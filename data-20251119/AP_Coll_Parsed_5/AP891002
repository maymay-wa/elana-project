elvis presleys involvement in the plot of jim 
jarmuschs new movie mystery train was a mystery to the 
filmmaker 
the writerdirector of stranger than paradise and down by 
law says he started with a few characters like he always does 
and came up with the idea for shooting the movie in memphis tenn 
home of presleys graceland mansion and sun studios where the 
king first recorded 
he snuck in there you got to watch out for him said the 
director at a recent press conference after the films preview at 
the new york film festival 
when i first came to memphis i went to graceland immediately 
by the time i left memphis i was so sick of elvis i never wanted 
to hear about him again 
but for now questions about jarmusch and presley are 
unavoidable 
elvis is everywhere in mystery train named after an old 
blues song that presley recorded at sun his music is on the 
soundtrack his pictures hang in hotel rooms characters see his 
ghost and johnny a workingclass englishman played by rock n 
roller joe strummer is even nicknamed elvis 
mystery train is broken into three segments which take 
place in the same time frame a young japanese couple visit memphis 
to see graceland and sun a young italian woman recently widowed 
and a talkative stranger share a hotel room for one night and 
three buddies are forced to leave town when johnny kills a liquor 
store clerk 
the japanese couple are fans theyre kind of an audience 
jarmusch says as the story progesses the way elvis is treated 
changes somwewhat by the third story johnnys saying that guy 
is everywhere 
fans of jarmuschs earlier films will quickly recognize the 
directors dark humor and fondness for characters usually found 
only in barrooms and poolhalls mystery train is however 
jarmuschs first movie shot in color 
i have to write very visually he said when i start to 
visualize the film i make an intuitive decision and i stick to 
that i cant say why if you ask someone whether they dream in 
black and white or color they cant say why i have future 
projects and i already know that some are color and some are black 
and white 
jarmusch did say he will continue to make lowbudget films 
outside the hollywood studio system he recalled a conversation 
with producer dino delaurentiis 
he asked me why do you make amateur films instead of 
professional ones i asked what made a film amateur or 
professional he said any film that costs more than 5 million is 
professional 
i guess im still making amateur films 
the cast includes elizabeth bracco rick aviles nicolette 
braschi and rhythm n blues stars screamin jay hawkins and rufus 
thomas 
mystery train is scheduled for a midnovember release by 
orion classics

strip away the orange ribbons and 
pulaskis courthouse square could be a movie set for an archetypal 
southern town where a confederate hero stands on a pedestal and 
pickup trucks sport dixie flags 
but the orange brotherhood color affixed to storefronts 
lampposts car antennas and coat lapels is meant to make sure no 
one confuses pulaski residents with the white supremacists who plan 
to march through town saturday 
these people are outsiders and this county is a victim of rape 
by these groups said author gregory mcdonald who owns a farm in 
the area and helped organize the antimarch campaign 
restaurants stores and markets have agreed to close for the day 
throughout the town of about 8000 people 90 miles south of 
nashville residents have been asked to stay off the streets and 
churches have planned activities to keep children and teenagers 
away from downtown 
the racists are attracted to pulaski by the towns role in the 
history of the ku klux klan the group was founded in pulaski in 
1865 as a reaction to what community leaders saw as a threat by 
carpetbaggers and former slaves after the civil war 
it was disbanded four years later after the legislature passed 
an antiklan law the modern klan was formed outside atlanta in 
1915 by a former minister who added jews and catholics to the 
groups list of enemies 
the klan began marching in pulaski annually in 1986 to protest 
the martin luther king national holiday 
the parades typically draw fewer than 100 marchers community 
leaders say as long as the racists obtain the proper permits and 
follow other rules they cant be stopped 
it started out as 35 to 40 old boys putting on their bed 
sheets and marching around the square haranguing said mcdonald 
author of the fletch mystery novels these people considered 
the towns silence tacit approval nothing could be further from 
the truth 
town leaders decided it was time to act when the aryan nations 
of hayden lake idaho announced plans to march here this year 
the group advocates the formation of a whitesonly country ten 
members of an aryan nations splinter group were convicted of 
racketeering in 1985 in a plot to overthrow the us government 
that involved murder bank robbery and armed confrontations 
were just not going to let our town be taken over by bigots 
and hate mongers said bettie higgins director of the chamber of 
commerce 
both sides claim pulaskis civil war hero sam davis a 
21yearold confederate scout who was hanged after refusing to 
reveal the name of a rebel spy ms higgins helped wire an orange 
wreath to the hands of a statue of davis on the town square the 
white supremacists will lay a wreath also 
hes our only hero and they want to take him ms higgins 
said 
the rev richard g butler pastor of the church of jesus christ 
christianaryan nations said the march was set on the day after 
davis birthday to honor white heroes 
sam davis was a hero of our people and nobody has ever honored 
him butler said 
butlers group claims several hundred members across the 
country but he did not know how many to expect on saturday all 
members of our race are welcome he said when asked whether klan 
members and skinheads would march 
he said the towns condemnation doesnt bother us a bit 
police chief stanley newton said at least 50 state and local 
officers will monitor the march 
residents concede that pulaski is no utopia of racial equality 
william mcnairy president of the local branch of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people described race 
relatons as average giles county is about 20 percent black 
ms higgins noted that the local country club has no black 
members 
i think this whole thing will draw attention to some areas we 
have not examined closely enough before she said 
businessman don massey made his protest on the side of a 
building he owns 
a bronze plaque commemorating the birth of the kkk has hung 
there for 72 years this month he turned the plaque to the wall 
if we just took it down it really wouldnt say anything 
massey said this was my way to say we cant just turn our backs 
on the other signs of bigotry and hatred as if they werent there

after chants of allahu akbar echoed in the 
cavernous royal albert hall the audience was told passages from 
the satanic verses would be read aloud and those who couldnt 
take it had two minutes to leave 
no one stirred then a tall man with a white beard and skullcap 
took the podium and fired the latest salvo in the yearlong moslem 
campaign against the novel and its author salman rushdie 
in a worldwide effort to suppress a novel they consider 
blasphemous moslems have rioted burned books gone to court and 
threatened to kill rushdie the author born a moslem in india now 
lives in britain 
many who condemn him have turned to ahmed deedat a 72yearold 
moslem scholar from south africa with a simple message read the 
book 
it may be a painful experience deedat says but moslems who 
know what the novel says have a much better chance of convincing 
westerners their cause is just 
he does not feel the blasphemy argument will convince westerners 
the satanic verses should be suppressed but he believes they 
would be more responsive if they knew what the book says about 
britain prime minister margaret thatcher and the west in general 
to prove his point he regaled the 6000 moslems in the royal 
albert hall on sunday afternoon with fourletter words extracted 
from the 547page novel 
rushdie is abusing his adopted country deedat declared so the 
moslem argument should go like this admitted that rushdie has 
many filthy dirty and obscene things to say about islam and its 
heroes and heroines but sir do you know what he has to say about 
you his benefactors and protectors 
deedat has an engaging folksy manner and the voice and vigor of 
a man half his age he argues cogently in simple language and has 
a keen eye for western hypocrisies 
citing a newspaper report about british lawmakers demanding that 
american actor mickey rourke be barred from britain for using a 
fourletter word to describe mrs thatchers policies deedat 
expressed confidence they would feel the same about rushdie 
applause greeted his presentation but at least one listener 
spotted an apparent flaw and expressed it during question time the 
young man said britain would not ban the book however insulting 
because its people are tolerant another troubling matter for 
questioners was the death sentence imposed on rushdie by ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini the iranian revolutionary patriarch who died in 
june rushdie went into hiding after khomeini issued his 
declaration feb 14 
deedat deflected questions on that subject saying it required 
an entire twohour lecture by itself 
in an interview afterward he said the death threat had become a 
political issue one group wants to take a certain stand which is 
against another group im not interested in groupings im 
interested in the best way to solve a problem 
to many questioners the problem was how to interpret the death 
sentence a young woman described hardships encountered at school 
because of her attempts to defend the moslem attitude toward 
rushdie 
someone else suggested deedat was in conflict with the koran 
the moslem holy book if he did not support killing rushdie 
sundays gathering underscored contrasts in modern 
multicultural britain 
arabic chants of god is great in a hall built as a monument 
to the traditional british way of life young men in jeans and 
tshirts kneeling on the lawn at the foot of the ornate albert 
memorial across the road praying to mecca stalls selling prayer 
mats korans alcoholfree perfumes and cassettes of deedats 
remarks 
it was a placid scene but a moslem weekly distributed friday 
outside the albert hall had expressed the undercurrent of unease 
peaceloving moslems fear that a time shall come when the 
british public would begin to identify an average moslem as a 
terrorist and feelings of hate could ruin the otherwise peaceful 
coexistence it said

there is fresh white lettering on the 
battered sign welcoming tourists to this ancient capital once 
visited by alexander the great by marco polo by tamerlaine and by 
hippies tramping through asia 
now the main square is filled with armed militiamen and an 
armored personnel carrier is parked 20 yards away 
the square bristles with kalashnikov rifles and rocketpropelled 
grenade launchers carried by militiamen who left the mujahedeen 
rebels to join the government 
there has been no fighting for months but residents of this 
northern town hate the unruly militiamen and say they smoke 
hashish demand goods at half price and prey on people traveling 
after dusk 
it is part of president najibs policy of giving weapons money 
and local autonomy to those who leave the pakistanibased rebel 
coalition that is trying to topple his government in kabul 
fear of the militias is not unique to balkh 
in the refugee center in mazaresharif a provincial capital 11 
miles east of balkh 12 people said they were attacked by a 
government militia when they crossed the border from iran they 
said they lost watches turbans and cash in balkh an officer in 
the local army garrison acknowledged the militias were beyond 
control and warned visitors to be out of town by 4 pm 
the roads just arent safe after 5 oclock said taxi driver 
ahmed ibrahim the bandits stop you and take money watches 
sometimes the car itself 
balkh one of historys crossroads has seen conquerors before 
but by the time of the 1978 revolution it was a backwater a quiet 
camping site on the hippie trail to the subcontinent and the far 
east 
balkhs past reads like a who was who of central asia 
in the 5th centrury bc it became the capital of the first 
aryan empire before they moved on to persia and india the greek 
historian heroditus put balkh in his chronicles 
alexander the great paused long enough on a 4th century bc 
march to india to marry roxane the daughter of a local tribal 
chief 
the arab forces that arrived in 645 were so stunned by its 
beauty they called balkh mother of all cities 
ghengis khan razed balkh and put all residents to the sword in 
1220 marco polo visited the ruins in 1275 and tamerlane crowned 
himself emperor in the rebuilt city in 1359 
but those were balkhs last halcyon days centuries of fighting 
gave the city a bad name so when the northern provinces became 
part of emerging afghanistan in 1866 the new capital was put at 
mazar 
tamerlanes massive mud brick walls melted like a sand castle 
and much of the glorious mosque built in 1597 crumbled 
but its bluetiled dome and a triumphant arch in the circular 
shady park at the towns center made it an idyllic spot for young 
westerners tramping across asia 
afghanistan was a main drug haven from 1970 to 1973 when the 
previous hashish capital of nepal required all travelers to show a 
minimum 500 in cash 
they were always stoned said a toothless old man 
but in those days people smoked hashish secretly the old 
man said now they do it openly 
did he mean the militia men swaggering nearby 
dont ask me i stay in the mosque he said 
until seven months ago when the soviets withdrew their troops 
the residents lived in fear of rocket attacks and fighting 
no one is quite how many were killed on both sides but 
residents think more than 1000 people died 
the road to mazar was unsafe many of the surrounding wheat 
fields reverted to desert their irrigation systems collapsed and 
their owners fled 
the population of the area droped from 80000 to 60000 
one or two years ago it was very dangerous here said 
mohammed isar who has sold boiled chickpeas in the park for 20 
years 
the opposition groups used to attack with rockets now that 
they have joined with the government it is peaceful 
farmers have started cultivating again in the past year but the 
town still has a menacing air 
militiamen roar around in trucks raising streams of dust over 
the broad unpaved streets 
voices drop when the townsmen talk about the militia 
they take things or pay only half the money whispered the 
chickpea seller the people hate them 
people are afraid of the militia they dont accept them 
said ahmed nadr 30 they switch sides all the time 
the only hotel was commandeered by a militia group that joined 
the government three years ago 
at the edge of town a request to walk on the still massive 
remnants of tamerlanes walls is discouraged 
there could be mines the government escort said 
no one expects tourists back soon

auxiliary firefighters taking part in an exhibition watched as the 
fire they were supposed to put out spread to a wider area the 
national news agency reported 
the firemen were showing off their skills monday in response to 
an emergency during the launching of the safety month campaign 
at the compound of the chemical company of malaysia 
but instead of applause they got laughs 
they had tried to extinguish several burning planks in a drum of 
gasoline but the blaze instead spread to a grassy area the bernama 
news agency said this would not have occured had the firemen used 
foam instead of water said a fire services department spokesman 
the firefighters finally managed to put out the fire when one

the first reports from the new tabloid 
television wars are in and a current affair and hard copy 
both have opened strongly while inside edition and usa today 
on tv appear doomed 
in this falls jammed field of realitybased shows other early 
casualties look to be crimewatch tonight trial by jury and 
usa today weekend 
according to the initial nielsen syndication service ratings 
foxs nightly a current affair was the seventh most popular 
syndicated show at the start of the new television season 
finishing ahead of entertainment tonight and donahue in the 
ratings a current affair was seen in more than 69 million 
homes the survey said 
every time a new show starts like hard copy inside 
edition or crimewatch tonight it becomes more competitive 
said peter brennan coexecutive producer of a current affair 
but the strange thingis that when inside edition started 
we never had better numbers so far in the first week against 
hard copy weve done the highest numbers weve ever done 
brennan said a current affair has attempted to fight off its 
challengers by trying to give more serious thought to the stories 
we do you try to avoid doing the celebrity ripoffs and the easy 
tampa shockvalue stories 
he said critics who blast a current affairs coverage of 
news and personalities as tawdry arent fair to the shows intent 
the worst kind of criticism thats written says that shows 
like a current affair seek to horrify shock and offend 
brennan said because if somebody shocks and horrifies and 
offends me on a regular basis im going to turn off and i wont 
let my kids to watch it either 
because it debuted sept 18 hard copy was not included in 
the first nielsen syndication report but the newsoriented 
program once entitled tabloid has performed strongly in los 
angeles chicago new york and san francisco according to its 
producers 
furthermore hard copy consistently has boosted some 
stations ratings from four months ago the shows representatives 
say in hartford conn for example hard copy is delivering 
to wvit an audience 60 percent larger than win lose or draw 
did in may 
for a new show we got off to a pretty solid start says 
mark monsky executive producer of hard copy we came off the 
blocks very quickly right now we have to prove to the people who 
did tune us in that what they got was just a little bit of what 
they could get 
in its first few weeks on the air hard copy has reported 
exclusives on imelda marcos and the death of her husband and the 
bombing of the pan am airliner over scotland 
i think our intention is very clear at the top of the show 
we want to be very close to whats going on monsky said and 
then we want to go deeper and deeper in trying to explore the 
widest possible range of the people involved 
the top five shows in the syndicated market for the week ending 
sept 17 are in order wheel of fortune jeopardy the 
oprah winfrey show the cosby show and the weekend version of 
wheel of fortune 
inside edition finished at no 22 usa today landed at 
no 32 and crimewatch tonight was no 46 trial by jury was 
no 62 and the weekend version of usa today was no 77 
in one strange twist the makers of inside edition have 
discussed the possibility of inviting celebrities on the show to 
rebut any distortions written about them in the supermarket 
tabloids 
however inside edition is revamped though it seems likely 
it will be replaced by 30 minutes producer av westin a 
veteran of abc news has joined inside edition maker king world 
productions to create the new syndicated news magazine 
new reality shows added to network schedules all have debuted 
poorly of the 81 shows covered in last weeks regular nielsen 
survey abcs primetime live hosted by sam donaldson and diane 
sawyer finished 49th cbs rescue 911 with william shatner

it had been almost a week and 
21yearold julia mendozas crying was done 
but her mother maria who had listened stoically to her 
daughters account of rape by a policeman of the national police 
could contain herself no more 
she sobbed when julia described the softvoiced rapist zipping 
up his pants and saying maybe that will make you want to 
collaborate 
allegations of mistreatment of prisoners have abounded since the 
rightist government of alfredo cristiani took office june 1 and 
began to move against what they called guerrilla fronts 
public organizations that sympathize with or support guerrilla 
positions on some or many issues 
the rebels over the farabundo marti national liberation fronts 
clandestine radio called the police animals for the alleged 
rapes 
this is too much to stand for they said the insurgents 
warned that continued repression and rights abuse will endanger a 
preliminary peace process begun last month in mexico with talks 
between government and guerrilla representatives 
just as we have been flexible and broadminded in order to 
negotiate we are likewise completely disposed to and capable of 
accompanying the struggle of the entire people and to take hold of 
the flagpole of democracy and peace and carry it forward to drive 
it into the heart of those who only want war said the rebel high 
command 
asked about the accusations maj mauricio chavez caceres head 
of the armed forces press committee said all commanders take 
pains to ensure that a prisoners human rights are respected 
because they know these people will come out of the police stations 
alleging this and that kind of abuse in order to make us look bad 
in what they called a response to escalated repression the 
guerrillas last week launched their first nationwide offensive 
since may seventyeight people were killed or wounded in the 
combat adding to the toll of a 10yearold civil war that has 
taken 70000 lives 
it was visiting day at the womens prison six miles east of san 
salvador and maria sat outside next to julia behind a backboard on 
the cement basketball court as she told her story 
julia mendoza is one of three women at ilopango jail who say 
they were raped at national police headquarters after their arrest 
the night of sept 18 following a demonstration that turned violent 
the national federation of salvadoran workers sponsored the 
march during which police were taunted by masked demonstrators 
wielding iron bars and two city buses were set afire 
authorities released 25 of 64 arrested demonstrators but seven 
women and 32 men were held 
dr roberto maldonado a forensic specialist who examined 37 of 
the 39 found corroboration of the rape allegation only in miss 
mendozas case 
the government and armed forces say prisoners like miss mendoza 
are leftist guerrilla operatives masquerading as labor activists 
and that they invent accusations of torture and abuse to slander 
authorities 
the workers federation known as fenestras by its spanish 
initials in fact espouses a political agenda identical to that of 
rebels who have waged war against a succession of usbacked 
governments 
but union and peasant organizations as well as local and 
international rights groups say the fact that an individual might 
support guerrilla positions does not strip him of the right not to 
be tortured raped or summarily executed 
maldonado found bruises cuts and scrapes on 20 of those 
arrested after the sept 18 march all said they were beaten during 
interrogation 
all said their interrogators belabored them about alleged 
membership in guerrilla units and insisted they provide names of 
cohorts 
superior court judge luis morales in charge of the unionists 
cases told the associated press that many of the injuries could 
have been inflicted with billy clubs during the suspects 
apprehension 
the new yorkbased lawyers committee for human rights after a 
fourmonth study of justice in el salvador said in a report this 
year we have identified a pattern of psychological as well as 
physical abuse of detainees 
the us state department in its 1989 human rights report to 
congress said of el salvador reports of abuse by arresting 
forces continue instances of severe beatings rape choking 
injection with drugs and electric shock were reported 
the state department said the allegations are extremely 
difficult to prove or disprove 
morales said thats because the judiciary depends entirely on 
the police forces for investigations 
we receive many allegations of rape but they never get 
anywhere he said in miss mendozas case practically 
speaking resolution would be impossible she was blindfolded and 
cannot identify the man and the same national police that are 
accused of committing the crime would be in charge of investigating 
it 
he suggested creation of a police force responsible solely to 
the judiciary to avoid such conflicts of interest 
just having an investigative arm separate from the executive 
branch would be great progress he said 
members of the treasury police were accused of raping and 
beating detainees after the april arrests of dozens of members of 
refugees organizations considered guerrilla fronts by authorities 
col rene emilio ponce chief of the joint chiefs of staff 
promised an investigation after repeated requests by the ap 
chavez caceres reported that the treasury police had investigated 
itself and found no wrongdoing

after 16 years of haggling a license was 
granted for widening a road next to the wall of jerusalems old 
city but work was halted days later when a bulldozer uncovered a 
byzantine bathhouse no one knew existed 
its a typical hazard for developers in jerusalem a city that 
dates back some 3500 years and where a shovel put in the ground 
almost anywhere can turn up archaeological artifacts 
we have an overload of history here said aharon meir a 
city archaeologist thats what makes jerusalem different if you 
dont bother to check you can simply bulldoze important findings 
away 
meir supervises the archaeological dig launched where 
construction crews have temporarily ceased building a 820foot 
stretch of the new mamilla road 
the finds so far indicate that contrary to earlier belief the 
roughly squaremile walled city may have once extended beyond the 
current walls meir said 
the new road runs near the old citys jaffa gate built by the 
turkish ruler suleiman the magnificent in the 16th century 
although long considered a possible archaeological site the area 
was never excavated by researchers 
for years it was off limits as a battlefield or ceasefire zone 
between israeli and arab armies after israel captured it and the 
rest of east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 middle east war 
other sections of the city were given priority by archaeologists 
one example was king davids city near the holy al aqsa 
mosque and the wailing wall remnant of the ancient jewish temples 
at the jaffa gate excavators have dug more than 2000 years 
into the past stopping when they hit bedrock that indicated they 
had found the earliest settlement 
two structures so far uncovered a bathhouse and a large public 
building yet to be identified have been tentatively dated from 
the byzantine period of the roman empire or about the 4th century 
also discovered by meir helped by several dozen palestinian 
laborers is an intricate web of water cisterns apparently part of 
an aqueduct system that supplied the ancient citys water 
these may not look like stupendous finds but they provide 
little important tidbits of information about what life was like 
if we give up these little things we would miss the larger 
picture meir said 
as he spoke hundreds of vehicles crawled at a snails pace above 
on the main road which has been temporarily narrowed to two lanes 
meir said the planned road would likely be completed eventually 
but the section adjacent to the dig may have to be diverted or 
lifted onto an overpass that would allow tourists to see the 
ancient ruins underneath 
under a city ordinance contractors must sponsor an 
archaeological survey of any building site if historical relics are 
found during construction usually a compromise is worked out so 
building can continue 
the new road is part of a 250 million project to build a hotel 
apartment buildings and a shopping plaza in mamilla a 
predominantly arab quarter before israels 1948 independence war 
several plans for developing mamilla have been shelved since 
1973 amid huge disputes between planners and environmentalists 
among other complaints the environmentalists expressed fears the 
new road could increase pollution causing damage to old buildings 
in the current project a compromise was struck in which the 
planned road was narrowed from six to three lanes and several old 
structures were spared being leveled 
officials of the karta company developers of mamilla said they 
hoped the latest delay will not last beyond the end of the month so 
they can meet their building schedule but they take it 
philosophically 
in some places they make a fuss over remains only 100 years 
old here were talking about things dating to 2000 years said 
kartas deputy director yaacov brandt 
the latest complication in the mamilla plan is typical of what 
most building projects in jerusalem have faced in the last two 
decades ranging from housing developments in the jewish quarter of 
the old city to the hebrew university campus on mt scopus 
last year preparations for a shopping mall were halted when 
excavators found two prehistoric farming villages from the bronze 
age at the citys southern outskirts a compromise to allow 
building of the mall is reportedly being worked out

the soviet union is a nuclear superpower 
saddled with a third world economy and that situation wont change 
any time soon even with mikhail gorbachevs reform efforts many 
soviet experts believe 
if anything these analysts said the soviet economy is in worse 
shape now than when gorbachev launched his perestroika or 
restructuring program 
he is facing the need to slash a huge budget deficit in half 
while at the same time coping with an economy which went into a 
nosedive in the spring even as inflation was heating up 
the soviet economy has fallen behind said howard wachtel 
an economics professor at american university in washington when 
you take off the tight controls of a command system you lose the 
threat over people and you get a drop in productivity unless you 
replace it with something else like market incentives 
gorbachevs economic troubles were the subject of discussions 
which took place in conjunction with the wyoming meetings a week 
ago between secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
one of the officials at that meeting robert zoellick a state 
department aide to baker will be traveling to moscow with federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan from oct 711 for continued 
discussions on the soviet economy 
officials said the soviets are studying a wide variety of ideas 
such as restoring faith in the russian ruble by backing the 
currency with gold 
the fact that the soviets are calling for advice from greenspan 
a disciple of anticommunist philosopher ayn rand has not gone 
unnoticed as a sign of how intent gorbachev is in introducing 
change 
an official from the central bank of the soviet union the 
gosbank attended the annual meetings this year of the 152nation 
international monetary fund and the world bank 
the soviet union has said it would like to join the two 
international lending agencies a move that would make the soviets 
eligible for economic assistance of the type already being received 
by china and poland two communist countries already in the imf and 
world bank 
while officials of both organizations stressed that they do not 
have any formal application from the soviets before them they did 
not dismiss out of hand the idea of soviet membership down the road 
richard feinberg executive director of the overseas development 
council a washingtonbased research group said he believes that 
integrating the soviet union and other eastern european countries 
into the world economy could be a central purpose for the imf and 
the world bank in the next decade 
the two organizations formed 44 years ago originally had the 
mission of rebuilding the wartorn economies of europe and japan 
feinberg said full membership for the soviet union probably will 
not occur for three to four years given the need to iron out such 
problems as opening the historically secret soviet economy to 
greater review by foreign banking experts but feinberg said the 
imf could begin sooner to provide policy assistance to the soviets 
the imf possesses expertise in the areas in which the soviet 
union badly needs guidance money and banking price reform and 
exchange and trade relations he said 
many experts believe that the economic assistance program 
currently being developed for poland and its new solidarityled 
government could serve as a blueprint for helping the soviet union 
but officials say it would be wrong to underestimate the 
enormity of the task in the soviet union 
we shouldnt be looking for miracles there is no panacea for 
the soviet economy said joseph pelzman an economics professor 
at george washington university he said the basic problem is that 
the soviet society has no memory of how a marketbased economy 
works 
you can bring in foreigners but that is not the same as 
having local entrepreneurs to call on he said the soviets 
have had 67 years with no business class 
pelzman said gorbachev will be forced to begin building up a 
foreign debt in order to import consumer goods as a way of 
demonstrating to a skeptical public that his economic policies can 
produce benefits for ordinary citizens 
if he can stock the stores he has bought himself a couple of 
years but if he cant satisfy local consumers then he is out of 
luck pelzman said the opposition will move in and say 
gorbachevs program is not working

rescue crews freed six sperm 
whales that beached on prince edward islands northshore national 
park but one of the huge sea mammals died 
as a crowd of hundreds watched sunday federal fisheries 
officers sent divers to tie slings one at a time around the tails 
of the creatures which ranged in length from about 40 to 65 feet 
a jetski took the line to a waiting parks canada boat which 
then towed each whale out about 300 feet then tried to keep it from 
returning to the beach by circling it 
the shoreside crowd let out a rousing cheer as the first 
surviving whale blew a high spout of water upon reaching the open 
ocean 
fisheries officers said they believed the dead whale drowned 
it was not known what caused the whales to become trapped 
between two sandbars but a fisheries spokesman said one 
possibility was that the sound of a jackhammer working on a nearby 
bridge might have attracted them 
whales have been known to beach themselves trying to answer the 
distress calls from other beached whales 
the beaching was reported early sunday 
covehead is near the eastern end of the national park between 
brackley and dalvay beaches

suddenly newly aggressive democrats on 
capitol hill are trying to paint president bush into a corner 
labeled timid 
democrats are displaying a greater willingness to challenge the 
adequacy of the presidents policies and to spell out stronger 
and generally more expensive democratic alternatives 
led by senate majority leader george mitchell of maine 
democrats are spelling out an alternative democratic agenda on 
issue after issue while portraying bushs programs as inadequate 
his funding proposals anemic and his entire approach as 
unacceptably timid 
the effort is leaving republicans grumbling that they are being 
whipsawed in a political bidding war in which oneupsmanship is 
the principal weapon 
although the signs have been building ron brown the national 
democratic chairman appeared to fire the starting gun last week 
when he told fellow democrats it was time to start taking on 
george bush 
accusing bush of timidly following the prevailing winds of 
announcing ambitious programs and lofty goals without providing the 
means to pay for them brown called on the president to begin 
matching his actions to his charming words 
in congress mitchell and many other democrats have been 
challenging bush on nearly identical grounds and in very specific 
terms 
recent examples 
democrats in the house as well as the senate demanded sharply 
increased aid for helping noncommunist forces build democracy in 
poland and hungary billions of dollars beyond the 218 million 
bush wants to spread over three years deputy democratic leader 
alan cranston of california calls the bush approach pathetically 
timid 
democrats challenging the adequacy of bushs commitment to the 
war on drugs led a successful fight to boost spending by 11 
billion earmarking most of the additional money for prevention and 
treatment 
mitchell is leading a new democratic drive to spell out a plan 
to improve the quality of american education to take the luster 
from bushs claim to be the education president and to 
underscore the historic democratic contribution to public education 
the majority leader has named a democratic task force to chart 
ways to broaden housing opportunities address the problems of the 
homeless and highlight republican scandals in the department of 
housing and urban development 
democrats are battling bushs bid to reduce capital gains 
taxes they want to revive individual retirement accounts to help 
average americans save for education housing and retirement 
theres going to be a lot more of that kind of thing says 
sen christopher dodd dconn were not just going to be 
standing around waiting for the president to act 
you are going to find a more active more aggressive party in 
the senate dodd said you may see us move even before the 
white house does 
dodd and many other congressional democrats say there is a 
distinct advantage in having a coherent position on as many issues 
as possible in order to build up bargaining chips in negotiations 
with the white house 
and some democrats are fearful of being bruised if the effort 
results in a headtohead confrontation with a president pledged 
not to raise taxes 
there is a lot of political gamesmanship in all of this 
some republicans say the name of that game is metoo only 
more so 
its clear theyve decided that the honeymoon is over with 
bush and that they need a way to counteract his popularity says 
an adviser to a senior senate republican and the only thing they 
can come up with is be tougher be more aggressive take shots at 
bush 
its a domorethentheyare strategy a oneupsmanship 
strategy he said 
as we see it the hidden agenda is to somehow make bush raise 
taxes 
mitchell who has been majority leader for only nine months has 
been under increasing pressure by other democrats to get out in 
front on policy matters to become far less timid himself in 
confronting the president 
as his apprenticeship ends he is clearly attempting exactly 
that

a senate panel is delaying confirmation of 
president bushs nominee to head the urban mass transportation 
administration while it investigates work done by his auditing 
firm senate sources say 
the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee is 
examining the relationship between nominee brian clymers suburban 
philadelphia accounting firm and an economic development 
organization nearby according to senate aides who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
the organization the delaware county partnership for economic 
development is the subject of a broad audit by the department of 
housing and urban development hud inspector general paul adams 
said in an interview friday 
the senate panel unanimously backed clymers nomination on sept 
8 but has since put a hold on sending it for a vote for the 
full senate 
clymer 42 is the former vice chairman of the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authority umta assists state and local 
governments in improving mass transportation systems he has 
declined requests to be interviewed about the matter 
the local partnership which has received 500000 in hud grants 
in the past year was founded in 1983 by us rep curt weldon 
rpa who has said he is not involved in its daily affairs the 
congressman ordered a consultant to investigate the partnership 
earlier this year when it was disclosed that several of weldons 
campaign supporters had received nobid contracts 
of particular interest to the senate panel are nobid contracts 
that the philadelphia inquirer reported were awarded to clymers 
firm by the partnership to audit its books 
clymer has been weldons campaign treasurer in the last three 
elections 
anthony j dunleavy the consultant retained at weldons 
request said in his report to weldon that this years contract 
given clymers firm was properly bid however the inquirer 
reported that dunleavy said that previous years contracts with 
clymers firm were not awarded through competitive procurement 
policies required by the federal government the newspaper said 
federal money was used 
in his report to weldon which has been made public dunleavy 
also said the partnership misspent 125000 in federal funds on 
ineligible items such as a promotion film and advertising william 
tancredi a top official of the partnership resigned in july after 
coming under fire for his handling of the organizations finances 
adams the inspector general said hud was conducting a general 
audit of the partnership that was not limited in any way shape 
or form 
hud was doing another audit in delaware county when a 
combination of things occurred concurrently that convinced it of 
the need to look into the partnership adams said he declined to 
be more specific

the voice of america says its taken care of a 
catch22 situation in which its broadcasts to angola were disturbed 
by a radio station run by usbacked rebels 
but rep mervyn dymally dcalif says he wants to know exactly 
what happened this summer when the voice of resistance of the 
black cockerel a station experts say was set up by the cia 
interrupted portugueselanguage broadcasts by the voa the 
usgovernmentsupported station that serves overseas listeners 
dymally chairman of the house subcommittee on international 
operations said last week hell raise the issue in panel hearings 
this year i wrote a letter of protest about it he said 
the need is great for the voa to have at this time unhindered 
and unhampered access to its consumers in southern africa 
dymally said in a letter 
the problem with the broadcasts is an outgrowth of the conflict 
in angola where the rebels headed by jonas savimbi are battling the 
sovietbacked government in luanda 
savimbi who is visiting the united states this week receives 
american government money to finance his group the national union 
for the total independence of angola known as unita 
unita operates the black cockerel resistance station which 
gerald bender a professor at the university of southern 
california said is a ciasupported clandestine radio station 
initial reports first published in the washington post last 
month said the unita station blocked 12 minutes of an aug 18 voa 
broadcast that included four minutes of a speech by angolan 
president jose eduardo dos santos 
joseph oconnell a spokesman for the united states information 
agency the parent agency of voa said us officials do not 
believe the unita station intentionally fouled voa broadcasts we 
dont consider it jamming he said 
but the two stations used frequencies that were close to each 
other so the voa listener could hear the rebel stations broadcasts 
at the end of the voa program 
you could hear their signature it sounds like a rooster 
crowing he said 
to eliminate confusion voa changed frequencies he said 
jardo muekalia a unita spokesman in washington denied the 
rebels interfered with the voa broadcasts but he charged that 
voas reporter in luanda had prepared biased reports designed to 
imply the united states favored the angolan government 
oconnell said voa has dismissed the notion the reporter is not 
objective we have been pleased with what he has done we have 
not seen any bias he said

many vietnam era veterans who want to take 
advantage of the gi bill to further their educations will soon run 
out of luck 
the gi bill program that covers people who served during vietnam 
ends dec 31 a new gi bill has taken its place but only the 
vietnam veterans who remained on active duty from june 1985 through 
june 1988 may benefit 
according to rep john j rhodes iii rariz 250000 veterans 
are affected many are gis who stayed in the military but left 
before the end of june 1988 
although legislative efforts have been made to extend the 
benefits neither veterans committee in the house or senate is 
taking up the measures 
its a damn shame this is going to come to an end and is going 
to hurt so many vietnam veterans who have made the military a 
career said paul s egan of the 35000member vietnam veterans 
of america 
vvas egan like richard w johnson jr of the noncommissioned 
officers association argue that the veterans being squeezed out 
of the programs are the ones who carried the military during 
the 1970s when it was plagued by low enlistment and low morale 
the 153000member fleet reserve association representing 
career enlisted personnel in the navy marine corps and coast 
guard has urged an extension of benefits 
neither of the two major veterans groups the american legion 
or the veterans of foreign wars spoke out on the issue in a recent 
house subcommittee hearing on the gi bill 
rep gv sonny montgomery chairman of the house veterans 
affairs committee opposes extending benefits under the socalled 
cold war gi bill the mississippi democrat says the bill is too 
costly unnecessary to help veterans readjust 14 years after the 
war and unneeded for a group of people who had already made a 
career choice for the military 
its time to move on to a new bill designed to recruit and 
retrain rather than just reintegrate said committee spokesman 
jim holley 
the gi bill that expires dec 31 followed the korean war gi bill 
and the pioneering world war ii gi bill 
there was also a veterans educational assistance program for 
people who enlisted from 1977 to 1985 the program offered a 
maximum benefit of 225 monthly and was based entirely on the 
enlistees contributions 
the vietnam era bill is the most used having served 81 million 
veterans compared with 78 million for the world war ii program 
the vietnam bill with no contributions pays a maximum 376 
million monthly benefit to fulltime students with no dependents 
the maximum eligibility is 45 months 
the veterans affairs department said in february that 750000 
people were eligible for benefits under the vietnamera bill and 
60000 were currently enrolled 
the new program relies partly on pay deductions from recruits 
it pays 250 to 300 a month for up to three years reflecting the 
three years of active duty required for eligibility a person is 
eligible for up to 10 years after discharge 
those who entered the service during vietnam could take 
advantage of the new program if they served three years of active 
duty starting june 30 1985 when the bill took effect the vietnam 
vets were not required to make further contributions 
but johnson of the 160000member nco group said the service 
regulations force many career noncommissioned officers to retire 
and many lost eligibility because they had to quit before the end 
of june 1988

harry s truman says he regarded his mentor 
franklin d roosevelt almost as a god even though roosevelt 
had an ego that sometimes got him into political trouble 
in fact the 33rd president says about the 32nd roosevelts ego 
was a factor which compelled him to break a tradition as old as the 
republic and run for a third and fourth terms 
truman discusses his boss in a posthumous book where the buck 
stops to be published late this month by warner books inc it 
is edited by his daughter margaret truman who says her father 
wanted its publication withheld until after he and wife bess were 
dead so that he could be completely candid 
the book gives trumans assessment of roosevelt as a strong 
leader but weak administrator and as a president whose ego 
sometimes led him to mistakes 
he cites one big example fdrs courtpacking plan of 1937 
roosevelt wanted congress to give him the power to enlarge the 
supreme court which had been striking down one new deal program 
after another 
truman writes that he supported roosevelts plan out of his 
knowledge from history that congress had changed the number of 
justices over the years 
but truman says roosevelts ego led him to overestimate his 
power and led to the most severe setback of his presidency 
i didnt agree at all with roosevelts obvious feeling that he 
had become so popular and so powerful that he could go ahead and 
push through anything even an unprecedented plan like that one 
without help and without bothering to try to convince people 
opposed to the plan that he was right truman writes 
the united states lost a bill that might have been very 
helpful to the american people because roosevelts ego misinformed 
him and made him believe he could win on his own 
truman also says that he was troubled when roosevelt decided in 
1940 to ignore the twoterm tradition and seek a third term he 
agreed with roosevelt that the threat of war made it the wrong time 
to change leaders but he says fdr was motivated by the belief he 
was the only person in the country capable of leading it 
i thought there might have been a partially wrong reason 
involved that he wasnt doing it only because he felt it was best 
to keep the same experienced man in place but that he might also 
have felt that he was the only possible man who could lead our 
country to victory in the war truman writes 
at another point truman says i guess that was his principal 
defect that growing ego of his which probably wasnt too 
minuscule to start with though perhaps it was his only flaw 
for all that truman says he admired roosevelt enormously he 
cites his record in fighting both the depression and the war and 
asks isnt that enough to make us think of him almost as a god 
he was a very very pleasant man and a great 
conversationalist he writes with marvelous flashes of humor 
in almost everything he said and he had a personality that made 
people feel close to him 
truman also pictures roosevelt as a firstrate executive 
never afraid to make those decisions he made but a weak 
administrator because he just wasnt able to delegate authority 
to anybody else 
he said i was always of the opinion that he ought to have 
restraints as every president should have and i sometimes argued 
with him myself when he wanted to go too far or when he set out to 
do something strictly on his own and without the agreement or help 
of others 
historians have written that roosevelt and truman were not close 
and roosevelt did not keep his vice president informed despite his 
failing health fdr died early in his fourth term without even 
telling truman about the atom bomb 
roosevelt accepted truman as his running mate in 1944 after 
becoming wary of vice president henry a wallaces leftwing 
inclinations truman a senator from missouri was widely respected 
for thoroughgoing investigations he had conducted into wasteful war 
contracts

democratic leaders claim they have the votes 
in the senate to kill president bushs capital gains tax cut but 
concede a watereddown version may get through congress this year 
meanwhile house speaker thomas s foley predicted sunday that 
the house probably will vote this week to repeal the medicare 
catastrophic health care coverage that it enacted only last year 
i hope personally that the program is retained on a modified 
form foley dwash said on nbcs meet the press program 
but there are a great number of republicans and some 
democrats in the house who are in favor of repeal if i were 
guessing today i think it probably would be repealed 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine also appearing 
on nbc likened the housepassed version of bushs cut in capital 
gains taxes to the cocainebased drug crack and said flatly that 
the senate will not enact it 
it is so bad so wrong for the economy he said it will 
do for the deficit what crack does for the user a quick short high 
followed by a long painful depression 
the senate finance committee plans this week to consider an 
alternative proposed by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and endorsed 
by a majority of senate democrats which would instead restore 
partial tax deductibility for contributions to individual 
retirement accounts 
in other congressional action this week 
the house will take up a longawaited bill to protect the 
nations waterways from oil spills similar to the exxonvaldez 
tanker accident in march that dumped 10 million gallons of crude 
into alaskas prince william sound 
negotiations continue between house and senate conferees on a 
dozen appropriations bills needed to finance government programs in 
fiscal 1990 which began sunday a major sticking point is how much 
the government will spend on star wars in fiscal 1990 the senate 
has appropriated 37 billion but the house wants to spend only 
31 billion 
competing child care measures both targeted primarily to 
lowincome families but one with the potential of being expanded to 
eventually subsidize day care for the middle class as well will be 
considered by the house 
the house government operations subcommittee on employment and 
housing continues its investigation into scandals at the department 
of housing and urban development with a return appearance by 
selfdescribed influencepeddler paul manafort 
mitchell said sunday he is positive that the 27month capital 
gains tax cut approved by the house last week will not win passage 
in the senate 
however he said bushs irresponsible position makes it 
extremely difficult to prevent any tax cut from occurring 
the housepassed measure would reduce from 33 percent to 196 
percent the maximum tax rate on profits from the sale of stocks and 
other investments until 1992 the rate would then climb back up to 
28 percent with assets indexed so that any gains attributed to 
inflation after that point would not be taxed 
economists predict the cut will generate some 94 billion in 
deficitreduction revenues over the next three years after then 
revenue would fall and worsen the deficit by a total of 21 billion 
over the following five years according to the congress joint 
committee on taxation 
im confident that this socalled yoyo on two years off 
two years and the way in which its constructed cannot pass 
mitchell said 
mitchell acknowledged that many democrats favor enacting a 
differential for taxing such profits at rates less than those for 
wages interest or dividends 
whether or not they will coalesce behind any plan along with 
republicans i dont know he said it will be very close on 
some other plan 
regarding catastrophic health care mitchell said he is 
confident the senate will retain key benefits under the program 
although it may change how they are financed the administration 
has opposed changing or repealing the program 
the wealthier among the 33 million elderly americans covered by 
the program have balked at having to pay premiums this year of up 
to 800 to cover the hospital and physicians bills for those with 
lower incomes 
foley also said congress likely will not complete action by an 
oct 16 deadline on a deficitreduction bill which would include 
any tax measure or changes in catastrophic care coverage 
that is the date when broad spending cuts in both military and 
domestic programs will be triggered automatically unless congress 
comes up with 6 billion in new revenues or programs for fiscal 
1990 
we might have some few days in which there would be a 
technical sequestration that is an acrosstheboard cutting 
through executive order of all the accounts foley said i 
dont think thats going to be a permanent situation

supporters of star wars believe the senate 
strengthened its hand in negotiations with the house by restoring 
funds for the missile shield but house members are casting doubt 
on that rationale 
the senate slashed 900 million from president bushs fiscal 
1990 request of 49 billion for star wars last tuesday then came 
back two days later and restored twothirds of the money 
what transpired in 48 hours were proclamations that the initial 
vote signaled the demise of the program formally known as the 
strategic defense initiative introduced six years ago by president 
reagan as a nuclearage antidote to a strike against the united 
states 
there also was a negotiating session between house and senate 
conferees thrashing out the defense authorization bill in which 
confident house members argued that the true senate star wars 
number was the 37 billion adopted tuesday in the appropriations 
bill not the 45 billion the senate approved last month in 
authorization legislation 
the house which had agreed to 31 billion for the program 
wanted a final figure closer to their total 
faced with that argument sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
armed services committee took his case to the senate for a 
stronger negotiating position he succeeded by a narrow margin 
5347 
despite the win lawmakers stressed that the house wouldnt be 
fooled by the senate reversal shortly after the second vote some 
star wars opponents said so in no uncertain terms 
it tells you about the depth of their feelings said rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo a member of the house armed services 
committee and one of the conferees 
those kind of flipflops dont make the senate look very 
serious she added 
but on friday some senators argued that they did nothing to fool 
the house 
were on record as supporting a higher number said sen 
jeff bingaman dnm a member of the armed services committee 
the senate signaled it did not want a significant cut 
he added theres nothing for the house to see through 
while the authorizers enter their fifth week of negotiations on 
their respective defense plans the appropriators are scheduled to 
begin in another two weeks 
the house and senate versions of the appropriations bills differ 
greatly on the major strategic weapons such as star wars the b2 
stealth bomber and landbased nuclear missiles the two blueprints 
also include different funding totals for the marine corps v22 
osprey the verticaltakeoff plane and the f14d tomcat jet 
fighter 
bush had sought to cancel the two conventional programs 
in addition the house slashed 11 billion for the advanced 
tactical fighter plane while the senate cut 18 billion earmarked 
for the trident 2 nuclear missile the submarinelaunched weapons 
that has had two successive test failures

hundreds of independent contractors for a 
bank are being scrutinized by the internal revenue service which 
thinks they earned thousands of dollars every time they washed a 
window or turned a screw 
a computer at wells fargo amp co multiplied the earnings of 
contractors maintenance workers lawyers and other professionals 
by 100 before passing the information on to the irs the salinas 
californian reported in its editions saturday 
and the irs eager to collect uncle sams cut of the phantom 
windfall has written to the contractors demanding explanations 
for the discrepancies between the wells fargo reports and the 
recipients 1987 tax returns 
i was panicked they moved the decimal point two places to the 
right said real estate appraiser harold m samuelson theyre 
in quite a snit about it 
samuelson who says he made 2400 from wells fargo was listed 
in irs files as earning 240000 
there could be hundreds of such errors said cheryl mortimer 
wells fargo spokeswoman the bank acknowledged the number may be 
higher but said the most people who could be listed wrongly would 
be 25000 the capacity of the suspect computer 
it probably shook a lot of people up said russell koch 
samuelsons tax adviser who has discussed the error with wells 
fargo officials 
the san franciscobased bank with 640 branches throughout the 
state hires about 2 million people each year on a contract basis 
said spokesman kim kellog 
the inflated income reports have been tentatively traced to one 
of wells fargos many computers that handle irs form 1099 which is 
submitted for all nonemployees who perform more than 600 worth of 
work for the company the cause of the malfunction remains unknown 
koch said taxpayers called to account for nonexistent income 
should be able to prove the banks figures were inaccurate but 
could face a large amount of paperwork 
but irs spokesman larry wright said that any problems in setting 
the record straight should be minimal 
its just a couple of additional zeroes he said its not 
a problem for the taxpayer we send out hundreds of thousands of 
letters like those and its not unusual to have some problems

nearly 500 couples who thought they had 
been divorced for years will find out they failed to finish what 
they started 
the orange county superior court clerks office discovered the 
incomplete cases some as old as a decade during a purge last 
month of old files 
judges and clerks said the legal lapses came about in most cases 
because couples or their lawyers simply neglected to file final 
divorce papers 
what if one of us just won the 50 million lottery and thought 
we were divorced asked hank roed 52 who recently found out he 
still was married to stephanie ferguson he thought they were 
divorced in 1983 there would be a big financial situation 
others who remarried have to legalize their current marriage by 
filing the missing divorce documents officials said in most 
cases a judge will then approve the filing 
court clerks were preparing to send out notices to the couples 
involved in the unresolved cases

millions of children particularly blacks and 
hispanics are being launched on courses of failure because 
they live in poverty says a congressional report that warns there 
appears little prospect for improvement 
rep george miller dcalif said the report released sunday 
paints a disturbing portrait of american children many of whom 
never benefited from the economic expansion of the 1980s under the 
reagan administration 
were launching millions of children on courses of failure 
said miller who heads a committee on families 
most disturbing he said is that i really see very little 
that holds out the prospect that this will change the prospect 
is that those incomes are going to stagnate 
neither the white house nor congress has been willing to put 
enough resources into social programs to give families the support 
they need so children can grow up wellfed healthy and educated 
enough to participate in the economy he said 
however rep thomas bliley rva ranking republican on the 
panel took issue with the chairmans conclusion that the federal 
government under a republican president has ignored the problem 
bliley said the net that is keeping so many children in poverty 
was not cast by reagan but is the result of social forces that are 
breaking up families and sexual behaviors that are leading more 
girls to become teenage mothers 
we have known for two decades that single parenthood is a 
prescription for poverty regardless of race bliley said how 
you solve these problems i really dont know 
bliley agreed with miller that congress was not likely to vote 
more money for social programs overall 
you can always use more money but i dont see it there with 
the budget crunch were in he said 
the 300page report by the house select committee on children 
youth and families compiles statistics from a variety of sources 
the figures show that children are the poorest segment of the 
us population in 1987 nearly 21 percent of children under age 
18 and more than 22 percent of children under age 6 lived in 
families with incomes below the poverty line compared with 12 
percent of the elderly and 14 percent of people of all ages 
the childhood poverty rate rose from 15 percent in 1970 to more 
than 18 percent in 1980 and more than 22 percent in 1983 before 
dropping to 205 percent in 1986 
poverty has been more persistent for black and hispanic 
children for whom the rates have risen since 1970 in 1987 more 
than 48 percent of black children and nearly 42 percent of hispanic 
children lived in poverty 
in 1988 71 percent of children were living with two parents 
while about 24 percent were living with only their mother or 
father in 1981 about 74 percent were living with both parents and 
about 20 percent were living with a single parent 
about 42 percent of children in 1986 were living with two 
working parents while 29 percent were in twoparent families where 
only the father worked about 15 percent lived with one parent who 
was in the labor force and about 8 percent were in singleparent 
homes where the parent was unemployed

theres a body evidence and a 
suspect but arkansas and tennessee authorities cant agree who 
should investigate the death of a former womens collegiate 
basketball star 
the body of joel tillis who played basketball at northeast 
louisiana university was found june 11 in a ditch near forrest 
city about 25 miles from the state line but she may have died in 
memphis 
im wondering if they are thinking of her as a nobody said 
marliss bates of hammond la who last saw her daughter when she 
came home for mothers day 
had joel been some prominent persons daughter would it 
have made a difference then was joel just another black child 
authorities in st francis county ark contend ms tillis 24 
was slain in a memphis apartment and her body then dumped in the 
ditch beside us 70 halfway between forrest city and memphis 
we have simply pursued all the leads that we have and 
everything to us points back to memphis tennessee said sheriff 
dave parkman who forwarded the case file to police in the 
tennessee city in august we just cannot resolve a murder here in 
this county that happened someplace else 
but capt ken east commander of the memphis homicide division 
said he isnt about to take over the investigation 
it is his case it has been his case and it will continue to 
be his case east said unless it can be proved that a homicide 
occurred here which it cannot be proved at this time then it 
stays where it is found 
the discovery of ms tillis badly decomposed body came a little 
more than two years after the body of her best friend and former 
teammate 18yearold brenda spicer was found in a trash bin on 
the monroe la college campus both women were strangled 
ms tillis boyfriend ivrin bolden who shared a memphis 
apartment with her until her disappearance in may is a prime 
suspect in the tillis case parkman said 
bolden was acquitted of seconddegree murder in the 1987 death 
of ms spicer with ms tillis testifying on his behalf 
on may 19 he reported to memphis police that ms tillis was 
missing and that he last saw her the previous day when he dropped 
her off for work as an assistant manager at a lady foot locker shoe 
store 
but ms tillis boss told police the young woman never showed up 
for work that day 
shortly after ms tillis disappearance bolden was questioned 
by memphis police but he since has left tennessee and was last 
reported living in florida 
parkman said investigators have learned ms tillis and bolden 
argued the day she disappeared but parkman said he never 
questioned bolden 
i think bolden should be interviewed parkman said but i 
dont think we have enough to do that in this county i dont think 
we have enough evidence and information on bolden to initiate 
picking him up 
bolden declined comment recently saying i know my name is 
being bounced around a lot up there but my attorney has advised me 
not to say anything 
st francis county officials know ms tillis was dead when her 
body was dumped in the ditch parkman said they also have learned 
bolden and ms tillis owned rosecolored sheets like the ones found 
wrapped around her body and crime lab reports indicate fibers 
found on the sheets and on ms tillis clothing matched carpet 
fibers in the memphis apartment parkman said 
parkman also said police have established a motive but he would 
not disclose it 
memphis chief of detectives fred warner said his department 
wont take the case unless theres conclusive evidence the crime 
occurred in memphis 
he denied the mothers implication that authorities are dragging 
their feet because ms tillis was black ninety percent of the 
people killed in memphis this year were black warner said and 
918 percent of homicides were solved

this battered city paused from cleanup 
labors sunday to thank the volunteers from all over the country who 
answered the call for help in the recovery from hurricane hugo 
what youre doing will never be forgotten mayor joseph 
riley told several hundred weary workers who gathered at a noon 
rally people from all over the country came to help a community 
in need we might have suffered some damage but our spirit is 
alive 
the mayor read several letters of support from children and 
other wellwishers from across the land one envelope from former 
president reagan included a check from 1000 
officials said 63 buildings collapsed in the historic city when 
hugo crashed ashore and more than 350 were severely damaged by the 
hurricanes 135 mph wind 
volunteers flooded into town to remove trees clear debris and 
pitch in to help people in need 
sen fritz hollings dsc an outspoken critic of the response 
by the federal emergency management agency praised the volunteer 
laborers for their efforts 
they didnt wait to fill out a form like the bureaucrats in 
the federal government ask you to they came up here free of charge 
and volunteered said hollings wearing a tshirt that read 
charleston sc were going strong 
this countrys great if we can get the federal government off

bureaucratic snarl 
mark chambers a spokesman for gov carroll campbell defended 
femas efforts sunday 
fema is providing everything the state of south carolina 
needs were talking about one of the most devastating storms in 
recent history its being done he said 
however the rev jesse jackson a native of south carolina 
joined critics of femas effort people do not need more 
bureaucracy they need more direct help right now he said 
the volunteers were treated to a hot lunch of stirfried chicken 
dished up by the outer banks rotary club from north carolina 
a canvas canopy donated by the sturh funeral home protected the 
food from an intermittent drizzle but it was more like a revival 
than a funeral and at one point volunteers standing in mud sang 
god bless america over the hum of portable generators 
steve desin 45 of vallejo calif arrived wednesday after 187 
days working on the alaskan oil spill in valdez alaska his 
company cheetah aviation transport service sent four large

it took hurricane hugo six hours to roar 
across south carolina lashing the state with wind rain and flood 
officials ending a week of cleanup say those few hours will be felt 
for years 
the storm smashed the states economy throwing thousands out of 
work it devastated timberlands farmlands and coastal areas 
damaging everything from tourist havens to shrimp beds the genteel 
face of charleston has been scarred and muddied 
its not going to be a quick process it is going to be hard 
for all of us said joseph p riley jr the mayor of charleston 
where more than 2500 historically significant buildings were 
damaged the repairs to those building will take five years 
the immediate effects are obvious eleven days after south 
carolina bore the brunt of the storm thousands of people remain 
without electricity and an estimated 50000 are homeless 
cleanup efforts are costing the state a halfmillion dollars 
daily state comptroller general earle morris has estimated hugo 
could put the state budget 300 million in the red in the next 
fiscal year partly due to losses in revenue from fallen payroll 
and property taxes 
hugos 135 mph winds and 17foot tidal surge also altered the 
states employment picture an estimated 270000 people were thrown 
out of work for at least the short term raising the states 
normally low unemployment rate of 45 percent to more than 16 
percent 
its across the board said jack philips a program 
supervisor with the state employment security commission we have 
everything from manufacturing plants to hardware stores affected 
the weather doesnt discriminate 
philips said it was hoped many shops and businesses would reopen 
soon but the states important lumber and fishing industries may 
take three years to recover 
dozens of shrimp boats were beached and damaged by the storm 
which struck during one of the best harvests in recent years state 
officials say shrimp beds appear to have escaped major damage but 
producers were hit hard 
the biggest thing is people who buy the shrimp the packing 
houses theyre all wiped out said jimmy scott a 
mcclellanville shrimper for 21 years 
of greater concern is the damage to forests which provide the 
raw materials for a 43 billion wood products industry that 
employs 30000 people 
it is estimated 36 percent of the 122 million acres of state 
forest was damaged felling trees worth more than 1 billion 
put in perspective about 22 billion board feet of timber are 
harvested annually hugos destruction downed 67 billion board 
feet 
we hope to salvage what we can but theres three years of 
harvest on the ground said steve scott a state forester we 
see a major reforestation problem after all how do you get that 
many acres back in production 
the tourist industry a 4 billion business that employs 98000 
people is expected to bounce back quickly despite 2 billion in 
damage but robert liming state director of tourism said damage 
to such resorts as myrtle beach and garden city would drop growth 
from an anticipated 8 percent to less than 3 percent this year 
liming said key to bringing tourists back is a quick rebuilding 
program to dispel notions that the coast remains in tatters 
some people are assuming that myrtle beach is gone and thats 
a wrong assumption he said a remarkable amount of property 
has already gotten back on line but some heavy rental areas are 
going to be a long time coming back 
the storm laid waste to as much as 100 million worth of cotton 
soybean corn and tobacco in the major agriculture areas in the 
savannah valley and the northeast part of the state 
while the damage will be gone with next years row crops dan 
smith a clemson agricultural economist said the effects will take 
its toll on those who raise poultry hogs and dairy cattle 
those losses will be much greater he said were talking 
about a longer term recovery period that will see some farmers sell 
out 
perhaps most worrisome is hugos impact on the states small 
businesses the restaurants shops and small manufacturers without 
the resources to survive weeks and months of down time 
the number of businesses coming into the disaster assistance 
centers is far greater than we expected said john patrick 
district director of the us small business administration we 
will probably be seeing effects of this for the next 10 years 
nelson bean president of evans american corp a houstonbased 
company specializing in catastrophe management said the longer it 
takes businesses to get on their feet the greater the risk they 
face of closing 
probably 40 percent of businesses wont reopen he said 
thats pretty significant when you consider that these are 
largely mom and pop operations that have been in business for years 
and years

manuel j clouthier who as a candidate in 
the 1988 presidential election brought conservative ideas back to 
mexican politics died in an auto accident in his native sinaloa 
state he was 55 
thousands of supporters marched through the streets of the state 
capital culiacan late sunday carrying the blueandwhite flags of 
his national action party with a blackbow ribbon sewed on one 
corner as a sign of mourning 
in mexico city about 200 supporters gathered around the angel 
of independence monument holding signs that read thank you 
maquio clouthiers nickname 
clouthier and political colleague javier calvo manriquez died 
sunday when the car they were in crashed head on into a truck 
loaded with papayas police said 
the accident occurred halfway between culiacan and the pacific 
beach resort of mazatlan a police news bulletin said the driver of 
the truck aurelio flores gomez was detained for questioning 
when he died clouthier was stumping the state to help national 
action mayoral candidates running in oct 15 balloting 
friends political foes and former business associates mourned 
the burly whitebearded politician who finished third in mexicos 
1988 election which was won by president carlos salinas de gortari 
and marred by fraud 
salinas on a oneweek visit to the united states telephoned 
his condolences to national action party leaders the government 
news agency notimex said 
rosario ibarra de piedra a leading human rights activist 
called clouthiers death a great loss for the political fight in 
mexico 
he was a strong courageous man of very defined political 
ideology but i learned to appreciate him as a mexican struggling 
to open the way of democracy for the mexican people heberto 
castillo a socialist political foe told reporters 
clouthier gained wide popularity after the 1988 campaign for his 
denunciations of election fraud and criticisms of the centrist 
institutional revolutionary party which has held power in mexico 
since its founding in 1929 
conservative politics had been frowned upon since the overthrow 
of dictator porfirio diaz in the mexican revolution 
conservative parties like national action were discredited until 
clouthier angered by former president jose lopez portillos 
expropriation of private banks in 1982 entered politics 
lopez portillo turned me into a politician when he did that i 
saw the power and the rigidity of the presidential system and i 
decided to struggle to change that a friend quoted clouthier as 
saying 
clouthier sold most of his investments in industrial companies 
and dedicated himself to truck farming and politics 
he managed to unify his fractious party into a political force 
and rally mexicos splintered conservatives he ran for sinaloa 
governor in 1986 but lost to the governing party candidate in 
balloting also allegedly marred by fraud

a priest has told parishioners he wont back 
down from enforcing a dress code despite orders from the 
archdiocese that communion is for anyone even those who wear 
shorts to services 
some people among the 80member congregation are rallying behind 
the rev roger griese who has preached at roman catholic sacred 
heart church for 21 years 
i dont think there is one person in our congregation that 
doesnt go along with a person going to church looking like a 
person going to church said toni bertran 61 
church officials said that while dress codes are permissable it 
is the practice of the church worldwide not to deny communion on 
the basis of dress 
for about 20 years the parish has had a dress code that bans 
shorts miniskirts and halter tops this summer griese posted 
signs throughout the church as a reminder 
ms bertran said the rules have been bent for people who cant 
afford dress clothes 
we dont mind polo shirts because sometimes thats all 
theyve got she said 
by and large it seems that the atmosphere of the parish seems 
to be very supportive of father said david acanfora an 
occasional churchgoer i certainly am 
others however oppose the dress code 
no one should be denied communion said nancy sexton 54 
who attends the church but is not a member if he denies 
communion to people how do we know if were going to be denied the 
last sacrament when we die i think the church should be more 
interested in saving souls than how people dress 
james garvey 33 was turned away by griese twice on consecutive 
sundays in september when he came to church wearing shorts the 
next sunday griese served him communion after garvey appeared in 
trousers and a dress shirt 
it is people like him across this world that drive catholics 
away from the catholic church garvey said my faith was taken 
away from me by not giving me communion for two sundays in a row 
for wearing shorts that tells me hes judging me based on what 
i wear 
elizabeth corrado 20 said she learned of grieses enforcement 
of the code in july when she and a boy friend went to mass she 
said she was wearing kneelength black shorts and a silk blouse 
with a collar her boy friend was wearing shorts 
in front of the entire church he says get out of my church 
youre not welcomed here ms corrado said i couldnt believe 
he was saying this of course everybody was staring at us 
the couple left 
archbishop daniel pilarczyk whose cincinnatibased archdiocese 
includes the church wrote griese in september that the code should 
not be enforced to the extent of refusing communion 
i have indicated this to you and pointed out that in the 
future you may not refuse holy communion or absolution in the 
sacrament of penance purely on the grounds of inappropriate 
dress pilarczyk wrote 
ray george an archdiocese spokesman declined to say what 
sanctions griese might face if he continues to refuse communion to 
shabby dressers 
griese 73 told his congregration last month he had been 
threatened with suspension but wouldnt back down 
im at peace with god as to what ive done and how ive done 
it griese said and if that doesnt please the archbishop 
then im very sorry but i have to follow my conscience 
he did not return phone calls to the associated press 
ms bertran said grieses manner of enforcing the dress code is 
part of his abrupt manner 
thats his personality she said you have to understand 
father and if you were a parishioner you would know that

amin fayyad has repaired his 
shellbattered west beirut pharmacy but hasnt removed the 
sandbags reflecting the skepticism most lebanese feel about peace 
talks under way in saudi arabia 
im back in business fayyad a druse moslem said sunday 
but i have no faith in the ability of those people in saudi 
arabia 
an arab leaguebrokered ceasefire that ended six months of 
remorseless shelling battles between christian and syrian forces 
has held for eight days 
but the daily crackle of automatic weapons along beiruts 
dividing green line a daily ritual for so many years no one 
considers it a violation is a reminder of how volatile lebanon is 
many lebanese who have seen hundreds of ceasefires collapse 
since the civil war began in 1975 consider this one nothing more 
than a respite in a conflict that has defied the peacemakers 
peace they believe is still far off 
simon hajj a christian taxi driver in east beirut does not 
believe the aging lebanese legislators trying to hammer out a 
settlement in the saudi arabian resort of taif will be able to come 
up with the magic formula that has eluded everyone else 
quoting an arabic saying he said theyre just cooking a stone 
soup its something that cant be cooked 
hajj 38 said these people have been members of parliament 
since 1972 and they havent been able to do anything to stop the 
war why should we expect them to be magicians now 
the best we can hope for from the taif talks is an agreement 
on vaguely worded general principles said columnist emile 
khoury a maronite catholic who writes for the respected 
independent annahar daily based in moslem west beirut 
parliamentary subcommittees will be set up to negotiate the 
details and mechanisms to translate these general principles into 
reality a process which will take many many months he said 
even then many lebanese believe there are too many fighters 
with a vested interest in perpetuating the conflict to make a final 
settlement attainable 
although parliament is one of the few constitutional 
institutions to have surivived the civil war there is a general 
consensus that it is helpless to influence the warlords and foreign 
powers who have kept the war going 
these men have no influence at all on the gunmen who fought 
the war said mustafa koosh 38 a sunni moslem and professional 
wrestler 
the current parliament was elected for a fouryear term in 1972 
three years before the war broke out 
the fighting prevented general elections and the legislators in 
the 99seat house have simply voted themselves a new mandate 
periodically since then 
the main moslem and christian militias who have accrued wide 
power during the fighting that has fragmented lebanon into 
sectarian cantons as well as the splintered lebanese army have no 
representatives among the 73 surviving parliament members many of 
whom are in their 70s 
moslem militia chieftains like walid jumblatt of the druse 
progressive socialist party and nabih berri of the shiite amal 
movement both have denounced the political reforms being debated 
in taif as meaningless 
if jumblatt or berri veto any resolutions taken in taif whos 
going to be able to implement them koosh asked 
many people believe parliament is incapable of disbanding the 
militias a move essential to ending the war 
yet despite the gloom many beirutis say they will use the 
current lull to get their businesses going again after the six 
months of shelling some of the fiercest of the war 
im going to repair my shop and resume business and i hope 
this lull lasts long enough for me to make up my losses said 
pierre shahine whose electrical tools shop in east beiruts 
lowincome dora district was gutted 
the lebanese despair is rooted in the failure of every peace 
effort that has been made in too many years of fighting that has 
killed more than 150000 people displaced another 1 million and 
ruined the economy 
but there are some optimists 
they pin their hopes on the prestige of king fahd of saudi 
arabia one of the main driving forces behind the peace initiative 
and the negotiating skills of senior aides to king hassan ii of 
morocco and president chadli bendjedid of algeria 
the three heads of state make up a mediation committee formed by 
an arab summit in morocco in may 
the committee must have gotten solid assurance of cooperation 
from syria otherwise it wouldnt have flown the lebanese 
parliamentary deputies to taif to discuss a settlement said 
samir honein a christian civil defense volunteer 
he contended that syria the main power broker in lebanon can 
easily prevail on jumblatt and berri to go along with any 
compromise reached in taif and that christian leader gen michel 
aoun cannot dissent without becoming an outcast in the arab world

a bomb exploded outside the 
police station of a small town 20 miles northwest of belfast 
heavily damaging the town center and slightly injuring three 
people police said 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the blast late 
sunday in randalstown but suspicion inevitably fell on the irish 
republican army which is fighting british rule in northern ireland 
belfast police headquarters said in a statement that the injured 
were two civilians and a police officer 
police said the bomb exploded as police officers were evacuating 
scores of families from their homes in the area following a 
telephoned warning by an anonymous caller 
they said the attackers put the 500pound bomb in a hijacked 
van then left the vehicle outside the police station which like 
many police stations in northern ireland is fortified against bomb 
attacks and manned only parttime 
the building unoccupied at the time was extensively damaged 
while dozens of nearby homes shops and offices were wrecked 
police said 
they said only the prompt action of the security forces in 
evacuating homes had prevented a major disaster 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the mainly catholic republic of ireland 
under socialist rule

americans overwhelmingly favor an increase in 
sin taxes to help fund president bushs war on drugs according 
to a media generalassociated press poll 
the poll also found that many preferred treatment of drug users 
to punishment and expressed doubt that more prisons will help 
and many doubted bushs plan will succeed among the 61 percent 
who called drug abuse the nations most important problem barely 
more than a third expected the problem to ease during the next 
decade 
nearly onethird of all respondents knew someone who uses 
cocaine but most said drug abuse is not a serious problem in their 
own neighborhoods and just oneseventh rated it very serious 
where they live 
the poll conducted sept 1424 among 1071 americans had a 
margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
bush has proposed a 79 billion program to fight illegal drugs 
saying they are sapping our strength as a nation seventy 
percent of the money is earmarked for law enforcement the rest for 
education and treatment 
in the poll though six in 10 said providing treatment for drug 
users would accomplish more than punishing them and 57 percent 
said building more federal prison cells for drug offenders as 
bush wants wont help 
sixtyfive percent believed boosting military and 
lawenforcement aid to cocaineexporting countries would help 
reduce drug abuse but the highest levels of support were for 
greater federal spending on drug treatment with 80 percent in 
favor and education with 91 percent in favor 
respondents were split on whether bushs plan spends enough 
money too little or too much nearly half wanted antidrug money 
taken from other programs while a third favored raising taxes the 
rest were unsure 
though taxes were generally unpopular threequarters said they 
would support raising cigarette or alcoholic beverage taxes to pay 
for a bigger drug program and seven in 10 supported a 1 percent 
increase in corporate income taxes 
another funding scheme had less support by 5343 percent 
respondents opposed a 1 percent increase in personal income taxes 
the number of people calling drug abuse the nations greatest 
problem has risen steadily in opinion polls as the issue gained 
increasing attention while most rank it the no 1 problem 
nationally however just 14 percent reported a very serious 
drug problem where they live 
an additional 26 percent rated the problem somewhat serious 
in their neighborhoods the larger share about six in 10 rated 
their local drug problem as not too or not at all serious 
bigcity dwellers were most concerned with half saying illegal 
drugs posed a serious problem in their neighborhoods 
the national institute on drug abuse has estimated that roughly 
8 million americans have used cocaine during the past year and 1 
million of them use it at least once a week in the media 
generalap survey 31 percent said they know someone who uses 
cocaine or its derivative crack half of them or about 
oneseventh of all respondents said they know an addict 
younger people were more likely to know a cocaine user 48 
percent of those age 1829 said they did black respondents and 
bigcity residents also were more likely to know a cocaine user 
bush last month called on americans who know drug abusers to 
help them stop but the poll showed the difficulty of that 
approach of those who knew current cocaine users nearly six in 10 
said they already have tried to get them off drugs 
the poll found overwhelming objection to buying or selling 
marijuana or cocaine the greatest tolerance was for growing 
marijuana for personal use which 26 percent called unobjectionable 
respondents split sharply on law enforcement priorities 
dividing about evenly on whether the best line of attack is against 
drug producers dealers or users 
they favored some new punishment schemes for occasional users 
with 82 percent saying people caught with drugs in their cars 
should have their licenses suspended and 63 percent saying the cars 
should be confiscated 
people were split about evenly on the notion of sending 
occasional drug users to militarystyle boot camps as punishment 
eight in 10 said bush should order the us armed forces to 
patrol the borders for smugglers but only 43 percent said he 
should order military strikes against illegal drug operations in 
foreign countries

points or 004 percent ending at 3562297 it shed 5322 points

yen from last fridays close of 13935 yen it opened lower at 
13877 yen and moved between 13865 yen and 13948 yen 
the dollar passed the 139yen mark shortly after the market 
opened as participants bought the currency for profittaking but 
trading became mixed afterwards traders said 
the dollars downtrend was further prompted by the the governing 
partys victory in the byelection and dollarselling by the us 
federal reserve board last week said one trader with a major 
commercial japanese bank in tokyo who spoke on condition of

a young east german woman screamed 
we made it we made it as she sobbed with happiness squeezed 
into a throng of hundreds of other refugees arriving in this 
northern bavarian city 
the refugees many with small children in tow looked tired but 
still showed nearly unbounded joy as crowds of west germans 
welcomed them after their overnight journey to the west 
elke ebecke her 12yearold son thomas and 3yearold daughter 
christine tried to push through the refugees and wellwishers on 
the train platform 
my husband managed to make it across through hungary three 
weeks ago but we didnt go the 32yearold woman said her eyes 
wet with tears 
mrs ebecke from the leipzig area was on the second train 
packed with east german refugees that arrived from prague 
czechoslovakia 
my husband doesnt even know were here yet she said 
annamarie lenz 52 told of how foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher of west germany announced late saturday to refugees at 
bonns embassy in prague that they would be permitted to go west 
i was just walking by in the embassy garden when he said it 
such a cheer went up from all the people it was unbelievable 
she said i had applied three times in two years to leave for the 
west but they turned me down each time i went to prague because 
i thought this was my only chance 
the refugees formed long lines at public telephones in the train 
station to call families in east germany or relatives in the west 
outside the station many refugees picked out donated clothing 
stacked high on yellow railway carts most had arrived with just 
one or two canvas bags packed with their belongings 
red cross police and railway workers mingled with the crowd 
many smiling and chatting some handed out hot drinks bananas and 
bowls of soup to the refugees 
at a table in the train station snack bar sat 21yearold mike 
mueller and his wife monique 19 
mueller a cook and his wife a waitress said they were fed up 
with harsh political conditions at home 
they communist authorities control everything you do 
mueller said we applied to go to hungary on vacation but they 
turned us down we didnt need permission to go to prague so we 
went to the embassy and joined the others hoping to get out 
mrs mueller said you cant get ahead over there in east 
germany you always have the feeling you are being watched you 
are afraid to discuss anything with your friends 
she said the east german news media lie and try to tell us the 
west just wants to make slaves of us they really think were so 
stupid we dont know better 
east german news media have claimed that west germany is luring 
east germans as a source of cheap labor 
peter shutz an auto mechanic said east german authorities 
try to control everything we do the young are tired of putting 
up with that its a dictatorship all i can say is im happy to be 
here if i work hard over here i know i can get ahead 
shutz was asked why he and other refugees turned down an earlier 
east german offer of travel to the west within six months on 
condition they first leave the embassy in prague and return home 
there arent many people who would fall for something like 
that he said 
uwe thuemmel a 30yearold east german truck driver said he 
had planned to take advantage of that offer and had traveled to 
prague from plauen near the czechoslovak border 
i left my wife and family at home thinking i would be back in 
three days but then genschers announcement came so i decided to 
leave without my family he said i hope theyll be able to 
follow me

ptl founder jim bakker didnt do his case 
much good when he repeatedly testified that he didnt remember 
details of his ministrys finances his lawyer says 
that was a pretty heavy crossexamination defense attorney 
george davis said of bakkers appearance on the stand last week 
it was very damaging very devastating 
the 82yearold defense lawyer added it didnt have anything 
to do with the issues but 
bakker who is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
was scheduled to return to the stand today for more 
crossexamination 
the us district court jury could get the case by the end of 
the week 
he is accused of diverting most of the 158 million in donations 
he raised to build lodging at his religious retreat and theme park 
and using some of the funds to support a lavish life for himself 
and his wife tammy 
in last weeks testimony bakker denied defrauding anyone 
repeatedly saying he had worked hard to keep the ptl dream alive 
yet he often appeared to be offguard particularly as prosecutors 
delved into details of ptls offers to provide free lodging at his 
heritage usa theme park in exchange for contributions 
under three hours of crossexamination bakker answered i 
dont remember or its equivalent more than three dozen times 
in several instances bakker said he had told viewers on his 
television shows that some changes would be made in the lodging 
programs at issue in the case but he was unable to say when he had 
made the announcements despite having access to the same 
videotapes as prosecutors 
there are so many dates bakker laughing said at one point 
in his initial testimony bakker told jurors that when he left 
ptl in march 1987 he had built was building or had plans for 
accommodations for more than 211000 socalled lifetime partners 
the name given followers who gave 1000 or more in return for 
promises of three nights lodging each year for life 
more than 150000 lifetime partnerships were sold between 
january 1984 and may 1987 including 66000 in the heritage grand 
hotel where bakker had said only 25000 would be sold and 74000 
in the stillunfinished towers hotel where bakker had said only 
30000 would be sold 
bakker attempted to show jurors a chart of the various hotels 
lodges bunkhouses chalets and campsites he said could have 
accommodated the 211000 partners but prosecutors objected that 
the chart contained information that was not in evidence and was 
misleading 
later bakker flatly accused former employees of either lying or 
making errors in saying he had ordered diversions of money and the 
destruction of corporate records 
even documented evidence met resistance from bakker 
when prosecutors tried to use ptl records to show bakker had 
reopened partnerships after they had been overbooked bakker said 
he did not recall doing that he also denied signing several 
letters and memos except for two on which the fbi had found his 
palm print 
shown a 1986 memo ordering bonuses to two ptl employees bakker 
said thats what it said but added i did not do this

communist china marked its 40th anniversary with 
fireworks displays and dances on tiananmen square which thousands 
of police patrolled to ensure the celebrations would not be 
disrupted 
thousands of police mingled with the 130000 performers and 
residential areas around the square were cordoned off hours before 
sundays show only people with passes were allowed to enter 
a million people joined anniversary events around a tightly 
guarded beijing on sunday along city streets potted flowers were 
arranged in designs that praised socialism and the communist party 
the highlight was the nationally televised 3hour dance and 
fireworks display on tiananmen square 
the symbolic seat of power in china the square has been under 
military guard since troops on june 34 put down the prodemocracy 
movement killing hundreds of unarmed civilians 
senior leader deng xiaoping 85 watched the performance from 
the tiananmen gate rostrum above a huge portrait of mao tsetung 
from the same spot mao declared the founding of the peoples 
republic on oct 1 1949 
communist party general secretary jiang zemin premier li peng 
and 84yearold chen yun an ideological hardliner who rarely 
appears in public joined deng 
western ambassadors boycotted the show to demonstrate continued 
concern over chinas suppression of dissent and most foreign guests 
were from socialist countries such as the soviet union north 
korea east germany and czechoslovakia 
the most prominent american to sit with the leaders was former 
secretary of state alexander haig now a private businessmen he is 
in beijing for a business symposium 
the official xinhua news agency quoted deng as telling north 
korean politburo member li jong ok that the spring political 
turmoil was bad but in the final analysis it is beneficial to 
us because it made us more soberminded 
deng said that because of the spread of western ideas before 
the military crackdown for a period of time some of our 
ideological front was lost 
but he said now social order has returned to normal 
despite frequent assertions that all is normal in beijing the 
city remains under martial law and security was extremely tight 
around tiananmen police and troops some armed with rifles 
patrolled city streets 
those who danced on the square and other places were carefully 
selected for their political reliability and nonparticipation in 
the spring demonstrations 
some offices and factories provided cash bonuses for employees 
who volunteered to dance on the anniversary 
the government led up to the national day with television and 
radio and press reports about chinas achievements over the past 
four decades in developing industry and agriculture and caring for 
its 11 billion people 
there has been little mention of the political and economic 
upheavals under communist rule reports have been couched within 
the central theme that only socialism can save china and only the 
communist party is qualified to rule the nation 
there is no doubt that the socialist system is superior to the 
capitalist system the communist partys official peoples daily 
said in an editorial

virgil thomson the pulitzer prizewinning 
composer and music critic whose career spanned more than half a 
century has died at age 92 
thomson who had been in failing health for a long time died in 
his sleep early saturday in his room at manhattans chelsea hotel 
where he had lived almost 50 years said his secretary jay 
sullivan 
thomson won the pulitzer prize for music for his score to the 
documentary film louisiana story in 1949 the only time the 
pulitzer has been awarded for a movie score 
the death of virgil t is like the death of an american city 
it is intolerable said composerconductor leonard bernstein 
virgil was loving and harsh generous and mordant simple but 
cynical son of the hymnal yet highly sophisticated 
but he will always remain brightly alive in the history of 
music if only for the extraordinary influence his witty and 
simplistic music had on his colleagues 
thomsons long career included orchestral and choral works as 
well as incidental music for plays by authors from shakespeare to 
truman capote 
in 1988 thomson was one of 12 recipients of the national medal 
of arts an award created by congress four years earlier at the 
suggestion of president reagan 
born in kansas city mo thomson began to play piano at age 5 
and as a teenager worked as a church organist 
in 1922 he graduated from harvard university and moved to 
paris where he was among a group of young american musicians such 
as aaron copland to study with nadia boulanger in paris he also 
met the iconoclastic composer erik satie who was a great influence 
on him 
while in paris he met gertrude stein and wrote one of his most 
famous works the opera four saints in three acts with her as 
librettist in 1928 it premiered in hartford conn in 1934 and 
had a short but successful run on broadway 
he settled in new york in 1940 and joined the staff of the new 
york herald tribune where he was music critic until 1954 
in 1982 he won a national book critics circle award for a 
virgil thomson reader 
thomsons latest book music with words is to be released 
officially oct 18 by yale university press sullivan described it 
as a howto book for composers people who are interested in 
setting words to music or music to words 
in an interview with the associated press before his 90th 
birthday the cherubic whitehaired thomson said ive got 
nothing wrong with me except im deaf and overweight you dont die 
from those 
thomson said the hearing problem kept him from enjoying musical 
performances more than 10 years ago but he continued to compose 
and kept busy on the lecture circuit 
he recalled that his first tribune music review said violinist 
jascha heifetz played silk underwear music but joked that when 
some other critic is unkind about his own music im convinced 
the writer is an ignorant pipsqueak and probably in the pay of my 
enemies 
thomson who never married is survived by a niece betty 
stouffer of longwood fla he will be buried in a family plot in 
slater mo sullivan said 
a memorial service is planned at the cathedral of st john the 
divine in new york on nov 25 what would have been thomsons 93rd 
birthday

the tokyo stock exchanges key index fell back from 
its record high morning close today and the dollar declined 
against the japanese yen for the sixth consecutive trading day 
the dollar closed at 13930 yen down 005 yen from last 
fridays 13935yen finish it opened at 13877 yen and moved 
between 13865 yen and 13948 yen the dollar now has fallen 570 
yen in six days 
market players reassured by the governing liberal democratic 
partys parliamentary byelection victory on sunday tended to buy 
the yen in early trading said minori takeuchi a trader with 
chemical bank 
but the dollar rose afterward in mixed trading mainly for 
technical position adjustments she said 
she added that market players were reluctant to buy the dollar 
at the 13950yen level for fear of bank of japan intervention 
the central bank has been selling dollars over the last week to 
check the us currencys recent rise the amount of selling was 
unknown and the bank does not comment on its exchange market 
activities

1379 points or 004 percent ending at 3562297 in early 
trading it had climbed to 3570133 its highest ever morning 
closing the index had shed 5322 points on friday 
the liberal democrats byelection victory also prompted the 
indexs early gain said masahiro umemori a stock analyst with 
nomura securities 
but the index started falling later mainly because 
participants became afraid of recent rapid rises in share prices 
he said noting the indexs 500point gain last week 
afternoon trading was directionless too he said 
a rumor that west germany might raise its interest rates soon 
also discouraged investors umemori said 
the rumor even said there might be a coordinated interest rate 
hike in a few countries he added without elaboration 
trading was moderate with first section volume estimated at 750 
million shares down from 900 million last friday 
electrical issues such as sony and pioneer and steel issues were

florida has joined the growing list of 
states that withhold drivers licenses from highschool dropouts 
but teachers arent sure the change will improve education or just 
keep bad students in school 
the law which took effect sunday drew praise from some 
educators as an attentiongrabbing way to cut the dropout rate 
i believe this is an excellent tool for parents to use to 
encourage their students to remain in school said betty castor 
florida commissioner of education 
but others say the law could create a bureaucratic nightmare and 
just might cause discipline problems by keeping reluctant students 
in the classroom 
there may be more children who will be in school but they 
dont want to be in there and they may become problems in the 
classroom said mary kay cariseo of the state association of 
school administrators sometimes these children just dont care 
west virginia broke ground last year with a law requiring 
teenagers to stay in school to keep their driving privileges 
arkansas texas and louisiana followed suit and dozens of similar 
bills are pending in legislatures around the country 
rep george sangmeister dill has introduced legislation to 
make such a ban nationwide 
the florida law says students must stay in school or an eligible 
program such as a course for a high school equivalency test or a 
training program or the license will be suspended until age 18 
the state department of education estimates 9200 students will 
decide to stay in school in order to keep driving because the law 
also limits unexcused absences 11 in a row or 20 for the year 
supporters of the law say attendance might improve for perhaps 
62000 students 
nearly 30000 drop out every year in florida 
the report card on similar laws in other states is mixed 
its so new that i dont think anybody really knows all the 
effects said mary ellen parker of the national association of 
secondary school principals a lot of people simply think its 
too broad 
through february 1809 dropouts returned to school in west 
virginia but 48 percent of them then left school a second time 
said therese wilson acting director of state educational support 
services more than 780 teenagers licenses have been revoked 
under the law she said 
in florida schools across the state must certify in writing 
that each student meets the attendance rules when they apply for 
drivers licenses teenagers become eligible to drive at age 16 
many florida school administrators anticipate the law will bring 
a deluge of paperwork that could clog up the system ms cariseo 
said 
every child has got to get these forms ms cariseo said 
i think the main problem is going to be keeping up with that and 
notifying the highway safety department once they drop out 
castor the education commissioner plans to ask the legislature 
for 58 million to cover administrative costs with the funds to 
come from floridas lottery 
backers say the law will back up parents warnings about the 
danger of dropping out 
its hard to tell a student hell have a lowerpaying job when 
hes 30 and have him listen said education department spokesman 
david voss when a parent says you cant drive any more its 
immediate

opposition politicians are backing 
efforts by ferdinand marcos followers to bring his body home as 
part of an apparent scramble to receive the mantel of leadership of 
the lates presidents following 
marcos died thursday in hawaii where he had lived since his 
ouster in the popular uprising three years ago that propelled 
corazon aquino into the presidency 
mrs aquino has banned the return of the former leaders body 
citing national security marcos supporters today asked the supreme 
court to overturn the ban 
political analysts expect that with marcos death his new 
society movement party will break up because it lacks leaders of 
national prominence 
the fact that marcos designated no clearcut successor will 
intensify efforts by major politicians to win the support of his 
constituency 
sen ernesto herrera an aquino supporter predicted a massive 
regrouping of various forces galvanized by the clamor to lift the 
marcos ban 
the marcos followers and sympathizers having lost a prime 
mover are now in search of a new leader who could unify and rally 
them into a strong cohesive party he said 
although marcos popular support had dwindled he still enjoyed 
a large following among his 6 million fellow ilocanos a linguistic 
group in northern luzon 
the new society movement is also believed to be wellfinanced 
and have a network of experienced political operatives nationwide 
in congressional and regional elections since mrs aquino took 
office in february 1986 the marcos party has fared poorly except 
in northern luzon and scattered parts of mindanao and the visayas 
islands 
but mrs aquinos decision to ban marcos body is controversial 
even among her supporters six proaquino lawmakers in the 
23member senate support his return opposition to the ban is also 
widespread in the 200member house of representatives 
promarcos politicians see the issue as a means of winning 
broadbased sympathy in a culture which respects the right of the 
dead to be buried in their homeland 
this explains the absence of massive public demonstrations in 
the wake of marcos death his supporters say they have decided for 
now to avoid large protests for fear violence would tarnish their 
image as an aggrieved party and ruin chances for the bodys return 
politicians not identified as promarcos see the issue as a 
means of currying support among his followers without being tainted 
with loyalist label 
chief among those angling for support in marcos camp include 
vice president salvador laurel and sen juan ponce enrile both of 
whom are widely assumed to have ambitions of succeeding mrs aquino 
in the 1992 elections 
mrs aquino says she will not run again 
laurel and enrile president and vice president of the 
opposition nacionalista party quickly endorsed the return of 
marcos body on saturday laurel called a press conference to 
announce the planned supreme court appeal even before it was 
confirmed by the petitioners 
previous attempts by laurel and enrile to forge an alliance with 
marcos followers broke down because of the reluctance of the late 
presidents supporters to break with their leader as long as he was 
alive 
laurel once a leading antimarcos figure began cultivating 
contacts with the marcos family soon after the former president was 
hospitalized in january 
enrile served as marcos defense minister and held the post 
under the aquino administration until he was fired in november 1986 
after a failed coup by his followers 
despite enriles role in the 1986 ouster of marcos he remains 
an attractive figure for many loyalists because he is an ilocano 
like their late leader 
one major factor in the realignment will be the role of marcos 
flamboyant and influential widow imelda political analysts 
believe the ambitious imelda is exploiting mrs aquinos ban to 
promote her image as an underdog a sympathetic figure in 
philippine culture 
if president aquino insists on her ban from president marcos 
being brought here the anger of the people might turn into pity 
for the former first lady and rally behind her said jesus 
nalupta mayor of the marcos ancestral hometown batac 
it is also unclear what role marcos only son ferdinand jr 
will play analysts say the 32yearold marcos is too young to 
become the leader immediately but will wield considerable influence 
in determining the new society movements future 
this is the end of an era the younger marcos said sunday in 
honolulu and i find myself facing the awesome responsibility of 
trying to fill my fathers shoes

a teenage father whos fighting a law 
that bars highschool dropouts from driving says such laws are 
probably a good idea there just has to be room for exceptions 
michael means 17 finds it tough to make ends meet since losing 
his license but he doesnt blame his lack of formal education 
rather he says he had to quit his job pumping gasoline to because 
of the publicity over his court fight against the law that bars 
high school dropouts from driving 
the experience left him bitter about the law 
i think that the people the judges and the governor think 
they own everybody in the state especially the younger people who 
it doesnt matter what they say or do means said last week 
children should be seen but not heard i dont think its fair 
means trouble began last fall when the department of motor 
vehicles cited the new law in refusing to replace his lost license 
the county school system later identified means as a dropout 
setting up a court test for the nations first law barring dropouts 
from driving until they reach age 18 
despite his argument that he needed to drive to provide for his 
thenpregnant wife a kanawha county judge last month refused to 
give him back his license an appeal is planned as early as this 
week 
means who left school at age 16 called judge paul zakaibs 
decision pretty stupid in his case but said the law is worth 
pursuing by other states 
its a good law its good if kids go back to school he 
said but there should be exceptions there has to be exceptions 
to everything 
state education officials point to positive reenrollment 
numbers and say they have been flooded with calls from virtually 
every state in the country seeking information on the law 
rep george sangmeister dill has introduced legislation that 
would impose the dropout driver ban nationwide arkansas florida 
louisiana and texas have passed similar legislation 
through february 1809 dropouts returned to school in west 
virginia and 48 percent of them then left school a second time 
said therese wilson acting director of state educational support 
services more than 780 teenagers licenses have been revoked 
under the law she said 
without a license means and his wife of a year were forced to 
move in with his parents whose fourbedroom home already had two 
adults and three children 
his 17yearold wife tonya also a dropout said the situation 
puts a strain on the family 
theres a time or two when his mom or dad or my mom will take 
us down and buy things for the baby that we dont have money to 
get she said parents can only stretch so far especially when 
they get a family as big as theirs 
means father william supported his sons decision to quit 
school if you can read and write and do arithmetic thats the 
basics thats all you really need to get by on 
but the younger means said he plans to make sure his son doesnt 
drop out i dont think i would like it means said im 
going to keep him in school as much as possible 
means immediate goal is to get a house and a job other than 
cutting lawns he talks of starting a stoneworking business with 
his father 
while the loss of his license made it tough for means to get to 
his service station job he said he had to quit the job because 
reporters covering the groundbreaking case made it impossible to 
work 
they kept coming up to where i work with cameras and i had to 
work means said i had to be on tv and i had to work it was 
putting a strain on everybody

a report that a popular underground drug is 
ineffective against the aids virus proves that the government 
should move cautiously before allowing people to take such 
medicine some researchers said 
in the oct 1 issue of the annals of internal medicine the 
researchers reported on the use of dextran sulfate in 18 healthy 
volunteers after administering the drug orally and intravenously 
the researchers found only traces of the drugs activity using 
three different methods 
this is a drug people are going to have to take two steps 
backward and take another look at said dr robert yarchoan an 
aids researcher at the national cancer institute just because it 
works in a laboratory you cant just go stuffing it in your 
mouth 
he said the report should remind researchers and policymakers 
alike to look at the simple things such as whether a drug can 
be absorbed into the bloodstream before allowing patients to take 
it 
the study confirms preliminary results announced in february by 
dr frank e young commissioner of the food and drug 
administration that the drug is poorly absorbed into the 
bloodstream and shows little promise of fighting the aids virus 
researchers in 1987 discovered that dextran sulfate prevented 
the human immunodeficiency virus hiv from invading the tcell 
lymphocytes a type of immunity cell that the aids virus normally 
attacks 
following those reports aids patients clamored for the fda to 
allow them to import the drug from japan where it was used as an 
anticlotting agent dextran sulfates use has not been approved by 
the fda 
the drug has been imported from mexico and japan during the past 
two years by buyers clubs organized by people infected with 
the virus last may the fda approved the drug for use in limited 
clinical trials 
tests of the drug in volunteers however have since 
contradicted the early laboratory findings 
since the publicity generated by the reports of dextran 
sulfates success in the laboratory some researchers felt public 
pressure made the drug available too early without sufficient 
testing according to the principal investigator dr paul s 
lietman of the johns hopkins university school of medicine 
lietman said he thought the studys results showed that the fda 
should continue to move cautiously in allowing aids patients access 
to untested drugs 
the easier access to unproven drugs is a step backwards he 
said 
researchers had hoped dextran sulfate might prove effective 
because it appeared to prevent the aids virus from attacking a 
vital player in the bodys immune system the tcell 
usually the virus attacks the tcells by attaching to a 
receptor a type of protein on the cells outer layer or envelope 
in the test tube studies researchers found that dextran sulfate 
prevented the virus from binding to the cell envelope thus 
preventing it from invading and killing the cell 
untreated hiv changes the genetic pattern of the tcell and 
forces it to make copies of the virus but this cannot happen if 
the virus cannot invade the cell 
but the researchers at hopkins the fda and the university of 
colorado health sciences center found little evidence that the drug 
was absorbed into the bloodstream 
if dextran sulfate is ultimately found to be an effective 
antihiv agent in humans its therapeutic index is likely to be 
small warned the researchers 
in addition the drug is unlikely to prove useful when given 
intravenously as the size of the large molecule prohibits it from 
easily crossing membranes according to lietman 
dr donald abrams of san francisco general hospital who has 
investigated dextran sulfate since 1986 said the drug had little 
effect in patients infected with the aids virus 
i dont think anybody believes anymore that dextran sulfate 
has any utility abrams said

actor george hamilton has been described by 
federal authorities as an unindicted coconspirator of former 
philippines first lady imelda marcos a newspaper reported today 
hamiltons name appeared on documents filed in us district 
court in connection with the case against mrs marcos according to 
new york newsday 
i cant give you any information said hamiltons agent tom 
corman 
an indictment last october charged that mrs marcos and her 
husband the late philippines president ferdinand e marcos stole 
168 million from the philippine treasury 
assistant us attorney charles g labella would not say why 
hamilton was on the list of unindicted coconspirators according 
to newsday 
also named were manhattan real estate developers joseph and 
ralph bernstein who are brothers and the marcos children irene 
imee and ferdinand jr the newspaper said 
the bernstein brothers have told a congressional hearing that 
they managed the marcoses new york real estate investments 
an unindicted coconspirator may have done something to advance 
an alleged criminal conspiracy but did not necessarily know they 
were doing it 
the list of unindicted coconspirators was included in a 
pretrial motion filed by one of mrs marcos codefendants 
california overseas bank 
the actor known for his perpetual tan and for his portrayal of 
a vampire in the movie love at first bite has denied rumors 
that he and mrs marcos were romantically linked 
hamiltons name previously has come up in connection with legal 
action against the marcoses specifically in a lawsuit by the 
philippines government against the marcoses 
alan d bersin an attorney for the philippines said the suit 
alleges that the marcoses invested in a beverly hills house owned 
by hamilton 
hamilton has said he has done nothing wrong 
in march 1986 hamilton said through his attorney michael 
sherman that marcos had no financial involvement in the estate 
hamilton bought the estate once owned by charlie chaplin for 
12 million in 1981 the deal was financed by hamiltons own 
money wells fargo bank and the seller sherman said 
in late 1983 hamilton used the increased value of the property 
to get a fiveyear loan from calno holdings nv in the netherlands 
antilles calno reportedly has ties with the marcos family

some of the record 20 tons of cocaine seized 
last week apparently was stored earlier in warehouses in el paso 
texas and across that citys border with mexico drug enforcement 
officials said 
seven men arrested in the case four in los angeles and three 
in las vegas were expected to be arraigned before federal 
magistrates today 
on friday the day after investigators stumbled upon the los 
angeles warehouse officials raided six warehouses in el paso and 
three homes in juarez across the rio grande 
we feel these warehouses were used as staging warehouses 
before the cocaine was sent to los angeles said us drug 
enforcement administration special agent phil jordan 
police said the four suspects held in suburban los angeles so 
far had thwarted investigators attempts to identify them giving 
false names and birthdates and saying only that they were from 
mexico mexican police were said to have the identity of at least 
one of the men 
we really dont know who they are ourselves said police 
sgt mike leinen of huntington park where the cocaine was found 
theyre not too forthcoming 
authorities believe the men are mexican or colombian jordan 
said 
investigators believe one of those arrested in las vegas carlos 
tapia ponce may have directed the rings operations authorities 
said dea spokesman ralph lochridge said tapia ponce worked as a 
customs inspector for the mexican government in juarez for 15 years 
he is the person who rented the warehouse he paid the 
bills said curt hazell a deputy los angeles county district 
attorney 
tapia ponce 68 was arrested at the flamingo hilton hotel in 
las vegas with his son eduardo tapia ponce 34 and his brother 
hector tapia 66 
investigators said the cocaine entered the united states through 
el paso before it was shipped to the warehouse operating as 
adrianas pottery warehouse where the the record seizure was made 
thursday 
one link between the suburban los angeles seizure and a house in 
juarez was confirmed when one of the suspects arrested in 
california telephoned the house from jail a police officer there 
answered the phone jordan said 
he said mexican federal judicial police know the identity of the 
caller 
no arrests were made at the house but a tractor and two 
trailers fitted with secret compartments were seized in one of 
these compartments we found 500 pounds of marijuana jordan said 
dea agents in el paso also found boxes similar to those found in 
the california raid along with mexican pottery 
the cocaine seizure attracted so much attention that crowds 
showed up at the unguarded california warehouse and began removing 
its remaining contents only hours after the cocaine was removed 
about 50 looters snatched up mexican pottery paintings 
statues desks chairs telephones and other office supplies 
no looting arrests were made and no evidence was taken police 
said

william fairbank whose work in 
lowtemperature superconductivity laid the foundation for hundreds 
of scientific experiments around the world has died he was 72 
fairbank professor emeritus of physics at stanford university 
suffered a heart attack saturday while jogging near campus 
university officials said sunday 
fairbank researched the nature of superconductivity and 
participated in the search for gravity waves subatomic particles 
called quarks and monopoles believed to be a component of 
magnetism 
his work is the basis of a multimillion dollar project to test 
a final unproven prediction of albert einsteins general theory of 
relativity 
fairbank who was working in his lab the night before his death 
believed in what he called the antimurphy law of physics his 
theory held that when one understands an experimental situation 
correctly three or four things come together to make the 
impossible possible 
he performed his first superconductivity experiment in 1947 with 
his brother henry also a physicist 
fairbanks work centered on the ability of some materials to 
offer no resistance to an electrical current if they are cooled to 
near absolute zero stanford said fairbanks influence on physics 
included the development at stanford of the superconducting 
accelerator in which a linear accelerator is cooled to 2 degrees 
above absolute zero the superconductivity allows for greater 
degrees of sensitivity and led to the first demonstration of a free 
electron laser 
fairbank was born in minneapolis on feb 24 1917 he graduated 
from whitman college in washington and earned his phd from yale 
university in 1948 
before joining stanford in 1959 he taught at the university of 
washington amherst college and duke university as well as working 
on the staff of the radiation laboratory at the massachusetts 
institute of technology 
fairbank is survived by his wife jane and sons william jr 
robert and richard his brother is professor emeritus of physics 
at duke university 
funeral arrangements were not immediately announced

a retired pressmans murderous schemes 
were common knowledge at the plant where he returned last month and 
shot to death eight people before killing himself according to a 
report 
joseph wesbecker revealed his plans on several occasions to 
former coworker james r lucas but the warnings were ignored by 
other coworkers and supervisors and they were never taken up with 
management the courierjournal reported sunday 
wesbecker 47 shot 20 of his former coworkers killing eight 
of them before taking his own life sept 14 
lucas said the first warning came in late 1987 or early 1988 
inside the standard gravure corp plant where wesbecker opened a 
brown paper sack and showed lucas a 38caliber snubnosed revolver 
lucas recalls that wesbecker said he was angry at supervisors 
that if any one of them came up to him and said anything other 
than what pertained to workrelated conversation that he was going 
to blow their brains out 
another warning came just a few weeks ago lucas said when 
wesbecker confided the names of six people he intended to kill 
during a conversation at the kitchen table at lucas house 
all had been pressroom supervisors or were managers of the 
plant only one employee relations manager paula warman was 
injured in the attack 
wesbecker who was placed on longterm disability early in the 
year because of psychiatric problems also described putting 
plastic explosives into a remotecontrolled airplane lucas said 
lucas said he believed his tormented friend was serious and 
began warning others 
but for a variety of reasons the airplane schemes 
improbability the frequency of bitterness among standard gravure 
workers and others affection for wesbecker lucas said his fears 
werent shared by others 
the schemes became common knowledge among pressroom workers and 
supervisors but upper management was never informed of it the 
courierjournal reported 
donald cox pressroom superintendent and one of lucas targets 
said he didnt take lucas warnings seriously because he doubted 
wesbecker was skilled enough to pull off the airplane scheme he 
also said he believed wesbecker was satisfied with the arrangements 
of his disability leave 
lucas however said he knew better 
i knew something was going to happen but i didnt know when 
or what time or where it was coming from he said every day i 
hid in different dark spots of the plant i didnt go in the 
pressroom or stay around the presses he said 
i think what he was doing he was reaching out to me and i 
didnt grasp it he said god forgive me i didnt grasp it

plo chairman yasser arafat in japan for the first 
time as a guest of the government said today that this oilpoor 
nation must be sensitive to arab concerns and cut its trade with 
israel a news report said 
it is not necessary for you to think of our interests think 
of your own interests japans kyodo news service quoted arafat 
as saying 
japan would be making a fatal mistake by ignoring the 
palestinians who have the support of 200 million arabs in a vital 
region it quoted arafat as saying in a speech at the foreign 
ministry 
japans trade with israel last year was roughly 12 billion a 
300 percent increase over 1985 according to israeli government 
figures japan meanwhile relies on oil from the arab middle east 
for much of its fuel needs 
arafat here on a fourday visit is expected to discuss his 
views on the middle east peace process in meetings set for tuesday 
with prime minister toshiki kaifu and foreign minister taro 
nakayama 
officials have said arafat was invited as chairman of the 
palestine liberation organization not as president of the 
selfproclaimed state of palestine though arafat had visited japan 
in 1981 he was then a guest of legislators not the government 
foreign ministry officials said the government invitation was 
intended to show japans appreciation for arafats denunciation of 
violence in december one official said the formal invitation also 
was aimed at bolstering arafats moderate policy amid reported 
pressures from plo hardliners advocating a return to terrorist 
tactics 
later today arafat was to attend a ceremony to rename the plos 
tokyo office the permanent mission of palestine 
japanese officials said the government approved the renaming 
with the understanding that the offices legal status would remain 
unchanged japan is the third country to allow such a renaming 
following france and italy 
japan like the united states and other western industrialized 
countries holds that palestine has yet to meet generally accepted 
international law criteria for statehood japan has full diplomatic 
relations with israel 
the plo was created in 1964 bringing together several competing 
palestinian groups including arafats al fatah 
by 1970 it was conducting guerrilla and terrorist operations 
against israel from bases inside neighboring jordan the plo 
currently is based in tunisia

comedian jackie mason who apologized last week 
for racial remarks about mayoral candidate david dinkins 
previously used a slur against the black democrat in talking to 
newsweek writers the magazine says 
mason called dinkins a fancy shvartze with a mustache 
newsweek reported in this weeks edition 
shvartze is a yiddish word for a black person it is often 
considered derogatory 
the newsweek report followed masons resignation last week from 
republican mayoral candidate rudolph giulianis campaign amid an 
uproar over remarks mason made about blacks and published in the 
weekly newspaper village voice the remarks were made at a dinner 
party at which a voice writer was present 
the voice quoted mason an ordained rabbi as saying jewish 
support for dinkins was based on guilt because jews were sick 
with complexes 
the newsweek remark was made almost a month before the voice 
article appeared 
newsweek said that after mason made his remark about dinkins to 
the writers at a luncheon giuliani joined in the laughter and 
didnt rebuke mason 
last week in reacting to masons comments published in the 
voice giuliani said he had never heard mason speak that way before 
on sunday giuliani denied hearing the remark and questioned the 
newsweek article 
as i recall there were four reporters there i emphasize that 
the four reporters did not report it which means they didnt hear 
it or they didnt attach any significance to it at the time 
giuliani said 
charles perkins a giuliani spokesman said he heard the remark 
and mentioned it to giuliani who told masons manager he thought 
it was inappropriate and jackie should be more careful with his 
language 
the editor of newsweek maynard parker was quoted in todays 
new york times as saying if he had known about the remark at the 
time we would have published it four weeks ago 
dinkins told that giuliani said he had not heard the remark 
said put down he smiled

federal investigators now believe someone with 
a grudge against the uss vincennes former skipper not 
revengeminded terrorists may have bombed the van his wife drove 
according to published reports 
the fbi probe has shifted its focus to the possibility that the 
march 10 bombing was carried out by a us citizen unconnected 
with the military who has a personal vendetta against capt will 
c rogers iii the san diego union reported today the paper quoted 
a navy official who asked to remain anonymous 
federal agents have identified such an individual and are 
checking his alibis but no further identification or elaboration 
was available a justice department official said 
the los angeles times quoted four unidentified sources sunday 
who also said the fbi probe is focusing on the personal vendetta 
theory two of those sources said the individual being investigated 
was a us citizen 
the pipe bomb explosion drew national attention because 
investigators initially interpreted it as terrorist retribution for 
the mistaken downing eight months earlier of an iranian commercial 
jetliner by the vincennes an aegisclass guided missile cruiser 
commanded by rogers 
all 290 people aboard the plane died 
rogers wife sharon was alone in the van but got out uninjured 
moments before it was destroyed by fire at an intersection near the 
couples home in san diego where the vincennes is based 
tom hughes fbi special agent in charge in san diego refused to 
discuss any aspect of the sixmonth probe we will have the same 
position we have in any ongoing investigation he said and 
that is no comment 
rogers expressed surprise at the possibility of a personal 
motive in the attack saying i have not the remotest idea of 
anyone who would take a personal vendetta against me or my family

for the first time in his fouryear 
ministry 90yearold mormon church president ezra taft benson was 
too feeble to provide the traditional closing address to the 
faithful a church official said 
he has not felt he would speak in this session gordon b 
hinckley bensons first counselor said sunday before the churchs 
159th semiannual general conference ended 
in recent conferences benson a former us agriculture 
secretary has either delivered or had read for him at least two 
talks over two days bensons sole address this weekend was a 
saturday sermon on the elderly read for him by thomas h monson 
his second counselor 
during a session on the priesthood saturday night benson 
seemingly confused arose and walked to the podium during a sermon 
by hinckley who cut his remarks short benson then said amen 
and was helped to his seat 
mormon presidents considered by church members to be prophets 
serve for life 
on sunday members of the quorum of the twelve apostles recalled 
mormonisms pioneer heritage of hardship and devotion as they 
praised the modern faithful for their selfsacrifice 
by giving 10 percent of their income to the church by serving 
fulltime missions or by remaining at home with young children 
mormons today are exhibiting the same tenacity as church founder 
brigham young and his followers said elder dallin h oaks 
in every nation in every worthy occupation and activity 
members of this church face hardships overcome obstacles and 
follow the servants of the lord jesus christ as valiantly as the 
pioneers of any age oaks said 
oaks also touched on what was a prominent theme of the 
gathering obedience to the allmale hierarchy of the church of 
jesus christ of latterday saints 
in our day as in the days of earlier pioneers those in the 
lead wagons set the direction and signal onward but it is the 
faithful men and women in the wagons which follow that provide the

lebanese leaders met for a third day 
today in an effort to end their countrys 14yearold civil war 
but they remained deeply divided over the syrian armys presence in 
lebanon 
saudi officials sought to smooth over the differences as the 63 
deputies of lebanons national assembly convened in this saudi 
arabian mountain resort 
conference sources conceded that discord between the 33 
christian and 30 moslem deputies largely mirroring the sectarian 
divide in lebanon was hampering progress 
druse moslem chieftain walid jumblatt and shiite moslem leader 
nabih berri syrias main allies in lebanon oppose a peace plan 
proposed by the arab league because they claim proposed political 
reforms do not go far enough in stripping the christians of their 
longheld domination of government parliament the judiciary and 
army 
the two warlords whose support will be essential for any 
agreement reached in taif flew to tehran sunday night for talks 
with iranian leaders iran is syrias ally 
tehran radio monitored in cyprus quoted berri as expressing 
strong opposition to the arab league plan 
despite the political problems a ceasefire called by the arab 
league sept 22 to end six months of fierce artillery battles 
between the syrians and christians seemed to be holding 
in beirut today syrian troops and their militia allies fired on 
a lebanese military helicopter trying to rescue the pilot of an air 
force jet fighter that crashed in the mediterranean off north 
lebanon military sources said 
syrian troops in speedboats later picked up the pilot 
identified as maj george sirhal and took him to the 
syriancontrolled northern port of tripoli the sources said the 
syrians promised to return him 
the syrian army which has 40000 troops in lebanon controls 70 
percent of the mediterranean country it entered lebanon in 1976 a 
year after the civil war broke out under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate 
conference sources speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
sizeable group of parliamentarians mostly moslems want the 
syrians to remain in lebanon 
others proposed a phased syrian withdrawal from moslem sectors 
of beirut to the bekaa valley in east lebanon the syrians main 
stronghold over two years while the countrys constitutional 
structure virtually dismantled by the war is rebuilt 
who would take over the responsibility of keeping law and 
order if the syrians left with the lebanese army divided said 
zaher khatib a sunni moslem 
but most of the christian deputies backed by some moslems 
allied with iraq syrias archrival in the arab world demanded an 
immediate syrian withdrawal 
the syrian military presence in lebanon is illegimate the 
syrians should be made to withdraw from lebanon within a short 
period said george saadeh a maronite who leads the rightwing 
phalange party 
christian leader gen michel aoun has opposed accepting 
political reforms aimed at giving moslems an equal share of power 
with the longdominant christians until the syrians pull out 
the taif meeting the first by lebanons parliament outside 
lebanese territory was convened by the arab league to negotiate 
political reforms and formulate a national reconciliation

former secretary of state alexander haig one of 
the few prominent americans to visit china since it crushed a 
prodemocracy movement urged the country today to keep its doors 
open to the west 
haig in a speech delivered to a business symposium stressed 
that relations between china and the united states now at a low 
ebb are fundamental for asian stability 
the chinese people should continue to look outward for their 
own benefit and for the benefit of both the region and the world 
haig said at an economic cooperation symposium hosted by the china 
international trust and investment corp 
haig one of the most prominent americans to visit china since 
the june military crackdown has been given a warm welcome here he 
was invited to sit at the head table with premier li peng during a 
national day reception saturday and he joined chinas top leaders 
on the tiananmen square rostrum for a 40th anniversary show sunday 
evening 
washington curtailed highlevel official contacts to protest the 
june violence in which troops killed hundreds and perhaps 
thousands of people in beijing during suppression of crush 
prodemocracy demonstrations 
haig a private citizen is now president of the international 
advisory firm worldwide associates 
danger setback and upheaval are the constant companions of 
economic change haig said yet the wisest course however 
troubled in the short term is the one that offers the most 
progress for the greatest number 
that is why we all support the chinese resolve to continue 
with the program of economic reform 
the conservatives now in control in beijing have pledged that 
there will be no change in chinas policy of economic reform 
however a retrenchment policy that began when inflation and 
growth got out of hand last fall and accelerated after the june 
events has raised fears that china is returning to reliance on 
central control of the economy 
haig devoted a large part of his speech to making the point that 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is now carrying out reforms 
in his country because the west forced the soviet military hand 
gorbachevs new thinking was therefore in my judgment the 
product of a realistic analysis that the lagging soviet economy 
could not bear the additional burden of a deadended and isolated 
foreign policy 
haig warned that even today the soviets produce half of all the 
worlds military material and its forces are still largely 
offensive 
let us be careful that in the course of what may be a 
compulsive competitive frenzy of disarmament that at the end we 
are not worse off than we were before he said

a black student praised the congregation of 
an allwhite church that allowed him to attend worship services 
after turning him away the week before 
they are good people the rev vincent taylor of akron ohio 
said after attending services sunday at central baptist church 
the church needs to be commended 
taylor a 24yearold divinity student at selma university was 
joined by three other black men who walked into the sanctuary 
before the start of services at the 1300member church 
the church has allowed christ to prevail and the gates of hell 
to be defeated he said there were no incidents and the men were 
greeted warmly on the front steps as they prepared to leave 
this is a wonderful great day said the churchs pastor 
the rev george jones 
he said the 18member board of deacons met friday night and 
made the decision to seat anyone who comes to worship 
the full congregation will vote oct 11 on whether to back the 
deacons he said the formal policy of not admitting blacks dates 
from the days of civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s 
i cannot speak for the congregation but i think if its 
ever rescinded now is the time it would be the pastor said 
on sept 24 taylor and two women students at the predominately 
black christian college arrived at the church planning to attend 
the service but a deacon told them the church had a policy 
excluding them from worshiping there 
taylor said he was shocked and encouraged saturday when a 
telephone call to jones revealed a change in the policy after the 
service he called jones a great preacher 
taylor said much of the controversy over his bid to attend 
services at central baptist had been blown out of proportion he 
also denied ever saying that a 50 bet with one of his professors 
prompted him to seek entry

jury selection got under way today in the 
liability trial in the 1987 northwest airlines crash that killed 
156 people with lawyers prepared to battle over who is to blame 
for the tragic outcome of flight 255 
the trial before district judge julian cook expected to take 
four to six months will feature about 4000 exhibits including 
shredded plane parts and hundreds of photographs 
at issue is whether northwest or the maker of the md80 plane 
mcdonnell douglas corp or both are liable in the fiery aug 16 
1987 crash 
expect a major battle between mcdonnell douglas and northwest 
trying to blame it on each other said richard schaden of 
birmingham one of five attorneys serving on a steering committee 
representing about 100 plaintiffs 
its such a hotly contested liability issue neither one will 
admit liability and thats rare schaden said 
a national transportation safety board report on the crash near 
detroit metropolitan airport said the pilots failed to properly set 
the wing flaps and slats before takeoff 
the phoenixbound plane never able to gain altitude slammed 
into an interstate 94 entrance ramp killing 154 people on board 
and two people on the ground the sole plane survivor was cecelia 
cichan then 4 who lost her parents and brother and now lives with 
relatives in alabama 
some relatives of crash victims said they would be at court 
every day betty polec an organizer of the support group flight 
255 their spirit lives on said the amount offered in outofcourt 
settlements so far has been an insult 
i want my day in court polec said my opinion is if you 
settle with the underwriter you are patting them on the back and 
saying everything is ok i want them punished 
northwest spokesman doug miller said the airline believes 
mcdonnell douglas is partially to blame in the accident 
schaden who will be responsible for arguing the case against 
mcdonnell douglas said he will discuss defects he thinks 
contributed to the crash including a disconnected or faulty 
circuit breaker on the flap and slatswarning system and an 
indicator that was supposed to tell pilots if the takeoff warning 
system wasnt working 
countered mcdonnell douglas spokesman don hanson there was no 
problem with the aircraft the aircraft is and was perfectly safe 
disagreements over liability have made outofcourt settlements 
with the relatives of victims slow in coming attorneys for the 
plaintiffs say northwest attorney carroll dubuc said in august 
that 46 cases had been resolved out of court and negotiations were 
continuing in others he didnt return repeated phone calls last 
week to his washington office 
dubuc said then that 102 suits were still pending 
i think going to trial with as many plaintiffs as we have is 
kind of unusual said jerry skinner who represents the 
plaintiffs 
northwest also has filed a suit against mcdonnell douglas texas 
instruments and national car rental saying they are partially 
responsible in the crash 
texas instruments manufactured a circuit breaker used in a 
warning system that alerts pilots when the flaps and slats arent 
set for takeoff national car rental owned a light pole that 
northwest claims was higher than the legal limit miller said the 
plane struck the light pole as it struggled to lift off at the end 
of the runway 
that suit is expected to be heard after the liability trial

payoffs or intimidation

pope john paul ii and anglican leader robert 
runcie pledged today to search for unity but noted that the 
anglican ordination of women remains an obstacle to healing the 
churches 400yearold schism 
we solemnly recommit ourselves and those we represent to the 
restoration of visible unity and full ecclesial communion said a 
declaration they signed at the end of runcies first official visit 
to the vatican 
runcie who as archbishop of canterbury is spiritual head of the 
state church of england and leader of the worlds 70 million 
anglicans said the commitment to continue talks on unification 
with the 850 million roman catholics should not be dismissed as a 
pure academic exercise 
runci told a news conference that his fourday trip allowed him 
to build trust with vatican officials and discuss ways to revive 
and spread religious practice 
vatican officials also promised to respond soon to a 7yearold 
report by an anglicancatholic commission outlining possible 
theological agreements between the churches he said anglican 
bishops have accepted the report 
vatican and anglican officials have been holding talks since 
1966 on unifying their churches which split four centuries ago 
over the popes refusal to annul king henry viiis marriage to 
catherine of aragon 
the new declaration noted problems raised in recent years by the 
ordination of women in some of the anglican communions 27 
selfgoverning provinces including the us episcopal church 
the question and practice of the admission of women to the 
ministerial priesthood in some provinces of the anglican communion 
prevents rerconciliation between us even where there is otherwise 
progress toward agreement in faith on the meaning of the eucharist 
and the ordained ministry the declaration said 
however cardinal johannes willebrands president of the 
vaticans council for promoting christian unity told the news 
conference this meeting has absolutely not been dominated by the 
theme of the ordination of women 
he called the ordination issue an obstacle to be considered 
and overcome

the supreme court today refused to revive an 
allegedly abused foster childs federal lawsuit against the social 
workers and government agency that placed him in his foster home 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling in a maryland case that no such right to sue exists 
charles milburn jr now 20 was not quite 2 years old when in 
1971 the anne arundel county department of social services placed 
him with foster parents karl and wendy tucker of glen burnie 
his parents voluntarily had placed him in the custody of the 
social services agency 
milburns federal lawsuit against the tuckers individual social 
workers and the county agency said he was subjected to physical 
abuse for nearly two years before being removed from the tuckers 
home 
the suit which sought 66 million in damages said his injuries 
included two leg fractures a facial laceration and severe burns 
that left his hands permanently scarred and disabled 
the suit alleged that mrs tucker with her husbands knowledge 
inflicted all the injuries including her immersing the 
youngsters hands in boiling water 
milburns suit based on alleged violations of his 
constitutional dueprocess rights was thrown out by us district 
judge joseph c howard and the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
upheld the dismissal last march 31 
such lawsuits must establish that the alleged harm was caused by 
the government or some government agent the 4th circuit ruled that 
the tuckers did not fit the definition of government agents 
the state of maryland was not responsible for the 
alleged physical child abuse itself the appeals court said 
it exercised no coercive power over the tuckers neither did it 
encourage them 
the appeals court noted that a parallel lawsuit filed in state 
court alleging maryland tort law violations is awaiting action 
the supreme court last february ruled that public officials may 
not be sued in federal court when their alleged gross negligence 
permits a child to be abused by a parent 
that decision in a wisconsin case said a state does not have a 
constitutional duty to protect people including abused children 
who are not in the states custody 
writing for the court then chief justice william h rehnquist 
said as a general matter we conclude that a states failure to 
protect an individual against private violence simply does not 
constitute a violation of the constitutions due process clause 
that constitutional provision bars deprivation of life liberty 
and property without due process of law 
a footnote in the february decision however said the justices 
were leaving undecided whether dueprocess considerations would 
arise in the case of children abused by foster parents 
the case is milburn vs anne arundel county department of social 
services 8996

vying to lead namibia into independence left two people dead and at 
least 30 injured officials and news reports said today 
a 27yearold man was clubbed to death when he and four friends 
stopped at a small shop in the northern town of oshakati on 
saturday said gerhard roux spokesman for namibias adminstrator 
louis pienaar 
roux said the victim and his friends were supporters of the 
democratic turnhalle alliance and were attacked by about 80 backers 
of the southwest africa peoples organization the party favored 
in the countrys elections next month 
also a swapo supporter was beaten to death in oshakati and the 
homes and shops of party members were attacked in northern towns 
during the weekend the star of johannesburg said 
roux said at least 30 people were hurt sunday one critically 
when people disrupted rallies held by the democratic turnhalle 
alliance around oshakati 
the clashes included gunfire grenades fires and looting 
according to the southwest africa broadcasting corp which is 
controlled by the south african government 
the elections are for the national assembly that will be 
empowered to draw up a constitution for namibia which has been 
ruled by south africa for 74 years 
south africa which agreed to relinquish control of namibia 
under a regional peace accord has not announced a date for 
independence but it is expected to be early next year 
the predominantly black swapo which waged a 23year bush war 
against south african rule is a leftistleaning party that draws 
its strongest support from the ovambo people of northern namibia

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether states may prohibit grand jury witnesses from making public 
their own testimony once the investigation has ended 
the justices said they will review an attempt by florida 
officials to block a former newspaper reporter from disclosing 
details of his appearance before a grand jury three years ago 
a federal appeals court said a state law barring such public 
disclosure violates freespeech rights 
michael smith a former reporter for the charlotte heraldnews 
in charlotte county fla wants to publish a news story and 
possibly a book about a 1986 grand jury investigation into 
allegations of corruption in the county sheriffs department and 
the countys state attorney office 
the grand jury probe ended in 1986 and no indictments were 
handed down 
smiths lawyer in an interview with the associated press said 
smith was subjected to abusive questioning by a state attorney 
when appearing before the grand jury 
smith no longer is a reporter and no longer lives in florida 
said his lawyer gregg thomas of tampa 
concerned that he could be charged with a crime for disclosing 
his grand jury information smith sued in an effort to have the 
florida law overturned 
a federal trial judge upheld the law and threw out smiths suit 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled for smith 
the appeals court said the florida law violates freespeech 
rights as it applies to witnesses who speak about the nature of 
their own grand jury testimony after the investigation has been 
completed 
such a permanent and absolute obligation of secrecy is not 
justified the appeals court said 
florida attorney general robert butterworth then sought supreme 
court review arguing that the 11th circuit courts ruling 
sacrifices the grand jury secrecy that shields the reputations of 
innocent people 
a tradition steeped in american jurisprudence has been cast 
aside despite the fact that the termination of one investigation 
does not necessarily mean that the testimony gathered during that 
investigation may not generate further investigations 
butterworth told the justices 
smith urged the court to reject the states appeal noting that 
most states and the federal government impose no such permanent 
restraints on grand jury witnesses 
floridas rule of blanket secrecy cannot be 
constitutionally justified smith contended 
the case is butterworth vs smith 881993

a golf club that has counted presidents and 
members of congress among its members failed today in a supreme 
court bid to regain a tax break revoked because of the clubs 
refusal to admit women as members 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that maryland 
officials did not violate the rights of burning tree club members 
by scraping a tax break worth more than 300000 a year 
burning tree has 440 members and is located just outside the 
nations capital in the affluent suburb of bethesda md the club 
had a longterm agreement with the state to preserve its open 
spaces in return for favorable propertytax treatment 
but in 1986 the maryland legislature canceled the agreement 
the club an allmale bastion since its founding in 1922 was told 
it must either admit women or have its land taxed at full value 
maryland officials also said the clubs refusal to admit women 
violated the states equal rights amendment enacted in 1972 
the maryland court of appeals ruled in march that a law forcing 
the club to choose between admitting women or losing its tax break 
did not violate the members freedomofassociation rights 
the law does not even prohibit burning tree from 
discriminating the states highest court said it simply 
provides that if burning tree continues to discriminate its 
property will be assessed in the same manner as the property of 
other taxpayers in the area 
burning tree officials argued their club should be exempt from 
recent supreme court rulings empowering government officials to end 
sex discrimination at such large national organizations as the 
jaycees and rotary clubs 
burning trees appeal said the club is a more intimate group and 
has a limited purpose providing a congenial setting for men 
devoted to the game of golf 
the maryland appeals court however ruled that the state is 
only withdrawing a benefit not forcing the club to accept women 
the state is simply declining to subsidize any organization 
that engages in discriminatory activities the state court said 
just because burning trees members may have associational rights 
does not oblige the state to subsidize the exercise of those 
rights 
a supreme court ruling in 1988 gave states and local communities 
power to ban sex and race bias at private clubs smaller than the 
jaycees and rotary the court upheld a new york city law banning 
discrimination by private clubs with more than 400 members 
two justices who joined that unanimous opinion harry a 
blackmun and anthony m kennedy once belonged to maleonly clubs 
the case is burning tree vs maryland 881970

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the army must bargain with unions over the wages and fringe 
benefits received by teachers at armyrun schools 
the court said it will review a ruling that the army had a legal 
duty to bargain with teachers at two fort stewart ga schools 
attended by children of military personnel 
the teachers union an affiliate of the national education 
association sought a 135 percent wage increase in 1987 and 
various fringe benefit improvements for teachers at the two 
elementary schools 
the federal labor relations authority ordered the army to 
negotiate with the union over the demands and that order was 
upheld in november 1988 by the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
the appeals court rejected arguments that the proposed wage hike 
and benefit improvements would interfere with the armys right to 
set its own budget 
although the proposals obligate the army to spend funds for 
salaries in the succeeding fiscal year the government will 
appropriate funds before the army incurs these obligations the 
appeals court said 
the appeals court also rejected the armys claim that it should 
be permitted to set teacher salaries according to how much teachers 
are paid in local public schools 
there is no compelling need for such comparability the 11th 
circuit court said 
in the appeal acted on today bush administration lawyers said 
other groups of federal workers whose salaries are not fixed by 
law could be affected if the appeals courts approach is adopted 
nationwide 
the appeal said other federal appeals courts have ruled that the 
army is under no such obligation 
in urging the justices to reject the governments appeal 
lawyers for the teachers union said only a tiny fraction of federal 
workers less than one percent might be affected if the appeals 
courts approach prevailed nationwide 
the case is fort stewart schools vs federal labor relations

eight mafia figures from new york city 
convicted in the 1979 murders of crime chieftain carmine galante 
and two of his associates lost supreme court appeals today 
the court without comment let stand the federal racketeering 
convictions of family bosses anthony salerno anthony corallo and 
carmine persico highranking mobsters salvatore santoro 
christopher furnari and gennaro langella and mob members anthony 
indelicato and ralph scopo 
the racketeering convictions stemmed in part from the plotting 
of galantes july 12 1979 murder at a brooklyn restaurant also 
gunned down were leonard coppola and giuseppe turano 
federal prosecutors say there are five distinct mafia groups in 
new york city the genovese gambino colombo lucchese and 
bonanno families 
prosecutors say corallo was boss of the lucchese family which 
santoro served as underboss and furnari as consigliere 
persico led the colombo family and langella served as his underboss 
salerno was boss of the genovese family persico boss of the 
colombo family and langella its underboss 
scopo a member of the colombo family was also president of the 
district council of cement and concrete workers laborers 
international union 
indelicato a bonanno family soldier promoted after the 
galante killings was the only defendant accused of participating 
in them 
evidence at the eight mens 11week jury trial indicated that 
the activities of mafia families throughout the nation are 
coordinated by a commission which each family boss serves as a 
member 
through the 1970s the bonanno family was not represented 
directly on the commission because of internal disputes galante 
was the bonanno family boss and prosecutors said the commission 
ordered his murder as a means of resolving the disputes 
each of the defendants was convicted of conspiracy in violation 
of the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
rico 
all the defendants except indelicato received 100year prison 
sentences he was sentenced to 40 years but that term was reduced 
to 20 years on appeal 
except for overturning part of indelicatos conviction the 2nd 
us circuit court of appeals upheld the rico conspiracy 
convictions last jan 31 
in the appeals acted on today lawyers for the mafia figures 
argued among other things that prosecutors failed to prove a 
sufficient connection between the galante murder and the commission 
the cases are indelicato vs us 881881 salerno vs us

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the government may prohibit soliciting on all postal 
service property including sidewalks adjacent to post office 
buildings 
the justices said they will review a case from bowie md in 
which a federal appeals court struck down the ban as 
unconstitutional 
other federal appeals courts have upheld the ban 
marsha kokinda and kevin pearl were arrested outside the bowie 
post office on aug 6 1986 after they refused to stop soliciting 
contributions and distributing literature from a sidewalk table 
the two are volunteers for the national democratic policy 
committee the political arm of an organization headed by political 
extremist lyndon larouche 
they had set up the table on a sidewalk adjacent to the post 
office building 
the post office in bowie like many in suburban and rural 
communities is a freestanding building with its own sidewalk and 
parking lot a municipal sidewalk runs in front of the post office 
property separating the parking lot from the street 
ms kokinda and pearl were convicted in a trial before a federal 
magistrate of violating a regulation banning soliciting 
electioneering collecting debts vending and advertising on 
postal service property 
there was no evidence that the two had blocked or interfered 
with people entering and leaving the post office but postal 
officials said they received more than 40 complaints from patrons 
during the several hours ms kokinda and pearl were there 
ms kokinda was fined 50 and sentenced to 10 days in jail 
pearl was fined 100 and given a suspended 30day jail term 
a federal judge upheld the convictions but the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals threw them out by a 21 vote last jan 31 
the appeals court rejected the governments argument that there 
is a difference between city sidewalks and a sidewalk located 
entirely on postal service property 
the appeals court called the activities by ms kokinda and pearl 
classic political speech pursued peacefully in a place that 
traditionally has been held open to the public for expressive 
activities 
because the sidewalk outside the post office is a public 
forum the appeals court said soliciting and other forms of 
speech could not be banned except by contentneutral time place 
and manner regulations that furthered a significant government 
interest 
the 4th circuit courts ruling set a binding legal precedent for 
maryland north carolina south carolina virginia and west 
virginia 
in the appeal acted on today government lawyers noted that two 
other appeals courts have upheld the soliciting ban after ruling 
that a sidewalk like the one at issue in bowie is not a public 
forum 
the postal service will not be able to enforce a single 
nationwide standard to deal with the problem of solicitation and 
other forms of speech on the grounds of the 35000 post office 
facilities around the country the appeal said 
the case is us vs kokinda 882031

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
making it easier for the government to cut off disability pay to 
some former federal workers 
the court said it will review a ruling that barred termination 
of a disability annuity for a california man who was given 
incorrect information about benefits eligibility 
charles richmond a retired navy welder from national city 
calif asked a federal official in 1986 how much money he was 
allowed to make as a bus driver without sacrificing his disability 
annuity 
he was told that if his pay for two years exceeded 80 percent of 
what his welders job had paid he would lose the disability 
benefit richmond also was given an outofdate federal manual with 
the same information 
congress had amended the law in 1982 to cut off annuity payments 
to anyone making more than 80 percent of the former government 
jobs oneyear salary 
richmond in 1986 did some overtime work as a bus driver and 
earned 19936 eighty percent of his pay as a navy welder that 
year would have been 19016 
when the government cut off his disability annuity because he 
exceeded the ceiling richmond challenged the decision he said he 
had relied on the misinformation he received from the government 
a federal appeals court here ordered the annuity restored the 
appeals court said in a ruling last december that the government 
recklessly misled richmond 
justice department lawyers in appealing to the supreme court 
said the government should not be prevented from executing the 
laws as written by congress because of the errors of government 
agents 
the appeal also said richmond suffered little harm it accused 
him of trying to work the system as close to the edge as 
possible seeking to keep the annuity while making as much in bus 
driver wages as he could 
the case is office of personnel management vs richmond 881943

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether hospitals and nursing care homes may sue in federal court 
to challenge how a staterun medicaid program reimburses their 
costs 
the court said it will review a ruling that would allow a 
hospital association to invoke a federal civil rights law in suing 
virginia over the states medicaid reimbursement rates 
the attorneys general of 36 states told the court its ruling 
expected sometime next year will affect hundreds of millions of 
dollars in federal and state funding 
the virginia hospital association sued the state in 1986 
attacking the states medicaid reimbursement rates 
the lawsuit alleges that the toolow rates violate the federal 
medicaid act and the dueprocess rights of participating hospitals 
medicaid is paid primarily by the federal government but 
individual state agencies administer the program aimed at providing 
health care to the poor 
virginia officials sought to have the suit dismissed contending 
that only health care recipients not individual or associated 
health care providers have the right to sue under the medicaid 
act 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals rejected that contention 
last feb 22 in a decision that set a binding legal precedent for 
virginia maryland north carolina south carolina and west 
virginia 
acknowledging that the medicaid act does not expressly give 
hospitals and nursing care home the right to sue a state the 
appeals court ruled that the right is implied 
such suits may be filed under a muchused reconstruction era 
civil rights law the 4th circuit court said 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for virginia argued that 
congress did not intend to enable hospitals and nursing care homes 
to sue over medicaid rate disputes 
they also contended that the state should be shielded from such 
suits by immunity granted under the constitutions 11th amendment 
a friendofthecourt brief written by the oregon attorney 
generals staff and submitted in behalf of 36 states urged the 
justices to reverse the 4th circuit courts ruling 
the ruling leaves medicaid providers free to attack the 
reasonableness of each states reimbursement rates the states 
brief said every routine rate challenge may be made a federal 
case

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether federal agencies sometimes must negotiate with employee 
unions over what goods and services the government buys from 
private businesses 
the justices said they will resolve conflicting court rulings in 
the contractingout dispute 
the appeal granted review today was filed by lawyers for the 
internal revenue service which contends that an agencys power to 
contract for the goods and services it needs from private industry 
is an exclusive management prerogative not subject to negotiation 
but the federal labor relations authority which adjudicates 
collective bargaining disputes between federal agencies and their 
employees ruled against the irs 
the authority said grievance and arbitration provisions of the 
tax agencys labor contract with the national treasury employees 
union apply to disputed contractingout cases the authority 
ordered the irs to bargain with the nteu over the unions proposals 
a us circuit court of appeals panel here by a 21 vote 
upheld the flra ruling last feb 28 
other federal appeals courts however have ruled that federal 
agencies have no such obligation 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the irs argued that 
the flra ruling will harm government efficiency 
under the scenario contemplated by the flra long after an 
agency has decided to contract work out and has accordingly entered 
into a contract with a private entity the agency may be told 
by an arbitrator that the contractingout decision must be 
reconsidered under the conditions that existed when it was made 
the appeal said 
that prospect is not conducive to efficient agency 
management it added 
flra lawyers told the justices that the irs case was decided 
correctly by the appeals court but the authority did not oppose 
the irs appeal 
the case is irs vs flra 882123

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
reinstating the murder conviction of a minnesota man who says he 
was duped into driving the getaway car in a gas station holdup 
the court said it will review a ruling that police violated the 
mans rights when they arrested him without a warrant at the house 
a where he was staying 
robert olson was convicted of murder armed robbery and assault 
in the july 18 1987 holdup of a minneapolis gas station the 
stations manager was shot to death olson was sentenced to life in 
prison plus six years 
the minnesota supreme court overturned olsons conviction last 
february and granted him a new trial ruling that he had been the 
victim of an unlawful arrest 
police acting on an informants tip did not obtain a court 
warrant or permission to enter the house where olson was staying 
before they went in and arrested him 
the fact that olson was a guest at the home did not deprive him 
of privacy rights the state court said 
noting that police said they failed to get a warrant because it 
was a sunday the state court said that is surely a curious 
reason for not observing the constitutional safeguards of 
citizens the state court also rejected arguments that police 
were faced with an emergency 
ordering a retrial the state supreme court said prosecutors may 
not use a statement olson made shortly after the arrest in which he 
admitted driving the getaway car prosecutors said discrepancies in 
the statement undermine olsons claim that he was an innocent dupe 
of the man who held up the gas station and shot the manager 
minnesotas appeal to the nations highest court was supported 
by the national district attorneys association and officials from 
10 states connecticut delaware indiana kansas michigan 
mississippi missouri new mexico south carolina and vermont 
the justices were urged to clarify whether house guests have the 
same right against unreasonable police searches and seizures as 
people in their own homes

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether a federal law unfairly makes it too difficult for coal 
miners who contract black lung disease to obtain a lawyers 
help when seeking benefits 
the justices said they will review a west virginia supreme court 
of appeals ruling that the system for awarding lawyer fees in black 
lung benefits cases violates dueprocess rights 
pneumoconiosis a chronic respiratory and pulmonary disease 
commonly called black lung afflicts numerous coal miners 
under the black lung benefits act congress provides benefits to 
those miners who become totally disabled because of the disease 
those who apply for such benefits are entitled to have a 
lawyers help and lawyers who assist miners in obtaining benefits 
have their fees paid by the coal mine operator its insurance 
carrier or the government 
to get such fees paid a lawyer must apply separately to the 
labor department and to the official that presided over the 
application hearing no fees award is made until a miner receives a 
final award of benefits 
west virginia lawyer george r triplett beginning in 1978 
entered into contingentfee agreements to help about 15 miners 
seeking black lung benefits the agreements entitled triplett to 
onefourth of any back benefits collected by the miners 
since the fees triplett collected between 1978 and 1983 were 
never approved by the labor department or any court they were in 
violation of labor department regulations 
the west virginia state bars committee on legal ethics in 1987 
recommended that the states highest court enforce a recommended 
sixmonth suspension against triplett for violating the regulations 
the state supreme court of appeals in a 32 decision last year 
refused to enforce the suspension 
the state court said the evidence made clear that most lawyers 
are unwilling to represent miners seeking black lung benefits 
because of inadequate fees and the long delays in collecting 
them 
once a miner is awarded benefits the state court said it often 
takes an additional two years for a lawyer to be paid his 
fee there is no provision for interest 
the result the state court said is to deny those applying for 
black lung benefits property without due process of law by 
severely restricting their right to obtain competent counsel in the 
highly adversarial process of black lung litigation 
the west virginia courts ruling did not bar the labor 
departments own enforcement of its attorneyfee regulations but 
it knocked out the primary method of enforcing those regulations in 
west virgina state bar disciplinary proceedings 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the labor department 
said the decision below substantially deprives black lung 
claimants in west virginia of the protection against overreaching 
and against unjustified dimunition of their benefits that congress 
mandated in regulating attorneys fees 
the appeal noted that west virginia is one of the nations 
principal coalmining states and added if not reversed the 
state courts decision may also encourage attorneys in other 
coalmining states to flout the black lung fee requirements

the supreme court today set the stage for an 
important ruling on political patronage agreeing to decide whether 
public employers may be forced to put aside partisanship when 
hiring promoting and transferring workers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by two men and a woman who 
said their job status suffered because they didnt support the 
republican party in illinois 
the court also agreed to hear a related appeal by illinois 
officials seeking to preserve patronage powers in determining when 
government workers may be laid off and rehired 
cynthia rutan franklin taylor and james moore asked the court 
to reinstate their lawsuit against illinois gov james thompson and 
state and local gop officials 
they said their rights of free speech and association protected 
by the constitutions first amendment were violated 
ms rutan said she repeatedly was denied promotions to 
supervisory positions in the state rehabilitative services 
department because she did not support republicans candidates 
taylor an equipment operator allegedly was denied an illinois 
transportation department transfer to another county because party 
officials opposed it 
and moore said the state corrections department has refused to 
hire him since 1978 because he could not get the backing of key 
republican leaders 
those who are politically favored are promoted transferred or 
hired they said those who are not so favored are not 
promoted transferred or hired 
they sued for more than 1 billion in damages and sought to 
have control of the state employment system shifted to a 
courtappointed federal receiver 
a federal judge threw out their suit and the 7th us circuit 
court of appeals by a 72 vote in february upheld the dismissal 
the appeals court relying on a series of supreme court 
decisions said public employees enjoy broad first amendment 
protection from being fired or threatened with firing but the high 
court has not extended the same constitutional safeguards to 
hiring promotion and transfer the appeals court said 
the supreme court in a 1980 ruling that significantly weakened 
the patronage system said government workers may not be fired 
solely because of their political affiliation unless that was an 
appropriate requirement for carrying out their jobs 
the 7th circuit court said employment decisions not involving 
dismissals are significantly less coercive and disruptive than 
discharges a person denied a promotion or transfer still 
retains his job and his ability to meet his financial obligations 
the appeals court said a judge should be reluctant to intrude 
into the political process and become a platonic guardian over 
state employment systems 
changes in the patronage system are better left to legislatures 
the appeals court added 
but the appeals court ruled in favor of two workers laid off 
from state jobs saying layoffs are similar in key respects to 
firings it ordered additional hearings in those cases 
the cases are rutan vs illinois republican party 881872 and 
frech vs rutan 882074

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
increasing the federal governments power to keep some accused 
criminals behind bars while they await trial 
the court said it will review a ruling in a new mexico case that 
forces the government to free on bail some defendants deemed to 
be dangerous or a risk to flee before trial 
a federal appeals court said pretrial release is required even 
for a defendant who otherwise could be held in custody if a 
pretrial detention hearing is not held the first time that person 
appears before a judge or magistrate 
the justices in 1987 upheld a federal law allowing denial of 
bail before trial to people deemed dangerous to the community even 
if accused of nonviolent crimes 
before the 1984 law called the bail reform act pretrial bail 
generally would be denied only if a judge determined the defendant 
was likely to flee 
in practice however federal judges could get around the old 
law by setting very high bail ostensibly aimed at guaranteeing the 
defendants appearance in court but effectively keeping the accused 
in custody while awaiting trial 
a provision in the 1984 law states that a hearing to determine 
whether pretrial detention is justified must be held immediately 
upon the persons first appearance before the judicial officer 
unless that person or the attorney for the government seeks a 
continuance 
a federal trial judge and the 10th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled that the first appearance provision of the law had been 
ignored in the case of guadalupe montalvomurillo charged with 
possessing nearly 1 million worth of cocaine 
montalvomurillo a citizen of mexico then legally living in 
this country was stopped last february while driving a pickup 
truck near the mexican border at orogrande nm 
us customs service agents found 72 pounds of cocaine with a 
wholesale value of almost 1 million in the truck 
at a feb 16 proceeding a federal magistrate put off a 
detention hearing until feb 21 after that hearing the magistrate 
decided to release montalvomurillo on 50000 bail and other 
conditions 
government prosecutors appealed to a federal judge who ruled 
that montalvomurillo posed both a danger to the community and a 
risk to flee 
but the judge ruled that the new mexico magistrate in 
postponing the detention hearing for five days violated the 
federal bail laws first appearance rule the judge said the 
only appropriate remedy was the defendants release on bail 
montalvomurillo was freed on 88500 bail and has been a 
fugitive from justice ever since he is believed to have fled to 
mexico 
the 10th circuit court upheld the judges ruling that the only 
remedy for denying a defendant a timely detention hearing is 
release on bail even if the result of the hearing would have been 
holding the defendant without bail 
in the appeal acted on today government lawyers argued that 
automatic release for such procedural infractions is not required 
by the 1984 law 
the court of appeals erred in imposing a remedy so plainly at 
odds with the objectives of the bail reform act the appeal said 
lawyers for montalvomurillo urged the court to reject the 
governments appeal contending among other things that their 
clients status as a fugitive makes his case moot

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
an antipornography activist who says sexually explicit photographs 
and caricatures in hustler magazine libeled her and invaded her 
privacy 
the court without comment refused to revive a 150 million 
lawsuit by feminist author andrea dworkin 
a federal judge threw out the suit and the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals upheld the dimissal last january 
the hustler references to dworkin were opinion not statements 
of fact and therefore are protected by the freespeech guarantees 
in the constitutions first amendment the appeals court said 
dworkin errs by limiting opinion to highminded discourse 
the appeals court said 
shielding all opinion from lawsuits means that outrageous and 
outlandish statements are sometimes protected the appeals court 
said but it added ludicrous statements are much less insidious 
and debilitating than falsities that bear the ring of truth we 
have little doubt that the outrageous and outlandish will be 
recognized for what they are 
the appeals court also noted that the supreme court in 1988 
threw out a 200000 award against hustler won by television 
evangelist jerry falwell who accused the magazine of causing him 
emotional distress by publishing a pornographic parody 
in that decision the justices gave broad freespeech protection 
to parodies and satire 
dworkin said she was viciously lampooned by hustler and its 
publisher larry flynt because of her opposition to pornography 
she is the author of an indianapolis ordinance since declared 
unconstitutional that defined pornography as a violation of 
womens civil rights and permitted lawsuits against pornographers 
dworkin sued over features published in three 1984 issues of 
hustler one was a cartoon of two women engaged in lesbian sex in 
which one woman says to the other you remind me so much of 
andrea dworkin 
a second feature included a series of photographs that referred 
to the andrea dworkin fan club a photograph in a third issue 
identified a woman engaged in sex as dworkins mother 
dworkin sued in wyoming but the case was transferred to a 
federal court in los angeles at the request of hustler 
the case is dworkin vs hustler 881900

the supreme court today let stand a 278600 
libel award against a pawtucket ri newspaper 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that news 
stories may be libelous even if they contain no false statement 
todays action sets no national legal precedent but instead 
leaves unresolved conflicting lower court rulings on the issue 
the pawtucket evening times published by a subsidiary of the 
ingersoll newspapers group was ordered to pay 28600 in 
compensatory damages and 250000 in punitive damages to dr paul 
healey a prominent pawtucket surgeon who chaired the local ymcas 
board of directors 
the rhode island supreme court upheld the jury award last march 
3 ruling that an evening times article falsely implied that healey 
was asked and refused to interrupt a ymca board meeting to help a 
heart attack victim 
jerry lampinski had gone to the boards june 23 1980 meeting to 
criticize the firings of two ymca staff members but was ordered by 
healey to leave 
lampinski then joined a group of protesters about 200 yards from 
the room where the board meeting was being held he collapsed 
minutes later 
lampinski was given first aid almost immediately and an 
ambulance arrived within 10 minutes the heart attack however was 
fatal 
an evening times article two days later reported that 
lampinskis sons were angry over the ymca boards treatment of 
their father 
the article said the family felt lampinski should have been 
given early attention by either a doctor or a paramedic at the 
board meeting 
the next paragraph said dr paul j healey is y president and 
was at the meeting when lampinski collapsed 
the following paragraph noted that lampinski collapsed 200 yards 
from where the board was meeting and the article went on to quote 
a ymca official refuting any implication that healey or any other 
board member was lax in responding to an emergency 
the official was quoted as saying that board members when told 
of lampinskis collapse also were told that the situation was 
well in hand and already being taken care of 
in its ruling rhode islands highest court said the june 25 
article that included the lampinski family criticism could have 
created the implication that healey was asked and refused to 
help lampinski and that there was enough time for him to render 
aid 
the state court added the evidence could support a finding 
that the newspaper knew these implications were false or that it 
acted in reckless disregard of whether these implications were true 
or false the defamation here really consists of what was left 
unprinted as well as what was actually printed 
using a legal definition employed by other state courts the 
rhode island court said publishing an opinion can be libelous if 
it implies the allegation of undisclosed defamatory facts as the 
basis for the opinion 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the evening times 
argued that the legal definition used by the state court violates 
freespeech rights 
only false statements of fact and not the reporting of 
someones stated opinion can be libelous they said 
the newspapers appeal was supported in a 
friendofthecourt brief sumbitted by five news media 
organizations the reporters committee for freedom of the press 
the national association of broadcasters the newsletter 
association the radiotelevision news directors association and 
the society of professional journalists 
they said the evening times had been punished for attempting 
to fairly and neutrally report both sides of a controversial local 
matter

john harris patricia murphy and charles reed were arrested 
outside friendswood high school in galveston county on jan 22 
1987 after refusing to leave 
a state jury convicted them of criminal trespass and a judge 
sentenced each to 90 days probation and 40 hours of community 
service 
the high school where more than 1000 students attend classes 
is fronted by a public road that has no adjacent sidewalk there is 
no access to students from the roadside because most arrive by car 
or bus and are dropped off on school grounds 
in the appeal acted on today the three convicted trespassers 
contended that their peaceful action before the start of classes 
should be constitutionally protected 
the vehicle unloading area and adjacent grounds in front of 
the school should be considered a limited public forum where 
distribution of literature is allowed the appeal argued 
under past freespeech rulings a limited public forum is an 
area opened for use by certain speakers or on certain occasions 
but a texas appeals court ruled that the friendswood high 
grounds are not any kind of public forum and the handing out of 
booklets there is not constitutionally protected the appeals court 
upheld the convictions 
the place is not an area which by tradition has been devoted 
to public assembly or debate by the general public there is no 
evidence that it had ever been opened by the school authorities as 
a place for public expressive activity the state court said 
it added a limited public forum cannot be created simply 
because members of the public are permitted to come and go at 
will 
the case is harris vs texas 882077

the supreme court said today it will consider 
placing new limits on the ability of convicted criminals to avoid 
making restitution to their victims by declaring bankruptcy 
the court agreed to hear an appeal by pennsylvania officials 
seeking to recover 4145 from a couple who pleaded guilty to 
welfare fraud 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled against pennsylvania 
welfare officials last march in the case of edward and debora 
davenport of bucks county 
the davenports pleaded guilty in 1985 to welfare fraud each was 
sentenced to one year probation and ordered to make monthly 
restitution payments of 208 until 4145 was collected 
the davenports sought protection in 1987 under chapter 13 of the 
federal bankruptcy code 
as amended by congress in 1978 chapter 13 is designed to give 
debtors various courtsupervised options to repay part of what they 
owe and eventually be rid of their debts 
a federal bankruptcy judge ruled in 1988 that the couple 
fulfilled its chapter 13 obligations without making the restitution 
payments to the state 
the 3rd circuit court upheld the judges decision the appeals 
court said excusing the davenports from the restitution payments is 
in line with the 1978 amendments congress made to the bankruptcy 
code 
otherwise the appeals court said restitution conceivably 
could deplete all the debtors resources before any distribution is 
made to the other creditors 
the appeals court ruling seems to conflict with a 1986 supreme 
court ruling that barred criminals from using another part of the 
bankruptcy code chapter 7 to avoid restitution 
unlike the chapter 13 provisions people who declare bankruptcy 
under chapter 7 must liquidate their assets the proceeds then are 
divided among creditors 
the appeals court said the 1986 supreme court ruling is limited 
to chapter 7 
the appeals court said chapter 7 unlike chapter 13 specifies 
that a fine penalty or forfeiture payable to and for the benefit 
of a governmental unit is not considered a debt for purposes of 
bankruptcy 
if chapter 13 improperly creates a haven for criminals it 
is up to congress not the courts to correct the problem the 
appeals court said 
where congress has enacted legislation which arguably affects 
state criminal proceedings it is not the function of this court to 
cure any perceived defects in that legislation the appeals court 
said 
in the appeal acted on today pennsylvania officials noted that 
restitution payments are an option to be considered by sentencing 
judges in all states and are required in many states

the supreme court today let stand a ruling 
that allows states to file criminal charges against employers 
accused of neglecting the health and safety of workers 
the court without comment let stand a ruling in an illinois 
case that federal workplace regulations do not bar such state 
prosecutions 
five officials of chicago magnet wire corp are awaiting trial 
on charges they recklessly injured 42 workers by exposing them to 
toxic chemicals extreme heat and other unsafe conditions at a 
wirecoating plant 
prosecutors said conditions at the plant were extremely 
hazardous and accused the officials of callously disregarding 
worker safety 
prosecutors said air in the plant was filled with smoke and 
chemical fumes temperatures reached 300 degrees on catwalks and 
employees were not allowed to wear masks 
the state said workers often passed out from the heat and fumes 
and on at least one occasion the plant manager laughed at an 
employee who suffered enamel burns 
chicago magnet wire officials argued that the criminal charges 
should be thrown out because the federal government preempted 
state prosecutions when it enacted the occupational safety and 
health act of 1970 
the officials said permitting such prosecutions would allow 
wholly uninformed and most likely wholly unconcerned local 
prosecutors and juries to decide when a factory is unsafe they 
said the job should be left to experienced and knowledgeable 
federal officials setting uniform national workplace safety 
standards 
their appeal was supported by the us chamber of commerce and 
other business groups that said allowing criminal prosecutions will 
cause regulatory chaos 
in refusing to squelch the prosecution the illinois supreme 
court last february said state criminal law can provide a 
valuable and forceful supplement to insure that workers are 
adequately protected and that particular egregious conduct receives 
appropriate punishment 
the chicago magnet wire officials indicted were anthony jordan 
president kevin keane plant manager frank asta maintenance 
foreman allan simon plant engineer and gerald colby an 
engineering and maintenance supervisor 
if convicted they face maximum sentences of 10 to 20 years in 
prison 
the case is asta vs illinois 881783

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether farm workers who suffer transportationrelated injuries may 
sue their employers after receiving workercompensation benefits 
the justices said they will review a ruling in the case of 10 
florida farm hands that such lawsuits are allowed under a federal 
law the migrant and seasonal agricultural workers protection act 
the 10 workers were hurt in 1985 while being transported in a 
van by their employer the adams fruit co each collected 
workercompensation benefits from adams under florida law 
they then sued their employer in federal court alleging that 
adams violated the federal law by transporting them in an unsafe 
van 
lawyers for adams sought to have the suit dismissed contending 
that the states workercompensation law made it the exclusive 
legal remedy for such injuries 
us district judge elizabeth kovachevich in tampa ruled for 
adams concluding that the federal laws motor vehicle safety 
provisions could not be invoked by workers who had collected 
workercompensation benefits 
but her ruling was overturned by the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals last march 15 
both the goal of preventing unsafe transportation practices 
and the role of private suits in enforcing worker protections 
convince us that applying the florida worker compensation law to 
bar private suits for violations of the federal act when 
transportation is covered by workercompensation insurance would 
frustrate congressional intent the appeals court said 
it added the receipt of workercompensation benefits does not 
bar a private suit for actual or statutory damages based on 
violations of the act the amount of workercompensation benefits 
however may be considered in awarding actual damages 
lawyers for adams said the 11th circuit courts ruling conflicts 
with a decision by the 4th us circuit court of appeals in a case 
from south carolina 
in it the 4th circuit court ruled that a farm worker injured 
when sprayed by pesticides could not sue under the federal law 
after receiving workercompensation benefits 
because of the conflicting rulings the appeal said it is now 
impossible for farmers across the nation to know to what extent 
they must protect themselves from additional losses

the supreme court today let states require 
automobile insurance for motorists who say it violates their 
religious convictions 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by a south dakota 
man who believes having insurance belittles a promise from god to 
provide in any situation 
lindy cosgrove of reliance sd was stopped by a state trooper 
in january 1988 while driving on a road closed because of a 
blizzard 
when he did not produce proof he had car insurance cosgrove was 
charged with violating a state law requiring motorists to 
maintain financial responsibility for motor vehicles 
the law requires either liability insurance or the posting of a 
75000 bond or 50000 certificate of deposit to protect others 
who might be injured by a motorist 
cosgrove pleaded not guilty saying that since 1972 he has 
refused because of his religious beliefs all forms of insurance 
as evidence of his sincerity cosgrove said he and his wife 
refused free insurance from their employers 
cosgrove was fined 75 and his license could be revoked under 
the state law 
the south dakota supreme court ruled in may that while 
cosgroves religious beliefs apparently are sincere the state has 
a legitimate interest in requiring car insurance 
the law is clearly designed to protect the public the state 
court said without the law damages caused by car accidents 
could be borne by the public at large rather than those who are 
responsible the state court said 
it added that the options of a bond or certificate of deposit 
permit cosgrove to maintain financial responsibility for his 
driving without purchasing insurance 
but cosgrove said the bond or the certificate would be a 
tremendous economic burden for him 
the alternatives place an unmistakable burden on cosgroves 
free exercise of his religious beliefs his lawyers said 
they also argued that the states interest in requiring 
insurance is less than compelling because many motorists tourists 
from out of state for example are permitted to drive without 
insurance 
the supreme court in 1985 by a 44 vote barred nebraska 
officials from requiring a drivers license photograph for a woman 
who believes the bible forbids such a graven image but that 
tie vote while upholding a lower court ruling in favor of the 
woman established no national precedent 
in other cases the high court has ruled for individuals whose 
observance of the sabbath conflicted with state authority 
last march the justices unanimously barred states from denying 
unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their sabbath 
even if the refusal is based on individual religious belief rather 
than a religious groups doctrine

the supreme court today let stand a 12 
million bonus in fees awarded to the lawyers for consumers who sued 
over allegedly defective transmissions in some general motors cars 
the justices without comment turned away arguments that 
federal law does not allow such fee bonuses when lawyers win cases 
in which there was a substantial risk of nonpayment because of a 
loss 
various lawsuits against gm each alleging that less efficient 
engines and transmissions were substituted in certain lines of 
cars were consolidated into one class action case in 1982 
the case was settled in 1985 after gm agreed to establish a 17 
million fund to be shared by those who sued 
a federal judge awarded the consumers lawyers nearly 2 million 
in fees to be paid out of the fund the award was based on time 
expended and reasonable hourly rates 
the judge refused to enhance the fee award as a bonus for taking 
a risky case on a contingency fee basis ruling that the federal 
magnusonmoss act bars any such risk multiplier of a lawyers 
fees 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals threw out the award ruling 
last year and ordered the judge to apply a risk multiplier in the 
gm case 
the judge then awarded an additional 12 million in lawyer fees 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for gm argued that the 
appeals court ruling conflicts with language in the magnusonmoss 
act and with a 1987 supreme court decision limiting lawyerfee 
bonuses 
the 7th circuit court rejected a narrow reading of the federal 
laws language the appeals court said the 1987 ruling did not 
apply to the gm case because a settlement had resulted in a common 
fund for payments to consumers and their lawyers 
gm lawyers called the appeals court ruling a patent evasion 
of the 1987 high court ruling they said the appeals court decision 
will increase the incentive for plaintiffs attorneys to clog the 
courts with marginal lawsuits in the hope of recovering large 
multipliers while spawning complex litigation over the collateral 
issue of attorneys fees 
gms appeal was supported in a friendofthecourt brief 
submitted by the national association of counties the national 
governors association the national league of cities and the us 
conference of mayors 
the brief noted that state and local governments are among the 
defendants most frequently sued under federal statutes providing 
for awards of attorney fees

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi is calling 
on the bush administration to take a more active diplomatic role to 
head off the possible collapse of peace talks designed to end the 
14year old civil war in his homeland 
savimbi said sunday he will carry that message to president 
bush other senior administration officials and congressional 
leaders this week he said a stronger us role is appropriate in 
light of the long history of us diplomatic activity in the area 
the united states knows the players said savimbi head of 
the unita rebel group 
bush will meet with savimbi on thursday to discuss current 
developments in southern africa including the national 
reconciliation process in angola and the proposals to end the 
fighting in that country white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said today 
angola seemed on the verge of a peace settlement in june when 
representatives of the leftist government and of savimbis 
usbacked rebel movement reached agreement on a ceasefire and on 
negotiations intended to lead to national reconciliation 
but the truce broke down in august with each side blaming the 
other and the situation has been aggravated during zairemediated 
talks by profound differences over what constitutes national 
reconciliation 
savimbi speaking with two american reporters on sunday 
reaffirmed his view that a settlement can come about only through 
the creation of a national unity government whose main task would 
be to arrange for free and fair elections 
the government of angola meanwhile has said reconciliation 
should consist mainly of the rebels integration into the existing 
political and military establishment 
savimbi also said he was prepared to meet with a highlevel 
angolan foreign ministry delegation which is due to arrive here on 
wednesday 
however in the talks mediated by zaire the two sides have 
refused to negotiate in the same room adding to savimbis 
frustration is the perception among some that zaire president 
mobutu sese seko has embraced the angolan governments view of the 
requirements for peace 
on sunday however savimbi declined to criticize mobutu 
concentrating his fire instead on the angolan government 
the soviet union has been angolas chief supplier of military 
equipment cuba has had troops in angola since 1975 but in december 
agreed to withdraw them by 1991 as part of a usmediated 
settlement the united states has been providing military and other 
assistance to unita since 1986 
savimbi said election processes are being used to bring about 
change in countries as diverse as poland and namibia where south 
african colonial rule is ending and he said elections are the only 
guarantee of peace in angola 
the power has to come from the people he said adding that 
he is confident the majority of angolans are on unitas side

the supreme court today allowed pennsylvania 
to require its state judges to retire at age 70 
the court without comment turned away arguments that such a 
mandatory retirement age for judges is unconstitutional 
the controversy may have had special poignancy at the nations 
highest court where four of the nine justices are over 70 and a 
fifth will turn 70 next year 
justices william j brennan justice thurgood and harry a 
blackmun are over 80 justice byron r white is 72 and justice 
john paul stevens will turn 70 on april 20 each has life tenure 
as do all federal judges 
since 1968 the pennsylvania constitution has required all state 
judges who generally are elected to 10year terms to step down 
at 70 
four judges challenged the state constitutional provision 
saying it conflicts with the equalprotection and dueprocess 
guarantees offered in the federal constitution 
but the state supreme court last march 1 upheld the mandatory 
retirement scheme as a rational way to promote legitimate state 
purposes 
the state court identified those purposes as 
continually bringing in younger judges while retaining 
parttime services of retired judges willing and able to help out 
eliminating unpleasantness of removing aged and disabled judges 
on an individual selective basis 
preventing harm caused by senile judges 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the four state judges 
attacked each stated purpose 
removing older judges to make room for younger ones is unfair 
legally unsupportable and unwise the appeal argued the public 
interest is not served by forcing mature experienced judges off 
the bench before their elected terms expire 
it added that because chronological age bears no scientific 
relationship to mental competence a blanket policy on retirement 
denies judges their rights to individualized determinations of 
their fitness for service 
removing the unpleasantness that may accompany such individual 
determinations has never been considered a legitimate excuse for 
rank discrimination the appeal said 
the mandatory retirement is not an effective way of protecting 
the public from senile judges the appeal said because mental 
incompetence may set in far earlier than someones 70th birthday 
the justices in 1976 upheld a massachusetts law requiring 
mandatory retirement of state police officers at age 50 and in 
1979 upheld a federal law requiring mandatory retirement of foreign 
service officers at age 60 
the four state judges who appealed the pennsylvania mandatory 
retirement are leon katz robert wright john rauhauser jr and 
william pfadt

eight antiwar activists convicted of breaking 
into a pennsylvania plant damaging two nuclear missile cones and 
pouring blood on related documents lost a supreme court appeal 
today 
the court over two dissenting votes turned down arguments that 
the activists known as the plowshares eight after the biblical 
prophesy that swords will be beaten into plowshares were denied a 
fair trial 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall voted to grant 
full review to the case but that left the eight activists two 
votes short 
the eight including longtime antiwar activist brothers daniel 
and philip berrigan broke into a general electric plant in king of 
prussia pa on sept 9 1980 
the protesters used hammers to beat the missile cones ge was 
manufacturing for the federal government prosecutors said the 
intruders caused about 28000 in damages 
in addition to the berrigans the defendants were the rev carl 
kabat of baltimore a priest with the oblate of mary immaculate 
order sister anne montgomery a member of the relgious order of 
the sacred heart who taught in new york city dean hammer a new 
haven conn protestant chaplain elmer maas a former music and 
philosophy professor molly rush of pittsburgh director of the 
thomas merton center for justice and peace and john schuchardt a 
baltimore lawyer 
each was convicted of burglary conspiracy and criminal mischief 
in a 1981 trial in norristown pa sentences ranged up to 
3to10year prison terms 
a state appeals court threw out the convictions after ruling 
that the eight had been denied a public trial because only news 
reporters not members of the general public were allowed to be in 
the courtroom during jury selection 
the pennsylvania supreme court reversed that ruling and sent the 
case back to the appeals court 
in late 1987 the appeal court ruled that the trial judge had 
been biased against the defendants and ordered resentencing but 
it voted 54 to uphold the eight convictions 
the state supreme court refused to hear the activists ensuing 
appeal last feb 3 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the eight argued that 
the defendants right to a fair and public trial was violated by 
the exclusion of most spectators during the five days in which 
jurors were selected 
exemption of the press from an order closing the courtoom for 
the first five days of the trial cannot relieve the judges action 
of its constitutional defect the appeal said 
in urging the justices to reject the appeal montgomery county 
lawyer mary m killinger said there was no real limitation on 
the publics access to any information and that the exclusion 
was ordered to ensure a calm and quiet setting 
saying that the judges exclusion order was perhaps unwise 
ms killinger said it does not catapult this case into the area 
of significant and constitutional error worthy of the high 
courts review 
the eight activists have not yet been resentenced all except 
kabat who is serving a prison term for an unrelated conviction 
are free on bail 
the case is berrigan vs pennsylvania 895119

the supreme court today turned its back on a 
stillbrewing tempest over americas multimillion dollar herbal 
tea market 
the justices without comment refused to take up an antitrust 
controversy stemming from the onceplanned acquisition by thomas j 
lipton inc of krafts celestial seasonings inc 
the case dates back to 1987 when lipton a subsidiary of the 
huge grocery products distributor unilever announced it had agreed 
to buy celestial seasonings from kraft inc 
celestial is the largest us producer of herbal teas 
accounting for 52 percent of all sales 
lipton controls the second largest herbal tea market share 32 
percent 
herbal teas are not actually teas but blends of flowers leaves 
roots and stems of edible plants the blends are steeped in water 
yielding a natural caffeinefree beverage 
after it became clear the federal trade commission was not going 
to challenge the purchase competitor rc bigelow inc sued in 
federal court to stop it 
bigelow a familyowned business based in norwalk conn 
accounts for about 13 percent of the herbal tea markets sales 
its lawsuit contended that the merger of lipton and celestial 
would create a monopoly that would hurt bigelows chances of 
competing effectively in selling herbal teas 
us district judge jose cabranes in new haven conn threw out 
the suit ruling that bigelow had not proved the merger would 
result in predatory pricing or any other antitrust law violation 
the mere fact that lipton will possess monopoly power after 
the proposed acquisition is not a sufficient showing that lipton 
will exercise that power in a way that will cause injury to 
bigelow the judge said 
his ruling relied heavily on a 1986 supreme court decision that 
made it more difficult for companies to challenge successfully 
mergers of their competitors 
in that decision the justices said a business making such a 
challenge must show a threat of antitrust injury and that a 
showing of loss or damage due merely to increased competition does 
not constitute such injury 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last jan 17 reinstated 
the suit 
it said the fact that lipton would have an 84 percent share of 
the herbal tea market after purchasing celestial constitutes 
sufficient evidence in and of itself of antitrust injury to a 
competitor to create a genuine issue for trial 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for lipton and kraft said 
the 2nd circuit courts ruling conflicts with the 1986 supreme 
court decision 
what practical impact the case sent back to judge cabranes by 
the appeals court continues to pack for the herbal tea market is 
being debated 
kraft in september 1988 cancelled the proposed sale and entered 
into an agreement with vestar capital partners inc a firm 
specializing in leveraged buyouts for a managementled buyout of 
celestial 
bigelow argued before the 2nd circuit court that the september 
sale did not make the case moot because the liptoncelestial 
transaction has not been irrevocably abandoned 
bigelow takes the position that there is more than a mere or 
abstract possibility that lipton will again seek to acquire 
celestial the appeals court said we agree 
the case is lipton vs bigelow 881948

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by 
older us postal service inspectors who say they are being forced 
illegally to transfer to other cities 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
inspectors are not victims of illegal age discrimination 
the postal service which employs more than 1900 inspectors 
has faced a problem of chronic staff shortages in 14 major 
metropolitan areas 
the service in 1980 adopted what it calls its career path policy 
to ease the bigcity shortages 
inspectors are urged to volunteer for work in the big cities as 
an incentive inspectors who have spent two years in one of the big 
cities are exempt from similar transfers later on when they reach 
seniorlevel status 
also anyone who has served five years in one of the 14 
metropolitan areas is eligible to be asked for reassignment 
another provision of the career path policy puts seniorlevel 
inspectors who have not worked in the big cities at the top of the 
list for involuntary transfers 
it is that socalled seniorfirst rule that was challenged by 
the older inspectors they said the policy disproportionately harms 
inspectors over age 40 
a federal judge ruled that the provision violates the federal 
age discrimination in employment act which is aimed at protecting 
older workers against arbitrary bias 
the judges ruling was overturned in december 1988 by the us 
circuit court of appeals here 
the appeals court said the seniorfirst rule should not be 
examined in isolation 
the seniorfirst rule was not a freestanding element of an 
employment program the appeals court said under the career 
path policy every seniorlevel employee was expected to spend 
five years in a major metropolitan area thus each seniorlevel 
employee can fulfill this uniform service requirement through 
either an early voluntary or a later involuntary transfer 
the appeals court said the postal service properly refused to 
adopt an alternative system of random transfers because that would 
have reduced the incentive for voluntary moves to big cities 
in the appeal acted on today the senior inspectors said they 
have been hit with significant hardship by the transfer rule 
after living for years in the same location they said the 
system forced them to uproot their families and move to areas with 
a higher cost of living 
regardless of the postal services motives the senior 
inspectors said the seniorfirst rule is illegal because it has a 
disproportionate impact on older workers 
bush administration lawyers urged the justices to reject the 
appeal saying the system ensures that the burdens of employment 
are distributed fairly while giving postal inspectors as much 
control as possible over their careers 
the case is arnold vs postmaster general 898

the president of the tiny south pacific 
republic of nauru today lost a supreme court appeal aimed at 
reviving his libel lawsuit against a guam newspaper 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that president 
hammer deroburt was not libeled by the pacific daily news 
the newspaper owned by gannett inc reported in 1978 that 
deroburt secretly made an illegal 600000 loan to a marshall 
islands political faction that favored separating the islands from 
micronesia 
deroburt said the article and a related one were false he said 
the loan was legal was a matter of public record and was made 
before deroburt was elected president 
nauru is an indepedent island nation of about eight square miles 
with some 4000 residents it is among the wealthiest nations per 
capita because of vast phosphate deposits 
after years of legal maneuvering a federal jury in hawaii 
decided in favor of the newspaper in 1985 the jury found that 
deroburt failed to prove actual malice that the newspaper 
knowingly printed falsehoods or acted with reckless disregard for 
the truth 
a key issue in the case was the identity of two confidential 
sources relied on by the newspaper 
deroburt at one point alleged that the sources did not exist 
his lawyers wanted the jury told it could presume there were no 
sources 
but during trial the reporter who wrote the first article named 
two sources including one who by that time had died 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the jury verdict in 
october 1988 the appeals court said deroburts lawyers in effect 
abandoned their claim that no sources existed 
they chose to present deroburts case in a manner 
inconsistent with a theory of no sources the appeals court said 
for the judge to then instruct the jury that it should 
conclusively presume that there were no sources would have been 
contrary to the evidence presented at trial by both parties and 
contrary to the truth the appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today deroburt urged the justices to 
overturn their 1964 ruling that established the actual malice 
defense in libel suits filed by public officials 
in the alternative deroburts lawyers said the burden of 
proving there was no actual malice should be shifted to the 
newspaper when it has withheld concealed or destroyed relevant 
evidence 
deroburt alleged that the reporter who wrote the first 1978 
article destroyed his notes 
the case is deroburt vs gannett 899

an evangelical christian group ordered to 
return most of the 65 million donated by a wealthy exmember lost 
a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand rulings that the group 
the bible speaks received the donations after exerting undue 
influence on department store heiress elizabeth dayton dovydenas 
the group now must return 55 million 
at issue was whether allowing mrs dovydenas to rescind her 
gifts made over a 12month period ending in late 1985 violates 
the the bible speaks religious freedom 
the bible speaks was based in lenox mass and was led by 
founder carl stevens 
the bible speaks claimed 1200 members worldwide until it 
disbanded in the summer of 1987 stevens has since moved to the 
baltimore area where the church has been revived under the name 
the greater grace 
the bible speaks appeal was supported in friendofthecourt 
briefs submitted by the national council of churches comprised of 
32 national protestant and eastern orthodox churches and by 
television evangelist jerry falwells oldtime gospel hour 
lawyers for the national council of churches said mrs 
dovydenas legal victory is not just ominous for religious 
liberty but devastating 
lawyers for the oldtime gospel hour said falwells related 
ministries received more than 100 million in gifts in the fiscal 
year that ended june 31 and in recent fiscal years had received at 
least one gift of over 1 million 
no surer way to destroy the churches of america could be 
found they said than to permit the courts to strip them of 
gifts by allowing a wealthy disaffected donor to reclaim a 
gift 
mrs dovydenas an heir to the daytonhudson fortune grew up in 
minnesota some years ago after moving to lenox in 1981 with her 
husband she assessed her personal wealth at about 19 million 
mrs dovydenas joined the bible speaks in 1982 
within a threeyear period mrs dovydenas gave the bible speaks 
over 65 million including major donations of 5 million 1 
million and 500000 
mrs dovydenas family after inviting her to her fathers 
birthday party in minnesota in late 1985 hired two 
deprogrammers to talk to her she later left the bible speaks 
and sued to have her gifts returned 
a federal trial judge ordered the religious group to return 65 
million but the 1st us circuit court of appeals ruled that only 
55 million must be returned 
the appeal acted on today challenged only that portion of the 
appeals court decision concerning the 5 million gift 
lawyers for the bible speaks said the lower court rulings 
threaten all religious groups but they are of especially grave 
concern to evangelical and fundamentalist religious communities 
the appeal said 
their nonmainstream character renders them particularly 
vulnerable to bias and misunderstanding both conscious and 
unconscious in tort and restitution suits brought by apostate 
members particularly former members who have undergone extensive 
professional deprogramming the appeal said 
the case is the bible speaks vs dovydenas 881977

the supreme court today refused to disturb a 
states ban on telephone solicitation for prearranged funerals 
the court without comment rejected arguments by an insurance 
firm and two funeral directors that such a virginia law violates 
their freespeech rights 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last march upheld a 1951 
virginia law banning the telephoning of potential customers to line 
up funeral business 
the appeals court said the constitution permits such 
restrictions on commercial speech 
the law was challenged by guardian plans inc an 
insurancefunded funeral program and two funeral homes that 
participate in the plan 
guardian sells prearranged or preneed funerals by 
including in the companys life insurance policies benefits to pay 
for funerals when a policyholder dies the family must agree to 
release the policy proceeds to a funeral home 
guardian said the plan is intended to be humane and a help to 
customers sparing family members the anguish of deciding how much 
to pay for a funeral at the time of a loved ones death 
but the virginia board of funeral directors and embalmers 
saying it was trying to protect consumers complained about the 
soliciting of business over the phone 
guardian and its participating funeral homes said the state 
board is influenced by the funeral industry and that the ban on 
phone solicitations is a ploy to reduce competition 
the 4th circuit court said the virginia statute leaves open 
ample alternatives for guardian and its plan participants to 
advertise their services consequently virginias ban on 
telemarketing does not violate the first amendment 
guardians appeal was supported by the american cemetery 
association which represents 2000 funeral homes nationwide 
the associations lawyers cited a statement by federal trade 
commission officials that restricting such telephone solicitations 
is anticompetitive 
the case is guardian plans vs teague 8938

alaskas attempt to forestall offshore oil and 
gas exploration in its bristol bay suffered a supreme court setback 
today 
the court over one dissenting vote left intact rulings that 
allowed the federal government last year to sell leases on 56 
million acres of bristol bay off alaskas southwestern coast 
justice harry a blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case 
but four votes are needed to grant such review 
the court turned away warnings by alaska gov steve cowper and 
others that an oil spill in bristol bay could do more environmental 
harm than the massive exxon valdez spill in alaskas prince william 
sound last march 
the disputed leases were sold for nearly 100 million after a 
federal judge and the 9th us circuit court of appeals rejected a 
challenge by cowper and numerous enviromental groups fishing 
associations and alaska communities 
the federal government first began considering oil and gas 
leasing in the north aleutian basin which underlies bristol bay 
in 1974 
after twice canceling plans for lease sales in the bay at 
alaskas request the secretary of interior in 1982 proposed 
leasing all 325 million acres beginning in 1985 
the secretary in response to concerns expressed by alaska 
officials later restricted the leasing to the southwest corner of 
the region by deleting nearly 83 percent of the acreage from the 
sale 
under the federal outer continental shelf lands act the 
department of interior must give the governor of any affected state 
a chance to make recommendations about any proposed lease sale 
the governor recommended that the federal government delay 
selling any bristol bay leases for eight years and then not sell 
any tracts within 25 miles of shore the interior secretary 
rejected both recommendations sparking the lawsuit 
the appeal acted on today contended that the interior secretary 
violated the continental shelf law because his rejection of the 
states recommendations was arbitrary and capricious 
in the appeal alaska attorney general douglas baily referred to 
last marchs oil spill by the grounded tanker exxon valdez as a 
dramatic example of the devastating impact of oil on biological 
resources 
bristol bay and the north aleutian basin are substantially 
more remote and inaccessible than prince william sound the 
weather is much more problematic efforts to clean up an oil 
spill in this area accordingly would be even less successful than 
in the sound the appeal said 
it accused the federal government of not striking a proper 
balance between satisfying the nations thirst for oil and gas 
and protecting one of the most biologically productive and 
important areas in the world 
the appeal was supported by the attorneys general of california 
florida massachusetts new jersey north carolina oregon texas 
and washington and by the south carolina coastal council 
the bush administration urged the justices to reject the appeal 
justice department lawyers said federal law gives the interior 
secretary not a governor the authority to make a final decision 
on lease sales 
the case is cowper vs secretary of interior 882000

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by san francisco policemen who say they lost out on 
promotions due to unfair preferences given to women and minorities 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
officers mostly white men are not the victims of reverse bias who 
are entitled to promotions 
the case stems from a 1973 lawsuit in behalf of women and racial 
minorities who said the citys police department discriminated 
against them 
that suit was settled in 1979 when the city agreed to hire and 
promote more women and minorities within the police department and 
to use unbiased promotion tests 
the city in 1983 gave a test for promotion to sergeant and 
inspector that included multiplechoice questions essays and an 
oral exam 
but when the scores of women and minorities scored 
disproportionately lower than white males city officials changed 
the test results more weight was given to the oral exam so that 
more women and minorities would be promoted 
the san francisco police officers association and officers whose 
scores were downgraded sued 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled in march that 
revising the test scores was illegal discrimination but it refused 
to order promotions for any officers whose test scores were lowered 
as a result 
the appeals court said the test as originally scored violated 
the 1979 court order since the exam adversely affected minorities 
and women 
the persons who did well on it did not acquire any rights 
the appeals court said it added that those people who benefitted 
when the scores were changed may not be penalized by having to give 
up promotions in favor of those with higher original scores 
instead the appeals court ordered the city not to change test 
scores in this manner again the 9th circuit court noted that the 
city conceded it is illegal to revise scoring standards after test 
results are compiled 
the case is san francisco police officers association vs city 
and county of san francisco 881984

the supreme court today refused to bar states 
from using abandoned property laws to recover some unclaimed 
insurance benefits 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by an insurance 
company ordered to turn over to connecticut 25 million in 
unclaimed benefits 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled last february that 
the states power to collect the money is not preempted by the 
federal employee retirement income security act erisa which 
regulates pensions and other employee benefit programs 
aetna life insurance co which provides group health and 
accident coverage for workers said it should be allowed to keep 
unclaimed benefits and use the money to lower its premiums or 
increase benefits 
the insurance company said tens of millions of dollars could be 
at stake if all states sought to recover unclaimed benefits 
connecticut in 1981 amended its laws on abandoned property or 
escheating to enable the state to acquire property left unclaimed 
after three rather than seven years 
the state said aetna must turn over to it 25 million in 
unclaimed benefits 
a federal judge ruled in favor of aetna but the 2nd circuit 
court reversed that decision 
we think that the impact of connecticuts escheat law on erisa 
benefit plans is too tenuous remote and peripheral to require 
preemption of the state law by the federal statute the appeals 
court said 
the case is aetna vs borges 881883

the supreme court today allowed its decision 
barring prosecutors from excluding potential jurors based on their 
race to be applied to all noncriminal trials in three southern 
states 
the justices over one dissenting vote let stand a federal 
appeals court ruling in a georgia case that extended their 1986 
decision to all civil trials 
although todays action sets no national precedent it leaves 
intact a binding precedent for courts in georgia alabama and 
florida 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the georgia 
case but four votes are needed to grant such review 
the justices in 1986 curtailed dramatically the traditionally 
broad power of prosecutors to bar prospective jurors from trials by 
using peremptory or automatic challenges 
the court ruled that the exclusion of potential jurors from any 
criminal trial because of their race violates the equalprotection 
rights of defendants and of those people excluded 
at the time of the ruling legal experts said it likely would 
not apply to peremptory challenges made by defense lawyers in 
criminal trials or to any civil or noncriminal trial 
but the 11th us circuit court of appeals last jan 17 took a 
much more expansive view of the supreme courts 1986 ruling 
the appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed by a black man 
against the richmond county ga deputy sheriff who shot him the 
appeals court said the trial judge must determine whether the 
deputy sheriffs lawyer used two peremptory challenges to exclude 
black potential jurors for nonracial reasons 
we hold that the 1986 ruling applies in civil as well as 
criminal cases said the 11th circuit court which has 
jurisdiction over georgia alabama and florida 
some government action must be present for the 14th amendments 
guarantee of equal protection to be violated but the appeals court 
said such a violation can be found even in a lawsuit in which 
neither the government nor a government employee is involved 
when blacks are excluded from jury service on account of their 
race the trial judge constitutes the discriminatory state 
actor the appeals court said 
although the appeals court did not say so the decisions 
rationale would appear to mean that the prohibition against 
racebased juror exclusions applies to criminal defense lawyers as 
well 
in the georgia case deputy sheriff frank tiller shot willie 
albert fludd while attempting to apprehend a suspected narcotics 
trafficker fludd sued tiller in federal court under a muchused 
civil rights law 
the case is tiller vs fludd 882088

a former delta airlines pilot fired for 
operating a commercial jet while drunk lost a supreme court appeal 
today in his effort to win back his job 
the justices over one dissenting vote let stand lower court 
rulings that the pilots reinstatement would be contrary to public 
policy 
a labor arbitration board previously had ordered his 
reinstatement 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
four votes are needed to grant such review 
william d day a bostonbased pilot for delta was fired in 
1985 after airline officials discovered he had been drunk while 
commanding a flight from bangor maine to boston 
the flight was without incident 
shortly after his firing day was medically diagnosed as an 
alcoholic after treatment he was recertified by the federal 
aviation administration 
day challenged his firing and under the terms of a contract 
delta and his union the air line pilots association his grievance 
was submitted to a fivemember arbitration board 
comprised of two members appointed by the airline two appointed 
by the union and one neutral chairman the board split 32 in 
finding that day had been fired without just cause 
although stating that day was guilty of serious misconduct the 
board concluded that he should have been offered the option of 
enrolling in deltas alcohol rehabilitation program the board 
ordered his reinstatement without back pay 
delta challenged the boards reinstatement order in federal 
court and us district judge orinda evans in atlanta overturned 
the board 
requiring delta to cooperate with day and the faa in 
recertifying day is violative of public policy the judge ruled 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals upheld that ruling last 
dec 8 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the air line pilots 
association argued that the lower court rulings conflict with a 
1987 supreme court decision that limited the power of federal 
judges to overrule labor arbitrators 
in that decision the court ruled unanimously that judges may 
reverse an arbitration award for publicpolicy reasons only if the 
award creates an explicit conflict with laws or legal precedent 
such judicial reversals cannot be based on general 
considerations f supposed public interest the justices said in 
their 1987 ruling 
in the appeal acted on today lawyers for the pilots union 
called the lower court rulings examples of the continuing erosion 
of the doctrine of finality of arbitration awards 
they urged the justices to restore the arbitration board ruling 
that would reinstate day

the supreme court today refused to impose a 
oneinmatepercell limit at san quentin prison in california 
the justices without comment let stand a state appeals court 
ruling that putting two prisoners in one cramped cell does not 
amount to constitutionally impermissible cruel and unusual 
punishment 
inmates sued state officials in 1981 challenging the 
doublecelling and other conditions at the maximumsecurity prison 
between 1977 and 1982 the number of inmates at san quentin grew 
from 2000 to 3400 by early 1983 the prisons general population 
was 153 percent of design capacity 
in the same years the rate of violent incidents at san quentin 
increased dramatically while the prisons general population grew 
by 46 percent treatments for assaultrelated injuries increased by 
519 percent 
reported assaults suicides and weaponspossession incidents 
grew by 193 percent during the same period 
state judge beverly savitt in 1983 declared the conditions at 
san quentin to comprise cruel and unusual punishment among other 
things she ordered state prison officials to stop putting two 
prisoners in cells designed for one 
the cells are six feet wide eight feet deep and eight feet 
high when two inmates are held inside such a cell each prisoner 
has less than nine square feet of usable space 
a state appeals court reversed savitts doublecelling ruling 
last dec 12 
the blanket ban on double celling cannot be sustained the 
appeals court ruled noting the surge in prison violence the 
appeals court said the evidence does not support the finding 
that double celling itself was the cause of the increase 
the california supreme court refused to review the inmates 
appeal last march 23 
the state appeals court relied heavily on a 1981 decision by the 
nations highest court that upheld the use of double celling in an 
ohio prison 
in that ruling the justices said double celling in cells 
designed for one prisoner is not necessarily unconstitutional

a drug used to deworm farm animals combined 
with a common cancer drug has been found to save the lives of 
patients who would have died from an advanced type of colon cancer 
the national cancer institute announced today 
nci director samuel broder said that a national study involving 
about 1300 patients with a stage 3 type of colon cancer showed 
increased survival rates for those treated with a drug called 
levamisole in combination with 5fluorouracil a cancer drug now in 
common use 
the study was directed by dr charles g moertel of the mayo 
clinic 
at a news conference today moertel said that the study showed 
49 percent of stage iii colon cancer patients were alive five years 
after therapy with the drug combination compared to only 37 percent 
of such patients who received no drugs both of the patient groups 
being compared had been treated with surgery which revealed that 
the colon cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes 
in cancer therapy this stage of the disease is called dukes c 
with todays announcement broder said that physicians are 
encouraged to discuss this treatment option with patients at this 
stage of colon cancer 
he said the combination drug therapy is started three to five 
weeks after surgery and is continued for about a year 
levamisole is a drug that is used by veterinarians to clear 
worms from the intestine of barnyard animals it is not now 
approved by the food and drug administration for any human use in 
the united states 
the drug however is commonly used in europe to treat worm 
infestation in humans and it has been used widely in experimental 
treatment of cancers 
moertel said the drug combination of levamisole and 
5fluorouracil has not been proven effective against colon cancers 
at an earlier stage in the disease or for those whose surgeries 
occurred at a much earlier time 
broder said a specific description of this new treatment method 
is being mailed to doctors around the country and that physicians 
may obtain levamisole through the national cancer institute

about 25000 blacks demanded 
clemency for two condemned african national congress guerrillas 
today in the largest protest march ever held in one of south 
africas nominally independent tribal homelands 
the marchers most of them schoolchildren paraded peacefully 
through the center of umtata capital of transkei 
some carried african national congress flags and displayed 
placards urging the release of two members of the guerrilla 
movement who are on death row in transkei for a 1986 bombing which 
killed two people at the wild coast sun a posh gambling resort 
overlooking the indian ocean 
the homelands official radio estimated the crowd at 25000 and 
said police did not interfere 
the protest came a day after transkeis military leader maj 
gen bantu holomisa declared at a funeral service that he would 
consider holding a referendum to let homeland voters decide if they 
wanted to rejoin south africa 
the star south africas largest daily newspaper said the 
government faced a major challenge to its grand apartheid plan 
if holomisa proceeded with a referendum the result said the star 
would be an overwhelming vote to rejoin south africa thus 
repudiating the white governments longstanding contention that 
blacks preferred autonomy in separate ethnic states 
the homeland system also came under heavy criticism sunday in 
botshabelo a vast rural shantytown in the orange free state which 
the government has placed under the jurisdiction of qwaqwa one of 
six semiautonomous homelands an estimated 15000 to 20000 of 
botshabelos 500000 residents marched in protest against their 
incorporation into qwaqwa which is 180 miles from their community 
many botshabelo residents fear qwaqwa may be declared 
independent thus depriving them of south african citizenship like 
many other blacks they feel south africa despite its segregation 
laws offers better opportunities than the impoverished homelands 
in regard to pensions employment and housing 
south africas 28 million blacks have voting rights only in the 
homelands and in local elections national policy is controlled by 
the 5 million whites 
holomisa at the funeral sunday of a tribal chief who opposed 
transkeis independence shared a podium for the first time with 
prominent antiapartheid activists speakers at the service 
denounced the homeland system and praised the late chief sabata 
dalindyebo for his staunch opposition to the excision of transkei 
from south africa in 1976 
transkei was the first of four homelands to accept 
independence from south africa as part of a plan by white 
officials to create separate nations for each major black tribe 
none of the four are recognized internationally 
south africas foreign minister pik botha declined to comment 
on holomisas statement saying he had received no official 
communication from transkei a ministry official requesting 
anonymity said any bid by transkei to renounce its independence 
would be a matter for negotiations between south africa and the 
homeland 
holomisa 34 took power in transkei in a bloodless coup in 
1987 he is the first leader of a nominally independent homeland to 
make favorable references to the african national congress and he 
reportedly held secret talks earlier this year with the groups 
exiled president oliver tambo 
transkei lies along south africas southern coast between the 
port cities of durban and east london it covers about 18000 
square miles and has about 35 million residents

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether police nationwide may try to curb drunken driving by 
stopping motorists at sobriety checkpoints 
the justices said they will review michigan court rulings that 
struck down that states sobriety checkpoint program as an 
unconstitutional invasion of privacy 
courts in other states have upheld virtually identical 
checkpoint programs 
michigan state police first used sobriety checkpoints modeled 
after a program used in maryland in 1986 
at a checkpoint site police directed all traffic headed in one 
direction to a roadside area where officers checked motorists for 
signs of intoxication 
if there was no immediate evidence of intoxication the motorist 
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away the 
average delay was about 30 seconds 
if some signs of intoxication were detected a driver was 
directed to another area for further questioning and perhaps a 
breath test 
at one such checkpoint michigan state police troopers checked 
126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers for 
sobriety field tests one driver was arrested on drunkendriving 
charges 
the state police department was sued soon after the checkpoint 
program began the lawsuit alleged that the checkpoints violated 
the fourth amendments ban on unreasonable police searches and 
seizures 
a state judge and a state appeals court ruled that the 
checkpoint program was unconstitutional the appeals court cited 
the potential for an unreasonable subjective intrusion on 
individual liberty interests 
the michigan supreme court last feb 22 refused to review the 
lower court rulings 
in other action today the court 
agreed to decide whether public employers may be forced to put 
aside partisanship when hiring promoting and transferring workers 
the court said it will hear an appeal by two men and a woman who 
said their job status suffered because they didnt support the 
republican party in illinois 
let states file criminal charges against employers accused of 
neglecting the health and safety of workers 
the court without comment let stand a ruling in an illinois 
case that federal workplace regulations do not bar such state 
prosecutions 
agreed to consider increasing the federal governments power 
to keep some accused criminals behind bars while they await trial 
the court said it will review a ruling in a new mexico case that 
forces the government to free on bail some defendants deemed to 
be dangerous or a risk to flee before trial 
turned aside an appeal by three people convicted of 
trespassing for handing out antiabortion booklets to students 
outside a texas high school 
the court without comment let stand rulings that distribution 
of the prolife literature on school grounds was not protected 
by the constitutions freespeech guarantees 
turned away an appeal by an evangelical christian group 
ordered to return most of the 65 million donated by a wealthy 
exmember 
the court without comment let stand rulings that the group 
the bible speaks received the donations after exerting undue 
influence on department store heiress elizabeth dayton dovydenas 
the religious group now must return 55 million 
refused to revive an allegedly abused foster childs federal 
lawsuit against the social workers and government agency that 
placed him in his foster home 
the justices without comment let stand a federal appeals court 
ruling in a maryland case that no such right to sue exists 
turned away appeals by eight mafia figures from new york city 
convicted in the 1979 killings of crime chieftain carmine galante 
and two of his associates 
the court without comment let stand the federal racketeering 
convictions of family bosses anthony salerno anthony corallo and 
carmine persico highranking mobsters salvatore santoro 
christopher furnari and gennaro langella and mob members anthony 
indelicato and ralph scopo 
in the sobrietycheckpoint appeal acted on today michigan 
attorney general frank kelley referred to the grave and 
legitimate public interest in fighting drunken driving he asked 
the justices to resolve conflictig state court rulings 
kelley said michigans checkpoint program is valid even if it is 
not the most effective police procedure available or may carry the 
potential of generating fear and surprise in some motorists 
the state police departments appeal was supported in 
friendofthecourt briefs submitted by the michigan chapter of 
mothers against drunk driving the american alliance for rights and 
responsibilities and a group called remove intoxicated drivers 
lawyers for those who successfully challenged the checkpoint 
program urged the justices to reject the appeal 
they said the warrantless suspicionless siezure of a 
vehicle at a sobriety checkpoint could lead to drivers and 
passengers being required to get out and being subjected to 
patdown searches they said police officers may use such occasions 
to inspect a vehicles contents 
the supreme court in 1979 barred police from randomly stopping 
vehicles to check registration papers in that case officers had 
total discretion over which vehicles were stopped 
but the 1979 decision in a delaware case did not rule out spot 
checks in which an officers discretion was not so unconstrained 
questioning of all oncoming traffic at road blocktype stops is 
one possible alternative the decision said 
the case acted on today is michigan department of state police 
vs sitz 881897

paul manafort a republican consultant with 
ties to presidents bush and reagan told a house panel today he 
played by the rules in obtaining lucrative multimilliondollar 
federal housing subsidies 
manafort came under sharp and hostile questioning today in his 
second appearance before the house government operations 
subcommittee on employment and housing the panel that has been 
investigating influencepeddling and mismanagement at the 
department of housing and urban development 
manafort a former campaign adviser to bush and expresident 
reagan and a former business partner of republican national 
committee chairman lee atwater failed to recall all the hud 
projects he was involved in when he appeared before the same panel 
last june and later sent two letters recounting additional 
projects 
he told the subcommittee today that he and others at his 
lobbying firm black manafort stone and kelly had failed to 
fully check all of the firms records and had initially overlooked 
some projets but not had disclosed them all 
he underwent extensive quetioning about a new jersey housing 
project which he purchased with other partners after first 
obtaining commitments from hud for more than 31 million in 
renovation subsidies and tax credits 
rep tom lantos dcalif chairman of the panel pressed 
manafort for details of the deal and suggested that manafort and 
his partners enjoyed an inside line to hud officials and benefitted 
from hud specifications that were written to exclude other 
developers 
it was a tailormade award lantos said 
manafort however said his firm has worked within the 
existing system at hud 
we played by the rules manafort said i understand that 
the subcommittee views the process as fundamentally flawed i am 
not here to argue with the subcommittee about the process or to 
defend it 
lantos said subcommittee staffers inspected the seabrook housing 
project in upper deerfield nj last week and found conditions 
shocking and a slum he said one mother had no refrigerator 
in her apartment which rented with federal subsidies for 700 a 
month 
manafort said the project was still under renovation and 
asserted when we are finished with construction we believe the 
tenants will be happy 
also scheduled to testify were two employees of manaforts firm 
richard davis a veteran of the reagan white house and lawrence 
gay whom manafort said had met with deborah gore dean when she was 
executive assistant to thensecretary samuel r pierce jr 
also appearing was victor cruse a partner with manafort in the 
seabrook housing project in new jersey 
in previous testimony before the subcommittee some local 
officials have said they opposed the new jersey project which 
manafort won subsidies for 
its a very peculiar case of influencepeddling lantos said 
testifying in june manafort acknowledged that his work on that 
project amounted to influencepeddling 
manafort said his alexandria va lobbying firm of black 
manafort stone amp kelly did relatively little hud business but in 
following weeks the firms involvement with developers on projects 
in new jersey connecticut georgia and puerto rico came to light 
manafort said that basically was it said stuart weisberg 
the subcommittees staff director then we got two letters of 
clarification 
manaforts two letters to the panel following his initial 
appearance detailed more business and one of the letters came 
after a new york times report revealed a connecticut project he 
hadnt mentioned 
he missed so much that if it were a college exam he would 
have failed it weisberg said then 
pierce last week followed dean in refusing to testify before the 
house subcommittee citing his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination and charging he had been prejudged by the 
panel 
two other former hud officials deans predecessor as executive 
assistant lance wilson and former deputy secretary hunter cushing 
have also refused to testify before the subcommittee 
despite their refusal the subcommittee has not moved to offer 
immunity from prosecution to any witnesses as a way to break the 
impasse weisberg said the refusal just means more work for us 
and that the panel will use other witnesses to shed light on the 
activity of the hud higherups 
most panel members have stopped short of calling for a special 
prosecutor to be named to investigate pierce and are awaiting his 
second subpoenaed appearance in late october to see if he will 
change his mind 
i believe he has a moral obligation having served as 
secretary of an important federal agency to tell the american 
people about his activities lantos said i very much hope 
secretary pierce will testify

a group of illinois residents trying to halt 
operations at three nuclear power plants in the state lost their 
supreme court appeal today 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling by the federal 
nuclear regulatory commission that the residents concerns over 
safety are unfounded 
six people filed a petition with the commission in 1986 seeking 
the suspension of the operating licenses of three northern illinois 
plants zion lasalle and byron 
the petition voiced concern over the spread of radioactive 
material from the plants if a nuclear accident occurred it alleged 
that inadequate leakrate testing of containments at the three 
plants owned by commonwealth edison co had created an unsafe 
condition 
the commission denied the petition after the director of its 
office of nuclear reactor regulation determined there were no 
safety problems 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals ruled last feb 3 that it 
lacked the jurisdiction to secondguess the commissions action 
the appeal acted on today contended that the appeals court erred 
in that conclusion 
the residents who initiated the licensing challenge are jacob 
aronov eckhard festag david kraft susan michetti patricia 
schaffner and abe sklar 
the case is citizens of illinois vs nrc 881923

the supreme court begins its new term much 
where it left off last summer with the issue of abortion heading 
the list of closely watched cases 
after a threemonth recess the justices return to the bench 
today to begin deliberations in a variety of controversial legal 
and political disputes none is likely to be more divisive or a 
better bellwether of the courts conservative course than abortion 
the court will hear arguments in three abortion cases probably 
in december or january that will determine whether it will expand 
the new regulatory power it gave states last july 
harvard university law professor laurence tribe said the july 
ruling began in a very major way the dismantling of roe versus 
wade the courts 1973 ruling that established a right to 
abortion 
the court may never say roe versus wade is overruled but is 
likely to say roe versus wade never heard of it tribe 
said 
officials from minnesota and ohio are urging the justices to 
allow laws requiring young unmarried girls to get parental consent 
before having abortions in the third case illinois is seeking 
stricter control over clinics that perform the great majority of 
abortions 
the state officials are not asking the court to overturn roe vs 
wade which legalized abortions nationwide 
the bush administration which urged the court last term to 
reverse the 1973 ruling is taking a lower profile this time 
the justice department will not participate in oral arguments in 
any of the three cases although it is expected to submit a legal 
brief supporting minnesotas parental consent law 
the abortion debate in america was recast dramatically by the 
courts july 3 ruling in a missouri case cutting back abortion 
rights and letting states make abortions harder to obtain 
the court by a 54 vote said states may require doctors to 
administer tests for determining whether a fetus is capable of 
surviving outside the womb 
it also ruled that states may ban even privately paid abortions 
in public hospitals 
holding the balance of power in that case and perhaps for the 
future of abortion rights is sandra day oconnor the only female 
justice in the courts history 
in a separate concurring opinion in july she said the missouri 
regulations do not place an undue burden on a womans right to 
an abortion oconnor said she was not prepared to decide then 
whether the right established 16 years ago now should be discarded 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justices anthony m 
kennedy and byron r white are ready to overturn roe vs wade 
justice antonin scalia voted to do so 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and john paul stevens reaffirmed their support of the 1973 
holding 
the july ruling has made abortion a hotter issue for the state 
legislatures where rejuvenated womens rights activists and 
antiabortion forces are taking the battle 
but the supreme court remains an important arena for the fight 
in a freespeech case the court today turned aside an appeal by 
three people convicted of trespassing for handing out antiabortion 
booklets to students outside a texas high school 
the court without comment let stand rulings that distribution 
of the prolife literature on school grounds was not protected 
by the constitutions freespeech guarantees 
here is a look at the three abortion cases on the court docket 
this term 
the illinois case turnock vs ragsdale could be the most 
important the 7th us circuit court of appeals struck down 
regulations a trial judge said would force abortion clinics to 
become the functional equivalent of small hospitals 
the clinics where nearly all early abortions are performed 
would be required to provide elaborate medical equipment and 
services that the clinics say are unnecessary for patient safety 
the cost of an abortion could rise by nearly 50 
the case could have broad significance if the court decides to 
water down or scrap its trimester approach to abortion rights 
established by roe vs wade that ruling generally prohibits states 
from imposing health regulations that make abortions more expensive 
or difficult to obtain in the first three months of pregnancy 
in hodgson vs minnesota the court will review a system that 
requires both parents of an unmarried girl under 18 to receive 
notification from the doctor 48 hours before an abortion is 
performed alternatively the girl may bypass parental notification 
by convincing a judge she is mature enough to choose abortion for 
herself 
the system was in force for five years before a federal judge 
ruled it was unconstitutional but the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals reversed the judges ruling 
the second parental notification case ohio vs akron center 
for reproductive health raises similar issues an ohio law 
requires the physician to give notice in person or by telephone to 
one parent 24 hours prior to the abortion or by regular and 
certified mail 48 hours in advance 
alternatively a judge would have up to 22 days to decide 
whether to permit the minors abortion 
the ohio law passed in 1985 never took effect before it was 
struck down by a federal judge whose ruling was upheld by the 6th 
us circuit court of appeals 
the supreme court has allowed states to regulate abortions for 
unmarried minors more strictly than for adult women 
the justices in a decision announced two months before kennedy 
joined the court split 44 in 1987 over the validity of such 
regulation by illinois

the supreme court today refused to hear an 
appeal by nonunion pennsylvania state employees who oppose paying 
the equivalent of dues to a union that represents them in 
collective bargaining 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that the 
employees rights were not violated when they were forced to 
financially support the unions negotiating efforts 
the employees are challenging the deduction from their paychecks 
of what is known as agency fees the fees average 263 a year per 
worker and are paid in lieu of union dues 
the american federation of state county and municipal employees 
afsme is the collectivebargaining agent for pennsylvanias state 
employees union and nonunion members alike 
the union signed an agrement with state officials july 28 1988 
to deduct the agency fees from some 18000 nonunion employees 
beginning the following month 
fifteen nonunion employees sued in federal court to block the 
deductions they said the fees violate their constitutional rights 
because some of the money would be used to support causes and 
politicians they do not support including gov robert casey of 
pennsylvania 
after the suit was filed the union agreed to place the fees in 
an escrow account barring their use by the union until an 
arbitrator decides whether the union may use the money or refund it 
the nonunion members then sought a court order returning the 
money to them and barring the union from collecting any further 
deductions pending outcome of the case 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals denied the injunction last 
february ruling that the nonunion employees failed to show they 
will suffer irreparable harm if the fees continue to be placed in 
escrow 
the appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 supreme court 
decision that set guidelines for the use of agency fees in that 
ruling the justices allowed fee deductions from nonunion workers 
as long as the money is not used even temporarily to finance 
ideological activities unrelated to collective bargaining 
the 3rd circuit court rejected arguments by the nonunion 
pennsylvania employees that temporarily depriving them of the fees 
violates their freespeech rights even if the money is held in 
escrow 
the case is hohe vs casey 8951

key house members breaking a 10year 
congressional stalemate have tentatively agreed to a compromise on 
clean air legislation that would substantially reduce automobile 
pollution through 2003 congressional sources said today 
the agreement would require the nation to accept standards 
already approved for california the state with the worst smog 
pollution problem and the toughest emissions requirements 
the antismog requirements would remain in effect nationally 
until 2003 and could be tightened after that if a federal study 
showed more reductions were necessary the sources said 
signing on to the privately negotiated agreement were reps john 
d dingell dmich who has represented views of the auto 
industry and henry a waxman dcalif a strong backer of 
environmental groups 
waxmans demand for much tougher auto standards and dingells 
resistance has led to a stalemate that played a large role in 
blocking a new clean air bill for a decade 
the energy and commerce committee members who signed on to the 
agreement have pledged to honor the pact through the entire 
legislative process said the sources who spoke only on condition 
they not be named dingell is chairman of the full committee and 
waxman heads the environment subcommittee that currently is 
considering amendments to president bushs clean air bill 
the agreement will be written as an amendment to the auto 
pollution section of bushs legislation a section recently amended 
in subcommittee to eliminate averaging of pollution emissions and 
to require onboard canisters to capture gasoline vapors 
the agreement would require a study before 2003 by the 
environmental protection agency and congressional office of 
technology assessment to determine if more emissions reductions 
would be needed 
the epa administrator could decide to tighten the standards as a 
result of the study or leave them alone if he does nothing 
standards already proposed by waxman would automatically become 
effective 
the agreement also would include controls on toxic chemicals 
coming from automobiles the sources said 
california now requires nitrogen oxide emissions be limited to 
04 grams per mile up to 50000 miles beginning 1995 californias 
hydrocarbon limits to be written into federal law will be 025 
grams per mile for 50000 miles and 031 grams between 50000 and 
100000 miles 
the carbon monoxide standard is 34 grams for 50000 miles and 
42 grams between 50000 and 100000 miles 
current federal standards outside california are 041 grams per 
mile for hydrocarbons 1 gram for nitrogen oxides and 34 grams for 
carbon monoxide 
with waxman and dingell agreeing i dont see who can keep it 
out of the law one source said of the new standards 
chief senate clean air sponsors already have proposed tough 
emissions requirements but the amendment process has not yet 
started in that chamber 
those who negotiated the agreement besides dingell and waxman 
include rep norman f lent rny michael bilirakis rfla 
terry bruce dill ralph m hall dtexas mike synar dokla and

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether lawyers who win civil rights cases can collect a big chunk 
of their clients awards under an agreement made when the attorneys 
were hired 
the court said it will hear an appeal by a california man 
awarded 212 million and then ordered to pay 40 percent of the 
judgment to his lawyer 
the case stems from a federal lawsuit by juan francisco venegas 
against long beach police officers venegas was imprisoned for 2 
years for a murder conviction obtained with perjured evidence 
according to court records 
venegas hired michael mitchell to represent him in the suit and 
agreed to a pay the lawyer 40 percent of any award he won 
a federal court also awarded mitchell 75000 in legal fees an 
amount to be paid by the police officers 
mitchell and venegas parted ways in 1986 when the lawyer asked 
for another 10 percent of the judgment to represent him on appeal 
and venegas refused 
the lawyer then filed a court motion to place a lien on the 
judgment to recover his 40 percent contingent fee or 406000 
a federal judge gave mitchell a partial victory ruling he may 
be entitled to the contingent fee but leaving the matter to a state 
court to decide 
mitchell won a bigger victory before the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals 
the appeals court last april sent the case back to the federal 
judge to reconsider the lawyers bid to enforce a lien on the 212 
million award 
the appeals court also said that under federal civil rights law 
mitchell is not limited to courtawarded attorneys fees when a 
contingency fee agreement exists with a client 
federal law does not place a ceiling on an attorneys 
entitlement under a contingency fee agreement the appeals court 
said fairness requires that we respect the freedom of clients 
and attorneys to agree to a contingency fee in excess of any 
court award 
venegas also argued that mitchell misled him when they made the 
contingency fee agreement venegas said mitchell did not tell him 
about the benefits the lawyer was entitled to receive under federal 
civil rights law 
the case is venegas vs mitchell 881725

new technology is expected to boost crop 
yields sharply over the next few decades but an agriculture 
department study says soil erosion continues as a threat to the 
productivity of farmland over the long haul 
in its projections announced on sept 21 the usda said only 
around 220 million acres of cropland may be required by 2030 to 
meet us domestic and export needs compared with more than 380 
million acres used in 1982 the base year for the study 
the report is the second appraisal of the nations soil and 
water resources since congress ordered the periodic studies in the 
resource conservation act of 1977 
regardless of technological advances and higher annual crop 
yields the 280page report also says erosion from water runoff and 
wind are longterm threats to the lands productivity 
and it is difficult to measure erosion reduces yields when it 
is severe sometimes by up to 50 percent 
generally however only a very small amount of soil is moved 
in any given year the report said the resulting annual loss 
in productivity is so small that it is hidden by differences in the 
weather or in the management farmers apply from year to year 
in many soils it said crop yields may not appear to decrease 
at all even if erosion is excessive because the farmer has 
switched to improved higheryielding varieties of crops or is 
applying more fertilizer or controlling pests more effectively 
to help show what is involved in longterm soil erosion 
researchers devised computer models to simulate the effects of 
many years of erosion on many kinds of soil under various 
conditions and systems 
using 1982 management conditions and not allowing for technology 
improvements the computer program looked at what might happen to 
the nations 421 million acres of cropland after 100 years of 
sheet and rill erosion from water runoff and wind erosion 
overall according to the computer cropland productivity would 
be reduced by less than 3 percent a century from now 
the projected national percentage of loss is low because many 
soils are not losing any productivity under current farm 
management the report said 
in other words some of the nations soil is being naturally 
replaced as rapidly as it is being eroded but other soils erode at 
several times the tolerance value or replacement rate 
and on very fragile soils even slight erosion results in 
significant yield reductions the report said on some of these 
after a century productivity loss was projected to be quite high 
loss of productivity after 100 years is projected to be as 
high as 60 percent along the central california coast range and as 
high as 50 percent in the great valley of virginia the report 
said 
another point to keep in mind is that a century is a short 
time in the existence of a soil or a society the report said 
some soils in the eastern part of the nation have been cultivated 
for as much as 300 years 
even a 100year period can be misleading as an indicator of 
the longterm effects of erosion it said 
according to the computer study after 100 years it would take 
more than 6 million equivalent acres to replace the 
productivity lost as a result of erosion that is not the same as 
the amount of land damaged by water and wind 
rather equivalent acres are the number of additional acres 
that would be needed after 100 years of erosion to match current 
production levels assuming constant technology the report said 
the greatest number of equivalent acres would be needed in the 
corn belt where millions of acres used for growing feed grains are 
projected to sustain moderate losses in productivity 
iowa would require 617000 equivalent acres after 100 years to 
replace its productivity lost from water erosion 
others in the top 10 states in terms of projected losses 
include illinois 569000 acres missouri 413000 indiana 
389000 kentucky 358000 pennsylvania 333000 ohio 310000 
new york 261000 nebraska 246000 and california 235000 
much of the wind erosion would be concentrated in the great 
plains states texas was projected at 380000 acres after 100 
years colorado 128000 montana 108000 washington 76000 
idaho 66000 south dakota 50000 kansas 43000 nevada 
31000 nebraska 19000 and oklahoma 19000

can american wines really fin a home in 
france some experts think so and the agriculture department has 
some figures to back up the optimism 
last year says holly s higgins of the departments foreign 
agricultural service us wine sales to france totaled 12 
million although that is a tiny part of french imports totaling 
322 million in 1988 it still is up sharply from only 155000 in 
1985 
higgins until recently the us agricultural attache in paris 
says there is little doubt that french demand for wine remains 
strong per capita consumption is 75 liters annually compared with 
nine liters for americans approximately 80 percent of all wine 
consumed in france is red 
prospects for greater us sales in the french market are 
bright higgins writes in the october issue of the agencys 
agexporter magazine us exporters can expect the french market 
to expand in the future as us wines gain acceptance and find 
their niche in the marketplace

israel has asked the united states for 400 
million in housing loan guarantees for about 100000 soviet jews 
expected in the country now that washington has tightened its visa 
rules officials said today 
washington said today it would study the request the request 
was made by finance minister shimon peres who returned friday from 
a trip to washington ministry spokesman arieh greenblatt said 
it will cost an estimated 3 billion to educate house and 
employ the immigrants greenblatt said 
he said that about onethird of that total would be sought from 
the united states including 600 million in donations from 
american jews and 400 million through usguaranteed loans 
the guarantees would allow israel to borrow money from 
commercial banks at low interest us law limits loan guarantees 
to 25 million per country per year 
simcha dinitz chairman of the quasigovernment jewish agency 
which helps resettle refugees told israel radio today that about 
100000 soviet immigrants were expected over the next three to five 
years 
questions have been raised about whether israeli plans to settle 
some of the immigrants in the occupied west bank might interfere 
with middle east peace efforts 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
that while israels request for 400 million in loan guarantees 
was being studied the bush administration would reject any effort 
to help resettle immigrants in occupied territories 
our policy is we dont allow us aid to be use for 
resettlement in the west bank fitzwater said 
the spokesman said that bush discussed the situation in general 
terms with peres last week when the president was in new york to 
address the united nations 
the president emphasized his sympthay for that problem and 
committed to look into it but we havent discussed any 
specifics fitzwater said 
we do anticipate growing numbers of jewish immigrants wanting 
to settle in israel there may be costs associated with that 
fitzwater said 
but he added that while the united states would do would it 
could to help there was no way it was going to provide money to 
help israel settle immigrants in the west bank 
israel has occupied the west bank home to one million 
palestinians and 70000 jewish settlers since the 1967 middle 
east war 
israeli housing minister david levy recommended in june that new 
immigrants be put in west bank settlements 
but the us has repeatedly called on israel to stop settlement 
activity there a major issue in the arabisraeli conflict at 
least 575 palestinians and 40 israelis have died in the 
21monthold arab uprising in the west bank and gaza strip against 
israeli rule 
effective sunday the united states changed its visa rules to 
stem the flood of soviet immigrants washington said the embassy in 
moscow faces a backlog of 32000 applicants of the 10000 new 
applications in august 45 percent were jews 
in addition thousands of soviet jews who accepted israeli visas 
are waiting at other european sites in hopes of getting visas to 
america but israel has long pressed washington to encourage soviet 
jews to emigrate to israel instead of the united states 
moscowbased jewish activists say that many soviet jews seeking 
to emigrate to the united states may remain in the soviet union 
rather than leave for israel 
the american jewish committee estimates that more than 170000 
soviet jews immigrated to israel between 1965 and 1988 
the soviet jewish education and information center in jerusalem 
says that of the 18961 jews who emigrated from the soviet union 
last year 2173 came to israel in the first eight months this 
year 4175 of the 34610 soviet jewish emigres came to israel

construction spending posted its biggest 
advance this year in august the government said monday but the 
gain was in government and nonresidential building while the 
singlefamily housing industry continued to sag 
the commerce department said overall spending increased 18 
percent last month up 73 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 4218 billion the first gain since mays 14 percent 
advance 
analysts expect building construction to remain at the current 
level for the remainder of the year as the economy continues to 
grow at a modest pace 
all signals point to not too much change from recent trends 
economist mark obrinsky of the federal national mortgage 
association said i dont think were going to see a boom or a 
bust in either residential or nonresidential construction 
analysts have been looking for a slight pickup in construction 
spending ever since interest rates began falling earlier in the 
year fixedrate mortgage rates declined from a peak of 1122 
percent in march to 1022 at the end of august and to 1016 last 
week according to a survey by the federal home loan mortgage co 
the commerce department said the august advance was the biggest 
since a 23 percent increase last december and followed declines of 
06 percent in july and 08 percent in june the july figure had 
been revised downward from a miniscule 002 percent gain 
government building a volatile sector representing about 20 
percent of construction spending was up 53 percent in august led 
by a 42 percent rebound in highway building which had fallen 45 
percent in july 
thats a number which from time to time shows a big onemonth 
increase and quite often will come back to the previous trendlevel 
in the following months and i suspect well see that this time 
obrinsky said 
residential construction which accounts for nearly half of 
construction spending posted a tiny fractional increase of 005 
percent to an annual rate of 1989 billion but singlefamily 
construction fell 02 percent to an annual rate of 1131 billion 
while apartment building gained 04 percent to 235 billion 
obrinsky said he expects the pace of housing starts to improve 
in the fourth quarter but at a modest pace 
nonresidential construction was up 29 percent to an annual 
rate of 1003 billion led by advances of 45 percent in office 
buildings and 18 percent in factories 
total construction was up 34 percent from the level of building 
a year ago

prime minister toshiki kaifu pledged monday to 
press ahead with political reform and a review of a widely 
unpopular new sales tax in his first policy speech since taking 
office in august 
kaifu addressed parliament after the liberal democratic partys 
victory in a weekend election indicated the scandalridden partys 
fortunes are improving the restoration of trust in politics is 
this cabinets most important task he said i am thus 
determined to continue to make a goodfaith effort to move ahead on 
political reform 
on sunday kaifus party won a byelection to fill a vacancy in 
parliaments upper house after the death of a liberal democratic 
lawmaker 
as the first nationallevel election under the kaifu 
administration it was closely watched the opposition campaigned 
mainly on pledges to work for abolition of the 3 percent sales tax 
which took effect in april and contributed to the liberal 
democrats loss of its upper house majority for the first time in 
34 years in july elections 
kaifu said his party is reviewing the sales tax which it rammed 
through parliament late last year but he ruled out abolishing the 
levy 
the consumption tax is absolutely indispensable in light of 
the need to equalize the tax burden and to meet japans future 
needs he said 
its weekday schedule from 74 
flights a day to 48 said robert priddy air midwests chief 
executive officer 
air midwest which operates as braniff express at the kansas 
city airport said it would eliminate service between kansas city 
and seven midwestern cities joplin mo grand island neb sioux 
city iowa waterloo iowa moline ill peoria ill and 
madison wis 
robert c dynan vice president of braniff express operations 
said most of the passengers on the canceled routes connected with 
braniff flights meaning there now wasnt enough traffic to keep 
flying to those cities 
priddy said the reduced air midwest schedule which still would 
serve 19 cities could be maintained without feeding braniff 
flights 
he said the cuts would force some layoffs of air midwests 150 
employees at kansas city although he did not know how many 
its an awfully sad thing but i really dont have that much 
choice at this point priddy said 
braniff which is trying to reorganize as a smaller carrier 
said it would offer a total of 46 flights nationwide monday serving 
11 cities and 40 of those flights would start or end at kansas 
city 
the schedule is for two roundtrip flights each to 10 cities 
from kansas city chicago dallasfort worth los angeles newark 
nj new york citylaguardia orlando fla phoenix ariz san 
diego san francisco and washingtonnational 
another three roundtrip flights will run between orlando where 
braniff is based and other cities 
the schedule will use 12 boeing 727200s each of which can 
carry 169 passengers none of braniffs five new airbus a320 jets 
will be used 
a federal bankruptcy judge ruled last week that an irish 
financial service company could suspend its contract to supply 
braniff with additional a320s 
on sunday braniff operated only four departures from kansas 
city because traffic was so low in terminal a several lounges and 
snack bars were closed

appeared in newspapers nationwide and it wasnt the kind of 
publicity robinson welcomed 
i didnt want my friends to see it he said

found dead on the beach 
i was with him robinson said i left him for 20 minutes 
to bum a cigarette on the boardwalk 
police are investigating the death robinson said hall died of 
something like a heart attack or a brain seizure 
it wasnt from being drunk he said living that kind of 
life will kill you 
robinson said halls death inspired him to try to turn around 
his own life it made me a stronger person it gave me something 
to do for a cause he said 
robinson blames his problems on drugs he said he used cocaine 
for about a year during which he spent as much as 3000 a week 
much of it from a 70000 inheritance he said he quit in february 
1985 and went through several rehabilitation programs

suicide attempt in 1987 and robinson was sent to ancora 
psychiatric hospital in winslow township for 10 months he said 
he was released to an atlantic city halfway house in may 1988 
and moved out after getting a job as a security guard

camping excursion 
im glad i went through it in a way he said we had some 
good times hey look at my tan he said rolling up a shirt 
sleeve 
a week after the beach episode robinson moved in with a cousin 
joan burke and her husband raymond of bogota nj 
we gave him the one shot said burke a retired new york 
city transit police officer when he called us i took that as an 
indication that he wanted help eventually we hope hell be all 
right 
now that hes working again robinson said he would like to help 
the homeless he also is considering writing a book 
there are bums that want to be bums he said you cant 
help them people until they want to be helped but theres a lot of

hundreds of east germans poured 
into the west germany embassy today hoping to join 7000 others 
who fled west during the weekend east germany demanded that west 
germany expel the new arrivals 
east germany filed an official protest with west german 
chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff rudolf seiters demanding 
that bonn throw out those who have arrived since the dramatic 
exodus during the weekend 
east germanys official adn news agency said the nations 
permanent representative in bonn horst neubauer complained to 
seiters that west germany was reneging on an agreement by harboring 
the newcomers 
west german government urged east berlin to allow the second 
wave of east german refugees to also emigrate to the west west 
german officials have said there were no strings attached to the 
earlier transfer 
neubauer according to adn told seiters that it was east 
germanys decision to let the earlier group of refugees leave on 
humanitarian grounds because the embassy compounds had become 
unhealthy due to overcrowding 
neubauer accused west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher of falsely taking credit for the resolution of the refugee 
standoff 
despite roadblocks in the area and strict identity checks 
between 500 and 600 east germans have made their way inside the 
compound here refugees reported about 100 new refugees were at 
the embassy in warsaw 
czech police patrolled the area with dogs during the night and 
some refugees said police had resorted to violence to stem the flow 
of east germans one woman said police had dragged and kicked her 
family 
a diplomat from the mission hurried out to rescue one man who 
clung to the embassy fence as policemen tried to drag him away the 
diplomat put his arm around the east german and police allowed him 
to lead the man inside police then freed another refugee who had 
been handcuffed to a park bench nearby 
east german agreed to the refugee transfer on saturday and 
thousands of east germans from prague and warsaw departed on 
sunday as they left however hundreds of other east germans 
trying to get west convered on the embassies hoping they too would 
be granted safe passage to west germany 
east germany had harsh words for those who emigrated west during 
the weekend 
with their behavior they have trampled on moral values and 
excluded themselves from our society no one should cry any tears 
for them said a government statement issued late sunday by the 
state adn news agency 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we 
are pleased that these refugees are being allowed access to the 
west it looks like the officials there are taking a 
responsible approach in trying to help these people get to the 
west 
in midseptember east germanys communist leaders registered 
fierce protests when hungarys liberal leaders opened their border 
to the west and thousands of east germans fled 
the exodus through hungary continued overnight border 
authorities in bavaria reported 1051 new arrivals by early today 
in all about 2000 refugees fled through hungary during the 
weekend officials said 
west german government spokesmen disclosed that soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze played an important role in winning 
the refugees release from prague and warsaw during the weekend 
and said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has been in touch 
with bonn by telephone throughout the continuing refugee saga 
gorbachev is expected in east berlin to help commemorate 40 
years of communist rule in a country that has already lost more 
than 100000 people to the westward exodus this year 
the soviet comunist party daily pravda today devoted almost all 
of its fifth page to feting the east german anniversary and said 
not a word about the refugee exodus 
about 7000 east german refugees many weeping with joy pulled 
into west german train stations early sunday after east berlin 
agreed to let them emigrate 
some said they jumped aboard the freedom trains as they passed 
through east germany which agreed to the exodus on condition the 
refugees travel via their homeland that allowed east berlin to say 
the refugees were being expelled 
the latest arrivals in west germany follow more than 26000 east 
germans who have fled through hungary since sept 10 when budapest 
broke ranks with the rest of the east bloc and opened its border 
with austria 
the extraordinary accord permitting the latest refugees to go to 
the west followed discussions involving east and west germany 
czechoslovakia poland the united states the soviet union and 
france it underscored dramatic changes in the soviet bloc and 
growing divisions among its member states 
east germany under 77yearold leader erich honecker has been 
an outspoken opponent of the reforms advocated by gorbachev 
many of those arriving sunday aboard packed trains in the 
northern bavarian city of hof had tears streaming down their faces 
others cheered and clapped wildly 
we had no future there 34yearold uwe kuester of cottbus 
said of his communist homeland 
wellwishers handed out bottles of wine champagne and fruit as 
the newcomers disembarked 
west german law automatically grants east germans citizenship on 
arrival

a blind aspiring minister who for nine years 
has sought financial aid from washington state so he can attend 
bible college lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand the states refusal to 
subsidize vocational training for larry witters he argued that the 
refusal violates his religious freedom 
the justices in 1986 ruled unanimously that the states 
providing witters with financial aid would not violate the 
constitutionally required separation of church and state 
the 1986 decision overturned a washington supreme court ruling 
that had said giving witters money under a state 
vocationaltraining program for the blind would promote religion 
impermissibly 
witters case then returned to the state supreme court which 
last april 20 ruled by a 54 vote that letting witters receive 
the state funding would violate a state constitution ban 
a provision of washingtons constitution says no public money 
shall be appropriated for or applied to any religious 
instruction 
in the appeal acted on today witters argued that the state 
constitutions provision violates his religious freedom protected 
by the federal constitutions first amendment 
his case crystalizes the inherent tension between two first 
amendment clauses one banning official establishment of 
religion and one banning official interference with the free 
exercise of religion 
witters who is legally blind was first denied aid in 1980 as 
a result he was forced to drop out of the inland empire school of 
the bible in spokane and take a dishwashing job in a medical 
laboratory 
his appeal said washington had excluded witters from receiving 
the benefits of public welfare legislation because of his faith 
the appeal likened the states treatment of witters to an 
attempt by missouri to ban religious clubs from meeting on state 
college campuses and tennessees attempt to bar ministers from 
holding elective office 
the nations highest court struck down both of those state 
attempts as unconstitutional infringements of religious rights 
in urging the justices to reject witters appeal washington 
attorney general kenneth eikenberry argued the problem with what 
witters wants arises from the type of instruction which he wishes 
the state to fund not from his career goal or from the institution 
he wishes to attend 
eikenberry said witters would be eligible for state funding if 
he took nonreligious courses even at the bible school 
the case is witters vs washington department of services for 
the blind 8994

the texas supreme court ruled unanimously 
today that the states public school finance system is 
unconstitutional and gave lawmakers until may to come up with a 
solution 
the ninemember court however said it would not instruct the 
legislature what specific steps to take to correct the problem 
a state district judge had held the school finance system 
unconstitutional in a case brought by poor school districts many 
of them largely hispanic against the state education commissioner 
and others 
that ruling was overturned last december by a 21 vote of the 
austinbased 3rd court of appeals but the high court upheld the 
plaintiffs today on the grounds that the constitution required an 
efficient education system 
we hold that the states school financing system is neither 
financially efficient nor efficient in the sense of providing for 
a general diffusion of knowledge statewide justice oscar 
mauzys opinion said 
with an enrollment of 33 million texas has the secondlargest 
public school system in the country after california 
texas school districts with relatively low property values 
brought the suit in 1984 as in most states public schools in 
texas are funded largely through a combination of local property 
taxes and state aid similar financing systems have been challenged 
in court in at least 10 other states 
the case is known as edgewood vs kirby from the lead 
plaintiff edgewood independent school district in san antonio and 
lead defendant william f kirby commissioner of the texas 
education agency 
im still i think about 20000 feet over san antonio 
edgewood superintendent james vasquez said after learning of the 
ruling 
its the end of a fiveyear struggle for me personally but 
its the end of a 20year struggle for the school district he 
said 
kirby was out of town to give a speech and could not immediately 
be reached for comment 
in its ruling the court rejected arguments that reform in 
school finance will eliminate local control saying an efficient 
system does not mean an end to local control only that the funds 
available for education be distributed equitably and evenly 
mauzys opinion said because the court had decided that the 
finance system violated the constitutions efficiency requirement 
it need not consider petitioners other constitutional challenges 
such as the argument that the present system is discriminatory 
mauzys opinion said the court would give the legislature until 
may 1 1990 to come up with a remedy because the court wanted to 
avoid any sudden disruption in the educational processes 
let there be no misunderstanding the opinion said a 
remedy is long overdue the legislature must take immediate 
action 
the legislature meets in special session nov 14 there was no 
immediate response from gov bill clements on whether he would put 
school financing on the agenda in the wake of the courts decision 
in the legislatures regular session this spring lawmakers 
approved five education bills including a plan to pump 450 
million in extra state aid to help equalize funding and provide a 
pay raise for teachers 
but many of the poor districts complained the extra money was 
not nearly enough and many cities have been forced to raise 
property taxes to pay for statemandated education reforms 
in 1988 comptroller bob bullock found that 730 of the states 
1100 school districts spend less than the statewide average of 
3290 per student per year 
the average in those districts was 2976 in the wealthier 
districts the average yearly expenditure was 4268 
john t garcia state director of the league of united latin 
american citizens the hispanic civil rights organization called 
the decision long overdue and a very bold step for the supreme 
court 
texas is one of 11 states whose school financing systems have 
been challenged in court on the grounds of equity in june for 
example the kentucky supreme court ordered that states 
legislature to reorganize the states public education programs 
other states with active lawsuits or court orders concerning 
school finance are alaska connecticut indiana minnesota 
montana new jersey north dakota oregon and tennessee a 
coalition of poor alabama districts says it will probably sue that 
state this fall

thirtyone people died in the 
bloodiest 24hour period since the government declared a unilateral 
ceasefire last week military officials reported monday 
twentyfour people were murdered by sinhalese radicals six were 
killed by soldiers they had ambushed and a jailed sinhalese 
extremist committed suicide the officials said 
a soldier and a child were wounded in the ambush sunday at 
girikola village 25 miles south of colombo said the officials 
whose names cannot be used under briefing rules 
the deaths brought the total to 59 since the government 
proclaimed the ceasefire wednesday it originally was called for 
three days then extended until 6 am tuesday 
president ranasinghe premadasa instructed the military to halt 
operations against members of the peoples liberation front a 
sinhalese radical group but said they were allowed to defend 
themselves 
he declared the truce to give the radicals among the sinhalese 
sri lankas predominant ethnic group an opportunity to end their 
2yearold uprising and join peace talks at least 5000 people 
have been killed in the violence 
the peoples liberation front rejected negotiations and 
continued its campaign of killings and arson but the government 
said 869 extremists had surrendered during the ceasefire 
military officials said the 24 people killed by sinhalese 
radicals included two soldiers whose vehicle was blown up they 
said the other victims were police informants members of 
policemens families or supporters of the government 
at least 14 post offices 17 government buildings and three 
buses were burned the officials reported 
violence increased after premadasa took office in january after 
elections the extremists claimed were fraudulent 
they oppose the 1987 peace accord with ethnic tamil separatists 
and the presence of indian soldiers assigned to supervise the peace 
plan india has said it will withdraw its troops by dec 31 
about 11000 people have been killed in the tamil war which 
began in 1983 
tamils predominantly hindu make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people and claim discrimination by the sinhalese most 
of whom are buddhists 
india became involved because it is the regional power and has a 
tamil population of 60 million most live in tamil nadu state just 
across the palk strait from sri lanka

in a major policy reversal the opposition labor 
party dropped its oncecherished policy of unilateral nuclear 
disarmament 
at its annual conference the socialist movement voted to adopt 
a new platform that would commit a labor government to scrapping 
britains nuclear weapons only in a negotiated arms deal 
ditching the nonnuclear doctrine which had been a factor in 
labors successive defeats by conservative prime minister margaret 
thatcher since losing power in 1979 is part of a major policy 
overhaul 
antinuclear activists had accused the party of betraying its 
principles 
britain does not need nuclear weapons there is no soviet 
nuclear threat declared tony benn a former cabinet minister and 
veteran leftwing labor legislator during a sometimes impassioned 
debate 
the delegates voted by 36 million to 24 million for the new 
policy after moderate trade union leaders swung the huge votes of 
their entire memberships behind party leader neil kinnock 
votes are counted in millions at labor conferences because of 
the block vote system 
labor leader neil kinnock his party leading the conservatives 
in opinion polls for the past four months had secured support from 
most of the trade union leaders who control 90 percent of the 
voting power at the partys conferences 
polls published sunday showed labor between five and 12 
percentage points ahead of the conservatives 
under the new policy labor would retain britains 
submarinelaunched polaris nuclear missiles and also drop its 
previous pledge to shut down us nuclear bases 
the policy also calls for a laborled government to stick with 
mrs thatchers decision to replace polaris in the early 1990s with 
the far more powerful us trident missile system 
party moderates have long said the nonnuclear policy adopted 
in 1981 invited electoral defeat 
but 47yearold kinnock a committed unilateralist since his 
student days held out until after mrs thatcher won a third 
successive fiveyear term in 1987 
party leaders now argue that the strides in superpower arms 
control negotiations mean labor is dropping a redundant policy 
rather than betraying a cherished ideal

egyptian president hosni mubarak said today 
after a meeting with president bush that a golden opportunity 
exists for an eventual settlement of the conflict between israel 
and the palestinian arabs 
after meeting with bush for almost an hour mubarak told 
reporters the essential next step in the peace process is to 
convince the israelis and the palestinians to enter into a dialogue 
without preconditions 
asserting that he believes a comprehensive settlement is 
possible eventually mubarak said it would be a grave mistake to 
miss the golden opportunity existing today a continuation of the 
status quo is hazardous to both parties 
mubarak met with bush against a background of us efforts to 
persuade a reluctant israel to open discussions with palestinians 
based on proposals set forth by the egyptian leader 
us officials regard the 10point egyptian plan as a complement 
to the proposal by israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir for 
elections in which palestinians would select representatives to 
negotiate with israel on limited selfgovernment in the occupied 
territories 
after the oval office meeting mubarak was off to the state 
department for lunch with secretary of state james a baker iii 
mubarak addressed the un general assembly on friday and arrived 
in washington on sunday his visit is officially listed as private 
shortly before leaving for the state department baker 
reaffirmed to reporters his backing for mubaraks initiative 
calling it a way to get an israelipalestinian dialogue that would 
in turn pave the way for palestinian elections 
we wont get to peace until palestinians and israelis speak to 
each other baker said 
as photographers snapped pictures at the outset of the meeting 
bush was asking the egyptian leader did you get any squash in 
i didnt find time to i didnt find any place replied 
mubarak an avid squash player 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater today declined comment on 
an egyptian newspaper report that the bush administration had 
proposed a joint egyptianisraeli committee to pave the way for 
elections in the territories 
fitzwater said it would be inappropriate to comment on the 
al akhbar report we have discussed any number of ways to 
facilitate that kind of discussion but there have been no specific 
proposals he said 
a key element of mubaraks proposal is the convening of talks 
between israelis and palestinians in cairo but shamir said last 
week he is worried that the palestinians may be more interested in 
israels surrender than in a peaceful settlement 
shamir also objects to mubaraks suggestion that voting rights 
be extended to arabs living in east jerusalem and to palestinians 
who live outside the occupied territories 
shamir has rejected mubaraks suggestion that the outcome of any 
negotiations be selfdetermination for the palestinians 
the arabisraeli conflict was a dominant issue for baker during 
his talks last week at the un general assembly in new york 
baker holds the view that mubaraks plan and shamirs election 
proposal are not mutually exclusive and that shamir therefore 
should not use his objections as a basis for scuttling the peace 
process 
mubaraks proposal stops short of demanding the establishment of 
a palestinian state and it contains other features which have 
attracted favorable comment from israels labor party 
the plan has caused a deep split between labor and shamirs 
likud party threatening the governing coalition between the two 
that has existed for 10 months 
on sunday israeli soldiers shot and killed four palestinians in 
clashes in the occupied lands and arab activists stabbed to death a 
man they accused of collaborating with israel the army and arab 
hospitals said 
in the gaza strip moslem fundamentalists issued a new leaflet 
calling on palestinians to escalate their 21monthold uprising and 
to continue to kill collaborators

teachers in this financially 
strapped city went out on strike today after rejecting a salary 
offer that would have left many taking home less pay than last 
year a union official said 
union members were setting up pickets at all 36 schools in the 
district said terry turley president of the east st louis 
federation of teachers local 1220 
samuel morgan principal at east st louis senior high school 
said classes were canceled for the districts 16000 students most 
of the staff members at his school were picketing morgan said and 
members of other unions such as the custodians were honoring the 
picket lines 
the east st louis board of education had proposed binding 
arbitration to settle disputes over wage increases and insurance 
payments the district which has a 125 million debt is trying 
to get the teachers to pay a larger share of health insurance costs 
turley said union members met sunday and voted 347227 to reject 
binding arbitration effectively voting to strike in the 
fourthlargest school district in the state the 1200 teachers 
teachers aides clerks and attendance officers represented by the 
union had been working without a contract since school started aug 
28 turley said 
turley declined to disclose the terms of the boards final 
offer but said rising insurance costs would have offset pay 
increases for some teachers last year the teachers were under a 
wage freeze 
last week state superintendent of education c robert leininger 
said the district stands to lose 60 million in state funds for 
failing to implement an emergency debtreduction plan 
the plan called for firing 250 teachers shifting the cost of 
dependent health care coverage to employees and closing or 
consolidating four schools to save 11 million by the end of this 
year

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration for its views on broadening the power of states to 
sue in behalf of gas consumers allegedly overcharged by utility 
companies 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before acting on an appeal by kansas and missouri officials who 
have accused utilities of illegal pricefixing 
the justice departments response may take months 
the appeal was supported by 32 other states seeking to protect 
their consumers and vigorously enforce antitrust laws 
kansas and missouri officials sued the kansas power amp light co 
and utilicorp united inc over natural gas transported by pipeline 
from wyoming and used to generate electricity sold to customers in 
the two states 
some of the natural gas delivered from wyoming was sold to the 
utilities customers 
the states alleged that gasproducing companies conspired to 
inflate the price of the gas and that the utilities passed on the 
higher rates to consumers 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals ruled in january that the 
states do not have the authority to sue in behalf of residential 
customers 
the appeals court said that only direct purchasers of fixed 
amounts of gas may sue in such cases 
any allocation of illegal overcharges to the residential 
consumers may require tracing the sale from the wellhead through 
each level of distribution to establish the amount of illegal gas 
costs actually paid adding new dimensions of complexity to 
antitrust suits the appeals court said 
residential indirect purchasers of natural gas are not 
entitled to sue the alleged violators the appeals court said 
kansas and missouri officials said the ruling conflicts with 
that of the 7th us circuit court of appeals which permitted such 
suits the states urged the supreme court to resolve the conflict 
the 10th circuit court has jurisdiction over lawsuits in 
wyoming utah colorado new mexico kansas and oklahoma 
the states that supported the kansasmissouri appeal are alaska 
arkansas california colorado connecticut florida hawaii 
illinois indiana iowa kentucky louisiana maine maryland 
massachusetts minnesota nebraska nevada new hampshire new 
jersey north carolina ohio oregon pennsylvania south dakota

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether attorneys may withhold their state bar association dues if 
the association uses the money to campaign for various causes and 
issues 
the justices said they will hear arguments by 21 california 
lawyers who say their freespeech rights are being violated because 
they are forced to pay dues to the bar group in order to continue 
practicing law in the state 
the attorneys said the money is being used to promote numerous 
ideological causes including a nuclear weapons freeze and handgun 
control that they do not support 
the california supreme court ruled in february that the lawyers 
rights were not violated except if money is used by the bar 
association to help finance campaigns of candidates for public 
office 
we conclude that the state bar may use dues to finance any 
activity except election campaigning which is germane to its 
statutory mission to promote the improvement of the administration 
of justice the state court said 
the ruling conflicts with decisions by other state courts that 
limit the power of state bar associations to use members dues for 
ideological purposes 
the california court said the bar association with power to 
license and discipline lawyers is more like a state agency than a 
labor union 
the us supreme court has limited the power of unions to spend 
dues money for publicissue lobbying 
the california court noted that every lawyer in the state must 
be a member of the bar to practice law there 
also the state court said the bar association is run by a 
governing board that includes six of 22 members appointed by the 
governor with approval of the state senate 
the california constitution statutes and judicial decisions 
appear to envision the bar as a governmental agency the 
state court said 
therefore the state court continued the bar association may 
use its revenues for any purposes within its authority 
issues of public health safety and welfare fall within that 
category the state court said 
but the state court said the bar association went too far in 
1982 when it distributed material supporting justices of the state 
supreme court who were up for reelection 
the material permissibly supported the independence of the 
judiciary the state court said but its primary purpose we 
believe was to assist in the election campaign on behalf of the 
justices that exceeded the associations authority the state 
court added 
the case is keller vs state bar of california 881905

the fate of medicare catastrophic health care 
coverage for 33 million americans hangs in the balance as congress 
considers repealing the program to cool the blast furnace heat 
of angry senior citizens 
house speaker thomas s foley today chided the bush 
administration for its silence on the program which could be voted 
on this week and added im told the president opposes the 
repeal but i havent seen any evidence of it 
foley dwash supports a continuation of the program and said 
president bushs refusal to take a more vocal stand on the issue 
puts congress in an awkward position votes also may occur this 
week in the senate 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today our 
position basically is that we want to retain the benefits and 
mitigate the premium costs but the administration has not yet 
endorsed or rejected any of the major alternatives the house is 
expected to consider he added 
the programs defenders have launched a lastditch effort to 
save it by pushing a revision that would scrap major features of 
the program cancel the unpopular surtax that helps finance it and 
retain new prescription drug benefits scheduled to begin in january 
were on the heartlung machine trying to keep the program 
going said john rother legislative director of the american 
association for retired persons but its obvious that some major 
changes are going to have to be made 
the medicare catastrophic coverage act is aimed at providing 
protection for the elderly and disabled against financial ruin in 
the event of a prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs 
the plan limits the amount that beneficiaries must pay for 
hospital care physician services medical supplies and 
prescription drugs and expands other health care benefits as well 
for example the program pays for unlimited approved 
hospitalization after a onceayear deductible of 560 in 1989 
previously medicare charged a deductible for each hospital stay 
during a year and provided full payment of hospital bills for 59 
days a year 
the program was enacted with support from major senior citizen 
groups such as aarp but drew swift and strong criticism from many 
older americans who were angry at the costs for mandatory coverage 
that some said they neither wanted nor needed 
many elderly people said they already had duplicate coverage 
from private insurers and that the new program doesnt address 
their chief concern with the high cost of longterm care in nursing 
homes higherincome retirees also objected to paying a high 
proportion of the programs costs 
the focal point of the opposition is a surtax levied on the 40 
percent of retirees whose incomes are high enough that they pay 
more than 150 in income tax the surtax 15 percent of their 
income tax liabilities this year is capped at 800 per medicare 
enrollee but rises in future years 
a lot of people dont have that extra money in their 
budgets said alicia hasek a florida retiree who joined a 
grassroots group called seniors opposed to the surtax the best 
thing is to go back to point one and start over again 
the opposition has members of congress on the run literally 
democratic rep dan rostenkowski of illinois the 6foot4 chairman 
of the powerful house ways and means committee was booed and 
chased down a chicago street by a group of senior citizens last 
month after he refused to discuss the catastrophic package with 
them 
these people dont understand what the government is trying to 
do for them rostenkowski said as he hurried to outpace his 
critics 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater earlier this month said 
the protests had reached tidal wave proportions but that the 
bush administration still hopes to see the program preserved 
many proponents of the package maintain that most seniors 
support the catastrophic package and that it is a vocal and 
affluent minority making much of the noise 
eric shulman legislative director of the national council of 
senior citizens said that while the opposition has hit washington 
with blast furnace heat legislators and seniors will come to 
regret it if they repeal important health care benefits 
over time seniors would look back and say we really could 
have used that benefit he predicted 
house action on the catastrophic package is expected this week 
as the chamber works through an omnibus budget bill laden with a 
host of unrelated items legislators will have the chance to vote 
on proposals both to repeal and scale back the program 
as an alternative to repeal democratic house leaders are 
pushing a plan that would eliminate the surtax and strip out new 
hospital doctor and nursing home benefits the remaining benefits 
would be financed by keeping the existing flat fee of 4 a month 
paid by all but the poorest medicare beneficiaries 
left intact would be new prescription drug benefits and modest 
expansions of coverage for home health care hospice benefits and 
inhome respite care also kept would be a requirement that 
medicaid pay the medicare deductibles premiums and copayments for 
the poorest seniors 
sen john mccain rariz is pushing a plan that would scrap 
the surtax retain the new hospitalization benefits kill the drug 
benefit and remove the cap on doctor payments other senators are 
likely to push competing plans to repeal or revise the catastrophic 
program

medicare reform research to determine 
effective medical procedures and an emphasis on healthy living are 
needed to avert a health care crisis in america said a 
congressional staff report released monday 
the report by the democratic staff of the joint economic 
committee also said some form of national health insurance would 
ensure that everyone gets high quality affordable health care 
solving the problem posed by an estimated 37 million uninsured 
americans 
but the report said such a system may be a long way from 
becoming a reality because of political reasons and resistance by 
physicians 
the report compiles information gathered during nine days of 
hearings last year by the health subcommittee of the joint economic 
committee which advises congress on economic trends but does not 
initiate legislation 
at a news conference where the report was distributed rep 
james h scheuer dny chairman of the health subcommittee and 
joseph a califano jr former secretary of health education and 
welfare and the lead witness in the hearings said much could be 
saved by ridding waste from the health care system and directing 
the savings 
its not a situation where you have to spend more money 
said califano who served under former president carter lets 
wring the waste out of the system and use it 
americans spent more than 550 billion annually on health care 
but scheuer said this system is falling apart as costs for 
medical care soar 
though the report lists national health insurance as the top 
recommendation it said that given the political realities 
costsaving changes in the medicare system the federal health 
insurance program for the elderly would be more easily achieved 
in the short run 
the key change suggested by the report would reform the rates by 
which physicians are reimbursed lowering some and raising others 
to make the system fairer and less complex such a change was 
proposed in congress earlier this year 
the report also says standards of care must be developed based 
on research on the effectiveness of various tests and procedures 
the report said an estimated 20 percent of medical services 
costing 125 billion a year may be unnecessary this effort to 
reduce unneeded medical services is also being considered by 
congress 
also physicians should more actively promote healthier 
lifestyles through drug alcohol and nutrition counseling and 
screen for prevalent diseases so they can be caught in the early 
stages the report said

thousands of wouldbe emigrants lined up outside 
the us embassy for visa applications monday as new rules on 
emigration took effect but the embassy quickly ran out of new 
forms and turned away thouands of angry people 
consular officials distributed 30500 applications at a rate of 
100 per minute with a maximum of five allotted each person before 
running out in about 2 hours 
another 70000 application forms were expected to be delivered 
to the embassy by the end of the week an official said and 
300000 more shortly thereafter we hope to be out of the woods 
by friday said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
many soviets were angry at being turned away and are upset at 
the new regulations which require applicants to deal with 
washington rather than the embassy in moscow the changes were made 
because the moscow embassy was unable to handle the flood of 
applications 
it is a conspiracy between the us congress and soviet 
authorities said one woman who refused to give her name 
the united states embassy should be ashamed of the way they 
are treating us said another soviet who also refused to 
identify himself 
the united states has long urged the soviet union to liberalize 
its emigration policy but now that soviet rules have become more 
lax the united states has found it cannot accept all the soviets 
who wish to emigrate 
the new regulations that went into effect oct 1 spurred a surge 
in the number of people lining up at the embassy and more than 
15000 lined up over the weekend to be among the first to get new 
forms 
they organized themselves into groups of 100 with group leaders 
holding up signs so people could secure a place in line then leave 
and return later 
on monday morning traffic around the embassy on moscows busy 
garden ring road was snarled and the sidewalks around the embassy 
were jammed with people 
when the applications ran out people still were lined up 
between signs with numbers up to 11000 according to soviets at a 
shack set up to register for a place in line 17000 people had 
signed up over the weekend 
a reporter visiting the embassy was besieged by hundreds of 
people who though he was a consular official they demanded to know 
when they would get the applications and whether photocopies would 
be acceptable in washington 
several times during the day embassy officials waded into the 
crowd that had waited overnight to explain that new forms would be 
available wednesday and that photocopies would be acceptable 
hundreds of people have lined up outside the embassy every 
working day since soviet officials began liberalizing emigration 
policies last year and us officials have been swamped with 
paperwork 
under the new regulations applications will be sent directly to 
washington rather than evaluated by moscow consular officials 
an official said last week that the embassy is likely to receive 
300000 applications in the next year but will be able to accept 
only about 7000080000 
following ceilings set in washington the united states will 
accept 50000 soviets classified as refugees and another 
2000030000 on a socalled parole system that does not guarantee 
any government support 
the new system also gives priority to people with close 
relatives already in the united states and to those who belong to 
groups that the united states considers to be persecuted in the 
soviet union

associated press military writer 
vice adm joseph s donnell iii the commander of the atlantic 
fleets naval surface force is in the mediterranean conducting a 
disciplinary inquiry for officers of the uss iowa pentagon sources 
said today 
the admiral is conducting a flag mast a nonjudicial form 
of inquiry to determine whether the captain and several other 
officers should be punished for infractions in navy procedure found 
after the april 19 explosion that claimed 47 sailors lives said 
the source who spoke on condition of not being identified by name 
commanders are responsible for good order and discipline in 
their commands 
in its lengthy study of the blast the navy determined that the 
explosion in the battleships no 2 gun turret most likely was 
caused by gunners mate clayton hartwig 
but the investigation conducted by rear adm richard milligan 
also found numerous lax procedures aboard the iowa including 
unauthorized experimentation with extrastrength gunpowder and 
projectile loads 
milligan also found that the officers had failed to qualify 
enough sailors for their specific duties in the gun turret and that 
many safety procedures had been circumvented 
the admirals investigation determined however that neither 
the experiments nor the procedural lapses had caused the explosion 
instead milligan said hartwig probably sparked the fireball by 
inserting a type of detonator between two power bags 
in his section of the report milligan also recommended that the 
captain fred moosally and four other highranking men aboard the 
ship be relieved of their duties and that appropriate disciplinary 
action be taken against them 
milligans recommendation however was softened by his 
superiors they recommended that the men receive the nonjudicial 
punishment meted out through the mast procedure 
the admiral could for example suspend the officers from duty 
for not more than 30 days in addition to issuing a reprimand other 
possible disciplinary action might include pay cuts or other 
restrictions

like many a construction project the 31mile rail 
link being built beneath the english channel is going to cost a lot 
more than planned and might not be finished on time 
the cost of the project estimated in 1987 at 78 billion has 
grown 44 percent and now is 113 billion builders said monday 
project contractors blame the cost increase on inflation 
construction problems and higher costs for rail cars 
the news sent shares of eurotunnel plc the anglofrench 
consortium building the link betwen england and france slumping 72 
cents to 1047 in trading on londons stock exchange shares were 
trading at about 1610 in late july when eurotunnel first 
indicated it would need more money 
eurotunnel initially arranged 81 billion in loans and raised 
161 billion by selling stock in the project now it needs to 
raise at least 161 billion more said eurotunnel cochairman 
alastair morton 
the consortium said it would seek to raise the extra funds next 
year or in 1991 75 percent from its banks and the remainder 
perhaps by selling additional shares to current shareholders 
in addition to denting investor confidence the announcement 
fueled fears that the builders might be unable to complete the 
tunnel without government aid and that the higher costs would lead 
to higher fares 
prime minister margaret thatcher supports the project but has 
maintained that no public funds would go toward it 
added to the financial problems are concerns about when the link 
will be completed technical advisers to the banks funding the 
project say it might be 5 months late on dec 31 1993 
eurotunnel insists it will be completed by its mid1993 deadline 
workers on both sides of the channel began drilling toward each 
other in mid1987 one tunnel the service tunnel is more than 
halffinished but much work remains on the other two which will 
carry trains in opposite directions 
the trains are to allow passengers cars and freight to travel 
between london and paris in three hours

there are just so many ways that you can sell 
dog food but ralston purina has found another one 
in a fullpage ad in mondays new york times the st 
louisbased purveyor of puppy chow claimed that if more dogs in 
new york ate purina hi pro it would seem like there were less dogs 
in new york 
under that headline there is a large picture of a disgusted 
businessman standing on one foot while examining the bottom of his 
left shoe 
he is not looking for gum on his heel 
hi pros high digestibility means smaller firmer stools 
the ad advises the more nutrients a dog digests the less passes 
through his system and onto our sidewalks 
this is not what a times reader expects with breakfast a call 
to ralston purina was referred to company spokesman patrick 
farrell he said he needed to do some research before he could talk 
about the ad 
ill get all the scoop and the dirt on it and ill call you 
right back he said 
when he called back he was a font of dog food information 
when you well not you but when your dog eats his system 
absorbs the nutrients and the rest passes through i dont know of 
any polite way to discuss this 
normal dog foods have a digestibility rating of 70 percent 
meaning 70 percent is absorbed and the rest passes through hi 
pros rating is 82 percent so less is coming out the other 
end farrell said 
ralston purina did no extensive field testing on new york 
streets before plunging ahead with its ad campaign which consists 
of the ad in the times and upcoming placards on telephone kiosks 
around the city 
hipro itself is not a new product the company has been selling 
it for more than a decade 
we dont think for a moment that we have the solution to the 
oops i stepped in it problem in new york the ad says but 
perhaps we can help a little by making the pickups a little 
quicker and easier for dog owners and even when the scofflaws 
wont pick up the mess wont be quite as messy 
farrell said new york is the only city slated for the ad 
campaign very few cities have that same urban lifestyle he 
said 
no television ads are planned it would be difficult wouldnt 
it he suggested 
he said the company did not expect any uh flak from readers 
who might be offended by the ad and its depiction of an unfortunate 
pedestrian 
theres actually nothing on the bottom of his shoe is 
there he said

the supreme court said monday it will use the 
famous alfred hitchcock thriller rear window to decide a 
copyright dispute in which millions of dollars and possibly the 
future of some movie classics are at stake 
the justices said they will hear arguments on behalf of actor 
jimmy stewart hitchcocks heirs and others seeking to prevent a 
literary agent from sharing in profits from the motion pictures 
rerelease 
the agent sheldon abend in 1971 purchased a copyright to the 
short story on which rear window was based abend paid 650 to 
chase manhattan bank for the copyright 
he filed a federal lawsuit seeking a share of the more than 12 
million in revenue that rear window has generated since 1983 
when the 1954 movie was released once again in theaters and for the 
first time on video casettes and over cable television 
rear window is based on a short story it had to be 
murder that was first published in february 1942 in dime 
detective magazine 
the copyright was owned by the storys author cornell woolrich 
who sold the separate motion picture rights in 1945 for 9250 
rear window starring stewart and grace kelly and directed 
by hitchcock had many elements not contained in the original short 
story 
woolrich died in 1968 without any surviving spouse or children 
and left his property to a trust administered by chase manhattan 
abend said in his suit that his copyright was infringed by the 
rerelease of rear window 
he also said the film distributors including stewart and 
hitchcocks heirs interfered with his plans to contract with home 
box office for a new play and tv version of the story 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals based in san francisco 
ruled in abends favor last december ordering a lower court to 
hear his suit for damages the appeals court noted that its ruling 
is in conflict with a 1977 decision by the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals based in new york city 
the appeals court noted that before 1976 federal law permitted a 
copyright to be renewed for 28 years after the initial 28year 
copyright period ended 
the law was amended in 1976 to provide for copyright protection 
for the life of the author plus 50 years but only to works 
copyrighted after jan 1 1978 
in abends case the appeals court said he is entitled to 
copyright renewal protection even though woolrich died before the 
copyright was renewed 
the appeals court acknowledged that the success of rear 
window was due to the collaborative efforts of many talented 
individuals other than cornell woolrich 
nonetheless the appeals court said woolrichs contribution was 
significant and abend still must be allowed to seek damages for 
copyright infringement 
but the court barred abend from blocking distribution of rear 
window such an injunction could deny the public the 
opportunity to view a classic film for many years to come the 
appeals court said 
some of the nations leading motion picture producing companies 
are supporting the appeal by stewart and hitchcocks heirs 
they said that thousands of films based on books plays and 
short stories might have to be withdrawn from distribution if the 
9th circuit court ruling stands 
the case is stewart vs abend 882102

anglican leader robert runcie and pope john 
paul ii signed a document monday committing their churches to 
eventually heal their 450yearold split but recognizing they still 
had a long way to go 
runcies first official visit to the vatican yielded few other 
visible signs of progress in relations between the worlds two 
largest groups of christians 
however runcie said he had built trust with vatican officials 
during four days of talks and that their commitment to seeking 
unity was no mere academic exercise 
the way in which the conversations we have had together bear 
fruit will come about gradually he told a news conference 
among major points separating the churches is the doctrine of 
papal infallibility which applies to roman catholic beliefs such 
as the immaculate conception of the virgin mary and her assumption 
to heaven after death 
runcie is the fourth archbishop of canterbury to visit the 
vatican since the late geoffrey fisher did so in 1960 ending four 
centuries of estrangement that began when king henry viii formed 
his own church after the pope refused to grant him an annulment of 
his marriage 
talks have been under way since 1966 on a theological framework 
for unifying the worlds 850 million roman catholics and 70 million 
anglicans 
the document signed monday said we here solemnly recommit 
ourselves and those we represent to the restoration of visible 
unity and full ecclesial communion 
but it noted the ordination of women in some of the anglican 
communions 27 selfgoverning provinces such as the us episcopal 
church prevents reconciliation between us even where there is 
otherwise progress toward agreement 
nonetheless cardinal johannes willebrands president of the 
vaticans council for promoting christian unity said obstacles 
are there to be considered and overcome 
runcie the head of the state church of england repeatedly 
emphasized one of the advances in anglicancatholic talks an 
anglican proposal to grant the pope a universal primacy over 
anglicans 
other advances in recent years have included a draft agreement 
on how peoples souls are saved 
but many practical barriers to unity remain including 
differences on the catholic ban on artificial birth control some 
anglican churches acceptance of abortion and divorce the role of 
lay people in the church and the anglican practice of allowing 
married priests 
still anglicancatholic talks are considered among the most 
promising interfaith discussions in which the vatican is involved 
and anglican officials say they expect some kind of unity in the 
21st century 
while both sides described the anglicancatholic meetings as 
extremely friendly runcies speeches expressed more eagerness 
about unification than the popes 
willebrands indicated the hesitancy of some vatican officials 
when he discussed a delay in the churchs response to a 7yearold 
anglicancatholic report on possible theological agreements 
we have often to consider in the church at large problems 
of internal struggles or differences of opinion etcetera and it 
is rather new to consider officially ecumenical documents he 
said 
runcie left the vatican meetings with the promise catholic 
officials would respond soon to the 1982 report by the theological 
commission 
that report included agreements on the eucharist and priesthood 
and said anglicans could recognize the pope as a universal primate 
but with somewhat reduced powers 
runcies appeals for a leadership role for the pope drew fire 
from the rev ian paisley a northern ireland protestant leader and 
antipope activist who charged at an impromptu news conference 
that runcie was trying to dethrone the queen and enthrone the 
pope in england 
but runcie said he envisioned a spiritual rather than political 
role for the pope aimed at helping churches to promote religious 
practice

police arrested an opposition leader and 
eight supporters who were touring remote provinces urging people to 
join a boycott of the militarycontrolled government a fellow 
opposition politician said 
ricardo arias calderon a former candidate for vice president 
was arrested with the others on sunday in veraguas province 180 
miles west of panama city according to guillermo cochez a fellow 
christian democraty party leader 
the panamanian defense forces announced in a statement that the 
opposition figures were freed today their released could not be 
confirmed 
the statement came shortly after the christian democratic party 
said that arias calderon would go on a hunger strike 
the opposition has engaged in a campaign of urging people to 
delay paying taxis and utility bills as a way of increasing 
economic pressure on the government led by military strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
the opposition also advocates a boycott of the lottery and 
gambling casinos which the government controls along with most of 
the countrys utilities 
the civic democratic opposition alliance which includes the 
christian democrats identified the other eight as party activists 
ivan romero his wife mabel jose a sossa and his wife gina 
carlos mantovani luis eduardo camacho temistocles de obaldia and 
ramon lima 
arias calderon was one of two opposition vice presidential 
candidates in may 7 national elections on a ticket led by guillermo 
endara who was in the 13th day of a hunger strike today as part of 
the antinoriega campaign 
the government annulled the may 7 election when returns showed 
the opposition winning by a landslide 
in a statement sunday endara called arias calderons arrest 
another symptom of despair by the dictatorship of gen manuel 
antonio noriega to repress the last vestiges of freedom and 
democracy that remain in panama 
the government which depends heavily on revenues from the 
lottery and casinos has been short of funds since the united 
states imposed trade and other economic sanctions on panama soon 
after federal courts in florida indicted noriega on 
drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges in 1988 
endara arias calderon and his other running mate guillermo 
ford want noriega to respect the results of the may elections 
the united states refuses to recognize the noriegadominated 
government and considers endara and his running mates panamas 
legitimate leaders 
noriega named his longtime friend francisco rodriguez as 
provisional president on sept 1 the day endara was to have been 
sworn in

a state legislator who spent the last four 
months in jail for drunken driving resigned monday amid pressure 
from his colleagues including threats by house republicans to try 
to expel him 
state rep dennis dutko an eightterm lawmaker from warren is 
an acknowledged alcoholic with a history of drunken driving 
incidents dating to 1973 during his time in jail he has donated 
his 42670 salary to drug and alcohol treatment programs 
lawmakers had become increasingly concerned about the effect of 
dutkos jailing on the legislatures integrity but they were 
reluctant to expel someone who was convicted of a misdemeanor 
rather than a felony because it would be setting a precedent 
the resignation came after last weeks hint by house minority 
leader paul hillegonds that he would call for an expulsion vote or 
at least censure if the situation didnt change 
dutko twice said hed resign but backed down both times he was 
awaiting results of a floundering recall effort and his aides said 
he still gets letters from constituents who dont think he should 
step down 
i am sure that many people will criticize me for not stepping 
down sooner but in all honesty i could not walk away from the 
job and the people i love without a fight dutko said in his 
resignation letter 
he was jailed may 24 serving sixmonth and oneyear sentences 
concurrently his scheduled release counting time off for good 
behavior is jan 3

renovation of an officers club at the largest 
us air force base in europe cost nearly three times the original 
pricetag of 45 million according to a defense department report 
released monday 
the house armed services committee had requested the review 
citing reports of construction and funding abuses 
work on the club at ramstein air base in west germany totaled 
128 million due to the use of incomplete and misleading data 
design changes that had to be made after construction began and 
structural problems with the building the report said 
in fact the facility was so structurally unsound contractors 
were forced to raze all of the building except for the kitchen and 
several small walls said the review conducted by the defense 
departments inspector general 
we had an officers club that began as a volkswagon and ended 
as a mack truck rolling over anyone who got in its way said rep 
marvin leath dtexas a member of the armed services subcommittee 
on readiness 
the report found that the original cost proposals for 
construction of the club were based on inaccurate information 
after the work began 130 design changes were made at a cost of 
about 16 million 
in addition the review found that management had not operated 
the club system efficiently effectively or profitably from fiscal 
1984 to fiscal 1987 
leath who released the report said enlisted officers at the 
base saw their financially sound clubs go into the hole several 
million dollars these operations lost 10000 a day as management 
was diverted to throw lavish parties for thousands of people 
this report reads like a base operations horror story said 
rep david ob martin rny another member of the subcommittee 
the air force in comments included in the report said the 
service has begun followup audits and the office of special 
investigation is looking into whether civil or criminal charges are 
warranted

lebanese legislators meeting here 
monday put aside the problem of syrias military presence in 
lebanon to discuss ways to disarm unruly militiamen and draft a 
national charter to end the countrys civil war 
new tensions surfaced however over a surprise visit to iran by 
two key moslem militia chieftains druse warlord walid jumblatt and 
his shiite moslem civil war ally nabih berri 
most of the 63 parliamentarians meeting here 33 christians and 
30 moslems interpreted the trip as an iranian attempt to 
undermine the conference under way since saturday conference 
sources said 
berri heads the shiite moslem amal militia and jumblatt commands 
the progressive socialist party together the two factions 
comprise about 12000 fighters 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia quoted berri as saying we 
are vehemently opposed to the plan submitted by the tripartite arab 
committee to solve the crisis in lebanon 
the committee composed of saudi arabia morocco and algeria 
has proposed a peace plan that includes a series of political 
reforms designed to end the christian domination of government 
parliament the army and the judiciary in lebanon 
the conference sources said the parliamentarians on monday were 
going over the proposed national reconciliation charter point by 
point 
the charter would serve as an alternative to an unwritten 
national covenant reached among the various sects in 1943 when 
lebanon gained independence from france 
this plan does not conform with the wishes and aspirations of 
the moslems this plan will result in the division of 
lebanon berri said 
berri and jumblatt are syrias main allies their support and 
that of their rival lebanese forces coalition of christian militias 
is essential for implementing any agreement that may be reached in 
taif 
despite political problems a ceasefire called by the arab 
mediators sept 22 to end six months of fierce artillery battles 
between the syrians and christians was holding 
the christians demand that a timetable for the withdrawal of 
the syrian army from lebanon be workd out before political reforms 
hampered progress during saturday and sunday 
but saudi arabias foreign minister prince saud alfaisal 
steered the deputies away from arguments persuading them to 
discuss instead the proposed political reforms 
faisal is sitting in on the parliament debates along with his 
moroccan and algerian counterparts abdellatif alfilali and 
bouallam belsayeh 
the deputies also discussed how to disarm militia factions whose 
military strength has eroded government authority 
the sources said several suggestions were being examined for 
disbanding the militias including attaching some of them to 
various military corps 
they said most deputies appeared to favor a timetable phasing 
syrian withdrawal from moslem sectors of beirut to the bekaa valley 
in east lebanon over two years while the countrys constitutional 
structure virtually dismantled by the war is rebuilt 
but most of the christian deputies backed by some moslems 
allied with iraq syrias rival in the arab world demanded an 
immediate syrian withdrawal 
the syrian army has 40000 troops in lebanon controlling 70 
percent of the country 
the troops entered lebanon in 1976 a year after the civil war 
broke out under an arab league peacekeeping mandate 
christian leader gen michel aoun who is backed by iraq says 
the syrians abrogated their peacekeeping mandate by openly siding 
with the moslems

president mikhail s gorbachev urged the 
legislature on monday to impose a 15month ban on strikes that he 
says are wrecking the soviet economy and threatening development 
gorbachev spoke at the end of a stormy twohour legislative 
debate on a proposal of emergency economic measures put forward by 
first deputy premier lev voronin the tass news agency said 
gorbachev urged legislators to discuss the strike ban overnight 
and be ready to vote on it tuesday 
he referred to the possible ban on strikes as a necessary 
measure which are called for to protect democratization from 
anarchy and irresponsible management 
plans for future economic development are under threat 
because of the strikes he said 
emergency measures to bolster the rapidly faltering economy 
overshadowed premier nikolai i ryzhkovs lengthy presentation of a 
package of legislation covering the governments longterm 
proposals on property ownership and use of land and taxes 
voronin told the legislature the soviet economy had lost 615 
billion in july and august alone due to strikes and that supplies 
of fuel are low enough that the country might be unable to supply 
enough heat to see soviet citizens through the winter 
the most damaging of a series of strikes to hit the soviet union 
this year was a walkout in july by thousands of coal miners in the 
far north siberia and the don basin of the eastern ukraine 
that strike alone cost the country millions of rubles and the 
government agreed to a package of economic and social improvements 
that officials say will cost about 3 billion 
strikes also have become a way of expressing ethnic discontent 
such actions have idled the nagornokarabakh region the center of 
a dispute between the neighboring caucasus republics of armenia and 
azerbaijan 
in moldavia and estonia russian and other workers walked off 
jobs at factories and offices during the summer to protest laws 
that they said favored the majority moldavians and estonians 
after legislators expressed contradictory viewpoints during a 
debate gorbachev proposed they return tuesday to vote on the 
strike ban and an overwhelming majority agreed tass said 
the package of government proposals also calls for imposing a 
special form of administration on railroads in armenia and 
azerbaijan with the ministries of railroads defense and interior 
responsible for protecting the railroads and their workers 
armenian activists say azerbaijani railroad workers recently 
have blocked the trains that armenia depends upon for 80 percent of 
the goods brought in from other parts of the soviet union 
food stores have been emptied of many basic goods and there is 
no fuel even for vehicles such as ambulances 
gorbachev said when the supreme soviet opened its fall session 
sept 25 that decisive steps would have to be taken if rails to 
armenia were not cleared 
ryzhkov and radical deputies both named the law on property as 
the most important of five key economic reforms presented to the 
legislature but they disagreed on what it should say 
ryzhkov said the central government must learn to refrain from 
interfering in local economic affairs including its tendency to 
claim all forms of property for itself 
as long as about 90 percent of the basic means of production 
belong in the framework of one owner the government all talk 
about developing a market will remain empty words and progress is 
impossible he said 
but progressive deputy anatoly sobchak of leningrad said the 
governments proposal still started from the point of view that the 
state had priority of ownership and individuals were last 
he said it should be just the opposite 
ryzhkov said the government saw no reason to allow private 
ownership of land but supported expanded rights for farmers who 
lease land on longterm contracts from collective and state farms

afternoon newspaper for 110 years will publish its final edition 
nov 30 the newspapers publisher said monday 
frank daniels jr president of the news and observer publishing 
co said an internal task force had recommended closing the 
raleigh times as part of a plan to expand and improve the news and 
observer raleighs morning newspaper 
the recommendation to cease publication of the raleigh times 
was one that was accepted reluctantly but it was not unexpected 
daniels said for several years we have watched as afternoon 
dailies in metropolitan areas closed we cannot make the 
improvements the news and observer needs and still publish a 
quality afternoon newspaper 
in recent years afternoon newspapers in winstonsalem 
greensboro and charlotte also have ceased publication 
daniels said no employee layoffs are expected the news staffs

soviet authorities have formed an independent 
commission to monitor psychiatric abuses an embassy spokesman 
testified monday but us experts said the reform was not adequate 
to readmit the soviets to the world psychiatric association 
seeking to bolster the kremlin case georgi markosov of the 
soviet embassy appeared before a house panel to detail reforms his 
government has taken to correct psychiatric abuses against 
political and religious prisoners 
the soviet allunion scientific society of psychiatrists 
is doing its utmost to implement and translate into reality the 
needed reforms in the field of medical care and psychiatric 
health said markosov reading a statement prepared by the soviet 
society for the hearing 
to prevent the use of psychiatry for nonmedical purposes as 
well as to assure maximum openness in specific cases of misuse of 
psychiatry an independent commission has been established which 
is composed of eight persons the commission is independent from 
the health ministry or any communist party or state organs 
markosov said 
before this year it was rare for soviet officials to testify 
before congress but since january about a half dozen have done so 
markosov also listed other reforms including 
new regulations that led to dropping 736000 people from 
socalled psychiatric registration lists us experts said the 
lists contained 102 million names and were used for job screening 
new rules that bar forcible commitment to a psychiatric 
institution without the consent of patients or their relatives 
unless the patient poses a physical danger psychiatrists who 
wrongly hospitalize mentally healthy persons may be sentenced to a 
twoyear prison term 
abolition in the russian federation the largest of the 15 
soviet republics of two laws often used against dissidents 
a ban on the use of sulphazine a drug made of pulverized 
sulphur that has been injected into political dissidents causing 
extreme pain fever and disorientation western experts say it has 
no medical value 
most of the steps had been publicized previously but the 
existence of the commission was not known in the west said another 
witness peter reddaway a george washington university professor 
who has written two books on soviet psychiatric abuses and was a 
member of a us delegation that visited soviet psychiatric 
institutions this year 
it remains to be seen whether it is indeed vigorous and 
independent said reddaway 
the american psychiatric association which supported the work 
of the us delegation has voted to oppose readmission of the 
soviet group to the world body which is scheduled to meet in 
athens greece oct 1116 
it is my sincere hope as well as the hope of the american 
psychiatric association that there will be a time in the near 
future when we can wholeheartedly welcome the allunion society of 
psychiatrists and narcologists of the ussr into the world 
psychiatric assocation testified ellen mercer head of 
international programs for the us organization 
it is also our concern that unfortunately this time has not 
yet arrived said mercer 
soviet health officials who in the past sent dissidents to 
psychiatric institutions remain in senior government posts said 
reddaway and they could resume their abuses if there is a 
conservative reaction along the lines of the crackdown in china 
this summer 
the officials he mentioned were yevgeny chazov the health 
minister nikolai zharikov last year appointed the head of the 
soviet society of psychiatrists and narcologists georgy morozov 
who for decades has headed the serbsky institute where many 
political dissidents have been held in psychiatric care alexander 
churkin chief psychiatrist of the ministry of health and marat 
vartanyan 
these conservatives said reddaway have a well justified fear 
that if there is a genuine reform in soviet psychiatry they will 
be swept out of office 
senior soviet psychiatric authorities want to be readmitted to 
the world psychiatric association said reddaway but the 
reformers within soviet psychology are opposed to it 
denying the soviets readmission to the world body said 
reddaway would delay genuine reform of soviet psychiatry 
soviet psychiatric abuses have been publicized for years by 
western experts some of whom also testified monday and are now 
being discussed more openly in the soviet press 
the us delegation to assess soviet psychiatry which visited 
the soviet union this year reported to congress that while some 
victims have been released forced incarceration under the guise of 
treatment for insanity remains an institutional problem said 
rep henry waxman dcalif who presided over the hearing 
perhaps even worse the perpetrators of these abuses remain in 
key leadership positions in soviet psychiatry said waxman 
chairman of the house committee on energy and commerce subcommittee 
on health and the environment

four men whose 42foot sailboat was 
overturned in a storm say they drifted for nearly four months in 
the south pacific and survived by trapping rainwater spearing fish 
and eating seaweed 
we needed a miracle and we got one new zealand skipper 
john glennie said after the crewmen washed ashore sunday and were 
rescued on the great barrier island the four were all reported in 
good condition 
after wind pushed the overturned boat ashore the survivors said 
they spent their first night on land in 120 days sheltered from 
rain under a tree in the bush of the island about 60 miles 
northeast of auckland 
on sunday they walked through bush until breaking into an empty 
cabin and finding warm clothes 
peter speck an island resident first met the sailors at the 
cabin 
at first i thought these guys were nuts speck said i 
couldnt believe it 
the crew included owner and skipper glennie a sailor who 
designed the craft for longdistance cruising phillip hoffman and 
rick hellriegel of new zealand and jim nalepka 38 of 
minneapolis minn who was in the second of two years as caterer 
for the outward bound program in new zealand 
nalepkas sister kathy moynihan of new brighton minn said he 
lost 25 pounds but was declared fit by doctors in auckland after a 
twohour hospital visit 
we never gave up hope he kept hoping he was safe this is 
wonderful she said its just an amazing story 
the sailors trimaran rose noelle left picton on the northern 
coast of the south island of new zealand on june 1 for a 
threeweek pacific islands cruise that was to take them to tonga 
on the night of june 3 a strong wind grew to a 60knot gale 
about six oclock in the morning there was a huge wave and it 
just flipped the boat upside down glennie said 
the boat floated on its crossbeams and cabin top with the cabin 
top now the floor beneath a couple of feet of water glennie 
said 
the sailboats light buoyant bow rode high so it always 
pointed away from the wind he said the craft was stable and would 
not sink unless it had broken apart 
the men jammed four abreast in its 54inch width cut a hole 
through the hull of the yacht to gain dry access outside without 
having to swim through the nowwatery tunnel of the hatch glennie 
said 
the yachts two emergency locator beacons designed to transmit 
for 30 days were switched on but there was no sign from jets 
overhead that their signals were detected 
the boat was reported missing june 24 after it failed to arrive 
in tonga 
for the first few weeks there were survival rations 
we had plenty of soda stowed in the forward compartment 
glennie said we had stacks of apples and kiwifruit and we got 
plenty of moisture from those but the drinks were rationed to a 
few ounces every night 
after about 40 days when we had all come to terms with things 
and began working as a team we organized ourselves into making a 
system to collect rainwater 
they split some plastic piping and placed the pieces together to 
collect rainwater which was drained into empty soft drink bottles 
glennie said they also ate seaweed and speared fish 
we ate them raw and we had plenty of vinegar on board to 
marinate them in he said 
the sailors families had given them up for dead said malcolm 
tomes glennies brotherinlaw 
we were absolutely ecstatic to hear johns voice on the 
phone tomes said we were just so thrilled that he and the 
rest of the crew are still alive after so many months the 
celebrations are already under way

nearly 10000 people marched 
through leipzig on monday demanding legalization of opposition 
groups and adoption of democratic reforms in the countrys largest 
such protest since 1953 
witnesses said marchers chanted gorby gorby and were 
staying here 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is enormously popular 
among east germans who hope his policies of economic and political 
reforms may some day be adopted by their nations hardline 
leadership 
gorbachev is expected to visit east berlin next weekend to take 
part in celebrations marking east germanys 40th anniversary 
east germanys aging orthodox communist leadership has so far 
rejected the need for reforms 
in 1953 workers rose up throughout east germany in an illfated 
uprising later crushed by soviet tanks 
the demonstrators monday also demanded legalization of 
opposition groups which have been suppressed by the government 
fledgling opposition groups have rejected fleeing the country or 
emigration and said they want to work for change in this country of 
166 million 
tens of thousands of east germans fled over hungarys newly 
opened border and thousands more were allowed to travel to west 
germany this weekend after seeking refuge in bonns embassies in 
czechoslovakia and poland 
witnesses said security officials followed the demonstration but 
did not try to break it up

an arizona death row inmate who is challenging 
the states capital punishment law won a supreme court hearing 
monday 
the courts eventual ruling in jeffrey alan waltons appeal also 
could affect death row inmates in idaho and montana two states 
that have death penalty laws similar to arizonas 
walton was convicted of robbing and fatally shooting thomas 
powell near tucson in march 1986 
powell was robbed in a bar parking lot and then driven in his 
own car to a secluded area where he was shot 
a trial jury heard testimony that walton fired the fatal shot 
walton denied he killed powell swearing that a codefendant was 
the gunman 
the jury did not specify whether it found walton guilty of 
premeditated murder or felony murder the taking of a life 
during commission of a felony 
waltons lawyers sought unsuccessfully during his sentencing 
trial to introduce testimony indicating that the jury had been 
undecided whether walton killed powell 
the arizona supreme court upheld waltons conviction and death 
sentence in a ruling that conflicts with a decision by the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals 
the federal appeals court previously overturned a key provision 
of arizonas death penalty statute in the case of john harvey 
adamson convicted of murdering reporter don bolles bolles who 
had been investigating organized crime for the arizona republic in 
phoenix died june 11 1976 nine days after his car exploded 
the 9th circuit setting aside adamsons death sentence said 
arizonas death penalty law unconstitutionally deprives defendants 
of the right to a jury trial because the judge not the jury 
decides whether an accused murderer is guilty of a crime warranting 
capital punishment 
the appeals court has jurisdiction in nine western states 
including arizona montana and idaho 
the case is walton vs arizona 887351

egyptian president hosni mubarak met with 
president bush monday on mideast peace efforts and said he saw a 
golden opportunity for a breakthrough between israel and the 
palestinians 
mubarak said failing to seize the opportunity would be a grave 
mistake and that he and bush agreed to work closely together in 
order to utilize the existing momentum 
the continuation of the status quo is hazardous to both 
israel and the palestinians the egyptian leader told reporters 
after an oval office session lasting nearly an hour 
however even as mubarak sought to promote his plan which 
includes a demand that israel agree in principal to giving up 
seized lands aides to prime minister yitzhak shamir said the 
israeli leader does not intend to alter his own palestinian peace 
initiative 
mondays white house session came amid new concern that settling 
jewish immigrants from the soviet union in the israelioccupied 
west bank could threaten peace efforts 
bush administration officials reacted coolly to an israeli 
request for 400 million in housing loan guarantees for about 
100000 jewish emigres from the soviet union israeli officials 
have said some dwellings probably will be in the west bank 
the united states policy is to oppose additional settlements 
in the occupied territories secretary of state james a baker 
iii said and presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater 
declared our policy is we dont allow us aid to be used for 
resettlement in the west bank 
still baker and mubarak were both upbeat about peace prospects 
i think its fair to say that we all hope that conditions 
exist for progress said baker 
the egyptian president after his meeting with bush baker and 
vice president dan quayle said we believe the potential is 
great for further progress it would be a grave mistake to miss 
the golden opportunity existing today 
in jerusalem yossi ahimeir a spokesman for shamir said the 
israeli leader does not intend to alter his own peace plan despite 
pressure from egypt the united states or the rival israeli labor 
party 
only five months have passed since shamir presented his plan 
for elections as a first step toward negotiations and the prime 
minister does not see any reason to change it the spokesman 
said 
shamirs plan calls for elections in the occupied territories to 
choose delegates for negotiations with israel however final 
status on the lands occupied by israel since the 1967 middle east 
war would be decided later 
mubarak told reporters here the essential next step in the peace 
process is to persuade the israelis and the palestinians to enter 
into a dialogue without preconditions 
mubaraks meeting came as the united states was seeking to 
persuade a reluctant israel to open discussions with palestinians 
based on mubaraks proposals 
us officials regard the 10point egyptian plan as a complement 
to shamirs proposal for elections in which palestinians would 
select representatives to negotiate with israel on limited 
selfgovernment in the occupied territories 
the egyptian ten points do not represent a competing 
proposal they represent a means of getting a dialogue 
established baker said on monday 
mubarak made a similar comment 
a key element of mubaraks proposal is the convening of talks 
between israelis and palestinians in cairo so far resisted by 
shamir the israeli leader also opposes mubaraks suggestion that 
voting rights be extended to arabs living in east jerusalem and to 
palestinians who live outside the occupied territories 
and shamir has rejected mubaraks suggestion that the outcome of 
any negotiations be selfdetermination for the palestinians 
on prospects of a summit with shamir mubarak noted that he had 
talked to shamir by phone last friday and discussed preparations 
for such a meeting 
but he said such a meeting should come out of something 
otherwise it would have negative reactions from the peoples of 
both sides i dont want to make complications thats why any 
meeting needs a thorough preparation 
quayle meanwhile told reporters at a luncheon on monday that 
the administration would be very supportive of a dialogue 
between shamir and mubarak that can be meaningful 
after visiting the president mubarak had lunch at the state 
department with baker 
baker reaffirmed us backing for mubaraks efforts to help 
broker the israelipalestinian dispute we wont get to peace 
until palestinians and israelis speak to each other baker said 
both baker and mubarak said they wished to withhold comment on 
specifics dealing with palestinian representation until after the 
israeli cabinet meets on thursday on the subject 
at the same time baker confirmed in part a report in an 
egyptian newspaper al akhbar that the bush administration had 
proposed a joint commission to pave the way for elections in the 
territories 
im not sure you would call it a commission he said what 
has been suggested is the possibility that the three nations the 
united states egypt and israel could in some way determine the 
palestinian representation with respect to the dialogue 
mubaraks 10point proposal stops short of demanding the 
establishment of a palestinian state and it contains other 
features which have attracted favorable comment from israels labor 
party

president mikhail s gorbachev urged the 
parliament monday to impose a 15month ban on strikes which he 
said are wrecking the economy and endangering development 
he spoke at the end of a stormy twohour debate on emergency 
economic measures proposed by lev voronin the first deputy 
premier the official news agency tass reported 
gorbachev urged legislators to discuss the proposals and be 
ready to vote on tuesday 
he referred to the possible ban on strikes as a necessary 
measure called for to protect democratization from anarchy and 
irresponsible management 
plans for future economic development are under threat from 
the strikes he said 
voronin said the ailing economy lost 615 billion in july and 
august because of strikes and fuel shortages might mean inadequate 
heat this winter 
proposals for the next 15 months include a prohibition on 
conducting strikes in all branches of the economy tass said 
the package also calls for a special form of administration 
for railroads in armenia and azerbaijan with the ministries of 
railroads defense and interior responsible for protecting the 
lines and their workers 
armenian activists say azerbaijani railroad workers have blocked 
the trains that carry 80 percent of armenias goods from other 
parts of the soviet union food stores have been emptied of many 
basic goods and even ambulances lack fuel 
when the supreme soviet opened its fall session sept 25 
gorbachev said decisive steps would be required if the rail lines 
remained blocked 
the neighboring republics in the caucasus are in conflict over 
nagornokarabakh a region that is part of azerbaijan but has a 
predominantly armenian population 
this years most damaging strike was a walkout in july by 
thousands of coal miners in the far north siberia and the don 
basin of the eastern ukraine it cost millions of dollars and the 
government agreed to economic and social reforms officials say will 
cost about 308 billion 
strikes have become a common way of expressing ethnic 
discontent in addition to the nagornokarabakh dispute russian 
and other workers have struck factories in moldavia and estonia to 
protest laws favoring native populations

two administration officials caught the brunt 
of criticisms monday for president bushs refusal at the education 
summit to commit to an increase in federal funding for the nations 
schools 
education secretary lauro cavazos irked a luncheon meeting of 
black republicans telling them our role is not one of funding 
across the street charles kolb a key education department 
official who helped craft bushs education budget drew angry 
responses from members of the council of urban boards of education 
when he said the 353 billion estimated to be spent this year on 
education by all levels of government is sufficient 
cavazos and kolb were keeping to the line held by bush at the 
conclusion of the twoday summit last week with the nations 
governors who agreed jointly to develop national performance goals 
by february 
milton bins of the black gop group the council of 100 sharply 
questioned cavazos on the administrations commitment to ensure 
adequate funding to educate minority and disadvantaged youths 
i am here to remind our nation that the problem of equity 
education has not been solved said bins noting that about 80 
percent of most state legislators are from suburban or affluent 
white communities 
there is no clear indication on the scene today that they are 
going to take the advice from the governors bins added 
bins deputy director of the council of the great city schools 
was assured by cavazos the first hispanic to head the education 
department that bush continues to fight for equality cavazos 
cited the presidents support for funding specialized magnet 
schools and for allowing parents to select the school their 
children will attend 
kolb drew harsh criticism when he discussed bushs stances on 
funding and choice with the schools council which is part of the 
national school boards association 
there was a general recognition that money wasnt the issue 
said kolb in summarizing the summit 
the biggest challenge for all of us on the federal state 
and local levels is to find ways to deploy the resources that 
are already available for education kolb said 
stephen kafoury a member of the portland ore school board 
said more money is needed for schools and stressed that to imply 
otherwise would be disingenuous at best 
i thought this area had been declared a drug free zone and 
here i am wondering what youve been smoking said a sarcastic 
jonathan wilson of the des moines independent community school 
district youve got to look at what were doing with the money 
wilsons was greeted with cheers and applause when he compared 
the amounts spent on the military and the savings and loan 
associations bailout with federal spending on education 
he bailed out the sampls the man didnt say he wanted to be the 
sampl president he said he wanted to be the education president 
said wilson referring to bushs pledge during last years 
presidential campaign 
what we need is more resources not someone talking 
platitudes the real test is what are the resources and where are 
they coming from 
nsba president james oglesby admitted the group beat up on 
kolb but said it was because many of the members are frustrated 
volunteers

the soviet union is equipping some of its 
tanks with several layers of a special armor that can withstand 
certain types of us missiles the chairman of the house armed 
services committee said monday 
the soviets have bolted two and three layers of reactive armor 
boxes to their t72 tanks a discovery members of the committee 
made during their trip to the soviet union in august said rep les 
aspin dwis 
reactive armor unlike the traditional type of armor goes 
beyond merely protecting against an oncoming missile or projectile 
the reactive armor consists of a steel box that includes layers of 
steel plates and explosives 
the rationale for the reactive armor box is that a missile may 
hit the box and set off the explosive inside but the steel plate 
will block further damage 
to combat the reactive armor boxes the united states has 
equipped its antitank weapons with dualcharge warheads these 
missiles include a first charge which penetrates the box and sets 
off the explosive and a second charge which when it ignites a 
fraction of a second later can break through the steel plates and 
penetrate the tank 
the soviet action makes it difficult for even a dualcharge 
warhead to penetrate past the armor 
this cant be anything but bad news to forces planning to 
defend against these tanks with current antitank weapons aspin 
said at the same time our antitank weapons should retain high 
effectiveness against soviet armored fighting vehicles whose 
numbers are being increased as tanks are withdrawn from soviet 
forces in eastern europe 
the soviets have said they are withdrawing 5300 tanks from 
eastern europe while increasing the number of infantry fighting 
vehicles which are thinnerskinned aspin said 
the committee plans to release a full assessment of the 
ussoviet military balance later this month

people in danger of developing high blood 
pressure cut their risk in half in a new study by reducing salt and 
alcohol intake losing weight and exercising 
it is the first study to show that such steps often recommended 
for people who already have high blood pressure can also reduce 
risk of developing the condition said researcher rose stamler 
the steps might prevent 1 million cases of high blood pressure 
over five years in people 30 to 44 and perhaps additional cases in 
other age groups she said 
stamler of northwestern university medical school in chicago 
spoke in an interview before presenting the work at an american 
medical association science reporters conference 
the work also appears in fridays issue of the journal of the 
american medical association 
the research focused on 201 men and women ages 30 to 44 whose 
blood pressure was relatively high but within the normal range 
such people are at risk of developing clinical high blood pressure 
at the start of the study in addition to high normal blood 
pressure the participants were overweight by at least 10 percent 
or they had a fast pulse rate of 80 or more beats per minute 
about half the group was assigned to an intervention program it 
included goals of reducing weight by about 10 pounds if they 
needed reducing salt intake to about half the national average 
limiting alcohol to two or fewer drinks a day and exercising for 
30 minutes at least three days a week 
the other 99 participants were simply followed for the studys 
duration of five years 
after five years 88 percent of participants who followed the 
intervention program developed hypertension compared to 192 
percent among the others 
stamler said she did not think any one part of the intervention 
program produced the difference but rather the combination of 
strategies weight loss seemed to be particularly effective 
however she said 
about 25 percent of the targeted group reached the 10pound 
weight loss mark she said in addition average salt intake in the 
intervention group dropped about 25 percent and they consumed 30 
percent less alcohol than before most also exercised more 
federal statistics say that the nation has at least 10 milion 
people in the age group she studied who have the relatively high 
but still normal blood pressures she said 
her results suggest that without intervention 2 million of them 
would progress to high blood pressure within five years but the 
intervention program might prevent that in half the cases she said 
the results are very encouraging said edward d frolich 
chairman of the american heart associations council for high blood 
pressure research

a senior cia analyst said monday that soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev might face a revolt among 
rankandfile communist party members but that his reforms are 
likely to survive a backlash 
even if there is a temporary setback i think the process of 
reform will continue marc zlotnik of the cias office of soviet 
analysis said in a lecture at the kennan institute for advanced 
russian studies in washington 
his remarks reflected a general sense of uncertainty among 
government and academic experts over the course of soviet politics 
in the short term after four years of often tumultuous reform since 
gorbachev came to power 
asked to comment on gorbachevs own description of a deepening 
economic and political crisis and reference to rumors of a 
conservative coup in moscow zlotnik said some spark could set 
things off to topple the senior leadership but no one is in a 
position to predict when it will come and whether it can be put out 
quickly 
the crisis is really serious zlotnik said but so far i 
think it is being managed pretty well 
gorbachev has solidified his position by eliminating 
conservative opponents in the communist party and by strengthening 
the role of the soviet parliament which this year elected him to a 
fiveyear term as president 
but the party and parliament may be on a collision course 
zlotnik said and at some point there is going to be a showdown 
between those who want a traditional role for the ruling 
communist party and members of parliament who put faith in 
gorbachevs call to transfer power from the party to the 
legislature 
most parliamentary deputies are also party members said 
zlotnik and for at least the next several years they are likely to 
obey any decision by the ruling politburo to dump gorbachev 
although gorbachev so far has done a good job of keeping two 
steps ahead of his rivals said zlotnik i wonder whether any 
politician can keep outguessing the opposition time after time 
gorbachev heeding a sense of panic in the party has 
recently taken a more moderate view asking nonrussian 
nationalities to curb their drives for independence and asking the 
legislature to approve a 15month ban on strikes that he says are 
disrupting the economy and endangering reform 
gorbachev has seen the need to rein in the most radical 
forces zlotnik said i dont think he has changed his goals of 
radically transforming soviet society but he sees a need for 
stocktaking a respite from the frantic pace of the last four 
years

territories may jeopardize support from washington which views 
jewish settlements in the west bank and gaza strip as an obstacle 
to middle east peace efforts 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday the bush 
administration would reject any request for aid to resettle 
immigrants in the occupied lands 
the west bank and gaza are home to 17 million palestinians and 
70000 jewish settlers they are the scene of a 21monthold 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule 
israeli officials say more soviet jews will flock to the jewish 
state as a result of new us immigration restrictions that make it 
more difficult to go to the united states and because of worsening 
economic conditions in their homeland 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs special adviser on jewish 
affairs yitzhak david said one barometer of the interest in 
emigration is the number of sponsorship offers sent to israels 
diplomatic mission in moscow at the behest of wouldbe emigrants 
he said an average of 200 such invitations needed to start 
emigration procedures are received daily about 200000 soviet 
jews have requested sponsorship so far this year 
washington has set a ceiling of 50000 soviets to be admitted as 
refugees next year an additional 20000 to 30000 may enter the 
country on a socalled parole basis with no government support 
we do anticipate growing numbers of jewish immigrants wanting 
to settle in israel fitzwater said there may be costs 
associated with that 
simcha dinitz head of the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
which helps settle new arrivals said 100000 soviets are expected 
over the next three to five years david said the number could 
reach 150000 
israel estimates resettlement costs at 3 billion over three to 
five years and hopes to get 600 million in donations from us 
jewish groups 
it also wants 400 million in usgovernment guaranteed loans 
that would allow it to borrow money from commercial banks at low 
interest finance ministry spokesman arieh greenblatt said 
the funding request was made by finance minister shimon peres 
who raised the issue with president bush last week in new york he 
said 
fitzwater said bush emphasized his symphathy for that problem 
and committed to look into it but details were not discussed 
the current american program of financing housing projects 
limits loan guarantees to 25 million per country a year 
officials in shamirs rightwing likud bloc say soviet jews 
should be settled in the occupied territories which likud sees as 
an integral part of israel 
housing minister david levy drew sharp criticism from american 
officials and jewish leaders when he first voiced the idea last 
june liberal critics said it would deter soviet jews who do not 
want to be thrust into the midst of the palestinian uprising 
dinitz said the jewish agency would not allow its funds to be 
used in the occupied territories 
the jewish agency the main body raising funds abroad is 
obliged by its policy to use all the funds for absorption in israel 
proper he said whatever the government decides its 
governments business but jewish agency funds will be used only in 
israel 
david the shamir adviser said israel would settle jews in the 
west bank and gaza with or without us backing 
we are a sovereign state and we think this immigration wave 
should be directed there if the americans refuse to give money we 
shall take a loan from our own population but we wont stop 
david said a group of settlement leaders was discussing the idea 
with shamir and that he was working on a survey of housing and job 
opportunities in the west bank and gaza 
another controversial proposal by israels absorption minister 
yizthak peretz calls for directing the majority of new immigrants 
to development towns in remote areas of israel 
jewish activists in moscow say many jews who seek to go to the 
united states would rather stay in the soviet union than go to 
israel 
some 250000 soviet jews emigrated to israel between 1967 and 
1988 
last year 2173 out of 18961 soviet jewish emigrants came to 
israel according to the jerusalembased soviet jewry education and 
information center in januaryaugust this year 4175 of the 
34610 soviet jewish emigrants came to israel and the government 
expects a total of 7000 in 1989

ten families are offering their table 
scraps rakedup leaves and old newspapers to development of a city 
garbage profile 
susan young a regional environmental planner said the city has 
little information on what or how much tulsa residents are 
tossing away so families were enlisted for special garbage pickup 
and analysis 
the biggest problem we have in doing any kind of planning on 
solid waste management is we dont have any information about how 
much is out there ms young said 
the families began sunday to separate their trash into 
categories including yard clippings plastics and paper they will 
continue the effort for a year 
ms young said the project will provide valuable statistics the 
goal is to find new ways to encourage recycling 
any estimate plus or minus 100 percent is so much better 
than what we have now which is sitting down with a cocktail napkin 
and saying well how much trash did you have last month

a republican lobbyist with former ties to the 
white house told congress monday that he played by the rules in 
obtaining lucrative federal housing subsidies but the head of a 
house panel charged he had reaped the benefits of a greased 
sweetheart deal 
paul manafort a former campaign adviser to president bush and 
former president reagan and a former business partner of republican 
national chairman lee atwater underwent hostile questioning from 
disbelieving members of a house panel probing scandals at the 
department of housing and urban development 
manafort who three months ago acknowledged to the same panel 
that his work amounted to influence peddling denied being 
given an advance tip by insiders at hud to the availability of hud 
subsidies for renovating lowincome housing projects which were 
prized profitmakers for developers 
he said his lobbying firm has worked within the existing 
system at hud 
we played by the rules manafort said i understand that 
the subcommittee views the process as fundamentally flawed i am 
not here to argue with the subcommittee about the process or to 
defend it 
rep tom lantos dcalif took sharp issue with manaforts 
description of a new jersey housing project in which manafort was a 
partner and which benefited from more than 31 million in federal 
subsidies for renovation and tax credits 
this was a greased sweetheart deal where all the 
participants knew what the final outcome would be said lantos 
chairman of the house government operations subcommittee on 
employment and housing 
manafort contended that partners in the development faced normal 
business risks including the potential loss of a 450000 
downpayment in buying the 326 units of dilapidated housing and 
putting together a package of subsidies and financing 
but lantos said hud documents showed manaforts group was 
assured of the hud subsidies in contacts with top agency officials 
before it invested the money lantos said manafort and his partners 
also benefitted from hud specifications that were written to 
exclude other developers he said it was ludicrious for 
manafort to claim he faced any normal business risk 
lantos produced hud documents which he said showed deborah gore 
dean former executive assistant to hud secretary sam pierce was 
passing along copies of hud project proposals to manafort even 
though he was not directly involved in them 
there was no risk here there was a prearranged deal which 
went through as it was prearranged lantos said 
there was a sweetheart deal with deborah dean lantos said 
deborah dean promised them the units of subsidy and she 
delivered on the units those are the facts 
dean is one of four former top officials of hud including 
pierce who have refused to testify before the panel by invoking 
their constitutional rights against selfincrimination dean has 
been at the focus of the panels probe into political favoritism in 
the awarding of hud subsidies to developers 
in one 1986 memo released by the panel dean had written another 
hud official should amass great wells of power and wield it on my 
behalf manafort said he did not recall receiving the hud 
documents but said they involved a partner victor cruse whom he 
had introduced to dean 
laurence gay an associate in manaforts lobbying firm 
testified he met with dean and discussed the new jersey project 
another associate in the firm richard davis was a former white 
house liason to hud who said he had been in contact with dean daily 
while in government 
manafort faced questions about his failure in his appearance 
last june to recall all the hudrelated projects on which he had 
served as a consultant or lobbyist 
manafort said he and his lobbying firm black manafort stone 
and kelly had failed to fully check all their records but had now 
produced a complete list rep bruce morrison dconn said that 
involved 21 separate clients 
although he faced contentious questioning manafort was offered 
reassurance by one of the panel members rep christopher shays 
rconn said in no way have i ever seen anything related to 
your activity that would suggest any illegalities 
lantos however later told manafort that yourre trying to be 
evasive and that while his deal may not have broken laws it 
certainly was highly questionable in terms of ethics as a 
result lantos said money was denied to infintely more worthy 
projects 
lantos said subcommittee staff last week visited the seabrook 
project in upper deerfield nj in which manafort and cruse are 
partners he described it as a slum with shocking 
conditions including waterdamaged apartments with no 
refrigerators renting for more than 700 a month including federal 
subsidies 
the panel questioned cruse and manafort at length about the 
renovations and the failure so far to install gutters manafort 
said that while 182 units are occupied construction is still under 
way and asserted when we are finished with construction we 
believe the tenants will be happy

the supreme court embarking on a term laced 
with controversial issues said monday it will decide whether 
police nationwide may use sobriety checkpoints in trying to curb 
drunken drivers 
the case accepted by the court which poses the question of 
whether police officers may use checkpoints to spot drunken 
drivers presents the latest test of strength for the courts newly 
solidified conservative majority 
michigan courts struck down that states sobriety checkpoint 
program as an unconstitutional invasion of privacy but courts in 
other states have upheld virtually identical police tactics 
in its usual startofterm flurry the court issued orders in 
more than 1000 cases denying review to most and agreeing to 
study 22 they will be among 150 or so disputes to be decided by 
the end of the term in july 
the court also heard arguments in a yonkers ny desegregation 
case centering on four city councilmen who voted against a judges 
order to pass a legislative package designed to lure subsidized 
housing to the citys white neighborhoods 
in addition to that civil rights case the justices are looking 
ahead to a term in which they have agreed to decide thorny 
rightofprivacy arguments in three abortion disputes and the high 
courts first right to die controversy 
in other action on the first day of its term the justices 
agreed to decide in an illinois case whether public employers 
may be forced to put aside partisanship when hiring promoting and 
transferring employees 
turned down the appeals of eight mafia figures from new york 
city convicted in the 1979 assassinations of crime chieftain 
carmine galante and two of his associates 
left intact marylands revocation of a 300000ayear tax 
break for a menonly golf club that has counted presidents and 
members of congress among its members 
refused to spare an evangelical christian group in lenox 
mass from having to return 55 million donated by a wealthy 
exmember 
rejected alaskas attempt to forestall offshore oil and gas 
exploration in bristol bay the state had argued that an oil spill 
there could do more environmental harm than the massive exxon 
valdez spill last march 
allowed states to criminally prosecute employers accused of 
neglecting the health and safety of their employees the justices 
without comment let stand a ruling in an illinois case that 
federal workplace regulations do not bar such state prosecutions 
the use of police sobriety checkpoints in michigan was attacked 
shortly after state police began using them in 1986 the program 
was modeled after one used in maryland 
at a checkpoint site police directed all traffic headed in one 
direction to a roadside area where officers checked motorists for 
signs of intoxication 
if there was no immediate evidence of intoxication the motorist 
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away the 
average delay was about 30 seconds 
if signs of intoxication were detected a driver was directed to 
another area for further questioning and perhaps a breath test 
at one such checkpoint michigan state police troopers checked 
126 vehicles in less than an hour and detained two drivers for 
sobriety field tests one driver was arrested on drunkendriving 
charges 
the state police department was sued soon after the checkpoint 
program began the lawsuit alleged that the checkpoints violated 
the fourth amendments ban on unreasonable police searches and 
seizures 
state courts banned the checkpoints citing the potential for 
an unreasonable subjective intrusion on individual liberty 
interests 
in defending the checkpoint program michigan attorney general 
frank kelley told the justices that fighting drunken driving is a 
grave and legitimate public interest 
he said michigans checkpoint program is valid even if it is not 
the most effective police procedure available or may carry the 
potential of generating fear and surprise in some motorists 
lawyers for those who successfully challenged the checkpoint 
program urged the justices to reject the appeal 
they said the warrantless suspicionless seizure of a 
vehicle at a sobriety checkpoint could lead to drivers and 
passengers being required to get out and being subjected to 
patdown searches they said police officers may use such occasions 
to inspect a vehicles contents 
in other matters the court 
agreed to use a florida case to decide whether states may 
prohibit grand jury witnesses from making public their own 
testimony once the investigation has ended 
said it will decide whether the government may prohibit 
soliciting on all postal service property including the sidewalks 
adjacent to post office buildings 
left intact a 278600 libel award against a pawtucket ri 
newspaper by refusing to review a ruling that news stories may be 
libelous even if they contain no false statement 
turned down the appeal of eight antiwar activists including 
philip and daniel berrigan who were convicted of breaking into a 
king of prussia pa plant and damaging two nuclear missile cones 
agreed to decide in a california case whether lawyers who take 
civil rights cases on a contingency basis may collect a big chunk 
of their clients awards 
let stand the trespassing convictions of three people who 
attempted to hand out antiabortion booklets to students outside a 
texas high school 
on the same day last july that the justices expanded state 
authority to make abortions harder to get they also agreed to 
study disputes over abortion regulation in minnesota ohio and 
illinois 
laws in minnesota and ohio require doctors to notify parents of 
unmarried minors who seek an abortion 
an illinois law would require abortion clinics where the 
overwhelming majority of abortions are performed to provide 
services and equipment now found only in hospitals the law could 
force many clinics out of business and drive up the cost of an 
abortion by nearly 50 
the court also will decide whether a lifesustaining tube may be 
removed from the stomach of a missouri woman in an irreversible 
vegetative state 
when nancy cruzans parents requested that artificial feeding 
and hydration be ended for their daughter hospital officials 
refused to do so without a court order the missouri supreme court 
ruled that the cruzans who say nancy would prefer to die have no 
right to order the termination of such treatment

voyager 2 photographed an active geyser 
or volcano blowing gaseous and frozen nitrogen 5 miles high on 
triton proving neptunes biggest moon is the solar systems third 
object with active eruptions scientists said monday 
we caught one in the act said ellis miner deputy voyager 
project scientist at the national aeronautics and space 
administrations jet propulsion laboratory 
a nasa news release called the eruptions geyserlike 
phenomenon but with 5milehigh plumes they can be considered 
either volcanoes or giant geysers said brad smith leader of 
voyagers photographic imaging team 
earth and io a moon of jupiter are the only other bodies in 
the solar system known to have active volcanoes ios volcanoes 
spew molten sulfur 
images radioed to earth when voyager flew past neptune and 
triton in august showed dark plumeshaped deposits of material 
lying on tritons south polar ice cap at the time scientists said 
they believed the deposits were created by volcanoes spewing gas 
and ice 12 to 20 miles skyward they said they believed the 
volcanoes were active or had been active in the past few hundred 
years 
but it wasnt until late last week that closer examination of 
aug 24 pictures taken from a distance of 62000 miles revealed an 
eruption in progress miner said monday 
resembling a smokestack the narrow stem of the dark plume 
rises vertically nearly 5 miles forming a cloud that drifts 90 
miles eastward in tritons winds nasa said in a stratement 
nasa made the announcement as voyager formally ended its 
twomonth close inspection of neptune the solar systems 
fourthlargest planet the oneton space probe was 347 million 
miles past neptune traveling at 37337 mph it was 283 billion 
miles from earth and had traveled 446 billion miles on a curved 
course since its launch in 1977 voyager 2 explored jupiter in 
1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 
voyager 2s encounter with neptune formally started aug 5 and 
it will continue to look back at the planet until december 
but the formal end of the encounter was marked by the activation 
monday of a new set of computer commands replacing the program that 
guided the craft and its cameras and instruments through the close 
examination of neptune 
voyager 2 like its twin voyager 1 is expected to return 
information to earth for another 25 or 30 years before its 
plutonium power generators fail the probes will measure magnetic 
fields and electrically charged particles in space voyager 1 
explored jupiter in 1979 and saturn in 1980 
the eruption isnt apparent in any single image of triton but 
was recognized by examining several images taken from different 
angles and analyzed through stereoscopic techniques nasa said 
tritons eruptions are of nitrogen ice with nitrogen gas smith 
said 
its a semantic issue whether to call them volcanoes or 
giant geysers smith said if were talking about the materials 
involved its closer to a geyser than a volcano but if youre 
talking about the mechanics involved shooting material miles 
above the surface thats closer to a volcano 
scientists dont know what causes the eruptions on triton the 
coldest known object in the solar system with a surface temperature 
of 400 degrees below zero fahrenheit 
one possibility being considered is that pressurized gas 
probably nitrogen rises from beneath the surface and carries aloft 
dark particles and possibly ice crystals nasa said whatever 
the cause the plume takes the particles to an altitude where they 
are left suspended to form a cloud that drifts 
triton is about fourfifths the size of earths moon 
voyager 2 also discovered gargantuan storms and 720mph wind in 
neptunes atmosphere and six moons orbiting the planet in addition 
to triton and nereid which were detected from earth it also 
discovered three thin rings and one broad band of dust orbiting the 
planet

vice president dan quayle said monday the 
administration may ask congress to let the philippines use us 
foreign aid to bolster internal security against communist 
insurgents 
two american military base workers were ambushed and killed by 
communist rebels in the philippines last tuesda shortly before 
quayles arrival 
quayle said a waiver of the restriction on using us foreign 
aid for internal security would help protect american lives 
quayle who returned friday from a 12day fournation asian 
tour was instrumental in obtaining a similar waiver for el 
salvador earlier this year after he visited there 
the philippines is due to receive almost 650 million in us 
aid next year 
quayle did not say how much he felt should be reallocated toward 
internal security but aides said the country needs basic security 
equipment including twoway radios for police cars in manila to 
help combat terrorism 
in a luncheon interview with the associated press and other news 
organizations quayle said that a longterm agreement to keep the 
six american military installations in the philippines would make 
the country more attractive to foreign investors 
the country needs economic development you see that just upon 
arrival traveling the streets of manila you still have poverty at 
a very significant degree quayle said 
they need private investment they need businesses to come 
over there and invest said quayle who also visited japan south 
korea and malaysia 
the base agreement covering clark air base subic bay naval 
station and four smaller installations expires in september 1991 
and a dozen of the 23 members of the countrys senate favor closing 
them vice president salvador h laurel has suggested a 5to10 
year extension of the lease agreement 
but quayle said he told laurel a 5to10 year agreement means 
were leaving i dont believe that that is what you really want if 
you want to think of the longterm stability of the philippines 
thats the question the filipinos have to ask themselves 
said quayle who reiterated that he believes the majority of the 
people still support our presence 
i think we are a stabilizing force in the philippines and 
stability is what investors and people look to 
on other issues quayle said 
the soviets should not misconstrue the bush administrations 
continued support for a realistic strategic defense initiative 
if they view a phased deployment and a redefinition of sdi as a 
lessening of the commitment theyre misreading the tea leaves 
shrugged off a question about his own low standing in public 
opinion polls im gratified for the presidents good standing in 
polls thats my concern right now i got plenty of time to worry 
about my own said the 44yearold vice president 
the united states cannot support the puppet cambodian 
government installed by the vietnamese the main us goal now in 
the wake of the vietnamese troop pullout is supporting the 
noncommunist resistance and trying to prevent the mass 
murderers of the khmer rouge from returning to power he said 
it will take time for china to recover following the 
government massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators in tianamen 
square 
the problem is china continues to perceive that nothing 
happened or whatever happened is nobodys business and therefore 
its for us to change not them said quayle that attitude 
must change he added 
all three south korean opposition leaders quayle met with 
clearly support keeping the 43000 us troops stationed there 
for us to pull the cord at this time would be very 
counterproductive said quayle who said democracy is clearly 
emerging in south korea

senate majority leader george mitchell again 
goaded the bush administration monday on its timidity in us 
policy toward poland and said the democratic congress will press 
ahead with additional aid for the new noncommunist government 
mitchell who met with top polish officials last week said the 
new government led by members of the solidarity trade union is 
firmly committed to establishing a more westernstyle economy 
the only question is whether the west will make it possible for 
this transformation to succeed he said in a floor speech 
he noted that bush has voiced support for new loans to poland 
through the world bank and international monetary fund but he said 
those moves alone will not meet the countrys immediate needs 
it appears the administration remains hesitant to move forward 
until polands economic reforms already are fully in place said 
mitchell dmaine in light of our great stake in the success of 
the new polish government i believe this response is excessively 
timid 
the comments were mitchells fourth public attack on bushs 
poland policy in two weeks 
congress will do its best to ensure that the united states 
does in fact play a leading role in encouraging the success of 
polands brave experiment he said pointing to a threeyear 12 
billion aid package passed by the senate foreign relations 
committee that dwarfs bushs threeyear 119 million program of 
economic development aid 
i call upon the administration to abandon its timidity and to 
take advantage of this historic opportunity to provide the kind of 
help that is necessary for democracy and open government to succeed 
in poland he said

a federal judge acted within his powers by 
fining four yonkers ny city councilmen for disobeying his 
desegregation order a lawyer for the federal government told the 
supreme court on monday 
but an attorney for the councilmen argued that the judge could 
have changed the city zoning ordinance but chose instead to 
violate the councilmens commonlaw right of legislative immunity 
as well as their constitutionally protected freedom of speech 
the case argued before the high court monday is an outgrowth 
of the bitter nineyear battle to desegregate yonkers the 
justices are expected to rule by july 
the case centers around four city councilmen nicholas v 
longo edward j fagan jr peter chema and vice mayor henry 
spallone who voted against a judges order to pass a legislative 
package designed to lure subsidized housing to the citys white 
neighborhoods 
kenneth w starr the federal governments solicitor general 
praised us district judge leonard sand for not employing more 
stringent tactics to compel the councilmen to obey his july 26 
1988 order 
in 1985 sand found yonkers that had for 40 years deliberately 
concentrated virtually all its subsidized housing in the southwest 
part of the city to keep blacks away from whites sand ordered the 
city to build 200 units of public housing in white neighborhoods in 
1988 and to plan for 600 more the city appealed lost and seemed 
close to agreeing on a desegregation plan until yonkers residents 
raised loud objections the council defied sands order by voting 
43 against the desegregation plan 
sand then set fines of 500 a day and threatened to jail the 
four unless they obeyed his order 
they simply chose not to obey and furthermore they said we 
dont have to obey starr told the justices 
sand had also set fines for the city starting at 100 a day 
and doubling daily until they reached 1 million daily prompting 
councilmen chema and longo to change their votes as yonkers faced 
imminent bankruptcy 
the councilmen ultimately paid 3500 apiece in fines none went 
to jail yonkers paid a total of 819000 in fines which were 
upheld by the supreme court 
james d harmon jr the attorney representing the councilmen 
argued monday that the district court used the most intrusive 
means available to compel the four to change their votes 
violating their legislative immunity harmon also argued that to 
vote is to exercise ones freedom of speech which is protected by 
the first amendment 
is this like the court ordering somebody to say something they 
dont want to say justice byron white asked harmon at one point 
courts are always doing that 
white gave the example of courts ordering employers to post 
notices theyd rather quash and suggested harmon could make his 
argument without invoking the constitution 
harmon also argued that there are limits to judicial authority 
and that the councilmen were compelled to vote their consciences 
this prompted justice anthony kennedy to ask whether the councilmen 
had the right to force the city into bankruptcy 
yes and to be held accountable for that at the ballot box 
harmon said 
the cases are spallone vs us 88854 chema vs us 88856 
and longo vs us 88870

lawmakers miners developers and 
environmentalists clashed monday over legislation that would 
designate about 95 million acres of california land as wilderness 
areas and national parks 
we need to draw clear lines that development can work around 
while saving some lands as parks and wildernesses sen alan 
cranston dcalif sponsor of the measure told a crowded hearing 
conducted by the senate energy and resources subcommittee on public 
lands national parks and forests 
congress in 1976 enacted the federal land policy and management 
act which established the california desert conservation area the 
bureau of land management in accordance with the law developed a 
management plan for the california desert to balance the demands of 
environmentalists hunters miners ranchers energy developers 
tourists and the military 
but according to cranston the bureau of land management has 
failed to protect important desert resources 
citing a report by the general accounting office cranston said 
the investigative arm of congress found that the bureau has 
frequently allowed the needs of competing interests such as 
recreation and commercial use to take precedence over wildlife 
interests when conflicts have arisen 
the bureau disputed that charge 
i wish the folks at gao would have had both their eyes and 
ears open when they did their report said cy jamison director 
of the bureau gaos report presents only a partial picture of 
blms wildlife activities in the california desert 
jamison also criticized the legislation which appears driven by 
the premise that public lands will be destroyed if they are not 
designated as wilderness or placed in national parks 
that is wrong and that mindset would gut the multiple use 
philosophy mandated by congress jamison said 
robert a sanregret a representative of the western mining 
council inc said the legislation would destroy thousands of 
private businesses and would literally make thousands of citizens 
homeless 
sanregret argued the measure would lock out millions of acres of 
public land for future use by mineral exploration and development 
recreationists complained that the legislation would close off 
camping areas hiking trails and rock collecting sites cranston 
had noted that the bureau proposes permitting a motorcycle race 
through a desert tortoise habitat during the thanksgiving weekend 
next month 
the state has listed the desert tortoise as an endangered 
species 
the high desert cattlemans association said the legislation 
will directly affect the livelihoods of the ranchers the future 
of desert ranching and the local economy

the supreme court on monday agreed to consider 
allowing the use of police undercover agents to elicit confessions 
from jailed criminal suspects 
the justices announced they will use the the case of an illinois 
murder suspect to consider weakening its famous 1966 miranda ruling 
that requires police to warn suspects of their right to an attorney 
and to remain silent 
an illinois appeals court ruled last november that police 
violated the rights of lloyd perkins when they planted an 
undercover agent in jail to question him about a murder 
perkins was charged with fatally shooting richard stephenson on 
nov 8 1984 in fairview heights 
police lacked a suspect in the murder in 1986 when donald 
charlton an inmate at graham correctional facility in hillsboro 
told authorities he had information about the homicide 
police then placed charlton and undercover narcotics officer 
john parisi in the montgomery county jail on march 31 1986 
perkins was being held there awaiting trial on a charge of 
aggravated battery unrelated to the murder 
parisi using the alias vito bianco wore motorcycle garb and 
told perkins he was interested in planning an escape parisi 
charlton and perkins arranged to meet in the cellbock after the 
other inmates went to sleep 
at that meeting parisi asked perkins whether he had ever done 
someone a phrase the appeals court said was intended to elicit 
information about any killings in which perkins took part 
the appeals court said perkins then recounted in detail the 
killing of stephenson 
perkins then was taken to the county courthouse placed under 
arrest for murder and given his miranda warnings 
a state judge in 1987 ruled that perkins jailhouse statements 
to charlton and parisi about the stephenson killing could not be 
admitted as evidence 
state officials seeking to have the statements admitted said 
the miranda ruling is designed to protect suspects against police 
coercion 
the officials said since parisi and charlton had engaged in 
friendly conversation pretending to enlist perkins in a jailbreak 
there could be no coercion 
but the illinois appeals court said the miranda ruling applies 
whenever a suspect is in custody even when the purpose of the 
custody is unrelated to the purpose of the interrogation 
the supreme court in 1980 ruled that law enforcement officials 
cannot hire jailhouse informants to induce criminal defendants in 
custody to make incriminating statements 
the justices in that ruling relied on their own 1964 decision 
handed down two years before miranda that barred government 
agents from eliciting incriminating information from defendants 
entitled to a lawyers help during interrogation 
illinois officials said the 1980 high court ruling permits 
parisis questioning of perkins because no murder charges against 
perkins had been filed 
under such circumstances the state said there exists no 
inherent danger that a suspect will believe he has no choice but to 
submit to police will and to confess 
the case is illinois vs perkins 881972

the supreme court agreed monday to review a 
law requiring people convicted of federal crimes to pay money to 
help crime victims 
the court said it will study a ruling that the law is 
unconstitutional because it is a revenueraising measure that 
originated in the us senate rather than the house of 
representatives the constitution requires that revenueraising 
measures start in the house 
the bush administration is seeking to have the appeals court 
ruling reversed 
the case stems from a 50 assessment against german 
munozflores convicted of helping an illegal alien evade 
inspection by immigration officials in san diego county calif 
munozflores also was placed on probation for two years 
the assessment was ordered under a 1984 law aimed at raising 
money to offset the cost of helping victims of crimes 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled last december that 
the law is a revenueraising measure that should have originated in 
the house rather than the senate 
the appeals courts ruling is binding in arizona alaska 
california hawaii idaho montana nevada oregon and washington 
justice department lawyers said the ruling invalidates 
assessments imposed against thousands of people convicted in those 
states the governments appeal said that the 9th circuits ruling 
if adopted nationwide would affect tens of thousands of criminal 
cases each year 
government lawyers argued that the 1984 law is not primarily 
designed to raise revenue but rather was part of a package to help 
crime victims the lawyers also said the assessments measure is 
designed in part to punish those convicted of crimes 
the appeal said the appeals court was mistaken in describing the 
measure as originating in the senate because it actually originated 
in the house which passed a crimecontrol bill that included the 
assessments feature 
the law calls for assessments ranging from 25 to 200 per 
offense 
the case is us vs munozflores 881932

prime minister yitzhak shamir does not intend 
to alter his palestinian peace plan despite pressure from the 
united states egypt and the rival labor party his aides said 
monday 
only five months have passed since shamir presented his plan 
for elections as a first step toward negotiations and the prime 
minister does not see any reason to change it spokesman yossi 
ahimeir said 
egyptian israeli and us officials have been meeting in new 
york and israels governing coalition shamirs rightist likud 
bloc and the centerleft labor party is preparing to debate 
mubaraks efforts to bring palestinians and israelis together in 
preliminary talks 
at the united nations in new york foreign minister marwan kasim 
of jordan urged the united states soviet union and others to 
persuade israel to talk with the palestine liberation organization 
and move out of the circle of violence and oppression into a 
state of security stability and constructiveness 
the cabinet leadership including likud and labor ministers is 
to meet thursday about mubaraks ideas 
likud rejects a formula backed by egypt and the united states 
that involves trading occupied land for peace and including people 
deported by israel in a palestinian negotiating delegation labor 
led by finance minister shimon peres supports both ideas 
shamirs proposed elections would choose delegates to negotiate 
with israel about interim autonomy in the west bank and gaza strip 
occupied by israel since the 1967 middle east war 
mubarak raised the landforpeace proposal after many 
palestinians dismissed shamirs plan as an effort to end the 
uprising against israeli occupation that began dec 8 1987 
at tammun village in the west bank mahmud hamed bani awde 22 
was stabbed to death monday for reasons not immediately clear 
the israeli army said the killing was a family matter and was 
under police investigation but the national news agency itim and 
arab reporters said awde belonged to the democratic front for the 
liberation of palestine a marxist group and the murder may have 
been political 
in the gaza strip a soldier was slightly injured monday by a 
rock thrown by palestinians in the jabaliya refugee camp the army 
said 
elsewhere in the occupied lands arab hospital officials 
reported 11 palestinians wounded by army gunfire including a 
15yearold boy hospitalized in israel with a critical head wound 
shops in nablus and bethlehem closed monday to protest the 
shooting deaths of two palestinians youths the previous day arab 
reports said 
israeli soldiers or civilians have killed at least 581 
palestinians in the uprising and 123 palestinians have been slain 
by fellow arabs most as suspected collaborators with israel forty 
israelis have died in the violence 
mubarak telephoned shamir on friday to talk about his proposals 
secretary of state james a baker iii issued a veiled threat to 
drop support for the election plan unless israel moved toward the 
proposals made by egypt the only arab country to have made peace 
with egypt 
baker said last week the united states would have to go back 
to the drawing board on plans for middle east peace if israel 
rejected mubaraks ideas 
avi pazner another shamir aide said israel did not see bakers 
comment as a threat but added that the government would not bow to 
us pressure 
everybody knows you cant twist israels arm when you want to 
get something he told the associated press in a telephone 
interview 
yossi benaharon director of shamirs office said including 
deported palestinians in a negotiating team was a ploy to sneak the 
palestine liberation organization which israel defines as a 
terrorist group into the peace process 
peres the labor party leader noted that mubarak did not 
mention two arab demands israel has found most objectionable a 
direct role for the plo and creation of a palestinian state 
he criticized what he called shamirs effort to create a new 
palestinian people who agreed with israel on all points 
the opinions of the palestinians the sentiments of the 
palestinians must be known not only by every israeli but to 
every israeli politician he said on television we must 
negotiate with people who do not agree with us

a flood of potent mexican black tar heroin 
washed across san francisco over the weekend killing three users 
and sending dozens to hospitals with injuries ranging from broken 
bones to brain damage 
black tar heroin is pretty potent stuff anyway said police 
inspector sam osborne he said the drug normally sold on the street 
is 5 to 9 percent pure what we think is somebody forgot to cut 
it somewhere along the line 
between friday and monday morning three people died in san 
francisco and 54 others were treated for overdoses after they shot 
up the gooey black drug 
some users were unconscious and unable to breathe when reached 
by paramedics who administered an antidote called nalaxone 
overdose cases were reaching san francisco general and a few 
private hospitals at the rate of one an hour compared with the 
usual heroin overdose rate of one or two a day authorities said 
the fatalities were said to be men aged 35 41 and 43 the 
coroners office was not releasing their names on monday 
at the haightashbury free clinic medical director dr alex 
stalcup said the latest overdoses were the worst since a similar 
wave of overdoses and deaths in march 1987 that involved black 
tar mixed with fentanyl a pharmaceutical compound that can be 
1000 times more powerful than heroin it is used by 
anesthesiologists and redirected illicitly 
stalcup speculated that the same thing may have happened in the 
recent overdoses introduction of fentanyl into the drug scene 
several years ago resulted in a sudden rash of even more deaths he 
said today its often mixed with an adulterant and sold as china 
white he added 
black tar has become the most commonly used heroin by san 
franciscos estimated 15000 to 18000 addicts since coming on the 
scene about seven years ago stalcup said it sells for about 20 a 
bag that can be broken into several shots 
stalcup attributed its popularity to the ease of bringing it 
into the country in body pack bags attached to ones body 
compared with the difficulties of smuggling socalled china white 
from asia 
a 35yearold musician who spoke with the san francisco examiner 
while recovering at san francisco general said he uses heroin about 
once a week 
it hit me good real good he said i remember telling my 
friends that it almost was too good i sat back to enjoy it and 
just nodded off next thing i was waking up here 
while san francisco police pursued leads from overdose victims 
oakland police seized 4 pounds of black tar heroin worth about 2 
million and arrested five people in their largest heroin bust in 
more than 10 years 
last week federal drug enforcement administration agents seized 
2 kilos of black tar heroin at hotels near san francisco

an heiress who donated 65 million to an 
evangelical christian group won a battle to recover most of the 
money monday when the us supreme court refused to hear the 
groups appeal of an order to repay her 
im thrilled said department store heiress elizabeth dayton 
dovydenas i think this decision shows that the supreme court 
does not protect bogus preachers 
the court without comment let stand rulings that the group 
the bible speaks received the donations after exerting undue 
influence on mrs dovydenas 
a lot of aspects of it arent over yet but this was the 
biggest part she said 
mrs dovydenas joined the bible speaks in 1982 within three 
years she donated more than 65 million including contributions 
of 5 million 1 million and 500000 
mrs dovydenas family in late 1985 hired two deprogrammers 
to talk to her she later left the bible speaks and sued to have 
her gifts returned 
the case was first heard in us bankruptcy court after the 
church petitioned for chapter 11 protection maintaining that mrs 
dovydenas lawsuit could force it into insolvency a judge ruled in 
her behalf and a trustee was appointed the 1st us circuit court 
of appeals upheld her claim to only 55 million saying the other 
1 million had been donated in good faith 
the appeal acted on monday challenged only that portion of the 
appeals court decision concerning the 5 million in gifts 
at issue was whether allowing mrs dovydenas to rescind her 
gifts violated the the bible speaks religious freedom 
attorneys for the bible speaks had argued that mrs dovydenas 
money was used for the purposes she specified including the 
construction of a new chapel a swimming pool and other 
improvements at the churchs headquarters they maintained the 
lower court rulings threaten all religious groups but they are 
of especially grave concern to evangelical and fundamentalist 
religious communities 
church leaders have since abandoned the former prep school in 
lenox that had served as the churchs headquarters the former 
pastor now works in baltimore for a group called the greater 
grace 
i am very disappointed that the supreme court has chosen not 
to grant our petition to hear this case there were many issues 
involved that should have been addressed and now they will 
obviously go unanswered carl stevens founder of both groups 
said in a statement issued through a spokesman 
mrs dovydenas who acquired the lenox headquarters at a 
bankruptcy auction for a fraction of her claim while the case was 
under appeal said she now plans to sell the property 
mrs dovydenas an heir to the daytonhudson fortune grew up in 
minnesota some years ago after moving to lenox in 1981 with her 
husband she assessed her personal wealth at about 19 million

the hungarian communist party has 
rejected a proposal by romanian president nicolae ceausescu for 
warsaw pact intervention to prevent formation of polands new 
government led by noncommunists an official said monday 
geza kotai the communist partys secretary in charge of 
international affairs made the remark in an interview with the 
party newspaper nepszabadsag he was confirming reports published 
in a polish newspaper that said the hungarian communist party had 
received such a proposal from romanias communist party 
a prosolidarity polish newspaper gazeta wyborcza published 
articles friday saying ceausescu had summoned the polish ambassador 
in august to complain about the planned formation of a 
solidarityled government in poland 
it said ceausescu had decided to turn to the leaders of the 
warsaw pact to jointly act in favor of preventing a serious 
situation in poland in favor of defending socialism and the polish 
nation 
the report did not say if ceausescu had made such an appeal to 
other members of the warsaw pact a sevennation military alliance 
led by the soviet union 
but kotai said the hungarian communist party had received a call 
for intervention and we gave a definite rejection 
nepszabadsag quoted kotai as saying in present day europe 
the fate of a nation is decided by the majority of the society in 
that country and not by a single party 
last month solidarity journalist tadeusz mazowiecki became the 
leader of the polish government the first noncommunist prime 
minister in the soviet bloc 
hungarys communist party among the most liberal in the east 
bloc has agreed to hold free elections by june and has said it 
would surrender power if it loses and join the opposition 
we categorically reject the idea of any interference here and 
the warsaw treaty can give no grounds for such action kotai told 
the newspaper 
at recent warsaw pact meetings the members expressed the stand 
of noninterference in each others internal affairs

a west german diplomat rescued an 
east german grabbed by a policeman monday as he tried to scale a 
fence into bonns mission however most czechoslovak police 
relaxed their controls letting hundreds more refugees enter the 
compound as a new diplomatic dispute built up over the issue 
east german refugees inside the embassy said they numbered more 
than 2000 by late monday and more than 100 additional refugees 
were arriving hourly 
in a formal protest delivered to west german chancellor helmut 
kohls office east german envoy horst neubauer said his government 
demanded that the new refugees be turned out of the embassy and 
returned to east germany 
the latest rush came after 7000 east germans were allowed to 
leave west german embassies in prague and warsaw over the weekend 
for west germany 
more than 32000 east germans have arrived in west germany since 
sept 10 when hungary opened its western border with austria and 
the numbers of refugees occupying bonns embassies swelled 
on monday both east germany and czechoslovakia accused west 
germany of breaking its word by harboring new refugees going back 
on conditions it agreed to in gaining release of the earlier 
refugee throng 
kohl spokesman hans klein denied any such agreement and peter 
rothen a spokesman for the bonn foreign ministry insisted west 
germany never told the east germans it would stop taking in east 
germans seeking refuge 
west german officials said they would press east berlin to let 
the new arrivals leave for the west 
czechoslovak police continued patrols outside the embassy monday 
but relaxed controls on pedestrians and drivers witnesses reported 
nearly 10000 people marched through leipzig east germany on 
monday demanding legalization of opposition groups and adoption of 
democratic reforms it was the largest mass opposition 
demonstration since 1953 when workers rose throughout east germany 
in an illfated uprising later crushed by soviet tanks 
in warsaw poland an estimated 100200 refugees had arrived at 
the west german embassy about 800 left the embassy sunday for west 
germany 
bonn officials said soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze was instrumental in winning the release of east german 
refugees and that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was in 
touch with bonn on the matter 
east german opposition groups criticized their governments 
approval of the exodus declaring in a statement that east germany 
was losing a village every day it said reforms were the only 
reasonable solution 
more than 120000 east germans have reached west germany so far 
this year including those who left legally and illegally 
police at the embassy in prague were alternately harsh and 
lenient 
an east german man about 30 years old was seen climbing the 
fence to the embassy a policeman hung on exerting all his weight 
to bring the climber down refugees inside the fence clung to the 
man and shouted for help 
a diplomat ran outside the fence and put his arm around the 
refugee 
they walked away ringed by police and reporters a policeman 
pointed to an east german handcuffed to a park bench the diplomat 
arranged for the east german to be freed then led both men into 
the embassy 
refugees said czechoslovak officers patrolled the embassy area 
with dogs during the night a 26yearold woman said she her child 
and her husband were dragged away from the embassy fence during the 
night kicked and beaten by police 
later she said three other policemen helped the family and 
showed them the way to the missions entrance where they and 
others were admitted 
some refugees said east germans caught by police were detained 
then released elsewhere 
inside the embassy garden studded with tents that sheltered 
those who left over the weekend refugees got assistance for 
newcomers and helped others over the fence witnesses reported 
more east germans however were reported crossing the border 
from czechoslovakia to communist hungary and entering austria from 
hungary 
hungarys official news agency mti said 2880 people entered 
hungary from czechoslovakia over the weekend most of them east 
germans it said 24 people swam the danube between rajka and 
esztergom to cross into austria 
newly arrived east germans at the giessen west germany refugee 
reception center said monday they had been prepared to stay 
indefinitely in bonns mudfilled embassy in prague rather than 
return home 
i would have never gone back to east germany this was it 
said heinz schmidt a railway worker from magdeburg who spent eight 
days in a tent with his wife and teenage son 
he said the family never applied for permission to emigrate 
legally because certain harassment would follow 
you can lose your job once you apply you will be 
interrogated by the security police and soon you can drop out of 
sight schmidt said 
lutz gillert said he was demoted from chief doctor in a hospital 
near magdeburg after applying to leave five years ago and his son 
an excellent scholar was rejected when he tried to enter a 
university 
the officials made no secret of the reason they told us in 
writing it was because we wanted to emigrate gillert said 
several refugees at the bonn embassy in warsaw emphasized their 
material situation was quite good in east germany but their lives 
were constricted 
i am not poor said a 24yearold civil engineer who spoke 
on conditoin of anonymity but i have no future we see no chance 
for change we have no trouble with eating and drinking but we 
have our limits

converting an abandoned 28building 
factory into a 775 million contemporary art museum could 
revitalize this remote milltown consultants said monday 
a commission is working on such a museum but critics question 
whether art lovers would drive to north adams three hours 
northwest of boston four hours from new york for the stark 
enticements of contemporary art 
backers of the socalled massachusetts museum of contemporary 
art want to use a plant complex abandoned in 1984 by the towns 
largest employer sprague electric they want to convert the vast 
grimy plant into rooms of unique environmental works or sculptures 
sprague employed more than 1000 people before relocating to 
connecticut a draft of the consultants feasibility study projects 
the museum could employ 640 people in the town of 16000 people 
where unemployment is about 4 percent 
consultants hired by the commission project as many as 150000 
people would visit the museum in a year pumping 22 million into 
the regions economy 
the sheer reality of marketing this museum will depend in a 
certain extent to a creative approach said dennis bidwell one 
of the consultants 
the idea of turning the complex of 28 buildings into 350000 
square feet of gallery space was devised by thomas krens former 
director of the williams college art museum in the berkshires 
shortly after launching the project krens was named director of 
the guggenheim museum in new york 
plans for the museum call for an accompanying restaurant and 
luxury condominiums selling at 160000 to 250000 
the project will work don bonz another of the consultants 
told the commission monday during review of the draft study 
the commission is looking for 35 million from the state spread 
over four or five years the remaining 445 million would come 
from private donations 
members of the commission did not take final action on 
feasibility of the project they endorsed the draft study and 
scheduled a presentation to the state dec 11

the texas supreme court found glaring 
disparities etween the states rich and poor school districts and 
ruled monday that funding within the nations secondlargest system 
is unconstitutional 
spending varies by as much as 17000 per pupil per year from 
rich to poor districts the court found 
a remedy is long overdue justice oscar mauzys opinion 
said the legislature must take immediate action 
the 90 ruling could have enormous financial and social 
implications for the 33 millionstudent texas school system 
second in size to californias 
the court found the public school finance system violates the 
113yearold constitutional provision for an efficient system 
of public schools it set a may 1 1990 deadline for legislators 
to find a solution 
state attorneys had argued that the word efficient was 
intended to suggest a simple and inexpensive system 
but the court said the states school financing system is 
neither financially efficient nor efficient in the sense of 
providing for a general diffusion of knowledge statewide 
it must be recognized that the constitution requires an 
efficient not an economical inexpensive or cheap 
system mauzy said 
a bandaid will not suffice the system itself must be 
changed the court warned 
gov bill clements said he will call for a special 30day 
session of the legislature in the spring 
nearly 10 billion in state money will be made available for 
public schools in 199091 and almost 12 billion is expected to 
come from local districts 
a state district judge in austin ruled the school funding system 
was unconstitutional in a case brought by school districts with low 
property values against the state education commissioner and 
others that ruling was overturned last december by a 21 vote of 
the austinbased 3rd court of appeals 
the lawsuit known as edgewood vs kirby was filed in 1984 
public schools are funded largely through a combination of local 
property taxes and state aid the federal government also 
contributes 
because of the disparities in district property wealth annual 
spending per student ranges from 2112 to 19333 the high court 
said without placing an exact date for the figures 
the case got its title from the lead plaintiff edgewood 
independent school district in san antonio and lead defendant 
william kirby education commissioner 
edgewood superintendent james vasquez led about 1800 students 
and teachers in a celebration rally monday the high schools 
marching band played and students waved banners with sayings like 
victory and edgewood all the way a marquee at the 
stadiums entrance read texas children 9 kirby 0 
today we can begin to say were no longer the poorest school 
district in texas were the toughest vasquez told cheering 
students and teachers we took on the state of texas and we beat 
em 
also attending the gathering was demetrio rodriguez who 
launched the fight for equal school funding in 1968 when he and 
other edgewood parents filed a lawsuit that reached the us 
supreme court in 1973 but was defeated 
this is a big day for me and my family said rodriguez who 
has four children who graduated from the edgewood district and one 
who is a high school senior i cried this morning because it 
really is something that has been in my heart rodriguez said 
his voice cracking with emotion 
in dallas education commissioner kirby said as the lead 
defendant in this case i have been required to defend the 
constitutionality of the system but i have always maintained that 
it is not adequate and have pressed for additional amounts of money 
to improve equity 
now that the supreme court has ruled the system 
unconstitutional the legislature must create a system that is 
constitutional and that provides adequate funding to ensure a high 
quality education for all children in the state kirby said 
olivia ollie besteiro president of the texas state teachers 
association said history will mark this day as the opening of 
the door to opportunity for tens of thousands even millions of 
children 
these children have been the victims of segregated 
opportunity determined by a geographical roll of the dice 
similar rulings have been issued in other states the kentucky 
supreme court in june ordered an overhaul of that states schools

the opposition labor party abandoned 
its controversial policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament monday 
overturning the votelosing doctrine at its annual conference 
it also approved a motion urging israel to begin a dialogue with 
the palestine liberation organization and called the palestinian 
uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip a just 
revolt 
israel refuses to negotiate with the plo which it describes as 
a terrorist group bent on destroying the jewish state 
the motion said that since israel seized the territories in the 
1967 middle east war the israeli military occupation has 
prevented the palestinians from living under their own chosen form 
of government and enjoying civil and political rights 
delegates reaffirmed previous party positions backing the right 
of both palestinians and israelis to states with internationally 
recognized borders and calling the plo the only legitimate 
representative of the palestinians 
it referred to the 21monthold uprising in the west bank and 
gaza strip as the just revolt of the palestinian people calling 
for an end to the iron fist policy of the israeli military 
and a withdrawal from the occupied territories 
after sometimes heated debate delegates voted for a policy that 
commits a labor party government to give up britains nuclear 
arsenal only as part of a negotiated arms deal 
dismayed left wingers hung peace symbols from balconies in the 
conference hall as speakers warned that the socialist movement must 
change or suffer a fourth successive election defeat by 
conservative prime minister margaret thatcher 
it puts us in a very strong position to argue for an effective 
and realistic initiative and to get verifiable nuclear arms 
agreements party leader neil kinnock said after the vote on the 
first full day of the weeklong conference 
delegates at the convention in this south england resort cast 
votes totaling 36 million to 24 million to ditch unilateral 
nuclear disarmament after leaders of big moderate trade unions 
swung behind kinnock 
there are 1500 conference delegates but the votes are counted 
in the millions because the leaders of trade union that control 90 
percent of the voting power cast blocks of tens of thousands of 
votes based on the memberships of their unions 
in a victory for party leftists the conference voted by a 42 
margin for a labor government to cut defense expenditures by 
onefourth bringing it in line with the average in other west 
european members of nato 
under the new policy a labor government would retain britains 
submarinelaunched polaris nuclear missiles it would also stick to 
mrs thatchers decision to replace them in the early 1990s with 
us trident missiles which are nine times more powerful than 
polaris missiles 
legislator tony benn a former energy secretary and doyen of the 
labor left accused the party of betraying the basis of our whole 
policy 
britain does not need nuclear weapons there is no soviet 
nuclear threat that is the challenge we cannot ignore declared 
benn to cheers from sections of the conference hall 
a succession of speakers cited strides in superpower arms 
control negotiations since soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev took 
office and they said a new labor policy suited the improved 
eastwest relations 
but others argued simply that labor must change to win 
we know it is the policy which is at fault not the 
presentation said delegate sylvia heal the leadership has 
been accused of betrayal but the people who will be guilty of 
betrayal are those who by their actions ensure thatchers return 
for another term 
labor adopted its policy on nuclear weapons in 1981 as the party 
lurched left after losing power to mrs thatcher two years 
previously 
polls show the policy was a major factor in labors two 
subsequent defeats by mrs thatcher in 1983 and 1987 she must call 
the next election by mid1992 
dropping the nonnuclear doctrine was part of a major new policy 
platform aimed at shifting the party toward the center the 
conference is to vote on the changes the result of a twoyear 
review through the week

the sony walkman the dictaphone and the 
braun coffeemaker were successful industrial designs that are the 
focus of designers gathered to look for an edge on products of the 
future 
those products succeeded because their companies took their 
industrial designers seriously said earl powell director of the 
design management institute of boston which is conducting a 
fourday symposium with the harvard business school 
most business managers say they use engineers or others to 
create a product and then get the flakes to get the color picked 
out powell said 
powell one of those flakes by training said designers can 
be the consumers advocate inside the firm choosing the right size 
knobs and switches that can make a product work easily or not 
yamaha corp which had an electronic saxaphone in the exhibit 
used its designers to find a modern shape that would match the new 
technology of digital wind music 
the first design was described by one yamaha worker as a snake 
that ate a lunch box several versions later the final product 
resembles a futuristic rifle embellished with the standard finger 
pads in black the instrument is a long black tube bent down at 
one end for the mouthpiece 
the sound that emerges from the instrument can range from 
synthesized voices to the acoustic timbres of wind instruments the 
product dominates the professional wind digital music market 
according to yamaha 
designers at ab bahco vertyg the tools division of the 
investment ab bahco of sweden helped the company maintain its 
share in the screwdriver market while increasing its profit margin 
by 20 percent said powell 
the company had discovered in market research that carpenters 
use a twohanded grip 70 percent of the time and gave the problem 
to its designers 
the new screwdriver which was presented at the exhibit is 
shaped like the numeral 8 with textured polypropylene where the 
handle widens 
at braun business managers faced the problem of an extremely 
low share of the coffeemaker market the kf20 model introduced in 
1972 had won awards for its simple cylindrical design but it was 
too expensive 
artists and designers would collect our things to add to their 
collections but we were not succesful said dieter rems the 
companys chief designer who spoke at the symposium monday 
the solution which included cheaper materials and fewer parts 
may not seem that innovative at first glance but rems said the new 
design marketed as the kf40 used one heater for both coffee and 
water instead of two which cut the price dramatically 
more than 25 million units of the new design sold in 1988 
giving braun a 12 percent market share the company makes 12000 
units a day 
rems said having the designers talk to the manufacturers was a 
crucial element in the braun story because the design could be 
adapted to cut production costs 
powell said he thinks if american businesses adopted more of 
these tactics the competitiveness of us products would improve 
vastly 
designers are still supposed to pick the right color though 
dallasbased texas instruments wanted its new educational toy a 
headset computer to appeal to both boys and girls 
but the companys research showed that boys liked black headsets 
and girls liked lavender and each sex hated the others top choice 
the result is a grand compromise a slategray headset with 
cushioning foam done in purple yellow blue green and magenta

supreme court justice john paul stevens will 
not take part in a key illinois case over abortion rights to be 
decided during the 198990 term a court spokeswoman said monday 
stevens had not disqualified himself when the justices agreed 
last july 3 to review the case one of three abortion disputes 
before the high court this term 
but a minor court order issued in the illinois case monday noted 
that stevens did not participate 
asked about that court spokeswoman toni house said the justice 
had disqualified himself from the case for unstated reasons 
stevens was one of four dissenters from the courts decision 
last july letting states make abortions harder to get he has 
provided a consistent vote in support of the 1973 court decision 
that women have a constitutional right to abortion 
the illinois case focuses on a state law that would require 
abortion clinics to add services and equipment now found only in 
hospitals 
the law could force many clinics to close down and could add up 
to 50 to the cost of an abortion performed in the first three 
months of pregnancy 
in invalidating the law lower courts said it violated a portion 
of the 1973 ruling in roe vs wade that limited state regulation 
over firsttrimester abortions 
illinois officials are not asking the justices to use the 
illinois case to reverse roe vs wade but legal experts say the 
courts ruling could chip away at the trimesterbytrimester 
approach taken in the 1973 decision 
the two other abortion cases under high court study this term 
focus on parental notification requirements for unwed minors 
seeking to end their pregnancies in minnesota and ohio stevens has 
not disqualified himself from those cases 
the illinois case is turnock vs ragsdale 88790

ptl founder jim bakker testified monday 
at his fraud trial that he and his wife tammy accepted 31 
million in bonuses while the ministrys finances foundered 
bakker said ptl board members granted the bonuses of their own 
free will and often told him i was worth much more than this 
and they would say that over and over again 
bakker left the witness stand monday completing 10 hours of 
testimony that began friday both sides rested their cases monday 
with closing arguments scheduled for tuesday the case could go to 
the jury as early as wednesday 
the disgraced television evangelist testified that he raised 
more than 425 million for ptl from 1984 to 1987 when he and his 
wife received 31 million in bonuses 
bakker was asked by his lawyer george davis what he did with 
the 425 million 
i put it to the work of jesus christ he said 
during defense questioning bakker summed up his defense we 
were a church and people always wanted to run it like a business 
i had to keep telling them this was a church not a business 
as bakker left court during a break he was smiling saying i 
feel fine he turned to davis and said this is a nice place to 
visit but i didnt plan to live here 
in other testimony mc benton the trustee overseeing the 
ministrys property since it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection from creditors testified ptl was 50 million in debt 
and had 160 million in claims against it from lifetime 
partners when bakker resigned in march 1987 
bakker 49 is charged with 15 counts of wire fraud eight 
counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire and 
mail fraud bakker is accused of diverting more than 37 million 
in ptl money for his own benefit and of conspiring to defraud ptl 
followers to support his lifestyle 
if convicted he faces up to 120 years in prison and more than 
5 million in fines 
richard dortch ptls former executive vice president was 
sentenced aug 24 to eight years in prison and fined 200000 under 
a plea bargain dortch pleaded guilty to two counts of wire fraud 
and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy and testified 
against bakker 
at the heart of the governments case is the charge that bakker 
failed to live up to his promises of providing lodging at ptl 
facilities for nearly 153000 partners people who sent in 
gifts of 1000 or more 
bakker is accused of diverting money from 158 million in 
contributions solicited to build lodging for donors bakker 
testified friday that based on his own calculations he could 
accommodate more than 211000 partners 
your long list of available lodging for the partners is 
really a recent fabrication you prepared for this trial special 
prosecutor deborah smith asked bakker 
thats a lie he responded 
christine howe a supervisor at ptls heritage grand hotel 
testified she had to turn away thousands of guests each month 
because there was no room for them 
ms smith said bakker failed to tell ptl board members about the 
ministrys money problems 
i dont know how the board members could not be aware of the 
financial crisis at heritage usa bakker testified they knew 
we had cash flow problems and they voted to borrow funds to pay for 
them 
ms smith asked bakker if he was contradicting testimony from 
six board members who said they didnt know about the ministrys 
financial problems 
i would tell them we were in great financial need they were 
always up to date on all the financial information bakker said 
i gave them the information to the best of my ability 
but bakker later acknowledged he may have painted a rosy picture 
of ptls finances to fellow board members 
i was a minister he said i did my best to keep them 
informed and i know i was positive in the face of turmoil at times 
i preached faith

a senior state department official said monday 
more fighting might occur in indochina but the united states hopes 
a more constructive soviet role could help revive the stalled 
cambodian peace process and avert civil war 
unfortunately there is a prospect of more fighting in the 
southeast asian country deputy assistant secretary of state 
david f lambertson told a senate foreign relations subcommittee 
but we hope it is not prolonged since the failed peace 
conference at paris in august was not the final chapter 
lambertson said 
vietnamese intransigence at that conference is one reason 
the united states believes it is premature to normalize relations 
with vietnam and will try to maintain the diplomatic and economic 
isolation of vietnam lambertson said 
in the current situation we plan to steadfastly maintain our 
support for the diplomatic and economic isolation of vietnam as a 
reminder that attempts to manipulate international opinion will 
not provide a real basis for improved relations with other 
countries lambertson said 
he testified as critics of us cambodian policy warned of a 
fourth indochina war in the current dry season and attacked 
usbacked prince norodom sihanouks alliance with the communist 
khmer rouge blamed for more than 1 million cambodian deaths during 
the regimes 197578 rule over the country 
dith pran the cambodianborn photographer whose escape from the 
khmer rouge was portrayed in the motion picture the killing 
fields said the breakdown at paris means that cambodians are 
being forced by their leaders to go to the killing fields again 
pran said international pressure is needed to force the 
cambodian factions back to the negotiating table 
at paris the soviets were frankly quite passive about 
pressing for compromise on the part of their ally vietnam and 
prime minister hun sens vietnambacked cambodian government 
lambertson said 
but he said the united states is encouraged by subsequent 
useful discussions about cambodia between secretary of state 
james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
at their recent meetings in wyoming and at the united nations 
the united states blames collapse of the paris conference on the 
refusal of vietnam and hun sen to agree to share power with 
sihanouk in an interim cambodian government 
we will continue to work on resolving the cambodian conflict 
with the soviets in the context of the united nations the 
continuing paris conference process and on a bilateral basis 
lambertson said we hope these discussions will result in a more 
constructive soviet role in this process 
he said the two superpowers have agreed on the need for a 
political settlement and a continuation of the negotiating 
process on the importance of averting both increased bloodshed 
and the return of the pol pot khmer rouge regime to power and 
declared our readiness to announce together with other states a 
moratorium on military assistance to all cambodian factions as part 
of a comprehensive settlement 
lambertson said vietnam appeared to have met its pledge to 
withdraw its military forces from cambodia late last month ending 
an 11year occupation while there was no evidence to back reports 
of massive numbers remaining the withdrawal should be verified 
as part of an overall political settlement he said 
us government assistance to the noncommunist resistance has 
been and continues to be nonlethal lambertson said an apparent 
reference to recent reports from the area about weapons assistance 
in the days ahead he said it is critical to maintain support 
for prince sihanouk and the other noncommunist cambodians he 
said 
but sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the east asian and 
pacific affairs subcommittee said the united states had pursued a 
morally bankrupt policy of backing sihanouks insistence on 
including the khmer rouge in an interim cambodian government not 
because we supported the khmer rouge but because we supported 
prince sihanouk

imelda marcos pledged in a radio 
interview broadcast tuesday to return to the united states to stand 
trial on racketeering charges if allowed to leave and bury her 
husband in the philippines 
supporters of former president ferdinand marcos asked the 
philippine supreme court on monday to lift the ban on returning his 
body to his homeland for burial and let marcos widow and three 
children return 
the high court was to consider the appeal at its regular weekly 
session tuesday 
marcos died thursday at age 72 in hawaii he had lived there in 
exile after a popular uprising in february 1986 ended his 20year 
presidency 
president corazon aquino banned return of his remains and barred 
members of his family saying a marcos burial in his homeland could 
ignite unrest marcos supporters have been linked to repeated coup 
attempts though protests since he died have been small and 
peaceful 
us authorities have banned mrs marcos from leaving the united 
states she is to stand trial in new york in march on us charges 
of embezzling philippine government funds and using some of the 
money for us investments 
i will have to go back to new york because i have to face the 
indictment she told manila radio station dzxl in an interview 
from honolulu what i am defending here is not only the marcos 
name but the entire nation 
mrs marcos who is free on 5 million bail claimed the 
indictment against her tarnished the filipino nation philippine 
officials believe the marcos family and their associates made off 
with up to 10 billion in embezzled money kickbacks and other 
funds during his administration 
they have spat on filipinos here mrs marcos said is it 
because our color is brown no i am going back to new york 
she claimed marcos remained the legitimate president of the 
philippines until his death 
he is the real president she is illegal mrs marcos said 
referring to mrs aquino this irregularity should be brought to 
all the courts of the world 
the appeal filed monday said the ban against marcos violates the 
philippine constitution and mrs aquinos commitment to due process 
what we are asking for is for the family to be allowed to come 
back and bury the president said nicanor yniguez leader of 
marcos new society movement party 
francisco chavez the philippines chief law officer said the 
government will argue that the issue is political not legal 
on sept 15 the court ruled in an 87 decision that marcos 
return would pose a security threat 
the appeal said marcos death should completely remove 
apprehension however unfounded as to both his intent and 
capability to destabilize conditions in the country 
it argued that mrs aquinos inability or failure to assure 
stability has been used to impair individual rights 
rolando abadilla marcos former manila area intelligence chief 
said the marcos group will organize a march on manila from marcos 
birthplace in sarrat 250 miles to the north if the petition is 
rejected 
abadilla vice governor of marcos home province of ilocos 
norte has been linked to previous coup attempts against mrs 
aquino 
former sen arturo tolentino marcos running mate in 1986 
suggested the body be flown to laoag capital of ilocos norte 
instead of manila and buried there laoag is about 250 miles north 
of the capital

the soviet foreign minister called monday for an 
international new deal to avert an impending economic disaster 
fueled by militarization third world debt poverty and 
environmental problems 
right before our eyes the world is sliding into a deep 
economic depression eduard shevardnadze said in a speech in 
manhattan sponsored by the foreign policy association 
the debt of the third world countries the interest they have 
to pay and the pace of their economic development are these not 
the signs of an impending catastrophe 
he added we could one day begin competing not for political 
supremacy or spheres of influence but for access to water fresh 
air and even a green lawn 
shevardnadze told the audience of about 350 people that the 
abolition of nuclear weapons forgiveness of some third world debts 
and increased protection for the environment will be essential for 
peace and worldwide stability in the next century 
radical bold steps are needed a kind of new deal a 
transition to a policy that would draw developing countries into 
the scientific technological and information revolution he said 
in the 1930s during the great depression president franklin d 
roosevelt promised americans a new deal of governmentsponsored 
social welfare programs 
shevardnadze compared pessimism over the future of perestroika 
the economic liberalization of the soviet union to pessimism over 
the future of capitalism during the 1930s in the united states 
he noted that in 1931 100000 americans requested permission to 
emigrate to the soviet union 
there were bread lines in new yorks times square and tents of 
the jobless huddled along riverside drive he said adding it 
is well known that in those years there were widespread 
expectations in leftwing circles that the severe crisis of the 
world capitalist system would finally bring about the world 
revolution 
he said the soviet unions economic system is undergoing an 
adjustment something similar happened in the unites states 60 
years ago 
but he predicted that so long as there is the will the 
understanding of the situation and the determination to change 
things for the better and we certainly have them the economy 
can remedy its ills

the house on monday overwhelmingly approved 
president bushs compromise plan to extend steel import 
restrictions on 29 foreign trading partners until april 1992 
the vote was 35410 
bushs plan announced july 25 called for immediate 
negotiations with japan south korea and other leading 
steelexporting nations to extend annual limitations on the volume 
of steel allowed to be shipped to the united states 
the original pacts which expired saturday were negotiated by 
the reagan administration in 1984 to give domestic steelmakers 
breathing space from subsidized foreign competition 
many steeldistrict lawmakers had pushed the administration this 
summer to extend the curbs for five years but bush opted for a 
smallerscale 2year program in deference to steelusing 
manufacturers who argued that the quotas have driven up steel 
prices and caused supply shortages of some steel products 
the compromise all but eliminated debate on the house floor 
opposition came largely from freetraders who felt the steel 
industry has had enough protection 
its not my first choice said rep bill frenzel rminn 
who had opposed the industrys requests for a longer extension 
nevertheless i have to admit its about as good a compromise as 
could be achieved 
rep joseph gaydos dpa who represents a western pennsylvania 
steel district said the reagan and bush program is not a 
cureall but has been the most effective method of dealing with 
dumped imports 
this legislation is basically and fundamentally giving the 
steel industry in this country a little more time to become 
competitive and theyre well underway gaydos said 
sen bob packwood rore has introduced a companion measure in 
the senate but no action on it has yet been taken 
with the old steel program due to expire sept 30 the bush 
administration could not afford to wait until congress acted to 
begin the painstaking process of negotiating new import ceilings 
trade representatives from japan south korea the european 
community mexico venezuela and romania were all in town last week 
for meetings on renewing their pacts 
many of the negotiations are already complete according to us 
trade representative carla hills even though congress has not yet 
finished work on the bill she said steel imports would continued 
to be monitored by the department of commerce and the us customs 
service 
no details on individual pacts have yet been announced

former world champion anatoly karpov drew with 
fellow soviet artur yusupov in their first game monday in a battle 
among four top chess grandmasters to decide the challenger to 
reigning champion garri kasparov 
jan timman of the netherlands and british grandmaster jon 
speelman adjourned on the 60th move in the other game in the world 
championship candidates semifinal at sadlers wells ballet theater 
in london 
timman was a pawn ahead in an endgame but most experts predicted 
a draw when play resumes 
kasparov in the 13th annual interpolis chess tournament in 
tilburg holland on monday earned the highest rating record in the 
history of the game shattering us player bobby fischers 1972 
record 
the soviet champion by defeating norways simen agdestein in 
the final round won 12 points out of 14 matches the best 
tournament record ever a win scores one point and a draw half a 
point 
this entitled 26yearold kasparov to a total of 2795 points on 
the international ranking list of the world chess federation known 
by the french initials fide 
fischers 1972 record was 2785 points 
although the next rating list will not be officially published 
before jan 1 kasparov who plans no further tournament 
appearances this year seems certain of his record 
the second round in the semifinals in london will be played 
tuesday 
the two winners of the semifinals contest will meet in the 
candidates final scheduled for march in london 
the winner will challenge kasparov for his world title in a 
24game contest in october 1990 
playing with the disadvantage of the black pieces karpov 
quickly neutralized yusupovs opening advantage and exchanged both 
pairs of rooks to reach an endgame where neither side could make 
meaningful progress 
after further exchanges yusupov forced a draw on the 44th move 
timman playing white gained an early opening initiative 
speelman mistakes on the 17th and 21st moves let timman reach an 
endgame with an extra pawn and superior placed pieces 
its just one of those days when you miss everything said 
british grandmaster nigel short the third ranked player in the 
world of speelmans early play 
but having gained a winning position timman failed to find 
several promising continuations and speelman put up the toughest of 
defenses 
in the adjourned position each side has a rook timman has 
three pawns and speelman two 
it looks like a draw now said short after timman sealed his 
61st move timman missed a lot of chances 
karpov 38 is heavily favored to knock out the 29yearold 
yusupov the outcome of the timmanspeelman contest remains in the 
words of british grandmaster daniel king completely unclear 
karpov ranked second in the world held the world title for 10 
years before losing to kasparov in november 1985 karpov is famous 
for his socalled creeping style which analysts say squeezes the 
play out of his opponents position like a boa constrictor squeezes 
the life from its prey he has never lost to yusupov 
yusupov the worlds 14th ranked player rose to prominence in 
1977 when he won the world under20 championship at age 17 
he will be hoping for a repeat of karpovs astonishing collapse 
at a june tournament in rotterdam in the netherlands over a 
dramatic final three rounds karpov lost every game for the first 
time in his long career 
the winner of that tournament was timman a 37yearold who is 
ranked eighth in the world by virtue of his formidable 
performances timman was for many years the top western grandmaster 
and in 1987 a magnificent run of victories put him within striking 
distance of karpov 
speelman who celebrated his 33rd birthday monday is ranked 
13th in the world he has a solid and tricky playing style 
punctuated with flashes of brilliance 
speelman in the sixgame quarter final defeated short by 
3515 
speelman said of the semifinals in his column in londons 
newspaper the sunday correspondent before karpovs collapse at 
the end of rotterdam i would have rated him the overwhelming 
favorite against artur yusupov now i put him at about 7030 i 
rate jan timman favorite by about 5545 but will strive mightily 
to upset these odds 
the winner of each contest will receive 77000 the loser 
46000 
if the matches are tied 44 after eight games two more games 
will be played if it is still tied the rules call for sudden 
death games 
the international chess federation has scheduled the 1990 title 
final for lyon france starting oct 7

rival colombian drug cartels may be joining 
forces to keep smuggling and distribution lines open during their 
governments crackdown a federal agent investigating a record 
cocaine seizure said monday 
drug agents were surprised to find cocaine from both the 
medellin and cali cartels in a los angeles warehouse that housed 20 
tons of cocaine said john m zienter the drug enforcement 
administrations special agent for los angeles 
it very well could be that based on the pressure in colombia 
this is a way cartels are trying to get much of the cocaine out of 
the country and to maintain distribution channels said zienter 
who declined to say exactly how much of the cocaine was from the 
two cartels named for the cities where they are based 
dea spokesman cornelius dougherty in washington said he did not 
believe it was unusual for the cartels to work together 
theyre not as competitive as might be the public perception 
when it comes to what is the best most profitable way to 
distribute the cocaine he said what works for one will work 
for the other 
seven men were arrested thursday and friday in los angeles and 
las vegas in connection with the 20ton seizure thursday 
arrested thursday in los angeles were james romero mctague 41 
of el paso and mauricio monroy 36 of mexico city on friday 
authorities arrested hugo fernando castillon 32 of sherman oaks 
and miguel garcia chavez 34 of panorama city who sometimes uses 
the alias ronald reagan 
the four men arrested in los angeles appeared before a municipal 
court judge who agreed to postpone their arraignments on various 
drug charges until oct 6 the men were ordered to remain in jail 
without bail 
authorities said they plan to eventually consolidate the cases 
in a federal action 
these are the major drug dealers not just the runners said 
los angeles county district attorney ira reiner they are as 
large as they get outside colombia 
one of the men arrested in las vegas carlos tapia ponce was 
described by authorities as a former customs inspector for the 
mexican government who became a major drug smuggling player 
tapia ponce 68 was arrested at the flamingo hilton hotel in 
las vegas along with his son hector tapia anchondo 38 and 
hector eduardo tapia ponce 66 the brother of carlos the drug 
enforcement agency said federal officials said monday they did not 
have enough evidence to charge the brother in the case 
the father and son case appeared before us magistrate lawrence 
leavitt in las vegas on monday but refused to identify themselves 
on the advice of their defense attorney david chesnoff 
leavitt set an identity hearing for friday to be followed by a 
detention hearing where motions for bail will be argued they are 
being held without bail 
leavitt set an identity hearing for friday to be followed by a 
detention hearing where motions for bail will be argued they are 
being held without bail chesnoff also requested a preliminary 
hearing for the two which under law must be held within 10 days 
tapia ponce apparently ran the mexican operation said special 
assistant us attorney susan bryantdeason 
he picks up the ball once it is in his country and moves back 
into the hands of the colombians in la said ms bryantdeason 
the rest of the men work for him anybody who gets that close to 
that much narcotics is an extremely trusted part of the 
organization 
in the los angeles raid authorities acting on a tip knocked 
apart a 6 padlock on adrianas pottery warehouse in suburban 
sylmar 25 miles northwest of los angeles and found 40000 pounds 
of cocaine worth between 2 billion and 20 billion on the street 
also found was 10 million in cash 
it was the worlds largest drug seizure topping the previous 
record of 12 tons seized in colombia 
the seizure also signaled the existence of a major drug route in 
which the drugs are shipped from colombia to mexico taken across 
the border through el paso texas and shipped probably by truck 
to los angeles for american distribution 
on friday officials raided six warehouses in el paso as well as 
three homes in juarez mexico authorities said the warehouses were 
used as staging sites before the cocaine was transported to los 
angeles 
ray sepulveda dea special agent in el paso said his agents 
discovered an underground storage facility being excavated in one 
of six warehouses he and his men raided in east el paso 
dea agents who tore down a false wall found a concealed room 
about the size of a living room he said 
they had been digging a pit down about 20 feet it would have 
been a good hiding place for narcotics sepulveda told the el 
paso heraldpost 
drug agents in california meanwhile had begun destroying the 
20 tons of cocaine said zienter the 10 million had been 
deposited into a downtown los angeles bank

worst oil spill on march 24 said the oil giant was not trying to 
avoid responsibility for the wreck of the exxon valdez 
instead he said a recognition that chance often has a say in 
human affairs does allow a more dispassionate view of what 
happened 
a breath analysis of former tanker capt joseph hazelwood taken 
nine hours after the accident revealed his bloodalcohol level was 
06 the coast guard limit is 04 investigators also are 
questioning why a third mate was at the helm as the tanker was 
navigated through glacial ice floes while hazelwood apparently was 
in his quarters 
stevens whose speech was interrupted three times by hecklers 
said the oil spill had hurt his professional pride but he said he 
was satisfied with exxons billiondollar cleanup was having 
results 
he said summerlong efforts to treat tarred alaska beaches had 
produced very remarkable progress 
should we let chance events which could happen prevent us from 
taking risk he asked 
without accepting risk he said there could have been no 
oilfields at prudhoe bay and no transalaska pipeline without 
them he said alaskans would have been denied a share in oil 
development wealth 
stevens said managing risk was a related valdez lesson if great 
undertakings are forfeited or delayed because of the risk of 
accident stevens said the country and all of us will be the 
poorer 
we all have some stake in alaska oil he said noting that 
the states oil meets 25 percent of us demand stevens said 
soaring imports unrest in the mideast and few viable oil and gas 
alternatives all remind him of conditions from the mid1970s that 
led to us gasoline shortages 
development will continue to focus on alaska stevens said 
since analysts have predicted as much as a third of the nations 
undiscovered oil is here 
stevens also said he was satisfied that exxon policies regarding 
tanker captain training and alcohol use on the job are adequate he 
said the oil spill was like a bad dream he said it had 
prompted a review of company policy which stevens said was 
determined to be sound 
i dont mean that to sound as if we are selfsatisfied 
stevens told a crowd of about 600 clearly procedures werent 
followed he said

angolas foreign minister indicated monday 
that if the united states continues aiding jonas savimbis unita 
rebels the withdrawal of cuban troops from his country might be 
halted 
pedro de castro van dunem claimed us officials repeatedly told 
angola that washington would extend diplomatic recognition to 
angola and end aid to the rebels if angola agreed to the cuban 
troop withdrawal 
the united states and south africa have linked the removal of an 
estimated 50000 cuban soldiers in angola by mid1991 to south 
africas agreement to cooperate with a un plan to grant 
independence to namibia by april 1990 
chester crocker former us assistant secretary of state for 
african affairs said in a telephone interview monday the united 
states did not promise to end aid to unita or to give diplomatic 
recognition to angola 
he mediated the accords last year between south africa angola 
and cuba on namibia and the cuban withdrawal 
in 1988 we did not make any commitment in principle or 
otherwise as the united states to end aid to unita crocker 
said south africa did he said 
crocker said in december that washington would not end its 
support for unita while angola received military aid from the 
soviet union 
in an interview at un headquarters van dunem was asked if the 
us aid to unita might mean the cuban troops would remain in 
angola he said we have not discussed this question but it can 
be a question 
in august when six cuban soldiers were killed in a rebel 
ambush cuban president fidel castro said further attacks can 
unfavorably influence compliance with the timetable for the cuban 
troops withdrawal from the peoples republic of angola 
both savimbi and angolan officials are taking their case to 
washington 
van dunem said he has requested a meeting with secretary of 
state james a baker iii 
savimbi is in washington seeking continued aid to the rebels 
national union for the total independence of angola unita 
unita has been battling angolas marxist government since 1975 
when the country gained its independence from portugal and the 
sovietbacked popular liberation movement of angola won a brief 
civil war 
cuba sent troops to angola to help the government battle the 
rebels 
a change in the scheduled withdrawal of the cubans could 
jeopardize the planned independence for south africanruled 
namibia also known as southwest africa 
unita and angola signed a peace accord june 22 and declared a 
ceasefire effective two days later but it broke down within weeks 
amid charges of violations 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said recently 
that un military observers confirmed 15927 cuban personnel left 
angola by aug 1 and the rate of departure was fully consistent 
with a timetable calling for complete withdrawal by mid1991

converging on prague and warsaw now that east berlin has allowed

fierce protests when hungarys liberal leaders opened their border 
to the west and thousands of east germans fled

the soviet union is a nuclear superpower 
saddled with a third world economy and that situation wont change 
any time soon even with mikhail gorbachevs reform efforts many 
soviet experts believe 
if anything these analysts said the soviet economy is in worse 
shape now than when gorbachev launched his perestroika or 
restructuring program 
he is facing the need to slash a huge budget deficit in half 
while at the same time coping with an economy which went into a 
nosedive in the spring even as inflation was heating up 
the soviet economy has fallen behind said howard wachtel 
an economics professor at american university in washington when 
you take off the tight controls of a command system you lose the 
threat over people and you get a drop in productivity unless you 
replace it with something else like market incentives

fernando collor de mello the 
independent candidate in brazils first presidential election by 
popular vote in 29 years has lost ground in opinion polls but 
still remains far in front of 22 other candidates 
in the most recent survey for the nov 15 balloting by the 
newspaper folha de sao paulo collor de mello was the choice of 33 
percent of the voters down from more than 40 percent four months 
ago 
the populist leonel brizola his most vehement adversary had 15 
percent and luis inacio lula da silva of the leftwing workers 
party a frontrunner early on had 7 percent 
the private polling organization ibope on sept 28 gave collor 
de mello 35 percent brizola 14 percent and da silva 8 percent 
all other candidates came below the top three in both polls 
collor de mello ideologically rightofcenter and running under 
the banner of the newly formed national reconstruction party 
promotes himself as an independent without ties to vested 
interests he promises to launch an allout war on what he says is 
a corrupt government bureaucracy 
theres a tremendous sense of moral outrage out there a 
disgust with the status quo said eli diniz a political science 
professor at the university research institute of rio de janeiro 
collor de mello running as the anticandidate and 
antipolitician has capitalized on it 
but political opponents charge that collor de mello is guilty of 
the same kind of corruption he vows to eliminate 
the man is a hoax said rep vivaldo barbosa of brizolas 
democratic labor party 
in august barbosa delivered a 228page report to the justice 
ministry containing allegations of corruption during collors 
tenure as governor of the poor northeastern state of alagoas from 
january 1987 to this past may the accusations are now being 
investigated 
the report charges that 
he gave a 400000 state contract to a company owned by a close 
political associate zelia cardoso de mello no relative without 
competitive bidding 
he named thousands to state jobs just before he resigned as 
governor to run for president 
he spent almost 1 million on official propaganda extolling his 
administrations work during his last five months in office and 
more than half the money went to media outlets owned by his family 
around 1987 a state bank exchanged a debt of 124000 with the 
familyowned business tv gazeta for free commercials on the station 
as well as on three radio stations and for advertisments in a 
newspaper owned by the family 
he spent more than 1 million in state money intended for 
emergency expenditures more than 5000 percent above what was 
budgeted from january to may and some of the money was used to 
buy gifts of flowers crystal and silverware for friends and 
political colleagues 
the charges run headon with collor de mellos image as an 
austere corruption fighter who cracked down on politicians and 
public servants 
collor de mello is best known for his refusal as governor to pay 
the exorbitant salaries of an elite group of state employees known 
as maharajas 
some of these functionaries by combining two or three 
government jobs but not really working at them were amassing 
paychecks of up to 10000 a month in contrast to brazils montly 
minimum wage of about 70 
the battle with the maharajas is the centerpiece of collor de 
mellos presidential campaign 
he also has gained support by sharply criticizing president jose 
sarney who many brazilians blame for soaring inflation of more 
than 1000 percent annually and rampant corruption 
direct presidential votes were banned by a rightwing military 
regime that ruled the country from 1964 to 1985 sarney the first 
new civilian chief took office in march 1985 following a vote by 
an electoral college made up of congressmen and state 
representatives 
collor de mellos campaign office has provided literature 
responding to some of the allegations against the candidate 
according to the material 
the contract with zelia cardoso de mello was legal no bidding 
was necessary as she was clearly qualified for the job 
with collor de mello as governor alagoas was among the three 
states that spent the least on official propaganda what 
advertising occurred was placed where it would reach the biggest 
audience 
emergency funds spent were modest and a good part of the 
money went to worthy projects such as health care and housing 
flowers were bought for receptions for visiting dignitaries 
herbert de souza of the brazilian institute of analysis and 
statistics said collor de mellos popularity will be seriously 
tested with the free television time given the major candidates on 
all networks 
the other candidates are using their tv time to go after 
collor de mello and most people are now going to hear the 
allegations of corruption against him for the first time souza 
said

a geomagnetic storm battering the earths 
poles is growing increasingly violent and northern lights 
researchers call it the best thing thats ever happened to them 
the storm caused by the bombardment of energy from solar 
activity is making the shimmering aurora borealis brighter more 
colorful and more spectacular than usual this year 
unni pia loevhaug a space researcher plans to fire bolts of 
electricity at the ionosphere the layer of earths atmosphere that 
acts like a movie screen for the solar lights to get an even 
better picture 
the study should offer insights into the universe and theories 
of physics and increase mans storehouse of knowledge she said 
her work may have practical applications in helping to overcome 
the havoc that the electrically charged lights can play with radio 
communications and navigation 
in tromsoe 185 miles north of the arctic cicle the tourism 
board is thankful for the aurora borealis which has drawn the 
curious and adventurous for hundreds of years 
these amazing sheets of light are the offspring of solar winds 
bursts of energized atomic particles that sweep 93 million miles 
through space and slam into the earths magnetic field at a speed 
of 156 million miles an hour 
the collision releases the storm of energy seen in the 
constantly changing lights over the south pole they are called the 
aurora australis 
its absolutely the most fantastic thing we have up here in 
the north said tourist official gunn sissel jaklin 
the aurora will just keep getting better and better from now 
until 1994 because the 11year solar cycle is moving toward a 
peak 
space researcher loevhaug keeps tabs on the lights summer and 
winter even when they are dimmed or hidden by the midnight sun 
were already seeing things that i have never witnessed 
before she said she has studied the lights since 1983 
from her laboratory 18 miles outside town the 33yearold 
physicist is taking part in european incoherent scatter radar 
eiscat a project launched in 1981 to study the northern lights 
and the earths outer atmosphere 
eiscats studies are funded by britain france west germany 
norway sweden and finland 
a transmitter fed by five megawatts of power enough to light a 
small village bounces a radar beam off the ionosphere 30 to 1250 
miles above the earth signals are picked up in sweden and finland 
and relayed to tromsoe 
a radar wave is an electromagnetic field loevhaug said 
it scatters through the northern lights and we receive a picture 
of what is going on when solar activity builds up it amplifies 
the lights and makes our studies easier 
it took centuries for mankind to discover that solar flares 
tongues of fire that leap thousands of miles above the suns 
surface caused the lights 
the vikings believed the lights were flashes from the shields of 
warriors bound for heavenly valhalla eskimos imagined dangerous 
spirits while swedes thought it was the torchlight of lapps 
stalking stray reindeer 
centuries ago tromsoes people feared that laughing at the 
northern lights would anger the gods who would strike them lame 
the aurora has sometimes been seen far south of the arctic 
circle it was mentioned in the bible and pondered by greek 
philospher aristotle 2500 years ago 
even though lights are commonly seen in tromsoe a colorful 
display makes everyone drop what they are doing to watch said 
jaklin the tourism official 
they look fantastic even when you understand them said

when we left paul m weyrich he had just 
undermined president bushs first choice for secretary of defense 
now he has decided to rebuild the american conservative movement 
from the bottom up using the tactics of mao tsetung 
that sounds unlikely but it is no less plausible than the 
undoing of john g tower the former republican senator from texas 
rejected by the senate for secretary of defense last winter after a 
controversy that surfaced when weyrich accused him of misbehaving 
with women and whiskey he said his testimony against another 
conservative stemmed from concern about towers character and about 
leadership at the pentagon 
weyrich says he is asked about the tower episode at his 
organizing and fundraising appearances for his free congress 
foundation but that other conservatives havent been critical 
only curious nor he said have there been any lingering problems 
in his contacts with the white house 
and conservative business seems to be thriving weyrichs 
organization raised 334 million last year has a staff of about 
55 and has just expanded its row of small office buildings near 
the foot of capitol hill 
but while his outfit has prospered weyrich says the 
conservative movement has declined in political power over the past 
10 years he blames a sort of potomac fever on the right and says 
he was guilty of it himself 
because of it weyrich said in an interview and in a monthly 
newsletter sent to about 600 leading backers of his operation 
conservatives have lost clout in precinct congressional district 
and state politics 
he calls it a confusing time for conservatives who think they 
are making ideological headway but cant convert that into 
political action as an example he points to the supreme court 
decision permitting state legislatures to restrict abortions a 
victory for the right if abortion foes can get legislatures to 
take the next step they are absolutely unprepared for that 
battle weyrich said 
weyrich contends that liberals are outnumbered now but can win 
political and legislative fights because their forces are organized 
and disciplined for state and local campaigns conservatives he 
said started moving people and political operations to washington 
when ronald reagan became president 
mao was correct in one thing he said in any revolution take 
the countryside and the capital will fall weyrich told his 
backers our strength is not in washington yes we had and have 
influence here and we helped to change certain policies but we 
have not had real power 
we will only be powerful in washington when we once again 
speak for a powerful movement outside washington when we have 
taken the countryside he wrote them 
weyrich said he plans to test his operation first in wisconsin 
he and his cadre went to madison last weekend to meet he said 
with 25 leaders of organizations identified with conservative 
causes and then to begin training about 75 people in political 
operations 
recently a high white house official who is sympathetic to 
our view described the conservative movement as a paper 
tiger weyrich said unfortunately he is close to the mark 
but it need not be so he said we are only a paper tiger 
because we are not organized 
president bush never has been a favorite with doctrinaire 
republican conservatives they didnt want him on the reagan ticket 
in 1980 and they didnt want him nominated in 1988 indeed weyrich 
told his supporters that bushs 1988 primary victories were 
evidence of conservative weakness 
but he says that a politically strengthened conservative 
movement would strengthen the presidents hand in dealing with 
congress nobodys talking about taking on george bush he said

good grief charlie brown is 40 years old 
yep charlie and the rest of the peanuts gang hit the big 
fouro a midlife plateau that usually sets off a good deal of 
soulsearching in most folks 
just dont expect to see it mentioned in the awardwinning strip 
a comic strip should not make selfconscious statements 
says charles schulz 67 creator of the peanuts characters who 
appear in more than 2000 newspapers in 68 nations there will be 
nothing in the strip 
but that hardly means the milestone will pass unnoticed an 
exhibition is slated for the louvre in paris and half time at the 
super bowl next january will feature a birthday extravaganza 
most importantly the story of charlie snoopy lucy linus and 
friends can finally be told the whole truth comes out in the shy 
cartoonists biography good grief the story of charles m 
schulz its due out october 12 from pharos books 1795 
the book by rheta grimsley johnson is a first says phyllis 
henrici of pharos a sister company of the scripps howard newspaper 
chain schulz draws for the united features syndicate a scripps 
howard subsidiary 
publishers have wanted to do a biography of him for years but 
he hasnt wanted to authorize one she said 
what made the difference this time 
i liked her right away schulz said of johnson a columnist 
for the memphis commercial appeal 
good thing too theres no apprentice or designated cartoonist 
working for schulz who can tell the tale some day 
when i retire thats the end of the strip said schulz 
its in my contract also in his contract is the clause was 
mainly my childrens idea said schulz a father of five they 
didnt want anyone but dad drawing it 
it is a strip thats become a household name and one thats 
brought schulz international fame he won the rueben award comic 
arts highest honor in 1955 and 1964 in 1978 he was named 
international cartoonist of the year an award voted by 700 comic 
artists around world 
the cbs special a charlie brown christmas won a peabody 
award in 1966 
charlie brown the roundheaded kid who seems to court bad luck 
was named after a friend at art school and is schulzs alter ego 
snoopy was inspired by a dog he had as child the other characters 
all have distinct personalities and eccentricities 
somehow the strip wouldnt be the same if charlie actually 
kicked the football or lucy didnt yank it away 
schulz studied art when he was in high school after he saw a 
do you like to draw ad 
the truth is i wasnt a very good student he said 
his first professional job was doing lettering for drawings in 
timeless topix a catholic comic book he later taught at the art 
instruction school and sold cartoons to the saturday evening post 
his cartoon feature lil folks which was the start of 
peanuts was developed for st paul pioneer press in 1947 the 
strip was sold to a syndicate in 1950 and the name changed to 
peanuts 
the artist whose income for 198788 was estimated by forbes at 
62 million is almost a natural resource in the wine country city 
of santa rosa about 80 miles north of san francisco 
he spends much of his time at his redwood empire ice arena 
where he frequently plays hockey or sips coffee at the rinks warm 
puppy snack bar 
the actual drawing of the strip takes place in his office at one 
snoopy place a singlestory stoneandredwood building its 
appropriate that the little beagles monicker got the nod for the 
office it was the snoopy and red baron episodes that really put 
the strip into orbit 
snoopy until then just another pet pooch became a world war i 
flying ace in october 1965 and piloted the strip to its pinnacle 
it worked beautifully so beautifully that nothing can be 
expected to duplicate it johnson recounts 
although the book contains stories about all the strips 
characters the most interesting is about a character never shown 
the little redhaired girl who is charlie browns unrequited 
love 
peanuts began syndication on oct 2 1950 19 days after 
schulz proposal of marriage was turned down in his native st 
paul minn by donna mae wold the original redhaired girl 
its heartbreaking said schulz who proposed five years 
after plowing across france in a halftrack as an infantryman 
during world war ii its something you never get over but i 
think the only purpose in recounting the story was to show how 
experience prompts a cartoonists ideas 
johnson whose book discloses that the artist suffers from 
depression says schulz life contains many rejections he 
translated to the strip 
rejection is his specialty losing his hobby he has spent a 
lifetime perfecting failure she said 
at first johnson thought the artist was kidding about wolds 
turning him down he talked about it as if it took place last 
year she said in an interview 
along with depression the artist also has bouts of agoraphobia 
the fear of being alone in public places from which escape might be 
difficult 
the sight of a hotel lobby for example puts schulz in a 
sweat writes johnson 
such fears and troubles are too bad says the author yet there 
would not be schulz unique gift to the world without the 
sensitivity that so limits his personal life 
and what does peanuts mean to schulz 
this is my whole life he said i pour my heart into this 
every day and some people dont even read the comics

the tower of pisa has been leaning for 800 
years so the keeper of the marble wonder cant understand what all 
the latest fuss is about 
its true that experts have been making dire predictions for 
years but there was a real tower tizzy after the minister of 
public works giovanni prandini sounded an alarm recently that 
scared all of italy 
newspapers immediately published headlines warning of a red 
alert for the tower raising fears that one of the symbols of 
italy could at worst topple or at best be closed for repairs 
but giuseppe toniolo chairman of the committee responsible for 
preservation of the monument says theres nothing to get excited 
about 
there is absolutely nothing new in the situation he said in 
an interview to say that the tower is in danger so what its 
always been in danger 
what does the tower need toniolo added it needs to be 
left in peace 
the 180foot circular tower begun by bonnano pisano in 1173 
started to tilt almost immediately because the ground shifted 
underneath it was completed by tomasso dandrea with the 
construction of the belfry between 1360 and 1370 
the tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular but 
toniolo and other tower experts say it would not topple for more 
than another century if it continues to tilt at its average rate 
according to the last measurement in june the tower leaned an 
additional 0008 inches in the last 12month period the average 
yearly tilt since the measurements began in 1918 is 0047 inches 
the thing should fall over toniolo said seated behind a 
desk in his office the tower visible through gothic windows how 
long will this lean last no one can say but at a certain time it 
will reach the point where it falls that will take more than 100 
years it could be 200 250 years 
for decades italy has tried to come up with ways to save the 
tower a number of national and international commissions have 
proposed plans for stabilizing the monument but none has ever been 
implemented 
the problem of trying to stabilize the tower is enough to make 
the hands of great technicians tremble said gero geri a 
topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower 
since 1969 who wants to risk doing something that could upset 
the equilibrium 
the latest plan approved by the government in 1987 is to 
implant a wheelshaped support below the base around the tower it 
would be connected by concrete spokes to the marble foundation 
the public works ministry appointed a commission a few months 
ago to study the soil conditions to determine whether the plan can 
go ahead 
but toniolo believes the tower cant be fixed until officials 
figure out what has kept the 14000ton structure standing all 
these years 
all the technicians say it cant be understood said the 
whitehaired 80yearold retired radiologist who has headed the 
monument preservation committee for 12 years this means there 
are special conditions of the terrain which havent yet been 
explained if you cant understand this how can you do a project 
to save it 
prandini a christian democrat who has been public works 
minister for barely two months apparently wants to find a solution 
after expressing his concern over the state of the tower 
prandini ordered a panel of technical experts to report back 
quickly on the feasibility of a stabilization plan he also told 
them to devise a roundtheclock monitoring system for the tower 
mayor giacomino granchi a socialist accused prandini of 
exaggerating the situation and trying to get publicity for himself 
prandini replied i dont see why one wants to make a 
controversy out of a well known problem only because theres the 
will to act decisively and go from the study phase to concrete 
realization 
the sense of urgency was heightened by the collapse in march of 
the 900yearold tower of pavia in northern italy killing three 
people experts said the 255foot tower crumbled either because of 
natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or because 
of a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the water 
table 
the example of pavia doesnt count because no one ever 
monitored it toniolo said no other tower in italy is 
monitored like pisas if pavia had all the instruments that we 
have they would have known a few months before that it was in 
danger 
toniolo said he receives an average of 40 proposals a year from 
people around the world mostly americans for saving the tower 
the latest erecting a huge statue of saint ranieri pisas 
patron saint with arms raised to hold up the tower 
some even suggest trying to straighten the tower a notion that 
makes toniolo shudder 
never for heavens sake he said it was born tilted our 
ancestors built it that way eight centuries ago it must remain 
that way

slowly the largest animals ever to roam the 
planet are returning to the craggy coves and lofty fiords of 
newfoundland beckoning the curious from across america and europe 
as well as scientists who want to study them while the seasonal 
arrivals of the whales are met with some trepidation by fishermen 
newfoundlanders are learning that a live whale can be just as 
valuable as a dead one 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
spring comes late and winter comes 
early to these climes governing the coming and going of exotic 
seabirds moose caribou and seals but the creatures that linger 
most on the mind are the whales 
in fact a group of scientists will gather in newfoundland in 
february under the auspices of memorial university in st johns to 
tally the number of humpback whales left in the world by comparing 
thousands of photographs taken over the years of humpback tails 
which have telltale fluke patterns 
situated off the foodrich grand banks where codfish is king 
the seas around newfoundland provide enough food deep water and 
isolation to satisfy the pickiest leviathan 
this is the biggest restaurant in the worlds oceans its got 
a varied menu everything you want and all you want and its 
cheap says whale researcher peter beamish who conducts 
whalewatching expeditions out of trinity 
the waters off newfoundland have the highest concentration of 
whales in the world says beamish who holds a doctorate in marine 
bioacoustics from the university of british columbia and a masters 
degree from massachusetts institute of technology up to 25 species 
of cetaceans whales dolphins and porpoises migrate every 
summer to the northwest atlantic to feed 
if a place like alaska is a fishandchips joint that seats 25 
people then this is the entire city of paris which seats 5 
million people all eating gourmet 15course meals beamish says 
but the waters around newfoundland have not always been 
hospitable to whales whose numbers have been decimated by 500 
years of relentless pursuit and slaughter by whalers from several 
continents 
since the time of columbus the coastlines of newfoundland and 
labrador were littered with makeshift whale factories which were 
moved from one site to another after whales in an area were 
depleted 
whales were deemed expendable the rendering of their blubber 
provided light for the streets of europe and food for asia 
observations of their habits were limited to those who hunted them 
almost to extinction 
since the turn of the century more than 2 million whales have 
been reported killed for food oil cosmetics and other products 
but after the 1960s the decade of increasing environmental 
awareness and the 1970s the decade of discovery about the 
intelligence and gentleness of whales the 1980s have been a decade 
in which most nations banned whaling at least temporarily 
while tourists spend thousands of dollars to travel here to view 
whales the fishermen who spend the most time in the company of the 
gentle giants view them more like city pigeons than a national 
treasure 
my stepfather is a fisherman and i cant go home and speak of 
what a great day i had says collette churchill 21 of port 
rexton beamishs assistant on the whalewatching expeditions to 
him the whales are a nuisance they get in their traps and cost 
them a lot of money 
whales often wreak havoc with expensive fishing nets and 
toothed whales compete for the capelin squid and cod that 
contribute to newfoundlands 700 million fishing industry 
for fishermen whales are marine rats its a pest an 
endangered pest because it really does cost them money says 
john lien professor of ocean studies at memorial university 
the provincial government and whale researchers such as beamish 
and lien have been working diligently over the past decade to 
create goodwill between whales and the fishermen 
educational programs about whales have been presented in just 
about every village and outport tiny settlements reachable only 
by boat and when a whale gets trapped in a net a tollfree hot 
line can put a fisherman in contact with a rescue team that will 
try to free the animal and save the net 
in newfoundland as a whole attitudes have changed says 
lien weve printed a half million whale posters and i claim 
they have replaced sears catalogs in the outhouses now 90 percent 
of the fishermen can identify a humpback for instance before it 
was a very low figure 
before hot lines and whale rescues one in two whales trapped in 
fishing nets would die lien says this year only three of 65 
humpbacks that blundered into nets died 
when i first came here live whales cost newfoundland 
fishermen over 1 million a year from lost or damaged nets and 
all beamish says and now tourism probably brings in 1 
million a year to the island 
what i did and what im proud of is that i came to 
newfoundland hoping to make live whales more valuable to 
newfoundlanders than dead whales and we did that 
a new generation of newfoundlanders also is emerging one much 
more atuned to the special creatures in their midst 
we surveyed 7000 kids in newfoundland and found that seal 
pups and whales were their favorite animals they were right up 
there with puppies and kittens says lien thats probably the 
most important thing an animal can do for its survival get humans 
attached to it 
there are two kinds of whales toothed whales like the dolphin 
sperm and killer whales and baleen whales like the blue humpback 
and right whales which feed on krill tiny shrimplike plankton 
gulped by the thousands while the water is expelled through a mesh 
of whalebone called baleen 
some whales like the rare blue whale the largest animal ever 
to have lived can be seen in winter feeding near the edge of ice 
floes along the islands undulating 5500milelong coastline

but most of newfoundlands whales notably humpbacks minkes and 
fins breed and calve in warm southern waters during the winter and 
migrate north in summer to feed on the millions of tiny smeltlike 
capelin that spawn on newfoundland beaches 
north to feed south to breed says beamish 
with little exaggeration thats just about all thats known 
about these warmblooded airbreathing mammals what they do at 
night how deep they dive where they go in the winter how they 
communicate how some species feed why certain whales beach 
themselves how long they live how often they give birth even 
whether some species still exist are all mysteries 
whales are really mysterious animals because they seem to 
disappear theyll go down and you dont see them ever again 
says beamish who spent 10 years at the bedford institute of 
oceanography 
we know a fraction about whales of what we do about other 
animals on earth because we cant study them at nighttime we cant 
study them when theyre below the surface we cant study them in 
captivity and we cant study them in the winter very well 
nevertheless centuries of hunting whales have yielded some of 
their secrets the sperm whale for instance feeds mostly on squid 
preferably the giant squid and octopus that requires that it dive 
to great depths although like all whales it is an air breather 
one sperm whale a relative youngster at 45 feet long was found 
at a depth of 3240 feet by the cable repair ship all america in 
1932 it drowned apparently in mortal combat with the cable it 
encountered while hunting squid almost 200 feet of cable was 
twisted around its jaws and body 
while most whales have a gentle reputation the killer whales 
are the most formidable thirty feet long and capable of swimming 
at about 30 mph they are unmatched in lethal potential they are 
voracious some caught with the remains of more than 20 porpoises 
and seals in their bellies 
but no whale challenges the imagination as much as the great 
blue protected now but once hunted almost to extinction some 100 
feet long and 150 tons it is the largest creature on earth and 
may have begun its evolutional history on dry land there are 
vestigial hipbones in the rear third of its body indicating that it 
may have prowled the primordial land 
it was a boon to the whalers one blue whale could yield 45 tons 
of meat and 40 tons of blubber its skeleton alone weighed 27 tons 
and its internal organs 18 more 
beamish who moved to newfoundland from nova scotia 10 years ago 
to study whales more closely says he sometimes gets frustrated at 
the very thing that makes them so mysterious their elusiveness 
sometimes i feel like switching to an easier animal he says 
wryly i do this as well as anybody in the world so im on the 
edge of knowledge but youd like to work on an animal you can work 
with more than just a few hours a day 
nevertheless there is something about whales that makes them 
special in the marine kingdom and attractive to scientists 
they are highly intelligent and their brains are extremely 
unusual and as complex as ours says jennifer bates of the whale 
center in oakland calif not only that they arrived at their 
brain size at least 2 million years before we attained ours 
they are at the top of the evolutionary ladder among ocean 
animals and man is at the top among land animals beamish says 
so even though you get less data the data might be more 
meaningful 
the body of knowledge about whales for the most part is a 
recent acquistion begun only in the latter half of this century 
the reason may be found in a little clapboard museum in historic 
trinity dedicated to the towns fishing and whaling past curator 
calvert goldsworthy a former fishplant worker fingers the long 
sinewy fibers of a humpbacks baleen 
looking out the window at trinity bay a favorite haunt of 
whales the slight man of 63 years remembers when fish plants 
smelling of salt cod covered the rocky coast and recalls stories of 
the carcasses of dead whales hauled ashore for rendering a century 
before 
in many parts of the globe the animals are still scarce some 
species like the bowhead and right whale so called by the whalers 
because it would float when killed therefore right are highly 
endangered while others like longmans beaked and the 
melonheaded whale have not been seen for decades 
slowly the largest animals ever to roam the planet have 
returned to the craggy coves and lofty fiords of this verdant 
island and their arrival in the spring is met with both eagerness 
and trepidation by the local inhabitants 
it means spring is here just like when my animals have young 
when the first lamb is born says goldsworthy the first whale 
is like the first robin the ponds start to melt and you take your 
rod and go out for a meal of trout 
you get this burst of energy says collette churchill 
research doesnt go so well on the first day because i cant sit 
down i still feel like that every morning with our first humpback 
sighting 
sitting at a table in the small restaurant of beamishs village 
inn churchill relaxes before the start of another day of 
notetaking on rough seas after several days of rain and fog an 
obvious deterrent to whale watching the clouds part and the sun 
warms the small clapboard houses built haphazardly along the steep 
slopes 
you cant describe the feeling that goes over you when you see 
a whale for the first time or a humpback breach churchill says 
her face beaming it doesnt matter who you are where youre 
from i dont see how you cant feel that way such a big animal 
so friendly its like they have this need to communicate 
they want to and are trying its just that no one understands 
them

like a roller coaster stuck on go 
the 60mph zodiac raft assaults mile after mile of 12foot swells 
startling puffins into diving for safety as tourists pursue an 
elusive minke whale 
blow 2 oclock yells a passenger pointing into a 
sunwashed horizon as the curved black back of the minke appears 
for a splitsecond breath of air 
minutes elapse before the whale watchers all peering intently 
into the vast expanse of ocean spy the sickleshaped dorsal fin 
that appears as a minke spouts 
blow 6 oclock yell two people at once as the zodiac makes 
a quick left turn and veers out toward open sea 
after two days of rain and fog the participants in a threeday 
whalewatch expedition in newfoundland are eager to see what they 
paid thousands of dollars and traveled thousands of miles to see 
their patience is rewarded this sunny day in late summer 
several minkes make appearances in coves at the base of high rocky 
cliffs and the group of seven whale watchers establish brief 
contact with a solitary humpback an endangered whale known for its 
melodious songs 
i felt totally overwhelmed by it all says wendy davidson 
35 an english native teaching in norway you really felt as if 
the humpback was there with us she came and rolled right beside 
the boat as if to say look arent i lovely 
i think we were relieved actually that we had seen what we 
came here to see says paul collins 33 a stage technician for 
the royal shakespeare theater in stratford on avon england 
whale enthusiasts gravitate to this remote canandian province at 
the easternmost edge of north america because of the abundance and 
variety of whales that migrate here every summer 
what they find is sometimes more than they expected seals 
bald eagles arctic seabirds and inland caribou bear and moose 
what they get in programs like those run by whale researcher 
peter beamish in the historic village of trinity is a chance to 
participate in experiments in humanwhale communication 
most peoples expectations are just to see a whale and as 
soon as they walk in the door we tell them that we do a lot more 
than that we try to get them involved in a communication 
experience which is a lot more valuable says beamish who has 
operated his ocean contact program for 10 years 
beamish conducts three and sevenday expeditions costing up to 
1000 air fare is not included 
participants are fed and housed at an old inn in trinity where 
evenings consist of whalerelated slide shows movies and 
discussions days are spent at sea looking for and hopefully 
talking to whales 
the talking actually consists of electronic beeps sent through 
the water several times at certain intervals a conversation 
develops when a whale responds either by spouting breaching 
slapping his tail or lifting his head above water participants 
help work the equipment and scan the horizon for the whales 
response 
in his whale watchers handbook author erich hoyt says 
sooner or later the serious whale watcher finds himself in 
newfoundland 
but serious whale watchers also are finding theres more to this 
ruggedly beautiful island than just whales 
people come here to see whales thats one of the things on 
the list but its not the only thing says dan collins chief of 
visitor activities at terra nova national park near trinity they 
are also interested in seeing icebergs and the wideopen spaces 
newfoundland is kind of like the last outpost says terra 
nova superintendent john fulton the frontier ethic that existed 
in the united states is still here you still go out and cut your 
wood get your moose or caribou and your fish 
greg taylor 40 an englishman teaching in the netherlands said 
the whales and the promise of pristine country are what attracted 
him to newfoundland and beamishs program 
when i asked the travel agent if she could get me a flight to 
newfoundland she said nobody ever goes there why do you want to 
go there for i said great then thats where i want to be 
new york city woodworker cathy zadoretzky 39 says she felt 
renewed by such close contact with animals that to her symbolize 
the things we are not in a land that is an idealization of 
what i think of as peaceful beautiful country 
whales are superior beings who live in the ocean and we are 
supposedly the superior beings on land they are a great force who 
live peaceably under the sea but we are a destructive force and 
we are beginning to realize that it might cost us 
theyre our salvation if we can save them we are starting to 
save ourselves

it was once called the american clyde after 
the clyde river in scotland then a major shipbuilding center in 
europe now the delaware river is losing the last of its onceproud 
shipbuilding yards partially because of a general slump in the 
industry brought on by new government policies 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when the unfinished hulls of two navy ships 
leave the yard of pennsylvania shipbuilding co the delaware river 
will be without a shipbuilding business for the first time in more 
than 300 years 
since william west built the amity in 1682 the year william 
penn came from england companies putting together seagoing ships 
have been a part of the delaware river landscape at one time or 
another there were 38 shipyards along the river and its 
tributaries 
it has been in decline here for decades but spokesmen say a 
national slump in shipbuilding aggravated by new government 
policies really finished off a onceproud industry that was a 
national leader 
for example john fitch advertised steamboat trips along the 
delaware river 17 years before robert fulton ran his clermont along 
the hudson some of the civil warera ironclad monitors were 
built here 
delaware valley shipyards built boats to defend the americas 
cup in wilmington del the pusey amp jones shipyard built them for 
trade on the amazon river 
in 1915 with war under way in europe american international 
shipbuilding corp built what was then the worlds largest shipyard 
50 shipways employing 34000 workers it turned out 122 cargo 
ships and troop transports in two years 
the river was nicknamed the american clyde after the clyde 
in scotland then the center of european iron shipbuilding 
the proud tradition continued down to 1960 when the huge 
aircraft carrier kitty hawk was launched from the new york 
shipbuilding corp yard in camden nj right across the river 
from the philadelphia waterfront that yard closed soon after and 
is now being demolished 
the kitty hawk is being modernized now in philadelphia at the 
us navy yard which does ship repair work but hasnt built a ship 
from the keel up since 1971 
the two ships the navy ordered from pennsylvania shipbuilding 
sit at the rivers edge one tied up in a slip and the other braced 
in a dry dock and minus the bow stern and deckhouse a mortgage 
agreement filed in the delaware county recorder of deeds office 
gives the navy title to four parcels of land owned by penn ship if 
the company fails to pay for the costs of finding another company 
to finish the work 
pennsylvania shipbuilding was known as sun shipbuilding amp 
drydock when sun oil opened it in 1916 to guarantee a supply of 
tankers over the years it built 674 oceangoing ships 
sun got out of the shipbuilding business in 1982 and sold the 
yard to a texas company that renamed it it was later sold to three 
mobile ala real estate developers 
in may 1985 penn ship won a 2224 million contract to build 
two fleet oilers for the navy vessels that refuel combat ships at 
sea 
the navy planned to buy 18 of the 677foot tao187 class 
tankers eventually and penn ship stood to gain a good share of 
that business if it completed the contract successfully 
it didnt the navy renegotiated the contract to 3314 million 
but penn ship announced in february that it didnt have enough 
money to finish the ships with the cost overrun factored in 
work stopped on the ships and penn ship laid off 1200 workers 
rumors have said the hulls one 90 percent finished and the other 
70 percent done will be towed to either tampa fla or new 
orleans to be finished 
william gallagher the yards general manager couldnt say what 
would become of the unfinished ships 
the contract has been terminated he said we are not 
involved with where they will go i have no idea when they will 
leave 
what went wrong why couldnt the yard finish a couple of 
tankers basically like ships that were built here for years 
there were a lot of circumstances contributing gallagher 
said we bid in a time frame when labor rates were low there was 
also an expectation of followup work our costs turned out to be 
much higher than we expected and there was no followup work to 
spread them over

nationwide gallagher said shipbuilding is in trouble 
theres no business he said the only new construction in 
this country for the past couple of years has been for the 
government 
why 
aging facilities and other countries yards are subsidized 
he said its impossible to compete in the world market the way 
were having to compete 
the us maritime administration once subsidized the 
construction of new vessels but those subsidies have been 
terminated gallagher said 
in washington john stoker of the shipbuilders council of 
america agreed in part 
for purposes of discussion its fairly accurate he said 
you can just watch the downward trend 
in 1982 the council counted 110 shipbuilding companies in the 
united states employing 112000 workers this year its down to 69 
companies employing 72000 
we lost 41 shipyards and 41000 people stoker said 
shipbuilding in the seattle area has been devastated in recent 
years stoker said other areas that were hit hard were south 
texas baltimore and the san francisco area 
the reagan administration terminated shipbuilding subsidies 
stoker said arguing that the government shouldnt be interfering 
in the private sector propping up the industry 
but that was looking at the world through naive and myopic 
lenses he said it doesnt recognize that if we are not 
subsidized and the rest of the world is we are doomed 
what saved american shipbuilding through the 80s stoker said 
was rebuilding the navy with that almost complete american 
shipyards face tough times again 
rather than asking the government to return to subsidies the 
council wants the major shipbuilding nations south korea japan 
west germany and norway to drop government intervention in the 
business 
the council filed a complaint in june with the office of the 
united states trade representative against the four it agreed to 
withhold the petition while the united states tried to negotiate an 
agreement on shipbuilding subsidies 
us trade representative carla hills agreed to seek agreements 
with us trading partners both through the organization for 
economic cooperation and development and through the uruguay round 
negotiations of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
i have received assurances from representatives of all these 
countries that they will negotiate seriously on this matter she 
said 
ms hills set a deadline of march 31 1990 which stoker called 
fairly aggressive 
but we cant really allow the process to drag on stoker 
said a number of our companies are potentially in trouble 
stoker agreed it will not be easy to persuade other governments 
to stop subsidizing shipbuilding 
it depends on how you define a subsidy he said they tend 
to think of a subsidy as a direct payment from the government to a 
business but when they make export credit available to a shipyard 
they dont think theyre subsidizing it 
gallagher is pessimistic 
those countries have decided they want to maintain a 
shipbuilding industry he said in this country weve 
apparently made the decision not to have one 
stoker is more optimistic the nation still has areas where 
employment is high in ship construction and repair the gulf 
coast san diego and the area around hampton roads in virginia 
other big yards are in connecticut rhode island and maine 
us trade negotiators have started talks with japan and south 
korea and stoker said the major talks are expected in midoctober 
we are hoping the us negotiating position can be hammered 
out later this month he said we frankly think some attitudes 
about the shipbuilding industry in the nation have changed

the last working commercial shipyard in 
pennsylvania was started by an oil executive making sure his 
company had enough tankers it went out of business trying to 
finish a pair of military fuel ships 
sun oil co incorporated sun shipbuilding amp drydock co in 1916 
a year after company president j howard pew had taken a business 
trip to germany and been impressed with that countrys naval 
strength 
sun ships first vessel the ss chester sun slid down the ways 
in october 1917 by the end of world war i the yard had built six 
tankers plus three minesweepers for the navy 
over the years sun ship emerged as one of the nations largest 
privately owned shipyards its sun doxford diesel engine eventually 
made it the biggest american manufacturer of large marine diesel 
it also launched the first allwelded tanker the ss white flash 
in 1931 
but its glory years were during world war ii when an average of 
a ship a week rolled down its 28 ways on one day the yard 
launched three ships 
by the end of the war sun ship had produced more than 250 ships 
40 percent of all us tankers built it converted armed and 
repaired 1000 more the yard employed 33500 people 
but the end of the war brought a sharp decline in ship 
construction the other yards on the delaware river began closing 
and by 1975 only sun ship was left by the end of 1980 the parent 
sun co estimated it had lost more than 200 million keeping the 
shipyard alive 
sun announced it was getting out of the shipbuilding business in 
january 1981 a company official estimated the shipyard would be 
sold for 30 million to 40 million 
in february 1982 the yard and its assets were sold for a 
reported 8 million to levingston industries inc a texas company 
that renamed the yard pennsylvania shipbuilding levingston sold 
control two years later to three real estate developers from 
mobile ala 
but shipbuilding hasnt been very successful for penn ship in 
may 1985 when the navy awarded the contract for two 677foot 
fleet oilers it was hailed as a deal that would keep the yard 
alive 
later penn ship would argue that it had to submit an 
unreasonably low bid to get the contract and the navy renegotiated 
the deal to 3314 million in february penn ship said that wasnt 
enough either and it suspended work with an eye to hiring another 
yard to finish the job 
finally the navy decided to find a new contractor itself 
william gallagher the yards general manager said penn ship 
made its bid when labor was plentiful and rates were low but soon 
had trouble finding qualified employees in a booming economy 
how could a shipyard that built tankers for years lose a 
contract to build a couple of navy fuel vessels michael shaffer 
business agent for local 802 of the boilermakers union says the 
company made a mistake by hiring japanese consultants to introduce 
modular construction techniques 
in traditional shipbuilding workers build the hull and install 
mechanical and electrical equipment inside the cramped confines 
the new technique has workers completely build entire sections and 
then weld or bolt them together 
thats one thing were bitter about shaffer said weve 
been building 50ton units and lifting them into place for years 
the japanese didnt show us anything we didnt know already but 
the company treated them like gods while they treated their own 
employees like dirt 
gallagher disagrees 
the modular techniques helped he said insisting that the 
shipyards troubles would have been even worse without them 
absenteeism wasnt especially a problem gallagher said but hiring 
skilled workers was 
thats really true throughout the country he said the 
shipbuilding industry used to have a lot of skilled people most 
shipyards used to have apprentice programs and they were major 
employers those people have left and found work in other areas 
these are people in the skilled trades electricians sheet 
metal workers machinists and so on and they dont have any 
trouble finding new jobs if you have to build up again you have 
to start over

lifesaving drugs are often available in france 
long before they are on the market in the united states the reason 
is a difference in the bureaucracies of the two countries while 
some argue that the us food and drug administration should speed 
up its drug approval process others warn that its risky to be 
hasty

in 1985 a desperately ill rock hudson was one of 
many aids patients who fled to france for a drug they couldnt get 
in the united states 
the drug didnt work but at the time it was the only hope and 
american doctors couldnt prescribe it 
last year french doctors began prescribing the socalled 
abortion pill to terminate pregnancies american women may not get 
it for years 
these are two examples among many in which the french became the 
first to receive the potential benefits of new drugs 
it happens because the french drug approval system is simpler 
and faster than that of the us food and drug administration 
advocates of the french system say it has elements that could be 
adopted in the united states cutting the time that americans must 
wait for new drugs 
the issue has become increasingly important as the fda faces 
growing pressure to speed the approval of experimental cancer and 
aids drugs that might help patients who would otherwise be unlikely 
to survive 
the fda has in fact responded to that pressure by speeding the 
approval of the aids drug azt and on sept 28 it announced that 
it was making a newer aids drug called ddi widely available while 
tests of its safety and effectiveness are still continuing 
defenders of the fda argue the french system has certain 
drawbacks that would make it unworkable in the united states 
the french system is faster because its very different 
says jerome halperin former deputy director of drugs at the fda 
in the united states the drug approval process is subject to 
enormous oversight by congress and consumer groups says halperin 
who is now with the us pharmacopeial convention a private 
organization that sets standards for drug quality purity and 
strength 
some public interest groups are calling for a speedup in drug 
approval halperin notes at the same time that others are arguing 
that the agency takes unnecessary risks by sometimes being too 
hasty 
the classic example of a drug being approved too quickly is 
thalidomide which caused severe birth defects after it was 
approved in europe in the late 1950s and early 1960s the drug was 
never approved in the united states 
oversight from congress and the public interest groups 
inevitably puts pressure on reviewers and slows down the 
drugapproval process halperin says similar government and public 
oversight does not exist in france 
there is hardly ever anybody from the ap or the new york times 
looking over their shoulders says dr michael weintraub a 
clinical pharmacologist at the university of rochester school of 
medicine in rochester ny who spent the 198081 academic year in 
france studying its pharmaceutical approval process our system 
is much more political 
most americans see that public scrutiny as important even 
though it might slow new drug approvals halperin says 
nevertheless he says there are examples of drugs that get 
approved here before they get approved in other countries 
including some aids drugs 
i think the fda has gone remarkably far in making experimental 
aids drugs available with as little administrative encumbrance as 
possible halperin says 
the principal difference between the french and american systems 
is that while the fda relies on an inhouse staff of drug 
reviewers the french rely on an outside committee of expert 
volunteers says dr yves juillet director of scientific affairs 
for the french national pharmaceutical industry association 
some of the volunteers are drawn from the drug industry itself 
that works well in france juillet says but the use of drug 
company scientists to review drugs in the united states would 
likely draw allegations of conflict of interest

the french expert committee meets every other friday morning to 
review pending new drug applications individual committee members 
present written technical reviews of each application and then the 
committee makes its decisions 
in cases in which unusual speed is needed or in which research 
results are especially complicated the health ministry simply 
invites additional experts to join the committee for a time 
it doesnt cost a lot because people are not paid for that 
juillet said in an interview at broussais hospital in paris where 
he practices medicine 
a decision is generally rendered within a few months after a 
company sends in its research reports the health minister 
rubberstamps it 
when i was there the limit was four months and i almost 
never saw anything over four months weintraub says 
in contrast at the fda some drugs are quicker than others but 
by and large its about 18 months for approval after a final 
application has been submitted weintraub says 
in the french system everything is reviewed within an hour or 
an hourandahalf in one day at one presentation weintraub says 
the fda also places great emphasis on certain studies considered 
pivotal in demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of new drugs 
the most important thing the fda could learn from the french would 
be not focusing on the socalled pivotal studies but looking at 
all the studies and all the data weintraub says 
one of the drawbacks of the french system according to 
weintraub is that the health ministry does little until research 
is complete and the company is ready to ask for approval 
the fda requires a review of laboratory findings before it will 
allow a new drug to be tested on humans the french dont drug 
companies simply inform the health ministry that human trials are 
about to begin and the ministry rarely intervenes 
they cant guide you weintraub says the fda meets 
regularly with drug companies testing new drugs to advise the 
companies on what further research is needed for approval 
in france there are no contacts between the committee and the 
companies until the file is through juillet says 
when the file of research data is complete juillet acting as 
the industry representative makes the companys case before the 
committee my mission is to be a witness and defend the companies 
and give them information if there is a problem he says 
french drug companies have a much closer relationship with the 
health ministry than american companies do with the fda weintraub 
says because the reviewers dont work for the government its 
not a themandus thing 
in contrast fda reviewers and drug companies often deeply 
distrust each other company officials charge the fda with dragging 
its feet while the fda often blames delays on the inadequacy of 
the companies research 
juillet suggests the fda should rely more on outside reviewers 
i think the open system is a good thing working with people on 
the outside he says 
dr charles leighton a senior vicepresident at merck sharpe amp 
dohme research laboratories in blue bell pa says one reason 
french drug approvals are often faster is that the french have 
decided that the benefits of speeding new drug approval outweigh 
the risks 
they realize there might be a risk he says if youre the 
first country to approve a drug you might be the first to see a 
problem 
weintraub says history shows however that the french have not 
in fact been subject to more problems with drug sideeffects than 
have americans we arent saved from every problem drug nor are 
they exposed to every problem drug he says 
although he believes the fda has much to learn from the french 
weintraub praises the expertise of the fdas reviewers everybody 
respects those people theyre smart hardworking a lot of 
countries will allow marketing of the drug once the fda does 
we are the benchmark for good or ill

the startling boom of heavy artillery 
reverberates through the worlds highest mountains where for five 
years india and pakistan have been fighting for control of an icy 
wasteland while neither side will say how many casualities they 
have suffered they estimate only one in three resulted from combat 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the top of the world is the 
battleground in a largely unknown and undeclared war raging between 
india and pakistan a war in which wind snow and ice often take a 
greater toll than the enemy 
at stake is national prestige and possession of the siachen a 
himalayan wasteland wedged between pakistanoccupied kashmir and 
territory controlled by china 
after more than five years of fighting and artillery duels over 
what would appear to be a minor issue india and pakistan are 
trying to end the costly war 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india and pakistani prime 
minister benazir bhutto confident they can do business are 
pushing to bury ancient animosities and move their countries into a 
friendlier era 
but while they talk of peace huge artillery guns continue to 
boom each startling blast echoing through the stillness of the 
cathedrallike mountains 
fifteen years ago few thought it possible to fight let alone 
hold ground for years in the higher reaches of the karakoram 
mountain range where lie the siachen and more than half of the 
worlds 20 tallest peaks 
never had battles been fought for any length of time at heights 
of up to 4 miles breathing air that contains less than half the 
oxygen at sea level and at temperatures that frequently drop to 50 
degrees below zero 
climb a 21000foot mountain anywhere else in the world and 
you get an award brig gen vr raghavan commander of the 
indian troops told foreign journalists flown to the base camp at 
the mouth of the siachen and then taken by helicopter up the 
45milelong 6milewide glacier 
the number of casualties on both sides remains a military 
secret although raghavan estimated only onethird are actually due 
to combat 
there are natural limits to this conflict the weather and 
the terrain he said here one has to fight constantly and even 
more doggedly to survive so much depends on so few and death can 
be just one false move away 
the conflicts roots can be traced to the 1947 partition of 
moslem pakistan and india which is predominantly hindu 
both countries have coveted the 85000 square miles of 
jammukashmir a predominantly moslem state that acceded to india 
the dispute led pakistan to grab about onethird of the 
territory in 1949 the two countries signed an agreement that drew 
a ceasefire line that stopped at the southern foot of the saltoro 
range running along the glaciers western edge toward the chinese 
border 
negotiators did not extend the line because there was no 
fighting in the region and glaciers were difficult to demarcate 
although there were minor adjustments following the 1965 and 1971 
indiapakistan wars the question of siachen was left unresolved 
almost from the beginning india has said it is entitled to 
control all of kashmir pakistan however says it has controlled 
the siachen all along citing mountaineering expeditions that for 
years sought its permission to enter and atlases published in the 
united states and britain in the early 1980s that showed the area 
under its control 
india first deployed troops to the siachen in april 1984 a move 
it said was merely to preempt a planned pakistani strike 
islamabad denied the charge 
the conflict slowly escalated with each side deploying 
thousands of soldiers erecting outposts and setting up bigger 
more powerful artillery 
in the winter of 1987 indian troops abandoned a 20000foot 
outpost on bilaford one of three key passes when they returned in 
the spring and found the pakistanis had moved in a fierce sixday 
battle ensued with both sides pounding the other with artillery 
pakistan retaliated three months later with its biggest strike 
of the war capturing one post and closing in on a second before 
the indians unleashed an artillery barrage

the secret to this conflict is to control the high ground and 
we do pakistan is on the lower slopes and we can punish them 
whenever necessary raghavan said as 130mm artillery guns fired 
reverberating through the canyons 
we have just given them our reply for firing at one of our 
posts 
indian soldiers posted on the peaks and ridges keep watch day 
and night for the other sides supply and patrols columns 
it is a lonely existence for the soldiers most of whom come 
from the palmfringed beaches of southern kerala state or the 
desert of western rajasthan or the jungles of eastern assam and 
have never lived much less fought in a snowbound environment 
this is the hardest place on earth said modhival iqbal a 
weary 23yearold soldier who just completed four months of duty at 
a 19000foot outpost 
from the base camp soldiers armed with ice picks skis 
shovels ropes and 65pound backpacks trudge across the black 
moraine through kneedeep snow and over 200foot crevasses and up 
the walls of ice to their posts 
but before leaving each visits the cavelike enclave where 
there are hung images of the hindu gods rama shiva and ganesha as 
well as a portrait of jesus christ 
everybody who goes to the glacier comes here first and says 
his prayers it doesnt matter if hes hindu or moslem or 
christian raghavan said 
the trek takes six to eight days with brief rest stops at posts 
along the way before reaching the small outposts where the 
soldiers live for months in bunkers dug deep in the snow 
every day up there is important because every day you survive 
means youre one day closer to leaving iqbal said its not 
just the pakistanis its the blizzards the howling winds the 
blinding glare of the sun off the snow its the avalanches and the 
isolation 
we have plenty of food and supplies but not much else maybe 
someday somebody will organize a society for the prevention of 
cruelty to soldiers 
a monthlong clash erupted in april when pakistan allegedly 
tried to establish a new post within easy firing range of the 
indians and both sides dispatched soldiers to an icy 21300foot 
peak pakistan however said it had only discovered an old 
observation post 
accounts of what happened differ but the indians apparently 
requested a meeting between the two opposition commanders after 
three sessions both sides agreed to pull back and the indians 
agreed to accept the post the pakistanis had said was there all 
along 
with india commanding most of the heights along the saltoro it 
now wants that boundary to serve as the northern extension of the 
line that divides most of kashmir between india and pakistan 
since january 1986 the two governments have met five times to 
discuss withdrawing their troops from the glacier and to consider 
declaring the region a demilitarized zone 
pakistan officials believe the eventual withdrawal of indiain 
troops would be a major victory for ms bhutto and a vindication of 
their position that india started the conflict by sending troops 
into an undemarcated area 
both pakistani and indian officials say the rapport between 
gandhi and ms bhutto is helping but it still may be difficult for 
either to yield gandhi is only months away from facing a national 
election ms bhutto is in an even stickier situation facing 
criticism at home from opposition leaders who accuse her of 
submission to india 
while their leaders struggle to find a political solution both 
sides contend they can hold out indefinitely 
whether there is a settlement is a matter between state and 
state raghavan said until then we have a job to do that 
doesnt mean we want to stay here forever who would but we can 
stay here as long as we have to

boston is trying to preserve its colonial heritage 
and intimate scale while riding into the 21st century on a 
bulldozer 
office towers are going up and up old ones are coming down or 
being remodeled elevated roads are going underground the water in 
boston harbor is on its way to the cleaners

the heart of downtown boston still beats along narrow streets 
lit by gas lamps and threaded between 19th century brick buildings 
out along the charles river boulevards of the back bay repeat this 
image on a grander scale with tall graceful row houses built with 
bay windows and front yards framed by castiron fences 
but rising beside this embrace of the past are elegant 20th 
century buildings that blend bostons antiquity with the pride of 
new money

downtown crossing the citys chief shopping district is slated 
for the biggest retail project in city history developers intend 
to spend 600 million tearing down a mediocre and claustrophobic 
4yearold mall that looks more like a fortress than a shopping 
arcade and replace it with a larger complex of department stores 
and office space 
depression of the central artery this 45 billion job that 
sounds like an unhappy medical procedure threatens to make life 
miserable for motorists and businesses alike the project 
scheduled for 1990 to 1998 will lower the major sixlane elevated 
highway in boston and make it an underground expressway it also 
would add a tunnel under boston harbor 
numerous other office and residential towers and projects are 
planned the new england aquarium wants to move to charlestown a 
new federal courthouse is proposed at government center the boston 
garden is slated to be replaced with a bigger and better sports 
complex the prudential center which in the 1960s was in the 
avantgarde of bostons new look is set for a makeover 
the city involves not only developers and planners in its grand 
designs but neighborhood groups affected property owners and 
history lovers 
its no more random development its calculated managed 
growth says antonia pollak executive director of the boston 
preservation alliance a consortium of 33 preservation and historic 
societies 
we have learned how to protect and manage good architecture 
not the character of 1630 but the character of contemporary 
boston a combination of colonial victorian boston with new 
stateoftheart structures 
this is a nation that has always loved change said 
architect and developer peter madsen who is on the board of the 
boston society of architects one of many groups guiding the city 
in its constant transformation 
for boston to cease changing would take a cataclysm affecting 
its widely diverse economy a cornucopia of education finance 
medicine legal and other professional services and corporate 
headquarters he said 
but for others the handsome changes can be dizzying and 
discomfitting 
tom cunha is a 36yearold machinist and a thirdgeneration 
resident of charlestown 
like many of his fellow charlestown residents cunha is learning 
to adjust to life with the toonies thats the derisive name 
locals give the moneyed people who began moving in after 1975 when 
an elevated train came down and property values went up 
charlestown isnt a neighborhood of generations anymore 
cunha says in the nottoodistant olden days charlestowners 
married each other he says their offspring grew up and began 
charlestown families of their own 
a lot of the people who own places here now dont raise 
families they raise pets plants and porsches cunha says 
the concerns of new people in the racial and economically 
diverse south end seem to be getting more selfish says jeanette 
boone who works in the boston office of us sen john kerry 
shes troubled by the trend 
the problem i have is when you move into a neighborhood that 
has a history and people decide they want to change it not having 
a regard for it they want to move the suburb into the city 
a homeowner for six years ms boone fondly remembers the south 
end she first encountered 
when we first moved to the south end we were friendly and 
people talked to us now half the people you see wouldnt give you 
the time of day 
it was a neighborhood that had lowincome blacks hispanics 
and whites basically people who lived together and tried to get 
along ms boone says 
with some of the changes people have no regard for the rich 
history were finding a generation of people who are not as 
caring who care more about my space people of all colors 
all races all kinds have a right to live in a neighborhood it 
makes a neighborhood a lot richer 
architecture critic and author jane holtz kay grew up in boston 
and now lives in the back bay where 20 years ago the distinctive 
brick row houses were rooming houses not small showcases for the 
upandcoming 
i dont find the changes heartwarming she said referring 
to the new demography the diversity is evaporating its 
becoming a city of the rich and the poor 
i dont mean it was a kinder gentler city if youll pardon 
the expression but you wouldnt have seen 3000 suits on the 
street

the painting of religious icons is an art form 
inspired by the eastern orthodox church and now practiced by less 
than 100 artists across the united states and canada but there are 
two schools that teach icon painting in this country one in a 
mountain community in western pennsylvania 
</TEXT>

philip zimmerman paints mystical windows 
to heaven he says haunting religious icons used as vehicles of 
prayer 
icons are a very important part of the church zimmerman 
says they are a spiritual and physical depiction of some sacred 
image of christ or the virgin mary a saint or some other 
liturgical happening 
icons popular in the eastern orthodox church are painted in 
rich luminous colors faces are depicted with prayerful 
expressions and religious figures usually are crowned with halos 
of real gold not gold paint 
perpective and scale are distorted to give the religious scenes 
a supernatural feel 
some regard icons simply as products of religious devotion or 
art inspired by the eastern orthodox church which began the 
tradition centuries ago 
the religious regard icons as windows to heaven or 
theology made visible and believe focusing on them deepens 
prayer and meditation zimmerman says 
zimmerman 36 of nearby johnstown has been teaching twoweek 
classes in icon painting since last summer at antiochian village 
an orthodox cultural center outside this mountain community about 
60 miles east of pittsburgh 
the village and the school of sacred arts in new york city are 
the only schools in the united states offering classes in icon 
painting zimmerman says there are about 90 iconographers in the 
united states and canada 
students must learn to create within the strict conventions of 
the art they eventually develop their own styles while absorbing 
hundreds of details on symbolism used in icons 
for instance halos blazing disks of golden light are 
applied in gold leaf around the heads of divine figures to depict 
emanations of radiant light 
they are auras of spiritual holiness icons depict not just a 
persons earthly image but a spritualtype image as well 
zimmerman says there is no light source like in other art the 
light source comes from within the figure 
anatomical details such as facial features fingers and body 
shapes are stylized to give figures an additional aura of the 
supernatural scenes are painted in two dimensions and no shadows 
are cast 
thats why in iconography the icons do not look like real 
people zimmerman says were not trying to make them look like 
real people its a symbolic representation of a person 
certain colors are associated with some religious figures 
christ for example usually is depicted in blue and red 
you usually never depict christ in green zimmerman says 
its not traditional 
iconographers say they technically do not paint icons but 
write them artists are taught to create their works with 
thousands of tiny caligraphic strokes 
what they are are scriptural pictures pictures of the 
scriptures zimmerman says when you write the icon youre 
writing scriptures just the same as when you are using words 
although the mechanics of the art are important theology 
debates often erupt during class sessions 
its very very very theological zimmerman says theres 
a lot of rules attached to this not a lot of painting rules but 
a whole lot of rules on whats proper whats liturgical whats 
not liturgical 
interest in icon painting has increased dramatically in recent 
years and not just among the religious 
people here in the west are just beginning to discover the art 
of the orthodox church zimmerman says its not just something 
grandma brought over from czechoslovakia 
i think the whole interest in religion is coming back says 
steven glazer an official of the school of sacred arts 
for a long time people were looking to eastern religions and 
eastern mysticism while thats still popular people are returning 
to their own traditions now 
iconographer vladislav andreyev who was born in the soviet 
union offers a 14week class at the new york school which also 
offers classes on the art traditions of other religions 
its pretty international and we sell out every time we 
usually limit classes to 10 students he says many of the arts 
we teach are not available elsewhere 
classes offered in the subject are shortterm but it often 
takes years to develop competence says nicholas papas 30 an 
iconographer from nearby indiana 
when i first started i was very timid and selfconscious he 
says i was pretentious boxed in and stiff i feel that it took 
me years to even begin to break out of that i feel like im still 
breaking out of that 
papas began painting icons in 1979 and started fulltime work as 
an iconographer in 1982 
papas sells notebooksize icons of a favorite subject such as 
portraits of christ for as little as 175 but bigger and more 
complicated works can be worth thousands of dollars 
every iconographer has his own idea of what he should get for 
an icon he says 
papas icons usually are sold to churches or people who display 
them in their homes a giant mural of his is displayed 30 feet 
above the ground in the dome of st marys byzantine catholic 
church in nearby homer city 
a 70 by 12foot mural papas currently is working on the 
communion of the apostles will attempt to depict what heaven 
looks like 
the idea of selling icons to people who admire them only as 
works of art is a sticky ethical problem for some iconographers who 
fear the buyer would be misusing a holy object 
i would feel uncomfortable but i would do it says papas 
who was born to an eastern orthodox family even if a person 
asked me for an icon for the wrong reason theres a possibility 
that the icon could be a good influence on them 
zimmerman began painting icons 18 years ago while studying to 
be an art teacher at indiana university of pennsylvania 
an iconographer who served as the choir director of one local 
orthodox church recruited him and several of his college friends to 
help him with his work 
we made his job a little easier by filling in colors and stuff 
like that zimmerman says 
also during college zimmerman decided to leave the protestant 
united church of christ to become an eastern orthodox christian 
i was always interested in religion always interested in 
exploring other religions as well he says i felt the orthodox 
church was very satisfying i felt this church has so much to offer 
liturgically spiritually musically artistically everything

fred savage didnt set out to become an 
actor but now that hes become quite successful at the age of 13 
hed like to stick to it 
fred who was nominated for an emmy for his lead role in abcs 
hit comedy series the wonder years but didnt win is a video 
game hustler in the upcoming december release the wizard 
i never really wanted to get into the business he says 
it was never a goal it just happened 
it happened when he began doing commercials at the age of 6 in 
his hometown of chicago where he lives with his family when hes 
not working he made his film debut at 8 in the movie the boy who 
could fly 
i really enjoy acting fred says now that he is a veteran 
performer id like to continue it for a while i do want to go 
to high school and college id like to direct on the set they 
call me little opie because ron howard started as a child actor 
and grew up to direct he could be a role model for me im always 
looking through the camera and checking angles i want to learn all 
i can 
the wonder years is the kind of show that will grow with 
fred it made its debut in march 1988 and it has already changed 
to reflect that fred as kevin arnold is maturing and facing 
different problems and challenges 
the beauty of the show is that when my voice changes i can 
still do the show he says even if i get zits 
the beauty is also that virtually everyone can identify with the 
adolescent traumas of kevin paul winnie and their friends the 
time period this season has advanced to 1969 but its stories and 
characters transcend time and place 
i see kevin as just a typical kid growing up in the late 
1960s he says hes very shy he has a nonstop fear of the 
men in his family his older brothers always beating up on him and 
everyones afraid of his dad 
hes sort of insecure especially around girls but i think 
hes a cool kid hes a normal kid in 1969 this year he moves into 
the eighth grade and has trouble with algebra and the algebra 
teacher this year his older brother learns to drive 
his favorite episode is the one in which kevin accompanies his 
father to his office 
its so true he says the exact thing didnt happen to me 
but i went to my dads office i was so impressed watching him 
work id bring books to the office and copy the whole book on the 
copy machine 
fred accompanied by his mother is late for an interview he 
explains he had to complete work with his tutor for the public 
school he attends in chicago he also explains that his father 
whos an industrial real estate broker is back in chicago 
but theyre not divorced he quickly adds theyre merely 
temporarily apart because of the requirements of his role on the 
wonder years 
fred has a younger sister kala and a brother ben who 
appeared with him in his latest movie little monsters 
in the wizard he and his younger brother head for a video 
game championship theyre heading from utah to the game in los 
angeles fred says they make money hustling other kids to play 
video games their fathers looking for them and their mother hires 
a kind of bounty hunter 
the movie also stars luke edwards beau bridges christian 
slater and jenny lewis 
fred first got into acting when notices in his chicago 
neighborhood asked for small children to audition for a television 
commercial 
the auditions were near our house and it sounded like fun 
he says so mom and i went over i didnt get it and six months 
later the same director held another audition i didnt get it 
again six months later the director called and i was cast in a pac 
man vitamins commercial 
i did commercials for about two years then i got into movies 
i did quite a few and i was in a tv series called morning star 
evening star it only lasted six weeks 
i was called in to read for the wonder years because the 
producers had seen me in the movie vice versa i flew to la and 
read for the network i guess they approved because i got the part 
they ran the pilot after the super bowl in 1988 and we went on the 
air in march 
the show won the emmy last year as best comedy series after just 
half of a season on the air fred never saw the emmy telecast 
because he was asleep when the show came on he was in north 
carolina making the movie little monsters his mother wouldnt 
let him stay up 
this year he was not only nominated as best lead actor in a 
comedy making him the youngest person ever nominated in a lead 
role but he was an award presenter with carl reiner

before he returned to broadway for the first 
time in 25 years tony randall wondered whether audiences would 
forget televisions felix unger long enough to accept him as the 
tormented protagonist of m butterfly 
after all randall was felix the fussy fastidious half of 
the odd couple for five years on prime time television as well 
as in nine stage productions with four different oscar madisons 
including his tv costar jack klugman 
that question came up a million times randall recalled the 
other day would they want to laugh instead 
he need not have worried 
theres not a moment of rejection and having to win them 
over he says now talking about his performance as rene 
gallimard the french diplomat who has an affair with a chinese 
opera singer and theatergoers go along willingly with the more 
bizarre plot developments in david henry hwangs tony awardwinning 
play gallimard is seduced by the singer who turns out to be a man 
masquerading as a woman 
but then director john dexter has set up the play so that when 
the first voice comes out of this miasma of light and movement and 
music the audience is already captivated the actor says hes 
the only director i ever worked with in my life who i thought was a 
genius 
randall is one of those actors whos not afraid of opinions 
asked why it has been more than 25 years since he has appeared 
on broadway he says no ones asked me 
ive frequently had a year off or more and have noised it 
around town that i was available the fact that a man is a broadway 
producer doesnt make him any more intelligent than a network 
executive 
not that he hasnt been on stage during this time last year 
there was a ray cooney farce done at the paper mill playhouse in 
new jersey and he has worked for john nevilles theater company in 
nova scotia as well as in all those tours of the odd couple 
the odd couple is a masterpiece he states 
matteroffactly the laughs just roll in but you have to play 
it as if its hamlet very very seriously 
any play that is good has some ideological basis behind it in 
the odd couple its male bonding the play is very chauvinistic 
and antifeminist the only women in it are two dingbats and the 
men hate their wives the only happiness these men have is when 
they are away from their wives 
randall has worked in just about every medium except burlesque 
last year when he was honored at the museum of broadcasting four 
videocassette machines simultaneously unspooled the odd couple 
the tony randall show love sidney and mr peepers 
the four television series he has done 
there was my life on the screen he recalls you could 
watch me go bald 
bits and pieces of randalls story also are told in which 
reminds me a collection of show business anecdotes he has 
gathered during his more than 40 years as an actor randall who 
says hes cursed with almost total recall wrote the book in 
collaboration with and at the urging of a good friend michael 
mindlin an advertising executive and movie publicity man it 
arrives in bookstores in november from delacorte press 
randall fresh out of tulsa olka and one year at northwestern 
university came to new york in the early 1940s his first broadway 
show was thorton wilders the skin of our teeth in 1942 well 
almost he was drafted into the army the second day of rehearsals 
four years later randall returned to new york where he found a 
lot of work on radio and a few small parts in the theater but he 
didnt and still doesnt think much of radio work 
it was nothing randall recalls standing there reading a 
script what was that and the script for the most part was 
dreck it probably had been written that morning how could you 
act you had one rehearsal and you were on the air 
randall had better luck and better parts on television 
beginning in 1952 when he appeared as english teacher harvey 
weskitt in mr peepers one of the best of the early tv sitcoms 
his big break on broadway came in 1955 in inherit the wind 
a retelling of the scopes trial in which he played a reporter 
modeled after hl mencken 
the play propelled him to hollywood for scores of movies 
including three doris dayrock hudson classics pillow talk 
lover come back and send me no flowers as well as other 
films like will success spoil rock hunter and the seven 
faces of dr lao 
the 69yearold randall admits he was a little frightened about 
returning to broadway in a play as physically demanding as m 
butterfly 
thats what i thought would kill me he says moving 
around like that and the knowledge that my predecessor john 
rubinstein had lost 25 pounds and he was a young guy they had to 
get new costumes for him 
but i was at the doctors this morning with my wife and ive 
gained weight 
memorizing was an easy part of the job randall says he had 
four weeks of rehearsal before going on in m butterfly and 
director dexter came back for a week to work with him 
a replacement doesnt have that much option really randall 
says the first three weeks of rehearsal he just works with the 
stage manager who takes him through the established staging if he 
wants to change anything he can but its foolish the stage is 
lighted everything is set if you want to move here instead of 
there that means they have to change the lights its not worth 
it 
actually he adds playing in the odd couple was more tiring 
than m butterfly but the role of oscar is harder than 
felix oscar is a killer he says of other half of the odd 
couple 
i dont think i could play oscar too well although when i 
went into this play a half dozen people asked me what part im 
playing randall laughs i dont see myself as the young 
chinese girl 
i think its the seven faces of dr lao they know i played 
an oriental in that movie

taipei taiwan forty years after generalissimo chiang kaishek 
and his nationalist chinese arrived in defeat from the mainland 
taiwan is prosperous the worlds 13th largest trading nation 
and democracy is beginning to take hold 
but in 1949 with mao tsetung communists in control of 
mainland china the outlook for the chinese nationalists on taiwan 
was bleak 
not only had they been routed from their homeland they faced a 
restive taiwanese population that viewed chiang and his 2 million 
or so followers as an occupying force 
the nationalists prevailed nevertheless by dint of 
authoritarian rule and clinging to their contention supported by 
the united states and other western nations that they were the 
legitimate rulers of china 
in the years since firmly guided economic policies have 
transformed taiwan into the economic success it is now as the 
island approaches its national day oct 10 double ten for the 
tenth day of the tenth month 
with prosperity at its peak and people demanding greater 
freedoms the nationalists have begun to loosen their authoritarian 
grip slowly bringing democracy to the island of 20 million and 
permitting contacts with the rival communist chinese for the first 
time since the civil war on the mainland 
many people used to be disappointed with the government and 
tried to emigrate whenever they had the chance said lu yali 
political science professor of national taiwan university they 
now feel there is some hope and have begun to care and criticize 
an agrarian economy based on rice and sugar production has given 
way to the manufacturing of textiles electronic products and 
machinery 
the formula was capitalism mixed with government policies 
designed to stimulate selected industries while the nationalists 
controlled major monopolies many of the lightindustry factories 
were familyrun operations that helped spread the wealth around the 
island 
annual per capita income rose from 50 in 1949 to 5512 last 
year gross national product soared from 12 billion 40 years ago 
to 119 billion in 1988 
exports led the way with foreign trade jumping from 300 
million in 1952 to 110 billion last year so much foreign exchange 
has poured in that the islands coffers bulge with 74 billion in 
reserves 
prosperity is everywhere on the streets of taipei porsche and 
bmw automobiles snake through the congested streets fancy 
restaurants are on almost every block and the latest electronic 
gadgets fill store windows 
indeed taipei the islands capital seems to lack nothing 
except foreign embassies 
while the island advanced on economic successes it faced bitter 
diplomatic defeats as the world recognized the communist chinese 
government in beijing 
only 24 countries mostly tiny island nations and latin american 
countries still recognize taiwan diplomatically down from 50 in 
1949 the communist chinese government has formal ties with 135 
countries 
the toughest blow came in 1978 when taiwans major ally the 
united states announced it was cutting diplomatic links and 
setting up formal relations with beijing 
the united states dismantled its military bases on taiwan and 
said military aid would not increase in quantity or quality 
but the us market did not close to taiwan and that helped 
assure its economic health 
chiang pengchien a leading opposition politician blamed 
taiwans diplomatic isolation on the dream of a reunified china 
ruled by a nationalist government 
the nationalists also used that dream in their efforts to 
justify their monopoly on political power and the harsh quelling of 
dissent 
the nationalists placed taiwan under martial law and refused to 
allow rival political parties or an opposition press critics who 
traveled overseas often were not allowed back many of those who 
stayed in taiwan were thrown in jail 
by claiming to be the rightful ruler of all china the 
nationalists insisted that native taiwanese who comprise about 80 
percent of the population could not replace any of the members of 
the legislature and electoral college who had been elected in 
mainland china before the civil war defeat 
but as the taiwanese prospered economically they demanded more 
political rights it was chiang kaisheks son the late president 
chiang chingkuo who finally launched the political liberalization 
the nationalists needed if they were to maintain popular support 
in 1987 chiang chingkuo lifted martial law which paved the 
way for the formation of opposition political parties some media 
restrictions were erased leading to a more critical press taiwan 
residents were allowed to visit relatives on the chinese mainland 
bringing a more relaxed attitude toward the communists

demonstrations became an almost daily occurrence with taiwanese 
taking to the streets to protest everything from prostitution to 
pollution 
by the following year it became apparent that the gradual 
liberalizing trend would not easily be reversed 
when chiang chingkuo died in january 1988 he was succeeded by 
vice president lee tenghui the first native taiwanese to lead the 
nationalist government and a supporter of democratic reform 
six months later lee was named chairman of the nationalist 
party and some but not all aging hardliners from the mainland 
retired from top party posts 
the nationalist leadership under lee has proposed a gradual 
increase in the percentage of the legislature that is elected on 
taiwan still only less than half the seats will be contested in 
dec 2 elections making it impossible for the opposition to wrest 
any real political power from the nationalists 
we are fully committed to democratization government 
spokesman shaw yuming said in a recent interview we are moving 
slowly but surely to meet the demands of the time 
but taiwan still has problems 
rising wages and an appreciating currency these have made 
taiwan less competitive in lowcost exports and the government is 
seeking a new economic formula to deal with the problem we must 
actively push forward the research of topnotch industrial 
technologies premier lee huan recently told the legislature 
the service sector should also grow quicker to become the center 
of our future economic development 
pollution caused by years of rapid development taipeis air is 
foul and the islands rivers are filthy some villagers have 
protested the construction of new factories they fear will ruin the 
local environment 
gambling and speculation gambling is illegal but rampant and 
speculating in the stock market has become the national pastime 
the taiwan stock exchange is second only to tokyos in trading 
volume and some analysts believe it is a speculative bubble 
waiting to burst some see the obsession as a temporary phenomenon 
following the easing of foreign exchange controls in 1987 others 
argue that industrialists are more interested in quick profit than 
in longterm investment such as automating factories and developing 
more sophisticated products 
perhaps the greatest challenge facing taiwan is its policy 
toward mainland china 
official policy remains the three nos no contact no 
negotiations no compromise with the communists but that policy 
today is a shambles 
the government allows trade with the mainland if conducted 
through a third party such as hong kong and taiwanese businessmen 
have begun investing in the mainland to take advantage of low labor 
costs 
finance minister shirley kuo traveled to beijing in may to 
attend an asian development bank meeting and met privately with 
communist officials 
the future of such contacts is somewhat clouded because of the 
communists violent suppression of the democracy movement this past 
spring but the old nationalist dream of returning to rule the 
mainland seems shattered 
when the chinese communist government seemed in disarray during 
the spring democracy movement the nationalists were forced to 
acknowledge there was not much they could do but watch 
we must have the courage to face the fact that at this moment 
we are unable to effectively exercise the right to govern the 
mainland president lee told a meeting of nationalist leaders on 
june 3

thirtythree nations meet in paris this week on 
the controversial future of antarctica an ap correspondent who has 
been to the disputed continent reports on what is at stake 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
antarctica the last place on earth where nature 
reigns over man is facing a showdown between those who want to tap 
its fabled wealth and those who want it to remain forever untouched 
under ice 
the majestic continent at the bottom of the world larger than 
united states and mexico combined is still peopled by scant 
thousands who have to import everything but ice cubes 
although 16 nations fly flags in antarctica and seven claim 
slices of it no one holds title no one needs a passport it is a 
vast global common ruled only by the harsh unforgiving elements 
but statesmen scientists and environmentalists must decide soon 
whether antarctica will open up to oilmen and airmen miners 
commercial fishermen hotelkeepers and possibly colonists 
in paris beginning monday 33 nations will review the 1959 
antarctic treaty that expires in 1991 they also will examine the 
remains of the antarctic minerals convention signed in may 1988 
the convention would have allowed controlled mining and oil 
exploration replacing a voluntary moratorium but australia one 
of seven claimant nations with a veto decided not to ratify it 
the united states the soviet union and japan among others are 
pressing for a minerals accord france echoing australias 
concerns wants antarctica to be an unspoiled world park 
delegates were guarded over an eventual compromise the 1988 
convention took six years to negotiate 
proponents say a world short of resources has no choice 
antarctica hoards unknown quantities of gold platinum and other 
strategic metals along with oil in amounts estimated to be in the 
billions of barrels 
detractors insist that even controlled exploitation inevitably 
pollutes a reserve crucial to mans survival upsetting its 
delicate balance they say will have consequences no one can 
predict 
undeniably the world is already muscling in penguin livers are 
tainted with pesticides and plastics centuryold garbage litters 
pristine panoramas antarctica has had its first oil spill 
trash thrown into the north sea will eventually settle in 
antarctica the french oceanographer jacquesyves cousteau once 
told the associated press the world is a closed system 
in a more recent interview he railed against plans to exploit 
the last untamed place on earth 
that would be almost criminal at least stupid he said 
it would be a catastrophe 
scientists worry that tourists whose numbers now approach 
10000 a year endanger fragile ecosystems huge ice floes menace 
ships hulls adding a threat of oil pollution 
yet it is the ancient lure of the mysterious continent largely 
unexplored for all of historys daring expeditions that make it 
such a disputed prize 
antarctica is 98 percent under ice but it is no more a white 
continent than africa is a dark one 
old ice grows blue then rich turquoise as the sun shifts its 
angle over floating ice and the glacier beyond antarctica is aglow 
in pinks and oranges beyond the range of film or canvas 
penguin colonies like rushhour crowds dressed in black tie 
amuse scientists who try to take them seriously seals frolic and 
birds move from place to place in turbulent clouds 
for all the beauty arguments focus on survival of the planet 
president francois mitterrand of france making the case for a 
world wilderness area told scientists from 40 countries at a june 
meeting its not just the forests the prairies or rivers that 
are in danger its the entire earth 
specialists regard antarctica as the worlds weather factory 
for 10 years scientists there have measured the earths 
thinning ozone layer letting through radiation that risks 
catastrophic changes in world climate and ocean levels 
a new zealand team recently reported the ozone hole over 
antarctica was much more serious than previously believed 
cousteau warns that jostling the precarious balance invites 
calamity for example just scraping the surface of the earth 
spreads dust that alters reflectivity raising temperatures and 
melting ice 
human activity disturbs the breeding of unique species of birds 
and marine mammals scientists say fishing threatens a delicate 
food chain that depends upon plentiful supplies of krill a tiny 
shrimp 
in antarctica with treacherous sea lanes and lashing winds 
accidents are common once damage is done experience shows it is 
very difficult to correct

man on the frozen continent requires steady supply the fauna is 
all but inedible even penguin eggs are too greasy for breakfast 
the plants are minuscule lichens and what comes in must be carried 
out 
travelers today find capt robert falcon scotts hut as he left 
it in 1911 with unrusted tins of huntley amp palmers biscuits lined 
up on dustfree shelves cold clean air preserves almost anything 
environmentalists rage at garbage dumps that accompany a 
lengthening string of military and scientific outposts including 
the sprawling us mcmurdo station 
the greenpeace environmentalist group set up a base near mcmurdo 
to monitor developments its members came to blows with french 
soldiers building a runway across from a penguin rookery near the 
south magnetic pole 
the group accuses the americans among others of killing marine 
life with sewage and refuse if scientists cannot protect the 
environment greenpeace argues oilmen and miners will be worse 
near the end of september word filtered out that 44000 gallons 
of diesel fuel leaked from a pipe at the us amundsenscott 
station at the south pole the leak was discovered in august 
us officials said it would seep into the ice with no 
environmental damage but foreign minister gareth evans of 
australia called it a perfect example of why antarctica had to be 
protected 
in the early 1970s when politics heated in antarctica claimant 
nations hurried to strengthen their positions 
argentina leased a greek ship with deck chairs but no radar 
for cutrate tourism chile built a hotel last year the first 
commercial flights landed at the south pole 
now australian entrepreneurs propose project oasis a 
runway for 747 jet aircraft a fivestory hotel and a hovercraft 
dock 
when the mineral convention was signed some specialists argued 
that controlled exploitation was better than no accord at all if 
anyone broke the moratorium no international law would apply 
ideas included carrying out oil in submarines rather than 
tankers to minimize risk 
but the picture changed in january when an argentine supply 
ship the bahia paraiso nosed into waters marked on charts 
dangerous ledges and channels and tore open its double hull 
the crew and all 81 tourists escaped but an estimated 170000 
gallons of its 250000 gallons of fuel oil leaked onto marine 
habitats eventually killing seals penguins and other marine life 
salvage crews were able to stop the leakage but oil still 
remains in the ships tanks 
the argentine navy reported after a reconnaissance flight over 
the area in early september that the bahia paraiso is still aground 
in icefree waters and listing at about 140 degrees 
capt raul pueyrredon of the argentine navy said the airmen 
saw no evidence of leakage nor any visible ecological damage 
he added that he was not sure how much oil remained in the 
vessel but that it was very little 
in a letter to us transportation secretary samuel skinner in 
may the environmental defense fund an american organization that 
describes itself as nonprofit said the bahia paraiso still had 
about 70000 gallons of fuel on board when the southern hemisphere 
winter set in and still poses a threat to antarcticas environment 
antarcticas worst environmental disaster has become a 
forgotten oil spill the letter said

differences over what is and what is 
not islam lies at the heart of afghanistans 10year war 
president najib has been attempting to deflate his foes main 
rallying cry that his marxistbased peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan is a pack of godless soviet stooges by transplanting 
the partys ideology into the countrys islamic heritage 
but many afghans hold deep suspicions that the party is rooted 
in the soviet union next door the assault on islam by najibs 
predecessors has not been forgotten 
islam is the one link the violently competitive afghan tribes 
all share being recognized as a good moslem is an ironclad form of 
acceptance 
doubt in the leaders faith is strongest among the shiite moslem 
minority known as the hazara they make up about 17 percent of the 
16 million afghans 99 percent of whom are moslems the sunni sect 
is the overwhelming majority 
hundreds of thousands of hazara live in kabul but most inhabit 
the mountains at the countrys center an area known as hazarajat 
the government has little control there but the hazara rejected 
a government offer of formal autonomy earlier this year 
the hazara want to be part of the government but not their 
peoples democratic party government said one 52yearold 
professional interviewed at the chendawul mosque it is a 
communist government 
the group was officially discriminated against for years kept 
out of the army and their rituals banned in public 
the hazara now have religious freedom but they contend the 
government ignores their development needs 
if you go to hazarajat there are no houses there are no 
schools there are no hospitals said a mullah or prayer leader 
at the chendawul mosque 
the hazara spoke in interviews only on condition of anonymity 
saying that many who publicly denounced the government in the past 
were sent to prison 
they said the governments wooing them is in part motivated by 
the desire to improve relations with neighboring iran 
the islamic republic of iran founded by the late ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini is run by shiite moslem clergymen and supports 
the shiite branches of the moslem rebels the mujahedeen seeking 
to overthrow the government in kabul 
the hazara say they respect khomeini as a religious figure but 
do not look to his revolution to solve their problems 
many hazara reject fellow shiites who have joined the 
government such as prime minister sultan ali kishtmand 
the people in the party it makes no difference from what 
place what religion they are we still think they are communist 
said the mullah 
najmuddin kawyani secretary of the partys central committeee 
says our party is not a communist party our ideology is not a 
communist one 
government officials say development will come in time they 
point out that president najib who uses just one name went to the 
chendawul mosque in august and pledged 10 million afghans about 
180000 for reconstruction 
suspicions about the religious faith of the government also are 
held by other afghan moslems including maulavi abdul rauf at the 
upscale wazir akbar khan mosque which is surrounded by a rose 
garden in kabuls diplomatic quarter 
our people are moslem he said we dont know about the 
government the sunni maulavi who is roughly the equivalent of a 
bishop spent five months in prison after he assailed soviet 
influence in afghanistan at a sermon the president had attended 
he also opposes the governments practice of writing sermons in 
support of its policies for the 20000 mullahs on its payroll 
religion should be free rauf said 
the role of the government is to build more mosques persuade 
people to pray more to establish the conditions so people will 
want to pray he said 
the lack of trust in the party stems from alleged atrocities 
that followed the april 1978 marxist revolution 
independent studies put the number of afghans killed in those 
early days of the revolution at 50000 to 100000 with hazara and 
clergymen a particular target hazara claim 13000 of their 
tribesman disappeared from kabul in one day 
the governments land redistribution program was seen as an 
attempt to rewrite moslem inheritance laws and a heavyhanded 
literacy campaign as an attack on the clergy as teachers even the 
study of islamic art was banned 
these measures helped spark the rebellion against the government 
and all have been reversed since the soviet intervention in 
december 1979 after which a more tolerant wing of the party was 
given power 
the culture of the people must be taken into considertion 
said abdul ghafoor bahir minister of islamic guidance when the 
revolution came there were some mistakes 
islam was enshrined as the state religion in the constitution 
adopted in 1987 which also stipulates that the president be a 
moslem new laws cannot contradict islamic law 
najib has won praise for establishing the university of islamic 
studies and research in kabul the soviet withdrawel in february 
gave a major boost to combating his unislamic image 
the research center publishes books about islamic history in 
afghanistan such as a chronicle of the holy place in kandahar 
it is also a religious cheering section for the party however 
its walls are plastered with stickers of koranic quotations used by 
president najib 
he who destroys the house of one moslem he is in truth 
destroying his own house said one quotation it is a pointed 
reference to the destruction wrought by rockets of the mujahedeen 
whose name means holy warriors 
mohammad siddiq sailani the universitys president kabul said 
that its aim is to educate students and that the religious 
squabbling impedes progress 
some traditional customs that exist among the people are 
unislamic he said we want to replace them with the real 
islam 
among the customs he listed as unislamic was what he described 
as the lack of equal treatment for women 
a woman is not a toy he said islam establishes many 
rights for women and the rights should never be threatened by men 
the government viewpoint on this and other issues clashes 
sharply with that of gulbuddin hekmatyar leader of the 
fundamentalist hezbeislami faction of the pakistanibased 
mujahedeen 
he has a reputation for having all the bars in kabul bombed 
because islam forbids the consumption of alcohol his group also is 
believed responsible for killing two women bus drivers by blowing 
up their buses when the government briefly experimented with women 
drivers several years ago 
the government also highlights what it calls the atrocities 
committed in the name of islam by the saudi arabianfinanced 
wahhabi mercenaries fighting for the mujahedeen reports of their 
mutilating victims and selling women into slavery are widespread 
in our opinion it is because of lack of knowledge of the 
koran that makes people act like this said gholam sarwar manzur 
president of the staterun council of clergy 
afghans in general say they basically want islam respected by 
the government

remember the bachelor mother kind of movie in which ginger 
rogers seeks a husband so her baby will have a father 
look whos talking is a 1989 replay with all the old 
gimmicks intact i dont like to fly she insists next scene 
shes flying in his plane the only innovation the baby talks 
not only that the voice is that of bruce willis the title get it 
its a pleasant sitcom with amiable performances especially by 
the four infants who play mikey the scenes under the titles will 
no doubt arouse controversy a large round object floats amid 
translucent undulating folds of matter bouncing gently at the 
bottom of a pit a flock of flittering chattering polliwogs enters 
the space and one of them joyfully discovers the round object and 
climbs inside a new kind of sex education 
throughout the film the voice of willis makes comments 
enjoying his ninemonth swim complaining about his abrupt 
emergence conversing with other infants and generally observing 
the human comedy the oneliners wear thin but some of it is funny 
stuff

edge of sanity virgin vision vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
in edge of sanity anthony perkins remakes the classic dr 
jekyll and mr hyde role into cheap buffoonery 
as the good doctor jekyll he discovers the anesthetic powers of 
a remarkable new drug cocaine his research elevates him in the 
eyes of his peers it advances the causes of medicine it gives him 
vigor and vitality its great 
but it also leads to his downfall 
in a laboratory mishap jekyll is exposed to spooky dryicelike 
fumes apparently from the cocaine that presto change him into 
a ghoulish monster as hyde he is unable to resist his most base 
desire which as it turns out is slashing the throats of 
prostitutes on the streets of london 
also as hyde he gets a ridiculous makeup job his face is 
slathered with a white film that looks suspiciously like crisco 
his eyes are lined with auburn rings and his lips are painted with 
cracking rubyred grease 
the pursuit of the murderer jack the ripperhyde has scotland 
yard in a dither even though hyde kills many of his victims in 
plain view has several witnesses and leaves behind mounds of 
indicting evidence the poor blokes cant seem to nab the killer 
if you can get beyond those leaps of logic you might find some 
humor and entertainment value in the movie if you take it 
seriously and consider it a legitimate suspense thriller you will 
certainly be on the edge of sanity

working girl cbsfox home video vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
with the possible exception of the gorgeous panoramic opening 
view of new york from the statue of liberty working girl is as 
charming and fun to watch at home as it was in the theater and the 
charm is the problem 
in the guise of a tale of one of the little people making it big 
on wall street working girl reinforces stereotypes most of 
the secretaries are goodhearted but not real bright and not too 
classy the one woman at the top katharine parker sigourney 
weaver is perfectly tailored but a manipulative liar who tramples 
other women and men to keep her place 
tess mcgill melanie griffith the secretary who breaks out of 
the typing pool lies and cheats her way out using as an excuse 
that she had no part in making the rules shes breaking and shes 
also escaping her workingclass boyfriend and crowd stuck out on 
dumpy staten island 
assisting tess in her meteoric rise is of course a modern 
prince charming a broker played by harrison ford from the start 
this is not just a business partnership and even tess friend 
played wonderfully by joan cusack can see the obvious and warns 
tess not to expect him to take her away from all this though 
the audience certainly expects that to happen 
and the movie can be sloppy if tess is so determined to make it 
on wall street that she takes class after class and can show up the 
male traders then how could she possibly have overlooked the 
dress for success advice 
the acting is superior griffith ford and weaver all are a 
treat to watch kevin wades screenplay is witty and mike nichols 
direction is lively almost covering up the lack of freshness 
underneath

anderson bruford wakeman howe arista 
 
at least when jon anderson bill bruford rick wakeman and steve 
howe were members of yes it took comparatively few strokes of the 
computer keyboard to dismiss them now that they bill themselves as 
anderson bruford wakeman and howe its a bit more timeconsuming 
so lets be brief their record is as ponderous as the groups 
name all the worst tendencies of 1970s art rock brought back to 
life in digital sound wakemans pompous synthesizer playing and 
andersons soprano are even more annoying than they were 15 years 
ago such titles as fist of fire and rock gives courage 
tell you not much is happening lyrically either 
even worse these men choose to noodle and drone for 60 minutes

piano quintet in a the trout by franz schubert piano 
quartet in g minor by wolfgang amadeus mozart artur schnabel and 
the pro arte quartet emi 
 
artur schnabel giant of 20th century pianists and superlative 
beethoven interpreter is reported to have said i play beethoven 
to make my living schubert i play for love his loving treatment 
of the trout can be heard on this emi reissue of a 1935 
recording previously released on arabesque 
the interpretation may put off some listeners at first but it 
grows on you after a number of hearings schnabels occasional 
rhythmic flexing evokes an earlier romantic style as do the string 
players tendency to slide between notes 
the sound quality is not the greatest the remastering from 78s 
is uneven and background noise considerable but first violinst 
alphonse ounnous sweet tone and schnabels direct lucid reading 
of the notes shine through 
the performance is brisk and muscular but not so much that 
schuberts fleeting changes of color and mood are sacrificed in 
the first movement phrases seem to build through their own natural 
momentum the cello and viola of the pro arte a belgian quartet 
founded in 1912 and one of the most prominent before world war ii 
sing beautifully in the andante 
the scherzo is the least successful of the movements with a not 
very appealing percussive militaristic quality the tempi in the 
fourth movement variations never seem quite right but that problem 
is straightened out in the forceful finale 
the wonderful mozart g minor quartet was recorded a year 
earlier schnabel and the pro arte members give a clean squarecut 
rendition more than in the schubert the pianists singing tone 
and uncluttered phrasing come out

piano concerto in g minor by antonin dvorak introduction amp 
allegro appassionato by robert schumann andras schiff and the 
vienna philharmonic conducted by christoph von dohnanyi london 
 
the g minor piano concerto was written in 1876 midway through 
dvoraks happy career behind the bohemian master were five 
symphonies a good deal of chamber music and his first opera he 
had yet to write his last symphonic masterpieces including from 
the new work the opera rusalka and his best concerto the b 
minor for cello the 35yearold composer was still 16 years away 
from coming to new york as head of the national conservatory where 
he was affectionately known as old borax 
the g minor is a middling sort of work a little long in the 
first movement sometimes amorphous and lacking truly memorable 
moments yet the sunny melodies slavonic motifs and beautiful 
orchestration are there 
the orchestra is no mere accompaniment but collaborates with the 
soloist in a joint symphonic effort dohnanyi and schiff play it 
that way pianist and orchestra players beautifully link their 
passages picking up and gently handing back themes the vienna 
strings show an amazing sweetness in the highest reaches 
the performance is live and shows few of the drawbacks of that 
medium with the usual advantages of freshness immediacy and 
excitement schiff and the orchestra are close to flawless 
technically and the audience is incredibly quiet no tubercular 
ward of coughers here 
but the pianos recorded sound lacks richness and sounds almost 
thin in the upper register 
in the schumann not recorded live dohnanyi draws particularly 
tasteful and melding phrases from the vienna schiff plays well 
though the inspiration level seems to dip maybe that is due to a 
comparison with the live dvorak performance

century spanish school 
the metropolitan museum of art is showing the stylistic 
intellect of velazquez at an exhibit through jan 7 the show 
includes his an old woman cooking eggs 1618 with its haunting 
reality and the forge of vulcan and josephs coat two

herrera at age 11 and later to franciso pacheco christ and the 
pilgrims of emmaus is among his early work and shows his 
developing tendencies toward naturalism he was made court painter 
at the age of 25

for a political activist such as donald 
sutherland the experience of playing the role of an afrikaner who 
becomes a fighter against south africas apartheid was something to 
kickstart his soul 
the film is a dry white season which so moved another 
actor marlon brando that he ended a nineyear retirement to take 
the brief role of a civil rights lawyer the mgm release is also 
notable as the first major film by euzhan palcy a 32yearold from 
martinique who directed her only other feature sugar cane 
alley on a 1 million budget 
sutherland and palcy were here to help kick off a dry white 
season and in separate interviews both had high praise for 
brando 
hes a genius declared sutherland a genius as a 
performer but also as a human being he has this immense wealth of 
observation culture and literary reserves you start to talk to 
him and you can see the ripples of the little stone you throw into 
the water 
as a fellow actor he is blissful and so sharing he makes you 
feel so secure im 54 and to work with this man that i used to 
see in movie theaters and giggle at because he was so perfect it 
was incredibly intimidating i had this crush on him i just wanted 
to be next to him 
he was wonderful said palcy a stunning beauty with a dark 
helmet of tiny braids when marlon came to the set the first day 
of shooting dead silence nobody was talking it was magical the 
myth was there at the end of the first shot he did something very 
funny he said and now im going to pee everybody laughed 
realizing he was a human being 
expectedly brando brought his own concepts to the role of the 
defense lawyer rumpled hair a limp a cane and an english accent 
marlon didnt want to portray an afrikaner so he wanted the 
character to be an english south african barrister the director 
said 
palcys involvement with a dry white season began in 1984 
when she read the andre brink novel about an afrikaner school 
teacher whose tolerance for apartheid turns to activism at the 
sight of the regimes atrocities two years later she joined forces 
with hollywood producer paula weinstein who had been seeking a 
project about south africa 
the pair developed the script at warner bros which decided not 
to proceed mgms then boss alan ladd jr agreed to sponsor the 
project a key element in getting a dry white season made was 
the participation of brando the connection was made through the 
actors close friend jay kanter then ladds associate 
when brando approved the script palcy warned that the 9 
million budget did not permit big salaries he replied ill do 
it for nothing 
sutherland became involved in a dry white season through his 
former agent hannah weinstein paulas mother paula weinstein 
also served as his agent before moving on to production posts at 
major studios sutherland signed on at onethird his usual salary 
i thought it had the potential to be an entertaining film in 
the best sense of entertainment said the actor who has never 
visited south africa i didnt want it to be just a message 
picture 
i loved the idea of this film being about an afrikaner not 
about a white anglo liberal but an afrikaner whose forebears had 
forged their way through on that great trek to set up their own 
community it was not unlike what we did in north america we came 
in and wiped out the local people put them into reserves 
the locations for a dry white season were filmed in 
zimbabwe and sutherland rhapsodized about such experiences as 
watching 79 elephants walking noiselessly in the moonlight 
of all of the places ive been including china zimbabwe is 
the only place where my wife and i want to go back on vacation 
he said 
donald sutherland has traveled far from nova scotia where he 
grew up plagued by shyness ill health and gawkiness that prompted 
playmates to call him dumbo and goofus he withdrew into a world of 
imagination fashioning puppets and performing his own plays he 
claims a 40year career 
at 14 i was a radio announcer in nova scotia he said 
then i went to the university of toronto and got involved in 
theater there i studied at the academy of music and dramatic art 
in london i worked in the professional theater in england until i 
got a walkon part in a film called the dirty dozen 
he recalled sitting around a table with lee marvin charles 
bronson john cassavetes and other members of the cast clint 
walker complained to director robert aldrich that he didnt want to 
impersonate a general because it wasnt fitting for his role as an 
indian 
so aldrich who made decisions faster than you can imagine 
looked down the table saw my shaved head but didnt know my name 
he said you with the big ears you do it that changed 
everything sutherland recalled 
sutherland became one of the screens busiest actors with such 
achievements as mash klute and ordinary people as 
well as duds such as start the revolution without me 
casanova and die die my darling now his son kiefer is 
following his fathers footsteps 
hes terrific said donald he has what i used to have 
before i went to school and had it trained out of me a kind of 
purity

finnish conducter esapekka salonen is a 
star in the symphony orchestra world and his only lament is that 
his career in classical music started late at age 9 
in this business people start at age 4 or 5 said the 
31yearold salonen named in august as musical director of the los 
angeles philharmonic 
i realized young that this would have to be my life i had no 
other hobbies 
salonen in oslo recently as a guest conducter said he looks 
forward to settling down with the los angeles orchestra after years 
of nomadic conducting he begins with the 199293 season 
he succeeds andre previn in los angeles when i got the offer 
from la i did a hell of a lot of thinking finally after 
some time i decided it made a lot of sense salonen said 
with the la philharmonic i have an instrument that is 
capable of anything i have no other plans beyond it it is 
definitely one of the worlds most important symphonies and the 
possibilities are unlimited 
between bites of an apple during an interview in a hotel lobby 
the boyishly handsome salonen said frankly im fed up with 
hotels and guest conducting 
he currently conducts the swedish radio symphony and is 
principal guest conducter of the london philharmonia and the oslo 
philharmonic 
these and other engagements keep him on the road up to 44 weeks 
a year he speaks five languages but countries often blur and 
in the morning it doesnt matter what i say its always in the 
wrong language 
salonen in jeans and a blazer said his weariness goes deeper 
than jet lag 
guest conducting is almost doomed to be superficial unless you 
know the orchestra very well you work with one orchestra and then 
a week later you go to another place he said 
what really excites me is getting beneath the skin of an 
orchestra which is not possible as a guest conducter it takes a 
long time to build up trust you have to establish certain musical 
habits in an orchestra to be able to express yourself 
so he will take a semisabbatical in 1991 i will lay down 
in my hammock and remain there until i feel the urge to do 
something 
but he will remain open about guest conducting in oslo and 
elsewhere and about renewing his swedish contract which overlaps 
with his los angeles contract for the 199293 season 
salonen drew international attention in 1983 when he conducted 
with one weeks notice a london philharmonia performance of gustav 
mahlers third symphony 
it was followed by a us debut with the los angeles 
philharmonic and concerts in west berlin new york chicago 
boston philidelphia paris montreal minneapolis and washington 
i always have so much work to do that i havent really had 
time to think about such concepts as success he said 
salonen was raised in helsinki his classical music training 
began at age 9 he studied composition and conducted at sibelius 
academy he eventually began to give concerts in scandinavia 
i happened to be part of a stimulating group and we had a 
music society he said of his childhood experience i loved the 
instant feedback it was fun he still joins young finns who 
compose and play their own music in a group called avanti 
a a composer french horn player and pianist salonen began 
conducting to make a living and because i needed a conducter who 
was sympathetic to my music and that was me 
now i would rather see someone else conduct my music i get 
very nervous about conducting my own music 
he is known as a champion of contempory music and avantgarde 
experimentation a philharmonic has a dual function he said as a 
guardian of traditional music and as a forum for new ideas 
contemperary music allows you to understand old musical 
phenomena in new ways he said 
a conductors frustration is having to depend on others he 
said you never make your own sound you depend on the orchestra 
the chemistry is essential 
its hard to describe what i will do in los angeles it must 
be something organic something that emerges by itself from the 
collaboration between the orchestra and me 
salonen got to know the orchestra as a regular guest since 1984 
his youth and smallcountry origins will be no problem he said in 
finland talent finds encouragement 
i never felt the age question as a problem in the states the 
society favors youth and age doesnt help if you cant 
deliver he said 
being a hot property presents other problems 
you know three or four years in advance exactly where you will 
be on any given date it creates a claustrophobic feeling like 
your life is being taken away from you you talk and think about 
things that are five years in the future but by that time you will 
be five years older he said 
salonen still has few hobbies an avid reader and movie buff he 
occasionally listens to pop music so he can know whats going on 
and he cannot relax with classical music 
if i listen to classical music when im relaxing i immediately 
go to work thinking about how i would do it he said i relax 
to enthic music indian and japanese because i can just listen

combine a mail deliverer a dishwasher a tour 
guide and a certified driller of bowling balls and you have 
katrina and the waves not the average rock n roll band 
take the name for instance former postal worker kimberly rew 
is the acknowledged leader the bands principal writer and 
arranger so who gets top billing singer and exdishwasher katrina 
leskanich of course 
at first kimberly was doing the singing and the group was 
called the waves explained drummer alex cooper the bands 
onetime tour guide but once katrina started singing we became 
katrina and the waves someone said wed get more dates at the 
military camps because the soldiers will come out for a girls 
name 
military camps are important because both cooper and leskanich 
grew up in military families that traveled all over the world 
leskanich alone has lived in england germany the netherlands 
nebraska massachusetts california georgia and kansas 
the groups first live performances were at military bases 
before crowds that responded to a singer called katrina 
we used to play on these horrible naval bases up in scotland 
where these guys had in been submarines for six months and i was 
the first female theyd seen leskanich said 
theyd go absolutely wild they were up to here in liquor 
theyd pull down their pants right on the dance floor we just 
collapsed laughing it was all a joke were trying to do our 
number and it was just ridiculous 
in 1981 rew wrote walking on sunshine a good oldfashioned 
rock n roll summer song bouncy melody memorable guitar riffs 
and katrinas joyous vocals on top it sounded like a sure hit and 
was four years later 
we took it around to all the stations and all the companies 
and nothing happened cooper said then we were signed at the 
end of 84 to capitol and at the end of 85 they put it out pow a 
classic it was released at the right time just one of those 
things 
after finally cracking the charts katrina and the waves could 
be expected to get right to work on a new album they did but the 
record didnt come out until recently 
we thought we had finished the record cooper said but we 
took it back home and listened to it and said oh dear i think 
well start again we did that twice 
the waves consider their group a democracy whoever shouts 
loudest wins nothing is considered finished until everyone is 
satisfied and with four very distinct personalities that can take 
time 
alex is dad id sit home all the time if i could cmon 
hell say lets get on the bus said bassist and bowling ball 
surgeon vince de la cruz kim is the mad professor katrina is 
chief brat i just try to do as little as possible 
the band agrees that katrinas voice and kimberlys guitar and 
songwriting are the key to their sound but since katrina wont 
sing anything that doesnt feel right creative differences can 
emerge 
kims songs are brilliant and hes still going to write songs 
on his own that the bands not going to touch katrina said 
but hes trying to write songs from my point of view and 
sometimes i didnt agree 
she cited crush on you a ballad off the new album 
at first i thought it was a little too boymeetsgirl thats 
a good example of one of kims boymeetsgirl songs i tried to 
change but when i did it lost the innocence 
i have to sing a song from my point of view i feel its going 
to be believed but when you are trying to write from someone 
elses point of view you start getting into cliches 
while all due admiration for rew the fellow waves have started 
contributing their own material 
katrina and kim cowrote to have and to hold and love 
calculator kim and alex share credits on rock myself to 
sleep and the whole band contributed to chain lover rock 
n roll girls and the hit single break of hearts 
weve only started doing that in the last six months cooper 
said kimberly tended to always just come to us with songs but 
he suggested himself after about eight years that we should 
contribute its taken us eight years to get confident enough to 
work on our own ideas 
sharing material has helped keep the band together so has 
separating their private lives 
you live a very tense existence cooper said but we all 
have interests outside the band that are not musical and not 
similar to each others interests 
kimberlys happy to be working 24 hours a day seven days a 
week on music its a complete obsession we love music too but 
not with that kind of intensity

money matters to terry mcmillan but the author 
doesnt yearn for luxury hotels or billiondollar deals just 
simple things a nice apartment or a good movie 
the characters in her second novel disappearing acts 
viking 1895 think a lot about money too franklin works off 
and on as a construction worker zora is a school teacher dreaming 
of making it as a singer and songwriter 
theyre two warm intelligent people living in brooklyn who meet 
by accident and fall in love but if savings are low luck matters 
and franklin and zora are nearly destroyed by events theyre 
incapable of controlling 
she loves franklin mcmillan said thats the whole point 
of the story how much is enough how much do you give before you 
say i cant do this anymore 
its like real life every relationship starts out great and 
then reality sets in and there are things you have to deal with a 
lot of it boils down to how much of an investment youre willing to 
make in order to make a marriage or whatever work 
the novel is a tapestry of exits and entrances disappearances 
and reappearances franklins moods fluctuate like the dow jones 
average ranging from playfulness to selfpity and violence zora 
hiding a case of epilepsy she fears will drive her man away 
juggles career and family finding release in music friends and 
the son conceived with franklin 
the title of the book came to me in a dream mcmillan said 
i was in brooklyn and i knew i wanted to tell the story about 
what can happen between a man and a woman when they fall in love 
and all these other things happen 
i was in a similar situation where i couldnt believe i had 
arrived at this point i stopped seeing my friends i stopped going 
to certain places because he wasnt interested i just disappeared 
i went to sleep and when i woke up that morning i said 
disappearing acts 
mcmillan lets franklin and zora tell their own stories trading 
chapters between the two she began with the names originally 
wanting to call franklin langston after author and poet 
langston hughes and zora mona 
but somehow franklin with its soft first syllable running 
into the hard k and gently trailing off again fit the 
powerful sensitive man tortured by his inability to find steady 
work 
and the sophisticated but streetwise woman he alternately loves 
and torments was renamed zora in honor of the great writer zora 
neale hurston 
the voices followed franklins earthy and angry tender and 
romantic a selfeducated black man trying to win zoras trust 
while battling a racist society and his own feelings of inadequacy 
his voice is mirrored in the following passage 
i could see that she was a little scared at first i mean 
sparks was flying so fast and everything and i was just waiting 
for her to tell me that her heart had been broke so many times she 
didnt trust men no more i was all set to tell her this time 
baby dont be scared this man aint interested in breaking your 
heart hes interested in gluing it back together and keeping it 
for hisself 
zoras voice is hopeful and frightened shes smart enough to 
know what she wants but too dependent on franklin to contend with 
his bitterness and physical power 
one of the things ive loved about franklin from the start is 
how safe he makes me feel protected im not even talking about 
his job situation im talking about his heart when he puts his 
arms around me if the wind was blowing a hundred miles an hour i 
wouldnt know it one thing im sure of when god made him he 
shouldve been cloned more women need to feel like this 
zora was harder for mcmillan to write than franklin i wanted 
her to have some street smarts but i didnt want her to be one of 
these prissy smith college types the author said 
there are a lot of educated black people who sound white i 
didnt want her to sound like that theres a rhythm to her 
sentences 
much of mcmillans childhood can be traced by reading her first 
novel mama she grew up in a poor section of point haven 
mich but escaped to the sunshine and promise of california as a 
teenager in the late 1960s a love affair at 18 inspired her to 
write poetry and soon mcmillan was writing vignettes 
she attended the university of california at berkeley joining a 
fiction workshop run by novelist and poet ishmael reed who 
encouraged mcmillan to tap her writing talents 
it was so easy so gratifying said mcmillan who now lives 
in tucson ariz not to say i actually wrote and finished real 
stories but the whole thing was emerging and it was just 
wonderful 
vignettes soon gave way to short stories and one short story 
gave way to mama published in 1985 mcmillan needed just two 
weeks to write the books first draft and another two weeks to 
complete the second 
my mother raised a houseful of kids sort of alone and i 
think she did a good job of it she said i couldnt figure out 
how she did it it was more of an exploration or a recounting of 
where she got her strength from 
mama was autobiographical and so is disappearing acts 
when i say autobiographical i mean being able to relate and 
identify with things that i have witnessed seen observed or 
experienced or a combination of all of them

johnny lee was an unknown honkytonk 
performer before his song lookin for love from the movie 
urban cowboy climbed the charts 
his stardom though was merely a blink in time his career 
finances and personal life all plunged and now hes trying to 
regain some of what he lost 
he has a 10album contract with curb records hes selling 
another lp woods amp water through tv marketing his biography 
lookin for love has just been published by diamond books 
the negative stuff is in the past lee said things are 
positive now i look forward to making good records having a 
family being happy and healthy and being alive 
when urban cowboy with john travolta and debra winger came 
out in 1980 lees lookin for love became a hit on both the 
country music and pop charts another song cherokee fiddle 
was also on the movies soundtrack lp which sold 3 million copies 
he and his country buddy mickey gilley came to represent 
country chic in their snappy cowboy hats spiffy western shirts and 
expensive cowboy boots they appeared on tv shows such as fantasy 
island chips the dukes of hazzard and the fall guy 
and lee married actress charlene tilton who portrayed lucy ewing 
on tvs dallas 
today he and gilley are hardly friends he went four years 
without making a record all the money he thought he made during 
his peak years has vanished he and tilton divorced they had a 
child cherish lee 7 
i lost everything except my talent the 43yearold singer 
said i never saw a dime 
lee has since remarried to deb lee in november 1986 that 
marriage was a year after he released keep me hanging on his 
last album until this falls new directions 
for reasons still unclear to lee no record company wanted him 
i felt absolutely useless he said my dignity was taken 
away i just worked jobs at clubs here and there did whatever i 
could do it was quite devastating for a while 
lee was a nightclub singer in the houston area when he was 
chosen to sing lookin for love in the urban cowboy movie 
everybody related to it he said its a meaningful 
simple song to this day everyone still knows the words to that 
song 
he followed it with hit records such as one in a million 
pickin up strangers you couldve heard a heart break and 
yellow rose which also was the theme song for the former tv 
series 
but he had trouble getting money he felt was due him from his 
career an associate who was handling money lee earned from 
performing told him the money had been deposited in safe accounts 
but when lee tried to get his money back he was unable to do so he 
hired lawyers to try to get the money but legal fees mounted and 
he finally could afford them no longer he gave up 
i was ready to get on with my life and start over thats what 
i had to do start over he said 
he and gilley went their separate ways under strained 
circumstances lee said because gilley apparently felt lee didnt 
support him in his own legal battles 
i still think the world of mickey lee said i love him 
like a brother but ive called him numerous times and hes never 
returned my calls im a little let down with him it hurts me to 
think so much of someone you can only do that for so long if 
they dont think the same about you what are you going to do

richard sherry began to ponder his own 
mortality after his father died 20 years ago and wondered how to 
extend his own life 
two years later sherry found a way to help find an answer he 
enlisted as one of 1000 volunteers in what has become the 
longestrunning comprehensive study of growing old the baltimore 
longitudinal study on aging 
we owe it to ourselves said sherry 57 a year older than 
his father was when he died im a great believer in what it is 
trying to do 
sherry comes every two years from oklahoma city to the 
gerontology research center at francis scott key medical center for 
2 days of tests 
a great deal of energy has been spent by scientists who have 
worked in this study for over a quarter of a century to prove that 
aging is not a disease and does not necessarily end in a disease 
process said james fozard blsas scientific director since 
1985 many of the things that we used to blame on age are 
indeed modifiable by lifestyle and probably add to the life 
expectancy and add to the quality of life of people 
the blsa a component of the national institute on aging in the 
national institutes of health was founded in 1958 by dr nathan w 
shock regarded as the founder of modern research on aging he 
started the first nih section on gerontology in 1941 at baltimore 
city hospital 
dr shock wanted to measure such things as the rate of 
aging said fozard as it turns out this hope sort of 
disintegrated and was replaced by a number of more specific 
questions 
blsa researchers have studied agings effects on more than 1800 
people who are given physical examinations tests are done each 
visit on all of the organ systems the condition of the blood 
muscles bones hearing and vision electrocardiograms and tests 
using radiation are given less frequently 
volunteers also are tested on their memory reasoning and 
problemsolving abilities intelligence and personality a history 
of each persons aging that is used in more than 50 studies under 
way as part of the overall project 
among the findings is that there is no single biological 
master clock which drives all of the physiological aging that we 
see fozard said 
volunteers pay their own way to baltimore and spend more than 
two days every 2 years undergoing as many as 103 medical and 
behavioral tests i know of no other study that makes that kind 
of demand he said we ask them for a lifetime of commitment 
and many agree to be autopsied after they die 
the study pays for lodging and meals while volunteers are here 
as well as for the tests which could total 4000 at a doctors 
office or hospital 
the volunteers range in age from 20 to 97 sixtyfive percent 
are men 70 percent are college educated and half of those have 
advanced degrees most are middle or uppermiddleclass and only 5 
percent are black 
in some of the studies the social class definitely makes a 
difference fozard said in that sense the study may not be as 
representative as one with a more varied sample but when you 
compare all types of biological results these things dont vary 
much on social class 
scientists who use data from the blsa say the racial and social 
structure of the study is one of its weaknesses 
in an ideal world wed have it truly representative of all 
groups in the united states said dr hugh taylor at the wilmer 
eye institute at johns hopkins hospital but you have to be 
realistic there is a variety of people there and everybody is 
going to die everybody gets old 
researchers say the studys history explains its sociological 
profile 
the first subject dr william wesley peter recruited 
participants from among family and friends a practice that 
continues among volunteers today 
the study has a waiting list of about 1000 people and 
researchers have not made an effort to broaden its base fozard 
said 
paul kirbys grandfather volunteered shortly after the study 
began since then kirby 40 of glenwood md his father brother 
and three sisters became involved his wife pamela and a sisters 
husband also have volunteered 
the involvement of nine members of a single family could help 
the blsa determine whether heredity determines aging kirby said 
if they can see a trend in different generations of a family 
they might find a genetic link 
that genetic link still has scientists baffled fozard said 
we are constantly looking for ways to measure to get a handle on 
the genetic component of aging we think there are only a few genes 
involved with aging but where they are and what they are is still 
a mystery 
kenneth j nicholson 86 of mesa ariz joined the study in 
1960 he recently completed his 13th checkup for the study which 
he said has made me more cognizant of aging and the aging 
population 
nicholson said he also has modified his diet and made other 
changes in his lifestyle as a result of information gleaned during 
his visit 
information on any medical problem detected is given to the 
volunteers and their family physicians are notified so treatment 
can be prescribed 
the longer i have cooperated the more they are providing 
information to us nicholson said they give me good advice and 
that is very helpful 
fifteen scientists work with the blsa fulltime fozard said as 
many as 10 other scientists collaborate periodically through 
agreements with universities around the country the study has an 
annual budget of about 3 million 
volunteers say the blsas impact on society is enormous 
the longer it can run the more value they will get out of 
it said nicholson i would certainly hate to see it stopped

husbands and wives struggling with the 
staggering costs of nursing home care for a spouse have new 
protections against the threat of poverty under rules that kick in 
this month as part of the medicare catastrohic health insurance 
program 
the spousal impoverishment rules have broad support on 
capitol hill and appear safe from repeal as congress debates 
whether to scrap major provisions of the catastrophiccare package 
to appease senior citizens angry at the costs of the coverage 
the new nursing home protections most typically will benefit 
older women who might otherwise be left destitute when their 
husbands are institutionalized at costs averaging more than 25000 
a year advocates say 
in the past medicaid would help pay nursing home bills only 
after couples spent most assets and income of the institutionalized 
spouse often leaving the athome spouse little to live on 
it was really a very tragic situation said laura loeb of 
the older womens league with women living on average about 
eight years longer than men these older women were forced to live 
out their remaining years in poverty 
attorney patricia nemore of the national senior citizens law 
center said that if most of a couples assets and income were 
listed in the name of the spouse who went into the nursing home 
you could lose pretty much everything 
some couples were driven to divorce to establish courtordered 
property and income rights for the noninstitutionalized spouse 
a 1987 congressional study found that the high costs of 
nursinghome care were quickly exhausting many couples resources 
leaving more than half of all couples impoverished within six 
months after one spouse entered a nursing home about 15 percent of 
the nations 15 million nursing home residents are married 
most often it is the wife who remains in the community and 
she often is left with little or no money with which to meet her 
own health care and other needs the senate special committee on 
aging reported last year 
under rules that took effect sept 30 and being implemented by 
states this month the spouse in the community will be able to keep 
more of the couples combined assets and income 
where couples in the past could qualify for medicaid help only 
after spending all but about 20003000 in assets other than 
their homes and certain personal belongings now they will be able 
to keep 1200060000 depending on the level set by their state 
the minimum monthly income allowed in the past was set at the 
supplemental security income level 368 in 1989 but now rises to 
122 percent of poverty or 815 and will increase to 133 percent 
in july 1991 and 150 percent in july 1992 states will be allowed 
to let couples keep up to 1500 a month in 1989 with the maximum 
rising in future years 
income and asset limits could be even higher if ordered by the 
courts 
ronald pollack executive director of families usa an advocacy 
group for the elderly said that while the new protection doesnt 
solve the problem of rising costs for longterm care it 
certainly provides tremendous relief 
for somebody who has lived relatively well the amount they 
can keep still may be seen as a hardship but for those of moderate 
to middle income it is going to substantially improve the 
protection that they had before pollack said 
the health care financing administration has estimated that in 
fiscal 1990 the new protections will cost the federal government 
165 million and state governments 135 million the federal share 
will rise to 245 million in 1991 and the state share to 200 
million 
john rother legislative director for the american association 
of retired persons said the costs are a drop in the bucket yet 
produce a benefit that is a real lifesaver for many older 
americans 
it doesnt do anything for the person without a spouse but it 
does protect many of the people whove sacrificed the most 
husbands and wives who already have spent years taking care of a 
spouse at home rother said 
the new impoverishment rules were enacted as part of a program 
to insure the elderly against the costs of catastrophic illness 
but even before all the programs benefits have taken effect many 
senior citizens are demanding its repeal because they say it is too 
costly 
congress is expected to scrap much of the program or cut it 
back but even legislators leading the call for repeal favor 
preserving the new impoverishment rules as a worthwhile and 
inexpensive protection 
advocates for the elderly meanwhile say that even if the whole 
catastrophic program survives the nation still needs a solution to 
the high costs of longterm care largely overlooked in the package 
spousal impoverishment is a result of the fact that our health 
care system doesnt cover these costs said ms loeb we still 
need some sort of public program that provides protection for the 
really catastrophic costs of nursing and home health care

maggie wiel is 80 nearly blind and 
cant live on her own yet she bristles at talk of a nursing home 
but wiel lives at tam house a communal home on a treelined 
street in the shadow of mount tamalpais with seven other women and 
two men its directors call tam house an idea whose time has come 
residents are simply thankful it exists 
its perfect for someone like me i needed to be around people 
but i needed to be independent and on my own said dorothy 
wright 70 who moved in 18 months ago after separating from her 
husband of 46 years 
now wright spends her time gardening playing bingo visiting 
nearby senior centers and hiking six miles a day its great to 
be able to walk to a good trout fishing lake from your home she 
said 
charlotte mulford 79 came to tam house after staying with a 
cousin on his houseboat in sausalito now she wouldnt feel 
comfortable going back if i didnt live here i couldnt afford 
to live anywhere else she said 
the 7yearold private nonprofit home owned and operated by 
the ross valley ecumenical housing association offers more 
independence than a boardandcare home while fostering 
companionship and support although there is a waiting list there 
hasnt always been communal living isnt for everyone 
it took more than a year to fill the sixbedroom main house and 
fourbedroom annex said norma dougherty rveha executive director 
it was a new idea shared living was not a real popular idea with 
seniors 
many wanted their own apartment and were reluctant to squeeze a 
lifetimes belongings into a bedroom dougherty said and for many 
tam house also is the first time theyve lived with a group since 
they were youngsters 
tam house is the product of a group of local church members who 
started meeting in 1975 to discuss senior housing in 1980 they 
found the house which was bought and renovated with federal 
development funds 
residents must be at least 55 and able to live independently 
when they move in rents range from 400 to 425 a month including 
dinner and food for doityourself breakfasts operating costs were 
78780 in 1988 dougherty said 
advocates for the elderly expect shared group housing to become 
increasingly common among seniors its very common among young 
people its just not been an acceptable mode of living among old 
people until recently said ellen caulfield director of the 
marin county agency on aging i think it is an extraordinarily 
viable concept but it takes the right mix of people 
this year for the first time california expanded its senior 
housing program to include funds for such shared group residences 
for those who dont mind paring down group housing offers a 
balance of privacy and company 
mulfords tidy room disguises the fact that she has boxes and 
crates under the bed jammed in the closet and covered with afghans 
in the corner little things can rankle she admitted laughing at 
her own annoyance when others forget to refill the ice cube tray or 
replace a roll of toilet paper 
but the good outweighs the bad she said tam house is within 
walking distance of shopping restaurants entertainment and public 
transit 
although residents must be independent tam house is small 
enough to accommodate changes wiels glaucoma has reduced her 
vision since she moved in so that they wouldnt take me this way 
now but residents help her with chores and all agree she is 
coping remarkably well with her handicap 
otto springer 81 is a senior member of the house having moved 
in in 1983 boxes of files create a mazelike pattern on his floor 
and books and more files practically spill off the bookshelves a 
portable computer hums in the corner springer is writing his 
memoirs 
he is a survivor of german concentration camps and was a spy for 
the british secret service who worked to rescue jews during world 
war ii he was imprisoned for refusing to divorce his jewish wife 
who escaped family photos hang on the wall beside framed 
commendations from israel and california 
although his two daughters have each offered to share their 
homes springer will never accept i would have the feeling that 
i am burdening someone we have a wonderful relationship but i 
wouldnt want to encroach on their privacy even if you have a big 
house its a problem to have old people around 
although only one person who had a drinking problem has been 
evicted tam house residents are sensitive to the ruptures that 
conflicts can cause 
springer said he is sometimes bothered by noise but uses 
earplugs rather than complain because it would establish a 
certain tension 
this is 10 crotchety old people said teddy mcdonald 81 
were all set in our ways before we get here its simply amazing 
how we all get along

chip hutton has retired from a 27year navy 
career that included the command of two ships but hes still 
giving plenty of orders 
you cant do anything now but sit in your seat 
i want everything off the desk 
listen to me if youre not listening youre not going to do 
well 
the orders are directed at fourth and fifthgraders at 
larchmont elementary school hutton 50 became their teacher this 
year after completing an old dominion university program that 
offers a masters degree and teaching certification to retiring 
military personnel 
i believe that i can help these kids the former navy 
commander said of his 16 students all of whom have failed a grade 
and have difficulty learning 
between commanding a destroyer and a salvage ship hutton spent 
much of his career teaching rotc courses fed up with 
administrative work he chose his new career because it lets him 
work with a small number of students all day long 
hutton is one of the first graduates of the old dominion 
program which has attracted 162 military personnel nearing 
retirement all but four are men 
robert h macdonald professor of educational curriculum and 
instruction at old dominion has no trouble recruiting students or 
finding schools for them 
the school divisions are calling and asking for these guys 
said mcdonald their military backgrounds make them good planners 
counselors and negotiators and all those are teacher skills 
they also bring to education just extensive life experiences 
macdonald has found the retired officers are no more 
authoritarian than anyone else they are unfamiliar with young 
children though so the program sends them into the schools to 
talk with students and teachers before they decide whether teaching 
is right for them 
a halfdozen have done their student teaching at indian river 
junior high school in chesapeake where assistant principal kathy 
dulaney said theyre wonderful they come in with a lot of 
experiences that we can use theyre used to dealing with the 
public theyve got lots of managerial skills 
one indian river mother wanted to know if her son could have a 
retired military officer for his teacher again this year because 
the one her son had last year was the only teacher who ever made 
him work ms dulaney said 
the military retirees also provide good role models for teenage 
boys she said for so many of our kids the father figure is 
absent 
similar programs are offered in florida california and north 
carolina which have large military populations but old dominions 
is the largest said macdonald many of the retired officers are 
interested in teaching math or science both areas where teacher 
shortages have developed 
hutton went into his new job with realistic expectations so 
hes had few surprises he has learned that teaching rambunctious 
children takes a lot more patience than giving orders to sailors on 
a ship it takes an awful lot of patience and you have to grab 
every success that you have and remember it because the successes 
are few and long in coming

david karp is only 45 but hes convinced his worst 
years are just around the corner karp isnt afraid of old age he 
just fears the 50s 
the boston college sociologist believes too much attention is 
paid to the trauma of turning 30 the midlife crises of the 40s and 
the infirmities of old age the 50s may be the most neglected 
decade and the most frightening the 50s he says is when ones 
mortality first comes sharply into focus 
the basic idea of the science of aging is how other people 
define us said karp who studied 72 people between 50 and 60 
youre as young or old as other people make you feel 
i think that during the 50s those messages pick up steam 
during this period people begin to think in terms of how long they 
have to live 
writing in a recent issue of the gerontologist in a piece 
titled a decade of reminders karp outlines the ominous signs 
of aging that appear for the first time in the 50s 
he begins with the body reminders 
in the 50s peoples bodies begin to betray them some develop 
lifethreatening disabilities for others its as simple as 
playing ball with your kid and noticing you cant throw the ball 
that far anymore 
then come the generational reminders 
those in their 50s are sandwiched between generations in a 
way that makes them face their own growing limitations karp said 
their elderly parents may be aging rapidly or about to die and 
their children may be growing more independent often making them 
grandparents 
finally there are contextual reminders like the perennial 
wunderkind who suddenly realizes his days as a whiz kid are long 
over 
people find themselves the oldest in many settings people 
want you to be their mentor people start to read the obituary 
pages collectively they give rise to a changing conception of 
time they recognize the finiteness of time 
the sharpness of the recognition that youre aging the 
discrepancy between mental and physical selves becomes harder and 
harder to maintain 
men and women may cope with these psychological crises 
differently 
by their early 50s men especially professionals have usually 
reached the peak of the their careers karp said its often 
depressing to them to realize they may never go higher 
but many women who sublimated career ambitions to home and 
family may have just joined the work force in their 40s they feel 
they still have a lot to do 
whereas men in their 50s are beginning to develop an exit 
consciousness women cant even thing about it karp said 
but all is not just doom and gloom he said though the 
signs of aging are there nothing is said married couples in 
their 50s their children often already launched may live together 
for another 15 years 
people are working longer at the same time many of the 
people talk about a growing wisdom they see things more 
holistically they look forward to life they sometimes see the 
empty nest as a liberating time

journalism careers begin humbly under 
wesley maurer a 93yearold patriarch of the profession who starts 
the process by having bright young students restock newspaper 
vending machines 
maurer teaches an old school of journalism the smalltown kind 
known unkindly in bigcity newsrooms as chicken dinner news 
its the toughest journalism there is and the most important he 
believes 
maurer bought the mackinac island town crier for his students 
and the st ignace news for himself at both weeklies reporters 
and interns write about ice cream socials and summer parades they 
sell ads take subscriptions paste up the paper and collect 
quarters from the stands 
they also probe social issues and pry truth from rumor and they 
listen for the beat of the community heart 
the idea to know about journalism is to know the whole 
thing maurer says that means living with the people you write 
about and to whom you sell the stories and the ads shed your 
cynicism and tell readers of their own decency grace and 
commonweal maurer says 
you might not expect to learn such high ideals selling ads for 
an obstinate man who can hardly hear who sits dwarfed in his dim 
office beneath a wall of books ripping into newspaper stories 
here is a man who advocates such oldschool and now taboo ideas as 
doctoring quotes to improve their clarity 
some of maurers students start their summers on mackinac island 
thinking theyre entering a museum the necessity for reporters to 
cover their beats by riding bicycles on the motorless island 
doesnt help 
i think they look at him in a way just as an old man i hate 
to see it but i know where its coming from said one of maurers 
disciples richard hayden a publisher who came out of retirement 
to be advertising manager 
i know they respect him but they wonder with his age that he 
might be out of touch with reality they look at him as a 
stodgy old professor 
then all of a sudden its a rude awakening heres this man 
tearing into their copy and theyre not prima donnas anymore 
there is more to wesley maurer than this 
he works every day of every week and always wears a suit with a 
university of michigan pin he joined the faculty in 1928 and was 
journalism chairman for two decades starting in 1947 and a tie 
with a perfect windsor knot even when weeding his beloved roses 
sunday mornings he gathers his interns for threehour lectures on 
topics ranging from the cold war to why papers didnt sell 
he called me back into his office once and i thought there was 
something wrong with one of my stories said former st ignace 
reporter mark esper now at the ironwood daily globe instead he 
leans back in his chair and says light can illuminate but it can 
also blind 
vintage maurer 
the reporters he has coached encouraged and tormented have gone 
on to become correspondents editors and publishers around the 
world 
he is a terrific teacher a very stimulating fellow he makes 
you think said earl gottschalk one of maurers first island 
interns now senior writer for the los angeles bureau of the wall 
street journal 
maurers students tell of a relentless teacher and 
perfectionist the idiosyncrasies are tolerated the ideologies are 
cherished 
i feel every moment i can spend with him is worthwhile he is 
forever the teacher says senior intern sean reavie i know new 
students see this 90yearold man waddling around and they say 
what can he do for us but they genuinely love the man at the end 
of the summer 
and how maurer loves them i get always connected with young 
people its a delight i find them interesting 
age now is wedging itself between maurer and the business he 
loves bypass surgery last fall knocked him off his feet despite 
doctors orders he would come down here and be on his feet to 
check the paper hayden said he was just obstinate i know he 
had said to me at one time when he was recovering that he thought 
it could be the beginning of the end 
i had never seen that attitude in him 
maurer has however turned over more of the daily newspaper 
work to his son wesley maurer jr and to hayden neither man has 
a journalism degree but both are lifelong students of maurers 
community news 
im an old man who doesnt know when to retire maurer says 
as long as i can i will do some kind of work because i think 
that keeps you alive

a revolution called xeriscape is sweeping home 
and public landscapes of the west manicured lawns and carefully 
tended plants seem out of place native plants requiring minimal 
care and water are popular 
water shortages are the primary catalyst of course but the big 
push comes when folks realize many native plants are things of 
beauty that can be grown with minimal effort and expense 
in denver for example a water department brochure suggests a 
number of outstanding plants that grow well with little or no water 
beyond what nature provides and reports savings of from 30 percent 
to 60 percent 
lots of greenery does not have to mean lots of water says a 
brochure published by the arizona municipal water association the 
state department of water resources the salt river project which 
manages reservoirs and the cities of phoenix glendale mesa 
scottsdale and tempe 
xeriscape news is the official publication of the national 
xeriscape council inc 940 e 51st st austin texas 78751 a 
recent edition featured the opening of a xeriscape garden in a san 
diego park though most material is aimed at the average homeowner 
the more than 50 xeriscape projects nationwide include a 
demonstration garden in wichita kan 
the national council has trademarked the term xeriscape to 
prevent its use as a product or corporate name for private gain 
the xeriscape concept which means water conservation through 
creative landscaping is generally credited to a 1981 idea of the 
denver water department the idea of course has been around for 
years especially in the arid southwest 
one of the earliest advocates was warren jones then a professor 
of landscape architecture at the university of arizona he won 
hoots of derision when he first suggested limiting lawns to 
10by10 feet jones now retired is a director of the national 
council and removing most of the lawn is generally the first 
recommendation to homeowners switching from conventional 
landscaping 
the second recommendation is to use plants adapted to ones 
area grouping them according to moisture light climate and other 
needs 
be sure to learn the needs of any plant and have a use for it 
in your landscape before purchase advises the front range 
xeriscape task force of colorado 
the concept involves using numerous attractive trees shrubs 
flowers and ground covers plus mulches pruning weeding 
fertilizing pest control and similar maintenance often isnt 
required because of plant adaptability 
while low water use is a must there is some dispute over 
whether this is a sufficient criteria few things are more 
beautiful than our deserts natural lowcare lowwaterusing 
plants says robert breunig director of phoenixs desert 
botanical garden 
karen reichardt president of the arizona native plant society 
says our native mesquites desert willows palo verdes and 
acacias help to distinguish the state olives eucalyptus and 
italian cypress are examples of things that will thrive in perth 
australia or kabul iran as well as here if we focus only on 
watersaving plants we open the doors to their widespread use 
greg mcpherson a university of arizona assistant professor of 
landscape architecture recently studied the landscaping value of 
the native palo verde and the nonnative mulberry a popular shade 
tree in arizona 
starting with 5yearold trees he found it cost 25 a year more 
to irrigate the mulberry although it provided about equivalent 
savings in air conditioning most native trees also grow much 
quicker than nonnative ones the desert willow for example can 
grow three feet a year in the the summer before reaching its 
eventual height of around 25 feet and its always included in 
lists of highly desirable local trees

more than half of all cancers occur in 
people 65 and older but many people mistakenly assume that once 
they reach retirement age they are powerless to prevent the disease 
that its just too late to try 
age is one of the greatest risk factors for developing cancer 
at 25 the chance of being diagnosed with cancer within five years 
is one in 700 at 65 it is one in 14 however scientists are 
convinced we can improve those odds 
its never too late to prevent cancer heres how 
stop smoking cigarette smoking causes 85 percent of lung 
cancers in men and 75 percent in women smokers also are more 
likely to develop cancers of the mouth throat esophagus pancreas 
and bladder once you quit no matter what your age your risk of 
cancer begins to decline right away 
eat a variety of good foods researchers have found that a 
highfat diet increases the risk of breast colon and prostate 
cancers which are common in older people a wellbalanced diet 
reduces the risk in particular eat more highfiber foods 
wholegrain cereals fruits and vegetables and fewer fatty foods 
butter cream and highfat cheese its not as hard as it sounds 
you dont have to give up all of the foods you like eat more of 
the foods that reduce your risk of cancer and less of those that 
increase it 
drink alcohol only in moderation cancers of the mouth throat 
esophagus and liver occur more often among heavy drinkers of 
alcohol 
avoid too much sun almost all skin cancers are caused by 
exposure to the sun repeated exposure is especially dangerous for 
people with fair skin and those who freckle easily the sun is 
strongest from 11 am to 2 pm sunscreen lotions and protective 
clothing like a hat or longsleeved shirt can help 
use hormones carefully estrogen has been associated with 
higherthanaverage rates of uterine cancer women who take it to 
relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause should discuss 
the benefits and risks with their doctor 
in addition to changing your lifestyle enlist your doctor the 
chances of surviving cancer are greatest with early detection and 
prompt treatment 
even before symptoms appear doctors can detect cancers of the 
breast colon prostate and cervix as part of your regular 
checkup your doctor may recommend a number of tests to look for 
these and other forms of cancer 
for example all women should have their breasts examined 
regularly by a doctor and should learn how to perform monthly 
breast selfexamination after menopause women should examine 
their breasts the same day each month an xray of the breast 
mammogram can detect a cancer too small to be felt beginning at 
50 women should have a mammogram each year or as recommended by a 
doctor 
men and women over 40 should have a digital rectal exam on an 
initial visit to a primary care doctor and at least every three 
years after that this is the most reliable test for prostate 
cancer in men it also can detect cancer of the rectum in men and 
women 
the stool blood test for rectal and colon cancers is recommended 
yearly after age 50 in addition most cancer specialists recommend 
sigmoidoscopy an examination of the colon and rectum with a thin 
hollow lighted instrument which can detect cancer and noncancerous 
growths this exam is recommended at least once after age 50 and 
then every three to five years after two negative exams a year 
apart 
most cases of cervical cancer could be prevented if every woman 
had a pap test and pelvic exam regularly the pap test detects 
cancerous cells in and around the cervix after women have normal 
test results three years in a row their doctors may suggest they 
have a pap test less often 
many people automatically attribute aches and pains to growing 
older they may ignore their symptoms assuming they are an 
unavoidable part of aging most symptoms are not serious but only 
a doctor can tell for sure to be safe tell your doctor about any 
unusual symptoms that last two weeks or more 
cancer frightens everyone but many older people are reluctant 
to discuss it with their families or doctors because they believe a 
number of myths about the disease and its treatment when they grew 
up nothing could stop cancers deadly progress even the word was 
whispered behind the patients back 
today however many cancers can be treated successfully if 
found early even better news is that the chances of surviving are 
greater than ever the best news of all is that many cancers can 
even be prevented

americans waste billions of dollars on 
unneeded medical costs while nearly half the us population cant 
pay for decent care says a report to a congressional study group 
witnesses before the panel recommend national health insurance 
national care standards to avoid unnecessary treatments an 
emphasis on preventive medicine and a shift of more research 
dollars to health problems affecting the elderly according to the 
report 
the american health care system is expensive wasteful and 
denies millions of americans even the most basic medical 
attention rep james h scheuer dny said today in releasing 
the report 
we spend 15 billion a day on health care much more as a 
share of gnp than any other industrialized nation he said are 
we getting our moneys worth absolutely not 
the report was based on nine days of hearings conducted in 1988 
by the joint economic committees subcommittee on education and 
health chaired by scheuer the 18member committee is a bipartisan 
economic advisory group with membership weighted in favor of the 
majority party 
some of the findings 
of the 500 billion spent in 1988 by americans on health care 
125 billion was spent on unneeded tests and procedures including 
many caesarean sections pacemaker implants and coronary bypasses 
paperwork imposes a 20 surcharge on every 100 spent for health 
care with malpractice premiums adding to that 
some 37 million americans have no insurance 70 million more 
are underinsured and 23 million are served by medicaid which has 
declined in its ability to provide basic or equitable coverage the 
us population is 240 million 
twelve percent of the population is 65 and older a group that 
generates high health care costs that will grow to one in four in 
2050 with 20 percent of that group expected to be 85 and over yet 
while incontinence dementia and arthritis all problems of the 
elderly produce 60 billion a year in health care costs only 200 
million is spent annually on research to combat those afflictions 
the report recommended that until national health insurance can 
be provided medicare must be required to implement a fee schedule 
and encourage preferred provider organizations those are 
physicians who meet cost quality and volume expectations 
standards of care must be developed to prevent unnecessary 
treatments it said 
people must be encouraged to develop good habits such as diet 
and exercise that will prevent illness the report said adding 
that research priorities must be drastically reordered to focus 
on diseases of the elderly 
it also suggested seeking alternatives to malpractice lawsuits 
the subcommittee members are reps augustus f hawkins

the company that held a monopoly on japans 
international telephone service will cut its rates by 14 percent 
next month to compete with two new rivals officials said monday 
kokusai denshin denwa co ltd began receiving telephone service 
competition sunday from the new international telecom japan and 
international digital communications 
the new companies started with service to the united states and 
hong kong the two places called most frequently from japan 
company officials said 
idc plans to extend its services to britain and singapore later 
this year and to taiwan next year company spokesman koyo taura 
said 
itj said it also would be serving singapore britain and france 
by november and such places as south korea taiwan australia and 
west germany next year 
government officials said they hoped the new competition would 
help the international telephone business grow in japan 
while domestic phone calls produce about 337 billion a year in 
profit the international phone business in japan has been worth 
only 144 billion in annual profit said takaharu yamamoto 
spokesman for the post and telecommunication ministry

year he said 
the two newcomers normal daytime rates for threeminute calls 
to the united states are 486 lower than kdds current 635 
taura said 
the post and telecommunication ministrys recent approval for 
kdds percent rate cut starting nov 1 to 520 would narrow the 
price gap making competition keener he added 
kdd has reduced its rates nine times since 1979 said kdd 
spokesman shinichiro terada the largest reduction was last years 
21 percent cut said the post ministrys yamamoto 
japan long has been criticized for expensive international phone 
call rates 
it used to be almost twice as expensive to call from japan to 
america we admit that yamamoto said 
but the gap has been narrowing and will narrow further with 
healthy competition in japan yamamoto added

august its first advance in three months and the largest this 
year the government said today in a report indicating the building 
industry may be pulling out of its slump

a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4218 billion last month 
that followed decreases of 06 percent in july and 08 percent in 
june spending rose 14 percent in may 
the august advance was the biggest since a 23 percent gain in 
december 1988 
it was thought earlier the industry decline had bottomed out 
when the commerce department reported that july construction 
spending posted a tiny fractional increase of 002 percent 
however additional information caused a downward revision in that 
report 
analysts have been looking for a pickup in construction spending 
ever since interest rates began falling earlier in the year 
fixedrate mortgage rates declined from a peak of 1122 percent in 
march to 1022 at the end of august according to a survey by the 
federal home loan mortgage co

the governmentowned railroad in april 1987 
the train never has been involved in a major accident

before the tokyo olympic games was seen as a symbol of japans 
remarkable postwar economic recovery 
the tokyoosaka run has since been cut to three hours with 
trains running at up to 138 miles an hour ms shimokawa said 
monday 
in 1975 the original line from tokyo was extended past osaka to 
hakata on the southernmost main island of kyushu 563 miles west 
of tokyo

zenith electronics corp said today it was 
selling its fastgrowing computer group to the french company 
groupe bull to concentrate on consumer electronics the weaker 
segment of its business 
zenith is the last major usheadquartered manufacturer of 
televisions a business that has usually lost money for the company 
in recent years 
zenith said in a statement it expected the purchase price for 
the computer business to be less than 635 million with the exact 
amount to be based on the net asset value of the computer business 
when the deal is closed probably by the end of the year 
the deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval 
sales of glenview illbased zeniths computer systems and 
components expanded by 23 percent to 16 billion last year 
compared to a 27 percent increase in consumerelectronics sales 
which totaled 11 billion 
despite its fast growth zenith chairman jerry k pearlman said 
the computer business was saddled with a large amount of debt that 
had restricted zeniths ability to realize the full potential of 
its consumer electronics division 
zenith will emerge as a conservatively financed company better 
prepared to capitalize on our strengths in consumer electronics 
pearlman said in a statement 
zenith said it will concentrate on new consumer electronics 
and component technologies particularly highdefinition television 
and advanced highresolution color displays 
zeniths stock surged more than 2 a share to 1675 from 
fridays close of 1450 in early trading today on the new york 
stock exchange pearlman estimated the book value of zeniths stock 
after the sale at 19 a share 
charles ryan an analyst with merrill lynch amp co said the deal 
represented good value for stockholders he said that with the

an importer of fine spanish porcelain that 
accuses another company of illegally selling the product in the 
united states at a discount lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that permitted 
the socalled gray market import of lladro porcelain 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals had ruled last may in 
favor of jalyn corp of new jersey and against weil ceramics and 
glass inc a new york firm 
the appeals court relied in part on a 1988 supreme court ruling 
that upheld a lions share of the multibilliondollar gray market 
the justices said then that the us customs service does not 
have to shut down the gray market famousname foreignmade goods 
bearing valid us trademarks sold in this country at reduced 
prices without approval from trademark owners 
weil ceramics is a wholly owned subsidiary of lladro exportadora 
of spain weil became the exclusive us distributor of the 
handmade porcelain in 1966 and later was acquired by the spanish 
company 
jalyn corp and its president bernard dash began importing 
lladro porcelain in 1982 
weil seeking to collect damages and block the rival imports 
sued jalyn over alleged trademark infringement 
the 3rd circuit court rejected weils arguments that the supreme 
courts 1988 ruling does not apply to it because it is the 
independent owner of the us trademark for lladro porcelain 
although weil was not a sham incorporated by lladro with the 
specific intent to benefit from the protection of the trademark 
act its present relationship with lladro nonetheless presents the 
potential for undesired monopoly of the domestic us market 
the appeals court said 
weil said it should have exclusive rights to sell the porcelain 
in this country because its marketing promotion and distribution 
efforts have built the popularity of the lladro name 
the case is weil ceramics vs dash 89173

you have the assurance of a person with 60 years 
of experience that there will be no recession so long as interest 
rates remain high 
that might sound odd because conventional thinking associates 
high or rising interest rates with a downturn sometime in the 
future this fellow says high rates will protect us from recession 
albert sindlinger has been analyzing public and economic opinion 
for close to six decades during the past three of them through 
information gathered from an average of 110 telephone calls a day 
seven days a week 
the staff of sindlinger amp co asks probing personal questions of 
a scientific sample of households and obtains remarkably straight 
answers out of each interview comes about 95 pieces of information 
the staff is especially interested in levels of income compared 
with six months earlier and income expectations for the next six 
months they ask about job security and about the households view 
of business six months ahead 
albert sindlinger a pioneer in consumer research analyzes the 
data of late that data has suggested a lot of americans feel 
rather wellheeled as usual he wanted to know why and made sure 
his staff probed into the subject 
answer any question asked by a canny interviewer and youre 
likely to provide more information than you realize one bit of 
information stood out people felt comfortable because they are 
getting good returns on their savings 
this is part of what often is referred to as the wealth effect 
although it is a lot more complicated than that with banks 
deregulated remember the old days of 525 percent interest a year 
people know they can get good returns 
to say that they have gone yield crazy may be an 
exaggeration although sindlinger used the term a couple of times 
but they are squeezing every nickel they can out of their assets in 
savings bonds certificates of deposit corporate and junk bonds 
it is an accepted dictum of market psychology that when 
consumers feel comfortable they are inclined to spend this being 
so says sindlinger theres a real question of whether the fed can 
wrestle inflation by raising rates 
but these people also carry a lot of debt too sure they do 
says sindlinger but never forget that you cant go into debt 
unless you have assets not just a nest egg of collateral but a 
good secure job too 
this situation tends to feed inflation but there is more for 
the first time in seven years sindlinger is finding an ominous 
rise in the wage demands of service workers that also is an 
inflationary sign 
the stock market sindlinger is finding that while households 
might have debts some of those debts are going to finance stock 
purchases adding to the wealth effect 
this debt situation household and corporate might cause 
problems down the road but he believes the immediate impact is to 
sustain a relatively high level of stock prices together with a 
sense of financial wellbeing 
many people feel capitalistic today he said about 20 years ago 
fewer than 25 percent of households had 100000 of liquid assets 
now he says 55 percent do its a bullish feeling even if 
100000 isnt what it used to be 
as sindlinger sees it the household financial condition 
explains why house democrats lost the battle of capital gains 
taxes he says too many of their old constituents think of 
themselves as taxpayers rather than tax recipients 
but the biggest lesson of all he maintains is for the federal 
reserve board that august body he says appears to be in the 
position of trying to fight inflation via high interest rates but 
is fueling it instead

the supreme court on monday allowed states to 
file criminal charges against companies accused of neglecting the 
health and safety of workers and limited alaskas efforts to 
control offshore energy exploration in another businessrelated 
decision as the court opened a new term the justices refused to 
take up an antitrust controversy stemming from the onceplanned 
acquisition by thomas j lipton inc of kraft incs celestial 
seasonings inc two years ago 
competitor rc bigelow inc had claimed in a federal lawsuit 
that a merger would create a monopoly a federal judged favored 
lipton but an appeals court reinstated the suit saying the deal 
which was later canceled was in apparent violation of antitrust 
laws 
in the workersafety decision the supreme court let stand a 
ruling in an illinois case that federal workplace regulations dont 
bar state prosecutions 
five officials of chicago magnet wire corp await trial on 
charges of recklessly injuring 42 workers by exposing them to toxic 
chemicals extreme heat and other unsafe conditions at a 
wirecoating plant 
but chicago magnet wire officials argued criminal charges should 
be dropped because the federal government preempted state 
prosecutions when it enacted the occupational safety and health act 
of 1970 the company said worker safety should be part of uniform 
national standards 
the illinois supreme court last february ruled that state 
criminal law can provide a valuable and forceful supplement to 
insure that workers are adequately protected 
in the case involving alaska the high court left intact rulings 
that allowed the federal government last year to sell leases on 56 
million acres of bristol bay off alaskas southwestern coast 
the court turned away warnings by alaska gov steve cowper and 
others that an oil spill in bristol bay could do more environmental 
harm than the massive exxon valdez spill in alaskas prince william 
sound last march 
the disputed leases were sold for nearly 100 million after a 
federal judge and the 9th us circuit court of appeals rejected a

state legal and consumer officials said 
monday that after a successful sting operation they were suing a 
pennsylvania company over alleged deceptive techniques in marketing 
the contour chair a chair advertised on television by 
entertainer art linkletter 
acting attorney general clarine nardi riddle said claims that 
the chairs which are sold through presentations in customers 
homes were custom fitted for individual consumers were false 
she also said salesmen deceived buyers in offering 
seniorcitizen and other discounts when there was no original 
retail price for the chair which she said sells for anywhere from 
2800 to more than 4000 
the suit filed in hartford superior court sept 19 charges use 
of false and deceptive sales techniques by the distributor contour 
lounge inc of bensalem pa its president mark s levinthan of 
huntington valley pa and the manufacturer craftmaticcontour 
organization inc of trevose pa 
the suit seeks to have the company barred from doing business in 
connecticut riddle said that the state of washington has already 
obtained a ceaseanddesist order against the company and others 
wisconsin pennsylvania and oregon as well as the city of denver 
colo are trying 
charles b chernofsky the lawyer for craftmaticcontour said 
the companys sales techniques were standard in the business 
im sorry for the way they feel but contour is really 
doing nothing that ive been able to determine thats wrong 
chernofsky said 
he said the chairs are in fact custom made for each 
customer including the size fabric and various configurations of 
viviration units vibrators and heating units preferred by 
each customer 
all those factors he said affect the price of the chair 
accounting for differences in prices that customers paid 
riddle said the sting included employees of the department of 
consumer protection posing as interested customers the employees 
were secretly wired and taped the sales presentations that 
allegedly used false and deceptive claims including offering 
discounts that didnt exist according to consumer protection 
commissioner mary m heslin 
this is an important case because these chairs are advertised 
extensively on television and also because weve had problems with 
their sales techniques before riddle said adding that 281 of 
the chairs had been sold in connecticut 
she said the sales techniques violated terms of a court 
settlement two years ago between the company and the state she 
also said that the salesmen claimed that the chairs were medical 
devices and endorsed by the american medical association and 
claimed that the companys sales materials and business practices 
had been approved by riddles office 
chernofsky said the problems encountered in other states were 
not directly related to the chairs themselves but with 
distributors who had difficulty filling orders 
he said the company would vigorously challenge the allegations 
in court

usx corp monday offered to sell the natural 
gas and oil reserves of its texas oil amp gas corp subsidiary in 
what is being viewed on wall street as a concession to shareholders 
texas oil amp gas has been a disappointment to usx since it was 
acquired in 1986 in a 3 billion stock swap 
i think shareholders have just lost their patience said 
david n fleischer of prudential bache securities 
usx is showing a willingness to part with assets that probably 
will appreciate if held long enough but could enhance the stocks 
value now by being sold he said 
this is a very strong statement that theyre committed to 
shareholders fleischer said 
chief among the shareholders who stand to benefit is corporate 
raider carl icahn who is holding an 11 percent stake in usx 
fleischer and analyst frank bracken of fidelity investments of 
boston said they valued the reserves at around 15 billion a sale 
is anticipated by years end said usx spokesman william e keslar 
who declined to say how usx values the reserves 
the pittsburghbased oil and steel giant said it has retained 
the investment banking firm first boston corp to handle the sale 
the reserves are principally located in texas oklahoma arkansas 
louisiana colorado and kansas 
after racking up impressive operating income of 547 million and 
377 million in 1984 and 1985 respectively texas oil amp gas 
reported an operating loss of 21 million the year usx acquired it 
then broke about even with 2 million the next year and lost 31 
million last year 
i estimate that txos producing properties are losing 30 to 
40 million per year on an operating basis said fleischer 
the sale besides boosting texas oil amp gass earnings will help 
with usxs goal of reducing debt and may lead to the repurchase of 
stock or raise the dividend he said 
usx had been pinning its hopes for a turnaround at texas oil amp 
gas on the prospect that natural gas prices will surge 
texas oil amp gas has 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 
reserve about a quarter of the 35 trillion cubic feet held by the 
other usx subsidiary marathon oil co texas oil amp gas has 28 
million barrels of oil or 3 percent of marathons 766 million 
the sale would not affect gas gathering the bulk of texas oil amp 
gass business or contract drilling usx said 
gas gathering accounted for 538 million of texas oil amp gass 
937 million in total sales last year drilling and other activites 
had sales totaling 41 million 
the remainder or 358 million came from petroleum sales

nissan motor corp car sales should drop 
in 1990 although it expects its truck sales to increase led by its 
new fourdoor pathfinder sportutility vehicle a nissan executive 
said monday 
overall sales throughout the industry in 1990 will drop to 
about 14 million cars and trucks from nearly 15 million in 1989 
said bob thomas general manager of the nissan division of nissan 
motor corp in usa the japanese companys us marketing arm 
thomas said nissans share of that market should be about 
660000 vehicles in each year nissans car sales in 1990 should 
drop by about 08 percent but truck sales should rise by 25 
percent 
thomas estimated the fourdoor pathfinder would make up 90 
percent of the vehicles us sales of about 31000 vehicles about 
24000 twodoor pathfinders were sold in the united states during 
the 1989 model year but thomas said that number would drop 
drastically because of price increases needed to recover tariff 
costs effective on the 1990 models 
the treasury department under rules announced earlier this 
year classified the fourdoor version of the imported pathfinder 
as a car making it subject to a 25 percent tariff 
nissan officials had worried that the fourdoor pathfinder would 
be classified as a truck making it subject to a 25 percent import 
duty 
nissan now makes pickup trucks and sentra automobiles at its 
smyrna tenn plant thomas projected that sentra sales will fall 
to about 180000 cars in the 1990 model year down 211 percent 
from the 228000 the company expects to sell in the 1989 model 
year sales of us built pickup trucks should increase slightly 
he said 
when asked if a larger car would be made at the smyrna plant 
thomas said only that it would be two to three model years away 
however he later said a redesigned stanza would be offered at 
about the same time and with design work done in california at 
that time it could be an allamerican vehicle 
he predicted the newly redesigned 1990 stanza would more than 
double us sales for the nameplate during the 1990 model year he 
also forecast that sales of the 300zx sports car would rise in 
1990 with sales of other cars flat or lower

striking eastern airlines pilots and machinists 
unions said monday they filed a civil racketeering lawsuit against 
texas air corp company chairman frank lorenzo and two subsidiary 
airlines 
the lawsuit seeks relief for damages to employees and 
shareholders from a pattern of fraudulent empirebuilding 
misrepresentation extortion assetstripping and criminal activity 
against eastern airlines unions the air line pilots association 
said 
a spokesman for the clerks office at the federal court in miami 
was unable to confirm receipt of the documents on monday afternoon 
but alpa attorney michael harwood confirmed that he had filed the 
papers 
the action a counterclaim to an earlier lawsuit filed by 
eastern charges violations of the federal racketeer influenced and 
corrupt organizations act by the company 
alpa spokesman ron cole said many of the allegations have been 
made to the bankruptcy court in new york but the racketeering 
complaint was filed because the progress of the bankruptcy case has 
been slow 
eastern spokesman robin robin mattell said the lawsuit was 
without merit 
in a separate action monday a federal bankruptcy judge in new 
york granted an injunction to eastern blocking another union 
lawsuit from being tried in the miami district court that suit 
filed by alpa alone on sept 1 challenges easterns recent 
practice of leasing dc9 jets and flight crews from sister carrier 
continental airlines 
in a hearing before us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland 
alpa attorney bruce simon contended that eastern violated its 
collective bargaining agreement with the pilots union by leasing 
the planes and crews from houstonbased continental bruce 
zirinsky a lawyer for eastern insisted that the leasing 
arrangement didnt violate any labor agreements and was vital to 
easterns rebuilding effort 
lifland agreed saying that the loss of the leasing arrangement 
now involving 16 jets and crews could cause irreparable 
harm to eastern 
in the corruption countersuit the unions alleged a pattern of 
racketeering activity in violation of the securities laws mail and 
wire fraud statutes and other federal laws in addition to texas 
air lorenzo and eastern the lawsuit names subsidiary continental 
and lorenzos jet capital corp 
the lawsuit seeks multimilliondollar damages and relief to be 
determined by the court the civil rico statute allows juries to 
award triple damages 
because eastern is in bankruptcy proceedings in new york the 
unions said they will ask for a release from the bankruptcy court 
to press the claims against eastern 
texas air filed a civil rico lawsuit against alpa and the 
international association of machinists in may 1988 accusing 
eastern unions of trying to wreck the airline in order to force its 
sale at a loss 
easterns machinists pilots and flight attendants walked off 
the job last march 4 and eastern filed for bankruptcy protection 
from creditors five days later

the us economys manufacturing sector remained 
weak in september although orders for exports increased sharply in 
spite of a stronger dollar the nations corporate purchasing 
managers said monday 
the purchasing managers index a widely watched barometer of 
the economys direction rose to 46 percent from 452 percent in 
august and matched the rate for july 
a reading below 50 percent indicates the manufacturing sector of 
the economy is in decline while a reading above 50 percent 
indicates growth according to the national association of 
purchasing management 
survey responses indicated new export orders rose during the 
month while prices continued falling and production employment 
new orders and inventories all declined 
the mixed picture painted by the managers left economists 
divided in their opinions of where us manufacturing is headed in 
coming months 
this is a report that is filled with cross currents it 
doesnt have a black and white picture that the economy is doing 
great said allen sinai economist with boston co and economic 
advisers inc 
the monthly report is based on a survey of purchasing executives 
in more than 250 industrial companies the index is a composite of 
five separate indicators including new orders production vendor 
deliveries inventories and employment 
the september overall index represented only a slight upturn 
from the august reading which had been the lowest for the index 
since december 1982 although the overall index averaged 495 
percent for the first three quarters of 1989 
past experience indicates that if this average were to 
continue for the final quarter it would be consistent with real 
gnp growth of about 17 percent for all of 1989 said robert j 
bretz survey chairman 
but bretz also said the index would have to fall below 44 
percent to show economic contraction for the year 
a sharp increase in export orders came despite the strength in 
the us dollar during september some 605 percent of those 
surveyed reported their volume of new export orders rose during the 
month compared with 56 percent in august it was the highest level 
since april when the new export order index was 62 percent 
the seasonally adjusted indexes for the five separate indicators 
represent the net change between those reporting positive negative 
and similar responses from the previous month 
the report also indicated inflation eased for the fourth 
consecutive month in september with the index remaining at 431 
percent ten percent of those surveyed reported higher prices 
compared with 13 percent in august and 25 percent reported lower 
prices compared with 30 percent in august 
the production index rose to 485 percent from 465 percent in 
august while the employment index rose to 459 percent from 447 
percent 
the index for new orders moved up to 454 percent from 451 
percent in the previous month and the inventories index rose to 
451 percent from 433 percent in august 
manufacturing related to exports particularly capital goods 
and capital goods spending and equipment were strong while the 
automobile sector and related areas remained soft sinai said 
the report is reflecting this mixture of pluses and minuses 
james solloway economist at argus research corp said that 
given the likely decline in car sales and corporate profitability 
as well as other sectors the report would seem to point to a 
deepening weakness into october and probably into the end of the 
year 
a slowdown in home construction would affect demand for lumber 
and other buildingrelated materials and equipment solloway said 
i still wouldnt rule out recession starting toward the end of 
the year solloway said its a minority view but one that can 
still be argued 
some economists said the data showed a more positive outlook 
the manufacturing sector seems to be coming back a little 
said sinai it is consistent with continuing strong growth in 
exports and equipment spending

cocoa futures prices plunged to a 16year low monday on new 
yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange on indications that more 
cocoa from the ivory coast may be headed for an already 
overburdened world market 
on other commodity markets monday cotton futures rallied 
strongly grains and soybeans were sharply higher most energy 
futures fell livestock and meat futures were mixed and precious 
metals were mixed 
cocoa settled 25 to 34 lower with the contract for delivery in 
december at 1008 per metric ton the december contract traded as 
low as 995 during the session marking cocoas first dip below 
1000 since 1973 the close was also the lowest since 1973 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds 
analysts attributed much of the markets weakness to 
confirmation that the ivory coast the worlds largest cocoa 
producer had slashed by 50 percent the support price it pays to 
cocoa farmers 
arthur stevenson an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc said the pricesupport cut had been urged by international 
lending agencies and could signal a more aggressive selling posture 
on the part of the ivory coast 
meanwhile rumors resurfaced that a 500000ton ivorian cocoa 
deal involving two trade houses had collapsed 
it just means there is that much more cocoa to be sold 
stevenson said 
cotton futures soared on new yorks cotton exchange largely 
reflecting bullish chart signals further buying was linked to 
speculation that indias cotton crop may be smaller than forecast 
and to positionevening by traders in a market that has fluctuated 
wildly in recent weeks 
a lot of people have been whipsawed by this market said 
analyst judy ganes of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
corn futures prices soared on the chicago board of trade amid 
rumblings of a major soviet purchase of us corn and the other 
grain and soybean markets went along for the ride 
rumors that the soviet union had bought as much as 3 million 
metric tons of corn over the weekend sent futures prices for corn 
up the permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel shortly after the 
opening 
the other markets rose in sympathy with corn but prices 
retreated from their highs across the board in afternooon 
profittaking 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 4 cents higher with december

december at 241 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 4 cents higher 
with december at 146 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 9 cents 
higher with november at 577 a bushel 
energy futures finished mostly lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange led by a drop in nearterm heating oil contracts that was 
viewed as a technical correction following five days of steady 
gains

lower with november at 2001 a barrel heating oil was 30 cent to 
45 cent lower with november at 5958 cents a gallon unleaded

grade of us crude oil slipped 12 cents to close at 2001 per 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange the contract

amr corp announced another airplane purchase 
monday a deal for six airbus industries jets and options for six 
more giving the parent of american airlines firm orders for 248 
jets with options for 302 more as it continues to expand what is 
already the largest fleet in the noncommunist world 
neither company would reveal the cost of the deal but previous 
estimates have placed it above 850 million 
the deal means that in the last 31 months the fort worthbased 
company has placed firm orders and options for more than 22 
billion worth of planes for american which last year became the 
nations largest carrier in addition its amr eagle commuter 
airline has placed orders and options for another 250 jets valued 
at about 145 billion 
meanwhile amr continued to be one of the most actively traded 
issues on the new york stock exchange monday as 16 million shares 
changed hands and the price declined 112 a share to close at 
85 the activity has been attributed to speculation involving a 
possible takeover of the airline 
amr said it would use the six widebody a300600rs ordered monday 
to expand its caribbean service and return to domestic service 
some of the dc10s now flying those routes 
five of the jets valued at about 71 million each will be 
delivered in 1991 with one the following year amr also has 
options for six more of the jets to be delivered in 1992 and 1993 
the jets are powered by two general electric cf680c2 engines 
the planes which meet the strictest noise requirements are 
designed to carry about 267 passengers said david venz spokesman 
for the french manufacturer 
the point is that we are a growing and expanding airline 
company with a great need for airplanes amr spokesman al becker 
said we are always looking for aircraft 
most of the planes purchased during the buying binge have been 
intended for expansion and not replacement of older aircraft 
becker said 
americans fleet already numbers 485 and becker said the 
carrier plans to have 575 planes by 1994 that does not count the 
options the airline holds for an additional 302 jets 
admittedly its blue sky becker said but american is in 
position to have a 900plane fleet by the end of the next decade 
with mondays order american now has firm orders for 85 md80s 
and eight md11s from mcdonnell douglas corp 70 757200s and 10 
767399ers from boeing co and 75 fokker 100s from the dutch 
manufacture 
the airline also has options on 100 md80 and 42 md11s 85 
options split between the two boeing aircraft and 75 options on the

motorola inc announced monday a plan to 
reduce its 105000employee workforce by some 2500 people through 
a program emphasizing what the electronics company called 
enhanced voluntary severance 
this is aimed primarily at salaried employees said motorola 
spokesman chuck sengstock weve improved our normal voluntary 
severance package those applying who are accepted will now receive 
two weeks severance pay for each year of service 
the program which is restricted primarily to motorolas us 
operations goes into effect immediately sengstock said he said 
most of those being urged to take the severance package work in the 
companys communications and semiconductor products groups 
if we do not have enough people volunteering for severance 
some involuntary severances may occur but we wont know about that 
for at least six weeks said sengstock were hoping we can 
meet our goals through voluntary severance normal attrition and 
internal business transfers 
the company said a pretax provision of approximately 43 million 
to cover the cost of the severance would be reflected in 
thirdquarter earnings to be announced next week 
we retain our confidence in the companys growth prospects 
said company president george fisher this program simply 
reflects what we at motorola consider to be good and prudent 
management and provides a means for us to reduce our cost base 
through a voluntary process which is in the best interest of our 
employees

bank of boston corp expressing concern about the 
economy announced monday it was diverting 370 million from its 
earnings to increase its reserve for possible loan losses 
ira stepanian chairman and chief executive officer said based 
on current estimates bank of boston will have a thirdquarter loss 
of approximately 125 million after placing the money in its 
reserve for credit losses 
but he said bank of boston should end the first nine months of 
1989 with a profit 
its a good deal of money said bank spokesman wayne taylor 
its certainly a big hit for us 
in a separate matter stepanian said the bank has taken steps to 
strengthen its internal controls real estate lending and review of 
credit risk as suggested by federal regulators after a review by 
the office of the comptroller of the currency 
the issues raised by the regulators are ones we take very 
seriously stepanian said in a prepared statement 
on the new reserve stepanian said the bank was taking a 
leadership position similar to 1987 when it shifted money to cover 
loans to third world countries 
among the reasons he cited for mondays action were continued 
weakness in the real estate industry and further signs of 
softness in general economic conditions the bank already had 100 
percent reserves against its nontraderelated lending to third 
world countries 
also taylor said one of the banks business customers assumed 
a large amount of debt for a transaction and now the bank is 
concerned that the company might have trouble paying off the loan 
he declined to name the company or the amount of the loan 
by shifting money into the reserve account it doesnt just 
forgive the debt taylor said 
were taking it off the books so it doesnt just hang there 
he said adding that the bank would still try to recover the money 
the additional reserve combined with 70 million in chargeoffs 
for bad loans in the quarter brings the total reserve to about 
945 million or 35 percent of total loans and leases 
stepanian said the bank expects to enter an agreement with the 
federal agency in which the board of directors will review steps to 
improve its performance in those areas cited in the governmental 
review

the man picked to head the securities and 
exchange commission believes he can fight to keep the nations 
stock markets honest but that its up to the industry to woo back 
small investors 
richard c breeden replying at length monday to a series of 
written questions from the senators who will vote on his 
appointment said restoring investor confidence in the wake of the 
1987 crash and the insider trading scandals is a job for the 
securities industry itself 
many americans may also have a perception that selfinterest 
and corruption among securities industry participants are 
widespread said breeden in the 109page questionandanswer 
sheet 
the commission can help correct this perception through 
vigorous enforcement but much of this change must be accomplished 
by the industry itself through renewed attention to retail 
customers and dedication to ethical business practices 
breeden also said that the head of the sec does not have the 
authority on his own to halt trading in the midst of a disaster 
such as the 1987 crash and even if he did i would not consider 
such a step 
breeden said that theres too much uncertainty about when the 
markets would close and for how long 
in a crisis this uncertainty and the related rumors 
concerning its likelihood could have seriously adverse 
consequences 
breeden 37 a key white house aide was nominated by president 
bush in august to succeed sec chairman david s ruder who returned 
to teaching law last week 
the senate has yet to confirm breeden the assistant to the 
president for issue analysis and the chief white house liaison on 
the recent savings and loan bailout bill 
breeden received a warm reception last month at his confirmation 
hearing before the senate banking housing and urban affairs 
committee a committee vote is expected later this month 
in the meantime sec member edward h fleischman has been tapped 
as acting sec chairman until the breeden nomination is decided 
breeden said in the written response that he believes vigorous 
enforcement of existing rules against insider trading and other 
illegal activities is one of the most effective means to increase 
individual investor confidence and participation 
he added that his experience with the sampl restructuring has 
largely confirmed my prior views rather than changing them about 
strict enforcement of safety and soundness standards 
on other topics breeden said he 
believed securities laws would benefit from modernization 
because current law often excessively restricts competition 
doesnt think the rival commodity futures trading commission 
should have exclusive control over all hybrid financial 
products that have some characteristics of securities and futures 
contracts because it could stifle innovation 
favors breaking down the glasssteagall acts barrier between 
commerical banking and the securities industry but only if the 
entire regulatory structure that would replace it was adequate 
to protect the integrity of the securities markets

honeywell inc has sold to nec corp of japan 
its 50 percent ownership in hnsx supercomputers inc the 
massachusetts company that markets nec supercomputers in the united 
states and canada 
terms of the agreement were not disclosed monday 
hnsx based in burlington mass had been jointly owned by 
honeywell and nec since its inception in 1986 honeywell said the 
venture is no longer within its strategic focus 
the minneapolisbased controls maker and defense contractor lost 
435 million in fiscal 1988 and announced a sweeping restructuring 
in july earlier honeywell had sold its other computer operations 
the hnsx deal puts nec in complete control of its attack in the 
us against minneapolisbased cray research 
cray is the worlds largest supercomputer maker but nec threw 
americas longterm dominance of the industry into question in 
april when it announced it will introduce the worlds fastest 
supercomputer next year 
supercomputers are considered crucial to national security 
because they are heavily used for designing nuclear weapons they 
also are used for such tasks as scientific research oil 
exploration and weather forecasting 
the us government has strongly discouraged federal agenies and 
universities that receive government grants from buying 
japanesemade supercomputers

cray research inc one of the 
worlds largest supercomputer manufacturers announced monday it is 
laying off 400 employees at two wisconsin plants 
the layoffs are due to a failure to meet sales projections and 
the fact that fewer employees are needed to manufacture todays 
supercomputer systems the minneapolisbased company said cray 
said it has essentially completed the transition from the cray xmp 
system to the more advanced cray ymp product line 
cray has about 5400 employees worldwide 
we never have had a major layoff in our 17year history 
largely because growth in market demand has more than made up for 
efficiencies realized in the manufacturing process john 
rollwagen cray chairman and chief executive officer said in a 
statement 
today however our rate of growth has slowed and the 
technical advances move as fast if not faster than before he 
said 
the company said all costs associated with the manufacturing 
work force reduction would be incurred in 1989 and are expected to 
total about 3 million 
cray said it was eliminating 280 jobs at chippewa falls and 120 
at its rice lake plant 
the company offered full salary to the end of year for any 
employees who left voluntarily at the end of the month any layoffs 
will be based on seniority cray said 
workers who lose their jobs would also get 4000 in education 
grants the company said

lockheed corp said monday it would 
take a charge of about 165 million against its thirdquarter 
profits because of overruns on fixedprice contracts 
the writeoffs will result in an aftertax loss of about 35 
million for the three months ended sept 31 daniel n tellep 
lockheeds chairman and chief executive said in a statement 
the charges stem mainly from a subcontract for wing parts on the 
c17 transport that mcdonnell douglas corp is building for the air 
force and a contract to modify 12 ep3e patrol planes for the navy 
also included in the charge are overruns on some smaller 
fixedprice development contracts and certain other programs 
lockheed said 
lockheeds initial cost figure was 13 billion for the c17 
wing work and 598 million for the ep3e modifications 
lockheed spokesman bob slayman said the company is continuing 
efforts to persuade the government that lockheed should be paid 
more because hundreds of changes were made in design specifications 
after the contracts were made 
the assumption was these were build to blue print he 
said but then there were many changes made in those prints 
despite the expected thirdquarter loss slayman said lockheed 
expected the year to be profitable as a whole

per share compared with 120 million or 75 cents a share for the

totaled 327 million or 310 per share compared with earnings of 
25 million or 11 cents a share for the first nine months of
