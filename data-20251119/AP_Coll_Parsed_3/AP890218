a state legislative election today between a 
former ku klux klan leader and a republican backed by former 
president reagan and president bush has focused international 
attention on a new orleans suburb 
poll commissioners reported a good turnout early today and a 
registrar predicted a record number of voters would cast their 
ballots in the race between former ku klux klan grand wizard david 
duke and his opponent john treen 
for nearly a month duke 38 and treen 63 have campaigned to 
represent the legislative district in metairie a nearly allwhite 
suburb with about 21000 voters 
the most recent polls conducted last week indicated the men 
were neck and neck an unusually large number of voters would not 
reveal their candidate of choice pollster joe walker said 
ive never seen anything like this in my life im 70 years 
old said jefferson parish registrar sam altobello we should 
have a hell of a turnout 
voter registration ended more than three weeks ago but altobello 
said even people outside the district have called to ask if they can 
register 
they all want to vote for one man altobello said one lady 
called yesterday and said if i cant vote for him im going to 
pray for him i know whos going to win but im not going to say 
altobello said a record 80 percent of voters could end up at the 
polls the 1988 presidential race drew 77 percent polls open at 6 
am and close at 8 pm 
of the 21457 people eligible to vote 52 are black 76 are 
registered as other and the rest more than 99 percent are 
white he said 
duke led a field of seven candidates with 33 percent of the vote 
in the jan 21 primary treen had 19 percent 
both men are running as republicans which drew the republican 
national committee into the campaign because it feared a duke 
victory would harm the gops image 
in an unprecedented move for a local race president bush and 
former president reagan endorsed treen earlier this week while 
neither mentioned duke 
the race also attracted international attention with reporters 
from british dutch french west german and other foreign 
newspapers covering the election 
dukes candidacy seems to confirm everyones perception about 
the south were going to look into it to see if thats true said 
john cassidy chief american correspondent for the sunday times of 
london 
under louisianas open primary system the top two votegetters 
in a primary regardless of party face each other in the runoff 
the seat opened when metairies representative was elected to a 
judgeship 
duke who ran as a democrat in the 1988 presidential primary 
switched his registration a few days before qualifying for the house 
race treen is a longtime republican whose brother dave served 
from 1980 to 1984 as louisiana governor 
duke left the klan in 1980 when another kkk leader accused him 
of selling secret membership rolls he then started the national 
association for the advancement of white people which duke says 
works for civil rights for everyone 
on friday duke spent the final hours before the election 
defending himself against accusations that he is still an associate 
of rightwing extremists 
hes spreading nazi venom across the united states treen 
said 
not only am i not a nazi but i condemn any sort of 
totalitarianism duke said i repudiate anybody or any group 
that advocates racial hatred or violence against anyone 
former american nazi leader ralph p forbes was hired to manage 
dukes populist party presidential campaign in 1988 and was paid at 
least 22000 for his work according to campaign finance reports 
quoted in fridays editions of the timespicayune newspaper 
the ralph forbes factor in this election is only the tip of the 
iceberg said treen

britain recommended today that all airlines using 
its airports examine passengers electrical and electronic 
equipment following the announcement that a bomb hidden in a 
radiocassette player destroyed pan am flight 103 
british airways the countrys largest airline immediately 
started checking radios portable computers cassette players and 
other equipment being checked in said an airline spokesman who by 
custom is not identified by name 
the department of transport said it sent a directive outlining 
the suggestion to all airlines operating in britain on friday a day 
after investigators said they believe the cassetteplayer bomb was 
in hold baggage 
passengers at british airways counters today were asked to take 
all electrical and electronic equipment out of their suitcases for a 
separate security check the airline spokesman said 
afterward passengers were asked to carry them aboard the plane 
as hand baggage he said 
a department of transport spokesman said the directive did not 
recommend how the items should be carried on the plane once they 
were cleared 
he said the directive was aimed mainly at batteryoperated 
transistor radios laptop computers and cassette recorders where 
explosives could be hidden rather than smaller items such as hair 
dryers but the final decision on what should be checked would be 
left to the airline he said 
at this weeks meeting in montreal of the international civil 
aviation organizations governing council british transport 
secretary paul channon outlined an eightpoint program to increase 
airline security including checks on electrical equipment the 
spokesman said 
the aviation organization unanimously adopted a resolution 
calling for a worldwide tightening of security including possible 
restrictions on carrying electrical and electronic devices on planes 
the montreal meeting was requested by channon and us 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner to consider international 
responses to the dec 21 bombing of pan am flight 103 all 259 
people aboard the new yorkbound boeing 747 were killed along with 
11 people in the scottish town of lockerbie where much of the 
wreckage fell 
while the council was meeting the detective heading the 
international investigation into the pan am crash detective chief 
superintendent john orr told a news conference thursday that the 
bomb had been planted in a radiocassette player checked as baggage 
antiterrorist experts have said the explosive most likely used 
was semtex an odorless highly malleable substance made in 
czechoslovakia 
orr said there was insufficient evidence to pinpoint the identity 
of the person or group responsible for planting the bomb

trade negotiators from the united states and 
europe expressed optimism today that they would be able to reach a 
compromise agreement to cool a sevenweek trade war that has erupted 
over the issue of us beef which contains growth hormones 
the bush administration is anxious to defuse the conflict before 
it aggravates other political strains between america and the 
12nation european community european officials have expressed a 
desire as well to settle the dispute which has resulted in a total 
ban on shipments of us beef to europe 
frans andriessen the top trade negotiator for the european 
community told reporters today that he hoped a compromise solution 
could be reached 
it is always fluid as long as it is not frozen andriessen 
said in explaining both sides negotiating positions before the 
talks resumed today 
the discussions had begun with a working dinner last night hosted 
by ambassador roy denman the european communitys representative to 
the united states 
new us trade representative carla hills and agriculture 
secretary clayton yeutter who had served as americas top trade 
negotiator during the reagan administration were leading the us 
negotiating team 
also taking part in the discussions today was ray macsharry 
formerly irelands finance minister and now the european communitys 
commissioner in charge of agriculture 
american beef has been banned in europe since jan 1 because of a 
prohibition which took effect then against hormonetreated meat 
the reagan administration retaliated immediately with trade 
sanctions imposed on 100 million worth of european food products 
ranging from canned tomatoes to instant coffee and boneless beef 
the 100 percent us tariffs totaling 100 million roughly 
equaled the estimated sales of american meat products that were lost 
under the european ban 
officials are seeking to defuse the dispute before new 
counterretaliation measures are taken by the europeans who have 
threatened to approve on monday 100 percent duties against 100 
million of american exports of walnuts and dried fruit 
bush referring to the dispute in his first address to congress 
said last week that the major industrial countries needed to rise 
above fighting about beef hormones to building a better future to 
move from protectionism to progress 
the us position has been that the hormones which are fed to 
cattle to increase their bulk do not pose any health threats but 
apparently the new administration is willing to reach an accord with 
the europeans so that the dispute does not escalate into a bigger 
battle with one of americas biggest trading partners 
the united states is pushing for establishment of a scientific 
panel under international trade rules in the hopes of showing that 
hormonetreated american meat is safe 
in return us officials may go along with a certification 
program that would allow hormonefree american beef to be sold in 
europe such a proposal has been advanced by texas agriculture 
commissioner jim hightower 
the texas plan would involve isolating untreated cattle from 
birth through slaughter giving them tests for artificial hormones 
and establishing enforcement procedures texas officials say that 
similar programs meeting european standards have been proposed by 
brazil and new zealand

author salman rushdie facing calls for his death 
and a multimilliondollar bounty for the killer today apologized to 
moslems for the distress caused by the publication of his novel 
the satanic verses 
however the official iranian news agency said the author had 
failed to repent or order that his book be withdrawn a moslem 
leader in britain welcomed the apology but said the campaign against 
the book would continue 
in a statement issued by his agent rushdie said i profoundly 
regret the distress that publication has occasioned to sincere 
followers of islam 
living as we do in a world of many faiths this experience has 
served to remind us that we must all be conscious of the 
sensibilities of others 
the brief statement was also issued to irans islamic republic 
news agency and a story was sent to iran a spokesman for the 
agency said 
rushdie apologized after his book was banned in six countries and 
removed from the shelves of major bookstores in the united states 
the authors statement came a day after irans president ali 
khamenei said the indianborn briton could save his life with an 
apology 
irans news agency noted the apology but said rushdies statement 
made no indication of his repentence or that his slanderous book 
would be withdrawn 
irna monitored in london said rushdie who was raised in a 
moslem family has been under growing pressure to make a public 
repentence that his statement is seen falling well short of 
two prominent moslems condemned the iranian campaign against the 
author which began tuesday when iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini said the satanic verses blasphemed islam and demanded 
zealous moslems kill rushdie two iranian religious leaders later 
offered a 52 million bounty for rushdie 
the times of london today reported that a power struggle may have 
prompted khomeinis execution order which sent rushdie 41 and his 
american wife into hiding under the guard of scotland yard 
detectives 
the british foreign office said on friday that considerable 
confusion persists within the iranian government and that britain 
intended to proceed with that fact in mind it did not elaborate 
moslems condemned the satanic verses when it was published 
late last year to critical acclaim in the west 
another round of protests began sunday with demonstrations in 
pakistan where six people died the protests spread and another 
person was killed and 75 people injured in a series of 
demonstrations in india 
after khomeini also ordered the death of publishers of the novel 
book companies in france west germany greece and turkey decided 
not to publish it others in finland norway and italy were unswayed 
major us booksellers such as b dalton and barnes amp nobel 
removed the novel from their shelves and canada halted imports the 
book has been officially banned in iran india pakistan 
bangladesh egypt and south africa 
the governments of west germany spain britain and the united 
states condemned the iranian compaign the united states called it 
appalling 
the times of london quoted a closely involved source as 
saying khomeinis son ahmad and three hardline ministers may have 
persuaded the 88yearold spiritual leader to make the death call to 
undermine a political rival seeking improved relations with britain 
the report said supporters of irans parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani believe khomeinis son and the government ministers 
hoped the death call would deal a blow to british relations and 
rafsanjani 
some diplomats in the middle east have speculated the rushdie 
issue was promoted by factions in iran opposed to recent moves by 
more pragmatic figures including rafsanjani to improve relations 
with the west 
but akhoond zadeh basti irans charge daffaires in london told 
independent television news in britian on friday that khomeinis 
call was based purely on religious grounds 
in egypt 1988 nobel prize laureate naguib mahfouz today said 
khomeinis call can undoubtedly be considered terrorism the 
76yearold novelist said in an interview that the decision is 
against humanity because it is against thought and against human 
rights it is also against islam because it harms the reputation of 
islam and moslems in the civilized world 
the head of the shiite moslem community in europe on friday urged 
book companies not to publish the novel but he denounced khomeinis 
death call 
the moslem world is shaken shocked by this work which throws 
doubt on the authenticity of our holy book which treats the wives 
of the prophet as prostitutes ayatollah mehdi rhouani said from 
his paris home in an interview with the associated press but he 
said khomeinis decree was contrary to islamic law contrary to 
international law contrary to morals 
rushdies publishers showed the apology to britains foreign 
office shortly before it was made public 
a foreign office spokesman who by custom was not identified 
said the statement is of course a matter for mr rushdie and 
not for the government but if it serves to calm passions then that 
can only be a good thing 
members of britains moslem community welcomed rushdies 
statement but leaders of the islamic community in bradford where 
some copies of the book were burned in public said their campaign 
against it would continue 
i think the apology will calm down the situation but it will 
not change the situation overall until the book is withdrawn from 
circulation said liaqat hussain general secretary of the 
bradford council of mosques 
viking the books publishers in britain and the united states 
said earlier this week that it and the author very much regret the 
distress the book has caused but viking did not apologize for 
publishing the book 
before todays statement rushdie had said the novel was 
fictional and not blasphemous 
moslems say the satanic verses blasphemes their religion by 
among other things portraying the prophet mohammeds wives as 
prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the koran the holy book of 
islam rather than receiving it from god

an arab assailant shouting allahu akhbar god is great plunged 
a kitchen knife into the back of a 16yearold jewish seminary 
student the victim chanoch albeck suffered a punctured lung but

the uprising against israeli occupation of the territories they 
seized from arab neighbors in the 1967 middle east war more than 
380 palestinians have died

dared enter the old city and other areas of israeliannexed arab 
east jerusalem

fishermen rescued fumio niwa from rough waters 
tonight maritime officials said almost 12 hours after the 
adventurer abandoned his attempt to become the first person to cross 
the pacific alone in a balloon 
the 38yearold balloonist was in good condition after suffering 
a severe bout of seasickness said his spokesman toshiaki oguri 
niwa was picked up in generally the same area where he came down 
this morning 400 miles off the coast of minami torishima an island 
1550 miles southeast of tokyo said oguri and the maritime defense 
force 
after his heliumfilled balloon landed in the water at 1116 
am niwa immediately separated his gondola from the balloons 
tentacles and bobbed around in the pacific ocean awaiting rescue 
oguri said he communicated with niwa by radio on the 59ton no 1 
yasueimaru he said he did not know the destination of the fishing 
boat which also is lugging the gondola which is six foot in 
diameter 
this afternoon niwa suffered severe sickness from the rough sea 
but recovered by the time he was rescued said kenji fukawa another 
spokesman 
niwa at one point opened a window at the top of his globeshaped 
capsule to get fresh air to combat the seasickness he also shone a 
beam out into the open sea with a flashlight after dark to help 
rescuers locate him fukawa said 
the fishing boat was guided to the site by one of two p3c patrol 
planes deployed by the self defense force the other one flew over 
niwas gondola to monitor his position 
attempts to rescue niwa in a seaplane failed the defense force 
this afternoon sent a us1 seaplane to the scene but it returned to 
base with engine problems a second us1 proved useless because it 
arrived after dark 
the fishing boat initially was delayed by strong winds of 30 mph 
which later diminished 
the balloonist took off wednesday from his hometown of yokohama 
near tokyo originally planning to reach san diego yokohamas 
sister city in about four days by hitching a ride on the 
highaltitude jet stream winds that generally blow west to east 
but since his departure the winds have blown north toward 
alaska forcing niwa to stay at a low altitude later he tried and 
failed to reach the jet stream said hiroaki tanaka another project 
spokesman 
niwa an experienced balloonist quit his job with a computer 
firm three months ago to prepare for the journey 
in 1981 four balloonists successfully crossed the pacific ocean 
by balloon for the first time no one has traveled the distance

authorities admitted saturday that some 
prisoners have been tortured to death but they said the number is 
lower than that alleged by amnesty international 
in a report published last month the londonbased human rights 
group accused turkish authorities of routinely torturing political 
detainees since martial law was imposed in 1980 following a military 
takeover 
amnesty international said it gave the government a list of 239 
men and women alleged to have died from torture and illtreatment 
while in custody 
a foreign ministry statement saturday said an investigation into 
146 of these cases had been completed and showed that torture was 
suspected in the deaths of 32 detainees or prisoners in the past 
eight years 
it said that trials in 14 of these cases had resulted in 
convictions of 57 people on charges of torture and illtreatment of 
prisoners four cases ended in acquittals and trials in the other 
cases are under way the statement said 
the ministry said 10 of the people cited as dead by the amnesty 
international were still alive and others had died of natural 
causes suicide effects of hunger strikes or in shootouts with 
security forces 
the ministry said all allegations concerning human rights 
violations in turkey were examined meticulously 
but since most of these allegations are based on insufficient 
or incorrect information it often takes a long time to reach 
healthy and satisfactory conclusions it said

country today nominated a moderate as president and a hardliner as 
prime minister for an interim government they hope will soon take 
power in their homeland 
mohammad nabi mohammadi was nominated as president and ahmad shah 
as prime minister according to a statement in english by council 
spokesman rab rasool sayyaf in earlier impromptu remarks to 
reporters he had said the two men had been approved for the 
positions however his written statement said their formal approval 
by the council was in fact expected sunday 
mohammadi who leads the moderate guerrilla faction known as 
harakatiinqilabiislami was earlier named president of the 
council itself 
his group was one of the largest guerrilla factions at the start 
of the civil war but it has since dwindled for lack of 
organization it has never received the amount of external support 
from the united states pakistan and other countries that the 
powerful hardline groups do 
shah a useducated engineer is a top political officer in the 
hardline ittehadiislami guerrilla group his group is the weakest 
of four fundamentalist pakistanibased guerrilla factions 
he was designated in early 1988 as prime minister of a guerrilla 
government that never became functional 
the nearly 400 council delegates cheered allahoakbar god 
is great when the nominations were announced indicating sundays 
vote will be a formality 
the consultative council or shura started its meetings in 
islamabad on feb 10 to form what its leaders say will be the future 
government of afghanistan 
the moslem guerrilla forces and many western diplomats say the 
marxist government of president najib based in kabul will soon 
fall now that soviet troops have withdrawn from afghanistan najib 
says his troops can hold on without the soviet soldiers 
the council spokesman said mohammadi will serve by virtue of 
being president as head of the presidium that ruling body will 
consist of a leader of each of the seven factions in the 
pakistanibased guerrilla alliance 
the president will be appointed for eight months the spokesman 
said at a news briefing today 
the prime minister and president will jointly present a list of 
proposed cabinet ministers to the council sunday the final day of 
the council session sayyaf said 
he added that an elected council will be formed within six 
months but he gave no details of those elections he said the new 
council will in turn name a president and ratify the interim cabinet 
the council had been bogged down over differences on 
powersharing between the seven groups in the pakistanibased 
resistance iranianbased guerrilla groups are boycotting the 
session demanding 100 seats in the council 
the guerrillas fought a nineyear war against the soviets and

i am rain man kim said in an interview this is an 
important time for me i have many talents now 
morrow who calls kim an island of genius believes the movie 
has changed kim 
when i first met him after he talked to me he dashed across 
the room and made low moaning sounds morrow said now he would 
walk into a room and offer you his hand 
kims father who asked for privacy reasons that his and kims 
last name not be used agrees that his son is changing after a 
special screening of rain man for the utah legislature kim 
stood up and stressed the importance of understanding the needs of 
the handicapped 
i had no idea he could talk to those guys that way fran 
said he is really learning to put his thoughts together 
after meeting father and son morrow decided he would pair a 
savant like kim trusting and sometimes childlike with a greedy 
selfcentered and impatient brother 
then i put them in a car and had them drive across the country 
together said morrow nominated for an oscar for his screenplay 
it chronicles the relationship between raymond babbit an autistic 
savant played by dustin hoffman and his brother charlie played by 
tom cruise 
i dont want to take away from the other people that helped 
dustin create the character morrow said by telephone from 
claremont calif but kim was the first inspiration for the 
story 
coincidentally fran and kim were rolling down the freeway when 
they heard the news last week that rain man had been nominated 
for eight academy awards including best picture and best actor 
kim has seen the movie three times the first seated at the 
premier between morrow and fran kim stared at his hands and the 
floor during most of the movie when morrow asked him why kim told 
him he had seen it with his heart 
while there are behavioral similarities between kim and hoffmans 
film character kim is far more outgoing two years ago he spent an 
afternoon with hoffman on a movie set the actor mimicking his 
movements and his walk 
when it was over kim recalls hoffman said i may be the star 
but you are the heavens 
daniel christensen medical director of the western institute of 
neuropsychiatry at the university of utah has made a thorough study 
of kim 
he has a photographic memory but no way to minimize stimuli 
christensen said hes the closest ive seen to a human 
computer unable to filter or forget information or assign it 
relative importance 
he can answer untold thousands of questions covering history 
sports maps literature mathematics and other subjects 
youd expect someone with these mental skills to have something 
extra in his brain but theres actually something missing 
christensen said brain scans show an absence of the bundle of nerve 
fibers the corpus callosum that connects the two halves of the 
brain 
kim is probably one in 10 million he said 
morrow offers another insight kim has been called a savant 
with some autistic characteristics but the real answer is that 
like all of us kim defies human labels 
the screenwriter said hoffman has received a flood of mail from 
people touched by the movie people who know other rain men morrow 
takes little credit for the response 
that was an accident he said the bigger story bigger 
than the movie is that people are coming out of their prisons and 
growing the awards will go away but the people like kim will not

in the wake of a steady stream of complaints 
and cries of discrimination from irate yacht owners and commercial 
fishermen the bush administration is slowly modifying ronald 
reagans zero tolerance antidrug policy 
the controversial program which emerged last spring in the midst 
of the nations antidrug furor called on the coast guard to seize 
vessels if any amount of drugs were found on board down to a single 
seed of marijuana 
the concept behind zero tolerance was to attack the user side of 
the drug problem and force boat owners to help in the antidrug 
effort 
but recreational boat owners and commercial fishermen said they 
were being discriminated against complaining that they could lose a 
multimillion dollar vessel because a guest or crew member was found 
with a small amount of drugs and that the drug violator would face 
only a minor criminal penalty 
last fall congress inserted into the sweeping antidrug bill 
orders requiring the executive branch to alter the policy on several 
fronts a move that was strongly opposed by the coast guard 
thentransportation secretary jim burnley and others in the reagan 
administration 
the bush administration which already missed congress deadline 
to install the new rules last week issued interim guidelines that 
prevents the coast guard from seizing commercial fishing vessels at 
sea for small amounts of drugs under the new policy the coast 
guard can issue a summons and have a forfeiture procedure when the 
fishing trip ends 
the new guidelines also require forfeiture procedures to be 
decided within 20 days 
but an innocent owner provision of the law which sparked the 
most controversy on capitol hill and intense opposition from the 
reagan administration is still being developed by the customs 
service attorneys and it may not turn out to be what congress had 
in mind when it wrote the law 
one of the key concepts behind the zero tolerance policy was not 
only to educate boat owners not to use drugs on board their 
vessels but to force them to take a series of steps such as 
written antidrug policies to help make sure no one else on board 
was using drugs 
we want to make people aware that no more can they afford to go 
out there and say to 12 friends very nonchalantly hey lets just 
get on the boat and go they have other responsibilities janet 
labuda said in an interview last year when she was head of the 
customs service program overseeing the zero tolerance policy 
were asking people not to turn a blind eye and to be a little bit 
more aggressive in trying to find things out 
under that policy labuda and others said an owner could forfeit 
the vessel even if he or she did not possess drugs or were unaware 
of drugs on board 
congressional critics led by rep gerry e studds dmass and 
house merchant marine and fisheries chairman walter b jones 
dnc pushed to eliminate that requirement 
in our view that is shifting the law enforcement onus onto 
private citizens turning the employer into pseudopolice said 
lee crockett an aide on the house merchant marine and fisheries 
subcommittee on coast guard and navigation 
the reagan administration and zero tolerance defenders on capitol 
hill argued that such an innocent owner provision would lead to 
a looktheotherway defense 
congress approved language that would prohibit vessel forfeitures 
if owners could prove they had no knowledge of drug use on board and 
that there was not willful blindness toward drug use 
while lawabiding citizens should not condone drug abuses 
enforcement of the drug laws is a governmental law enforcement 
responsibility which should not be shifted to private lawabiding 
citizens through this civil forfeiture procedure said rep bob 
davis of michigan ranking republican on the house merchant marine 
and fisheries committee 
but customs service officials who are drafting the proposed 
regulations said the administration may interpret the congressional 
changes to zero tolerance differently than jones studds and davis 
one customs service attorney said the new government regulations 
will propose a standard of reasonable expectations and that 
would include expectations that boat owners take some antidrug 
measures 
obviously this is going to be subject to interpretation in 
court cases the attorney said 
the regulations are not expected to be announced for at least 
several more weeks and then will be subject to a 30day public 
comment period

the government today declared a state 
of emergency in afghanistan three days after the soviets completed 
their troop withdrawal and left the afghan army to fight the moslem 
guerrillas 
the emergency which becomes effective at midnight was announced 
on staterun radio and television by president najib 
the foreign ministry said it was declared after unauthorized 
letters and pamphlets began circulating in kabul warning people to 
close their businesses and stay off the streets the ministry said 
the material was leading people to believe that guerrillas 
surrounding the city would soon launch a rocket attack 
the emergency allows the government to suspend or limit the 
constitutional rights providing for protection against the search 
and confiscation of property confidentiality of correspondence and 
telephone conversations peaceful assembly freedom of expression 
and freedom from cumpulsory labor 
najib said without elaborating that he acted after receiving 
reports from security forces of activities of certain elements 
trying to create disturbances the military increased the number 
of tanks and armored personnel carriers in kabul and stationed 
troops on the roofs of buildings 
at a news briefing before najibs announcement a foreign 
ministry spokesman mohammad nabi amani said the declaration was 
prompted by clandestine activities that were terrorizing the people 
of kabul 
he said the activities included the circulation of letters and 
unsigned phamplets that began appearing shortly before the 
completion of the soviet troop withdrawal on wednesday he said the 
material warned residents to stay off the streets close their 
businesses and stay away from the airport 
these created an air in which people were being terrified of a 
rocket attack on kabul amani said 
he also said the refusal of the united states and pakistan to 
halt the supply of arms to the gurrrillas made the state of 
emergency necessary 
today was the first time an emergency has been declared in 
afghanistan since 1978 when the government did so after the marxist 
government seized power in a military coup the emergency was lifted 
the following year 
some western officials believe the guerrillas now surrounding 
kabul and other major cities will soon topple najibs government 
but najib says his troops can hold on without the soviet soldiers 
in pakistan today afghan guerrilla groups nominated a president 
and prime minister for an interim government they hope will soon 
take power in their homeland the guerrillas consultative council 
nominated mohammad nabi mohammadi as president and ahmad shah as 
prime minister a council spokesman first said the men had been 
named to the positions but he later said they were only nominated 
and that they would be approved in a vote on sunday 
mohammadi a moderate who had led one of the resistance factions 
had earlier been named president of the council itself shah a 
useducated engineer is a moslem fundamentalist 
on friday a top kremlin diplomat said soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev has appealed personally to president bush to help bring 
peace to afghanistan now that the red army has withdrawn 
both the diplomat and a soviet general acknowleged at a news 
conference that the soviets are worried about continued bloodshed in 
afghanistan

about 5000 people including 
barmaids and soldiers marched to a rally outside a us air base 
saturday to try to drown out a concert sponsored by opponents of 
us military bases in the philippines 
authorities reported no violence but they said the usrun 
clark air base closed its main gate while the two groups held rival 
events within a few hundred yards of each other at a park nearby 
the antibase concert featured dance and vocal performances with 
no speeches city authorities earlier withdrew a permit they gave 
the group but they later reissued it under pressure from members of 
the senate 
many senators have criticized the presence of the bases on 
philippine territory and pressed president corazon aquino to demand 
they be removed 
groups for and against the bases have faced off here before 
last month several thousand residents of angeles city about 50 
miles north of manila prevented hundreds of base opponents from 
entering the city during a march from manila the protesters were 
demanding closure of clark subic bay naval base and four other 
smaller us facilities in the country 
saturdays march through the city and the rally near the base 
were organized by the citys chamber of commerce participants 
included local officials led by mayor antonio abad santos and at 
least a dozen government soldiers who marched in civilian clothes 
abad santos said clark should not be closed because most of the 
citys 200000 residents depend on it for their livelihood 
even our pickpockets will run out of business if the base is 
closed he said 
last year the us and philippine governments concluded an 
agreement allowing the united states to keep the bases until 1991 in 
exchange for 962 million in military and economic aid during the 
next two years 
mrs aquino has given no indication of her position on 
maintaining the bases beyond 1991

oliver norths irancontra trial scheduled to 
start tuesday nearly fell apart because of an order the judge in 
the case issued a month ago concerning classified material 
us district judge gerhard a gesell spelled out in that jan 19 
order the problems he saw arising in connection with classified 
secrets that north and his attorneys wanted to reveal in the 
courtroom 
north and his counsel have been unwilling to advise the 
government except occasionally in the most generalized terms why 
they believe that a particular document or portion of a document is 
relevant material and required in defending the case said gesell 
north a former national security council aide is facing 12 
felony charges ranging from lying to congress to shredding 
irancontra documents 
under the classified information procedures act the government 
and the defense are required to spell out what state secrets they 
expect to disclose intelligence agencies then decide whether to 
declassify the information for use in the courtroom 
gesells problem was this how can a judge determine ahead of the 
trial whether sensitive classified material should be introduced in 
norths defense without knowing how or whether it ties into the case 
the judge described his dilemma as legal gridlock and the 
solution he worked out caused concern in the intelligence community 
questions of whether the material was admissible would be 
resolved during trial rather than before the trial gesell ruled 
in addition the judge outlined eight broad categories of 
classified material which north would be permitted to introduce 
without prior order of the court they included information tending 
to show that norths intent and purpose was not to violate the law 
the national security agency and others in the intelligence 
community worked through the justice department in an attempt to 
build in more safeguards 
gesell felt sufficient controls were in place and was concerned 
that too many restrictions would jeopardize norths right to a fair 
trial he used the phrase cuckoo clock trial to characterize a 
possible scenario in which there would be frequent courtroom 
interruptions due to protests from the government over the use of 
classified material 
matters got worse feb 8 when the justice department acting on 
behalf of intelligence agencies sought a court order barring north 
from introducing classified material without a court order and as 
long as the government had an objection pending 
intelligence experts seated in court winced when gesell declared 
with regard to classified material i have authority once the 
trial starts to say this evidence comes in the judge subsequently 
refused to adopt the justice departments proposal 
the justice department was opposed by independent counsel 
lawrence walsh who asked for more moderate safeguards which gesell 
adopted 
it was an awkward moment in the case walsh was ready to go to 
trial and the justice department was now engaged in a courtroom duel 
with the the independent counsel 
the department asked for a delay on feb 9 the day a jury was 
chosen chief justice william rehnquist issued a stay a week ago 
it took the prosecutors in walshs office and the justice 
department four days to resolve their dispute under a proposed 
agreement the government outlined nine specific categories of 
classified information that should not be revealed at trial before 
walsh had an opportunity contest its relevance 
the areas included information identifying undercover cia 
officers and us covert activities other than paramilitary support 
to the contras 
gesell accepted that part of the proposal saying he had already 
approved such safeguards earlier but was willing to restate them 
but the judge rejected procedures outlined by a justice department 
deputy in which the attorney general would step in at any time 
during trial and file affidavits in effect barring disclosure of 
classified material deemed damaging to national security 
gesell said he didnt want attorney general dick thornburgh 
coming in with bits and pieces of affidavits and ordered him to 
stay out of the courtroom unless he was taking the more drastic step 
of filing a broader affidavit that would kill one or more of the 12 
criminal charges against north 
walsh responded that he would notify the attorney general in 
advance of planned disclosures in the nine categories a preliminary 
step which could lead to piecemeal affidavits being filed by 
thornburgh 
on friday gesell cautioned walsh not to unreasonably interfere 
with the orderly processes of the court a reference to the power 
of the government to interrupt the trial and challenge sensitive 
classified material that north might want to introduce in his 
defense what the judge is saying in effect is that toofrequent 
visits to the court by the justice department will jeopardize 
norths rights 
north strongly objected to walshs plan saying that it defies 
the courts order interjects the attorney general diretly into the 
trial process and guarantees the unfair cuckooclock proceeding 
that the court has insisted it wants to avoid

a bank would never risk a dime on rosie 
moore but a pilot federal program is loaning thousands of dollars 
to her and other welfare recipients who want to start their own 
businesses 
ive always worked for someone else id like to become my own 
boss says the mother of two 
shes getting her chance under a pilot selfemployment initiative 
program in which mississippi iowa michigan minnesota and new 
jersey are participating 
moore of canton says she worked for seven years in a banks 
collection department and a year for a private collection agency 
she wanted to open her own collection agency but is supported by 
the welfare departments aid to families with dependent children 
program and until now couldnt cant afford to start her own 
business 
the selfemployment initiative will give moore a chance to make 
her dream come true and other women in the two pilot projects in 
canton and meridian hope to turn skills learned at home into 
profitable commercial enterprises such as house cleaning child care 
and catering 
each participant will be allowed to borrow up to 5000 
the real key to the project is not the loan but the training 
said john jones director of the pilot project in meridian 
meridian junior college is providing business training and the 
canton project has contracted with bill cooley of systems 
consultants in jackson to provide six months of morning workshops 
covering everything from marketing to legal tax and insurance needs 
of small businesses 
cooley said he helps each participant draw up a detailed business 
plan before they present their loan application to the programs 
advisory board which includes local business owners as well as 
welfare and social service representatives 
under a special waiver participants will be allowed to retain 
their welfare benefits for one year before they must begin paying 
back their loan and living off their businesses explained glenda 
crump project director in canton 
aurelia jonessmith project coordinator for the governors 
office of federalstate programs said her office chose to use some 
of its federal dollars for the selfemployment initiative instead of 
other welfare programs because gov ray mabus wanted to provide 
another option 
but his state welfare commissioner thomas brittain has 
reservations 
my first concern is that its an awful lot of money for such a 
few welfare clients brittain said second private ventures 
even under the best of circumstances often fail and third there 
are probably things we could do to get these same people other 
jobs 
jonessmith says of skeptics are they suggesting that afdc 
recipients should work only for others and not for themselves that 
implies the only option that should be available to these people is 
to work for somebody else and i dont agree with that 
the governors office of federalstate programs has funneled 
about 70000 each into mississippis two pilot projects with 10 
participants in canton and 22 in meridian 
the 70000 is almost all federal funding and covers the 
projects operations for 18 months canton started its program in 
january and meridian began in december both programs also are 
seeking private donations to bolster their revolving loan funds 
crump said the levi strauss foundation has given the canton project 
a 49000 grant 
crump said about 40 madison county welfare recipients applied for 
the canton project 10 participants were selected 
we looked at their debt level because if theyre overextended 
we know that once they start their business a lot of their money 
will probably have to go back into some of those debts that they 
acquired she said we looked at their business idea to see 
how viable it is for this area and we also looked at their desire 
and commitment to becoming selfemployed 
progam workers say they expect the new business owners to be able 
to repay their loans but know most probably will never become 
wealthy 
were starting off with a projected gross income between 
12000 to 15000 annually crump said its not a lot but it 
would be enough to let them leave welfare and be selfsufficient

experts on global warming uncertain whether 
the greenhouse effect will produce more long hot summers are 
giving congress conflicting advice on whether immediate action is 
needed 
the disagreement to be aired before a house panel tuesday is 
unlikely to suggest a solution to legislators wondering what to do 
about gases that trap heat like the glass roof of a garden 
greenhouse 
the searing heat wave and severe drought that afflicted many 
areas last summer often was blamed on the theory that the earth is 
slowly warming because of such a phenomenon 
experts agree there is a greenhouse effect but also realize 
theyre gazing into a very dirty crystal ball according to a 
witness scheduled to testify tuesday before the house energy and 
commerce energy and power subcommittee 
the tough problem is how long we clean the glass before we act 
on what we think we see inside according to stephen h schneider 
of the national center for atmospheric research in boulder colo 
schneider has written that immediate environmental action must be 
taken as an insurance policy against the uncomfortable risks of 
future grim surprises 
but patrick j michaels a university of virginia professor of 
environmental sciences will caution the subcommittee against acting 
hastily on a clouded vision because lawmakers may take action 
theyll regret michaels has warned against public hysteria and 
the politics of fear 
suppose you pass a carbon use fee for gasoline he said in 
an interview that can have serious economic effects you better 
make sure you have the bases covered his reference was to a 
policy calculated to reduce the release into the atmosphere of 
carbon gases a major contributor to the greenhouse effect 
the greenhouse effect occurs when gases in the earths atmosphere 
trap radiant heat near the planets surface the more gases the 
more heat 
the gases are more transparent to incoming solar energy than they 
are to outgoing infrared energy mars a planet with a thin 
predominantly carbon dioxide atmosphere has a mean temperature that 
is below that of deep freezers venus with a thick largely carbon 
dioxide atmosphere is hotter than an oven 
the earths atmosphere on the other hand has been just right to 
support life 
greenhouse gases have built up due to burning of fossil fuels 
coal oil and natural gas and destruction of tropical rain forests 
the difficulty is in guessing how much greenhouse gases will 
increase in the future and what effect they will have on climate 
the experts say 
the answer michaels said in the interview is just very 
unclear right now 
michaels said there is evidence the earth is warming less than 
would be expected and some indication that much of the warming 
occurred at night a development that could trigger beneficial 
effects like a longer growing season 
if we base rational environmental policy on the greenhouse 
effect and it turns out over the next few years its not going to 
warm up as much as some people feared the basis of that policy 
will have lost its credibility he said you can wind up setting 
back the progress on these important environmental matters another 
decade or two 
michaels fears no one will heed such a cautionary view the first 
really hot day of summer when people start screaming you have to 
do something now 
the virginia professor said he supports taking actions that could 
alleviate greenhouse buildup if theyre done for other 
environmental reasons an example he said would be stopping the 
destruction of tropical rain forests 
schneider adopts a more forceful tiein strategy that would 
be designed partly to reduce greenhouse gases while simultaneously 
providing other benefits unrelated to climate 
this strategy envisions more efficient use of energy including 
strict opposition to weakening automobile gasoline mileage 
standards he said 
other ideas development of nonfossil fuel energy supplies 
including solar and a new generation of nuclear plants and helping 
developing countries deploy alternative technologies that can 
provide economic development with less pollution

and lenny and later served two years in prison for an investment 
scam was arrested thursday on grand larceny charges and ordered 
held without bail at an arraignment friday 
i believe she was preparing to flee assistant district 
attorney christopher prather said in arguing for the nobail 
provision and i believe she has access to an immense amount of 
stolen wealth 
manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau said mrs holzer

five central american presidents 
have signed a death warrant for the contra movement but still must 
find a way to carry it out 
at a summit here last week the leaders of costa rica el 
salvador guatemala nicaragua and honduras committed themselves to 
finding a way to disband the usbacked rebel force that has been 
fighting nicaraguas leftist sandinista government for seven years 
it wasnt that the presidents killed the contras they merely 
affixed a seal to a plain truth that the contras lost the war 
said a highranking diplomat from a nation that will provide troops 
for a united nations monitoring force 
at the same time president daniel ortega of nicaragua pledged to 
move his nation toward democracy 
although president bush was skeptical others said ortega has no 
alternative as he tries to reconstruct nicaraguas shattered economy 
the central american presidents promised to produce within 90 
days a detailed program for the demobilization and voluntary 
repatriation or relocation of the contras 
the rebel force consists of about 11000 fighters and 8000 to 
10000 family members the contras received strong support from the 
reagan administration but theyve been withdrawing from nicaragua 
to border camps in honduras since congress cut off military aid in 
february 1988 
many say they are determined to keep fighting even though it is 
extremely unlikely the united states will renew military aid 
a blueprint for disbanding the contra force was drafted earlier 
this month in meetings at the united nations in new york under the 
proposal spain canada and west germany would station troops along 
the hondurannicaraguan border 
were talking about small contingents mostly soldiers but 
unarmed said the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
one thing these countries dont need is more armies 
foreign ministry officials from the central american nations will 
work with un officials on a final plan to be approved by the 
presidents of their nations 
the plan might allow some contras to return to nicaragua or 
settle in honduras others might be relocated to third countries 
including the united states 
dissolution of the contras is irreversible the diplomat said 
he said honduras was fed up to the eyebrows with having an 
alien armed force on its soil moreover the contras lost their 
patron when reagan left office the diplomat said 
contra leaders did not agree on the rebels future in light of 
the central american accord 
if we cant win militarily we have to make use of new fields 
of action said one leader adolfo calero 
he said washington has a moral obligation to the contra movement 
and that it should provide relocation money and visas for rebels who 
want to settle in the united states it would cost between 150 
million and 250 million to dismantle the forces calero said 
the us whether it likes it or not is deeply involved in 
whats happening he said it has to monitor sandinista 
compliance and support the central american presidents 
wilfredo montalvan like calero a member of the contra 
directorate said the rebels will not lay down their arms until the 
sandinistas start carrying out democratic reforms he did not say 
how the contras could be effective without us aid 
enrique bermudez also said the contras may continue their fight 
he was unimpressed with ortegas pledge to free political 
prisoners hold early elections and allow opposition parties access 
to the media 
what ortega committed himself to was very little said 
bermudez considered the most hawkish contra 
he said nicaraguan authorities terrorize civilians and that 
neighborhood committees keep a big brotherlike watch over residents 
president bush also was leery 
claims like this have been made at one time only to see those 
claims repudiated he said lets be sure that we not leave the 
resistance standing alone leave them twisting down there without 
fulfillment of the methods of democracy on the part of the 
sandinistas 
because the central american nations reached agreement on the 
contra question the united states likely will have less flexibility 
in how it responds to political changes in nicaragua 
the diplomat whose country will participate in the un task 
force said ortegas pledge to bring democracy to his nation was not 
so much a concession as a recognition of nicaraguas state of 
affairs 
nicaragua is in such disastrous economic shape that it has to 
reform in order to reconstruct it has no alternative if it wants 
outside support the diplomat said

the adventure of a japanese balloonist who tried to 
make the first solo flight across the pacific ended saturday night 
when fishermen pulled him from a gondola that had been tossed around 
in rough seas nearly 12 hours 
the 38yearold balloonist fumio niwa was in good condition 
after suffering a severe bout of seasickness said his spokesman 
toshiaki oguri 
niwa was picked up close to where he came down saturday morning 
400 miles off the coast of minami torishima an island 1550 miles 
southeast of tokyo he brought the heliumfilled balloon down 
intentionally 
after landing in the water niwa immediately separated his 
gondola from the balloon and bobbed around in the pacific ocean 
awaiting rescue 
oguri said he communicated with niwa who spoke by radio on the 
59ton no 1 yasueimaru oguri said he did not know the destination 
of the fishing boat it was towing the gondola which is six feet in 
diameter 
the balloonist took off wednesday from his hometown of yokohama 
near tokyo originally planning to reach san diego yokohamas 
sister city in about four days by hitching a ride on the 
highaltitude jet stream winds that generally blow eastward 
but the winds were blowing north toward alaska forcing niwa to 
stay at a lower altitude his spokesmen have said 
saturday afternoon niwa suffered severe sickness from the rough 
seas but he recovered by the time he was rescued said kenji 
fukawa another spokesman for the balloonist 
niwa at one point opened a window at the top of his globeshaped 
capsule to get fresh air to combat the seasickness he also shone a 
beam of light into the open sea with a flashlight after dark to help 
rescuers spot him fukawa said 
the fishing boat was guided to the site by one of two government 
p3c patrol planes the other one flew over niwas gondola to 
monitor his position 
attempts to rescue him in a seaplane failed the government sent 
a us1 seaplane but it returned with engine problems a second us1 
proved useless because it arrived after dark 
the fishing boat initially was delayed by 30mph winds which 
later diminished 
niwa an experienced balloonist quit his job with a computer 
firm three months ago to prepare for the journey 
in 1981 four balloonists successfully crossed the pacific ocean 
by balloon for the first time no one has traveled the distance 
alone

winnie mandela agreed today to 
remove from her home the bodyguards who have been accused of 
abducting and beating a black teenage activist who was later found 
dead a minister said 
the agreement came soon after the exiled leadership of the 
african national congress said mrs mandela had made mistakes and 
had refused to heed earlier requests to disband the youth group 
known as the mandela united soccer team 
the rev frank chikane who announced the agreement after meeting 
with mrs mandela for five hours told a news conference that she 
had asked him to find another place for the youths to stay 
chikane generalsecretary of the south african council of 
churches said mrs mandela told him she was following instructions 
from her husband nelson mandela the imprisoned leader of the 
african national congress 
the outlawed anc is the main guerrilla group fighting to end the 
apartheid system of legalized racial discrimination in south africa 
the statement from the ancs exile headquarters in lusaka 
zambia called on antiarpartheid groups to help her solve the 
problem it was less critical than the condemnation of mrs mandela 
that was made thursday by some of the most prominent leaders of 
antiapartheid organizations inside south africa 
chikane refused to say why mrs mandela had not carried out her 
husbands wishes immediately after she visited him in prison on 
wednesday 
he said he would find another place for the black youths to stay 
and make other arrangements for mrs mandelas security he did not 
elaborate 
she formed the mandela united soccer club in 1986 saying she 
wanted to provide something to do for youths congregating on the 
streets near her house 
but they became a group of bodyguards who lived at the house in 
soweto and were often accused of antagonizing members of the 
community 
black leaders in soweto have said they mandela and anc officials 
in exile have all called on her to disband the team but she had 
refused 
the controversy came to a head last month when three men told a 
community meeting of 150 top antiapartheid activists the bodyguard 
members had abducted them to the mandela home and beaten them 
the men said that 14yearold activist stompie seipei was also 
taken and beaten but was hurt more seriously and was removed from 
them after two days his body was found dumped in a soweto field on 
jan 6 with its throat cut police this week identified it in a 
morgue and opened a murder investigation

britains prince charles arrived in south 
florida today for two weekend polo matches a couple of benefits 
with high society and some quiet time on a horse ranch 
but at least one local official plans to give the prince of wales 
the royal snub 
the whole thing seems a little snooty to me said vero beach 
mayor ken macht 
after taking part in charity polo matches today and sunday the 
prince flies on to the caribbean island of st lucia and to 
venezuela where he will visit a rain forest 
charles began his eighth us visit in new york with a private 
dinner party friday night charles is traveling alone his wife 
princess diana made a highly publicized fourday visit to new york 
earlier this month 
he spent a quiet 24hour visit to washington that included a 
getacquainted dinner with president bush at his mountain retreat 
bush greeting charles on his arrival by helicopter friday night 
at the camp david md presidential retreat told reporters they 
would discuss a wide array of issues over an informal dinner of 
grilled swordfish and rice pilaf at aspen lodge 
charles ducked a question whether he would take the occasion to 
lobby for one of his favorite causes protecting the environment 
as british officials had predicted he would you never know he 
said 
the only other invited guests to the twohour dinner were bushs 
wife barbara british ambassador sir antony acland and his wife 
henry catto the us ambassadordesignate to london and brent 
scowcroft the presidents national security adviser 
it was the first time that bush and the eldest son of queen 
elizabeth ii had held an extended conversation although the former 
vice president had met charles during two previous royal visits in 
1981 and 1985 
it was charles second visit to camp david the presidential 
retreat in the catoctin mountains of maryland north of washington 
he and his sister princess anne were there in 1970 as guests of 
president nixons daughters tricia and julie who served grilled

with 16 american leaders in business education science and social 
welfare programs had afternoon tea with vice president and mrs dan 
quayle and greeted about 250 former and current american scholarship 
students at british universities 
charles drew laughter and applause from his audience of marshall 
scholars whose studies abroad were financed by the british 
government when he asked about the 234 former scholars whose 
whereabouts are unknown 
have they vanished off the face of the earth or did they drop 
out and are now rearing goats in georgia or practicing sustainable 
development in idaho he asked 
perhaps they were picked up by visiting ufos and their very 
special skills are even now being exploited by alien intelligence in 
some farflung corners of the universe charles suggested 
in that case it merely confirms the advantages of the british 
educational system he said 
among the guests at the embassy lunch were sen albert gore jr 
dtenn michael j boskin nominated to head the presidents 
council of economic advisers donald graham publisher of the 
washington post arthur ochs sulzberger jr deputy publisher of the

a white principal accused of making 
racist comments about blacks to white students has resigned from his 
job and will be reassigned school officials say 
charles walker is accused of telling white cheerleaders that 
associating with blacks would degrade them 
charlie stepped down this afternoon at northeast jerry 
epperson director of high schools for the east baton rouge parish 
school system said friday his reason was basically he didnt 
want to do anything to hurt northeast high school 
local naacp chapter president g washington eames said thursday 
he had received a letter written by several black teachers at 
northeast that read 
when a principal summons white cheerleaders to his office and 
tells them that their association and friendship with black boys and 
girls will cause them to be degraded is the best example of racism 
we have ever experienced from a person who calls himself a 
professional 
walker has been teaching that one race is better than or less 
than the other eames quoted the letter as saying it said he 
not only frustrated demoralized and insulted every black child at 
this school but also created social degradation and human 
humiliation among the black members of this faculty 
walker has an unlisted home phone number and could not be reached 
for comment 
rather than getting involved in some type of turmoil charlie 
thought it best to step down epperson said 
walker will take one week of annual leave beginning monday and 
then will be reassigned to a central office position epperson said 
an interim principal who will be from outside northeast high 
and will not be allowed to apply for the permanent position will 
be named over the weekend epperson said

james a baker iii is new to diplomacy but he 
learned fast on his first overseas trip as secretary of state not to 
challenge friends or foes 
baker hopped nimbly through the 15 countries that are joined with 
the united states in the nato alliance without touching a sensitive 
nerve 
baker briefed president bush on the trip by phone on saturday and 
will meet with him personally sunday for a more detailed report 
according to white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
bush is spending the weekend at the presidential retreat at camp 
david md 
the president reviewed at length with the secretary a variety 
of issues that had been discussed with the allies including the 
generally shared view that eastwest relations are now clearly 
proceeding on the basis of the wests agenda fitzwater said in a 
statement 
the president expressed his conviction that nato unity is 
strong and his confidence that the allies will move together in 
addressing the major questions of international stability 
fitzwater said 
baker operated most effectively behind the scenes as white house 
chief of staff and treasury secretary in the reagan administration 
and then as president bushs 1988 election campaign chairman 
critics of the bush campaigns tactics especially its rough 
attack on liberals and prisonerrelease policies rarely took aim at 
baker 
baker took the same subdued style with him to canada and to 
western europe just for a moment on the flight home on friday he 
showed a touch of emotion concerning his decision to sell his stock 
in a new york bank 
he owned the shares because of a merger involving a texas bank 
founded by his grandfather 
my grandfather would be turning over in his grave he said 
and yet characteristically when ethical questions were raised 
at the white house the bank holds 45 billion in third world debt 
that could be affected by state department decisions baker put out 
the fire quickly 
he ordered trustees to sell all of his publicly traded stock as 
well as that held by his wife susan and their daughter mary 
bonner baker to avoid any appearance of an ethical conflict 
on policy issues and on terrorism baker was as reserved in his 
soft east texas drawl as any of his eastern predecessors 
he artfully avoided a showdown with touchy west german leaders on 
nuclear weapons and on the help german firms gave libya in building 
a chemical weapons plant 
baker did not try to talk chancellor helmut kohl out of his 
proposal backed also by denmark to postpone the upgrading of 
natos battlefield lance missiles 
instead they agreed to try to work out a compromise at the north 
atlantic treaty organization summit meeting being planned for late 
may in brussels 
baker let it be known he was aware of the political problems 
confronting kohl a conservative who faces elections in 1990 in a 
country with growing disarmament tendencies 
nor was there any public criticism from baker of the help west 
german firms gave libya as it tried to develop chemical weapons 
the germans who first denied the charges as exaggerations by the 
american media have tightened export controls and promised to 
prosecute violators baker let it rest at that 
in the hague baker was confronted with an appeal from dutch 
foreign minister hans van den broek that he take the advice of 
french greek and spanish foreign ministers who toured the middle 
east as a european community troika and plunge into arabisraeli 
diplomacy 
baker politely declined saying the time was not right and that 
premature us intervention could destroy whatever moves toward 
peace talks may be developing 
he told the west europeans he did not have any time line to 
take action 
and yet baker tactfully agreed to have american diplomats take 
soundings among the israelis arabs and the palestine liberation 
organization he promised to report back to the west european 
foreign ministers when they attend the opening of arms control 
negotiations between nato and the warsaw pact in vienna next month 
even on terrorism where george p shultz his predecessor as 
secretary of state struck a high profile by vehemently denouncing 
the latest outrages baker was careful and subdued 
he called it regrettable that a british author had been 
threatened with death by islamic fundamentalists for publishing a 
book they considered blasphemous 
reporters traveling with baker were told by a selfstyled senior 
us official that it does not do a lot of good if you are 
interested in suppressing terrorism to fan the fires 
throughout his eightday trip baker projected a cool confident 
reserve 
and yet baker reads what is written about him reports from 
washington that brent scowcroft the assistant to bush for national 
security affairs was crowding him on foreign policy were dismissed 
as ludicrous 
the procedure for holding white house discussions on issues that 
span the state department the pentagon and other agencies has been 
changed to permit scowcroft to preside 
but reporters were told baker was not concerned that he has 
known bush and scowcroft too long to worry about being eclipsed 
they were also admonished not to overplay the disagreement with 
the west germans as a schism and he questioned reports that he 
had not informed senate committees of his bank holdings 
obviously baker cares a lot about what the media say about him 
he has abandoned shultzs policy of putting all his remarks on 
the record baker held two news conferences aboard his plane but 
most of the time reporters were given socalled background 
briefings in which they were prevented from identifying the 
speaker 
baker also has expanded his public relations contingent while 
secretary of state henry a kissinger in the 1970s took a single 
spokesman along and shultz added an assistant baker is the first to 
have a staff of three looking after the press 
he reduced his security detail at the same time and found seats 
on his air force jet for 17 reporters a new high

a year after being disgraced by charges 
of sexual misconduct evangelist jimmy swaggart portrays his plight 
as a lifeanddeath struggle against pornographers who are 
trying to topple his tv ministry 
this is the crisis point in this ministry satan has come at us 
with his mightiest blow he has not succeeded he will not 
succeed swaggart said last weekend on his hourlong television 
program 
swaggart said that without an influx of donations his television 
ministry will leave the air feb 26 a year and five days after he 
tearfully confessed from the pulpit to an unspecified sin 
its been a long year for swaggarts ministry which had seemed 
to be on top of the evangelical world after the fall of ptls jim 
bakker 
shortly after swaggarts confession to his congregation new 
orleans prostitute debra murphree said he had paid her to pose nude 
for him a claim she repeated for a penthouse magazine article 
swaggart originally agreed not to preach for three months in 
accordance with a recommendation from the assemblies of god state 
council but resigned from the pentecostal denomination after 
national leaders demanded that he stay away from the pulpit at least 
a year at the same time swaggart resigned the assemblies dismissed 
him 
although the ministry refused to reveal specifics of its ensuing 
financial plight as donations dropped swaggart held a telethon to 
raise money to stay afloat laid off employees from his ministry 
one of baton rouges major employers called off construction plans 
and put the ministrys jet up for sale 
once the highestrated television preacher with viewership 
estimated at more than 2 million swaggart was dropped from three 
major cable television networks his family worship center which 
seats 5000 and was filled to the rafters for his confession now 
displays signs informing worshipers that its large balcony is closed 
the assemblies of god said it would revoke credentials of 
ministers who remained part of swaggarts organization and at least 
two churches were formed in the baton rouge area by ministers who 
left swaggart many faculty left swaggarts bible college 
enrollment dropped and some graduates last spring wondered aloud if 
their diplomas could be changed to eliminate reference to the 
evangelist 
nevertheless around thanksgiving swaggart told his congregation 
that the ministry had turned the corner his television program 
began broadcasts to china in january 
throughout swaggart remained mum about murphrees claim but he 
broke his silence last month when a new orleans stripper catherine 
mary kampen made similar allegations and like murphree sold her 
story to penthouse 
there is not one shred of truth to these allegations i have 
never met or seen this woman he said the ministry promised a 
libel lawsuit and said it had evidence kampen made up the 
allegations though she and penthouse said they stood by the story 
this is a crime it is a filth that must be eradicated from the 
land swaggart said during a jan 30 news conference in which he 
declared war on pornographers 
two days later swaggart warned his congregation that another 
plot to subvert his ministry might be in the works as 
preposterous as this one if you have enough money you can get 
anyone to say anything then came the threat a week ago to halt 
the tv ministry unless enough donations come in 
on wednesday night swaggart said his followers were responding 
to his plea for money but i dont want to shout too much because 
there are newsmen here and they might think were rich swaggart 
said he had met several times with one of the worlds foremost 
lawyers 
for now swaggart says his followers must decide 
you are making a choice today a choice between the 
pornographers that are working more diligently than you will ever 
know or its us its either the devil or darkness or its god 
and light

afghan guerrilla leaders nominated a 
moderate as president and a fundamentalist as prime minister 
saturday in what was viewed as a compromise on who will lead 
afghanistan if its sovietbacked government falls 
rebel leaders told a special consultative council of about 400 
delegates they had picked mohammad nabi mohammadi as acting 
president and ahmad shah as acting prime minister of an interim 
government 
the appointments were to be formally approved sunday by the 
council but guerrilla officials said the vote was a formality 
the delegates have already made their feelings clear said 
guerrilla spokesman mohammed saeed 
smiling delegates clustered around mohammadi to shake his hand 
and congratulate the resistance leader 
but officials of moderate guerrilla groups said they were not 
happy claiming hardline fundamentalist groups had dominated the 
council they said some of their own delegates might vote no 
sunday or walk out in protest 
guerrilla leaders and some western diplomats predict 
afghanistans communist government will soon collapse in the wake of 
wednesdays withdrawal of the last soviet forces a state of 
emergency was declared in afghanistan on saturday 
however the seven guerrilla parties based in pakistan remain 
deeply divided over sharing power many observers said the council 
was probably the guerrillas last good opportunity to form a united 
front and avoid a power struggle if they take control in kabul 
elections would be held in afghanistan within six months to form 
an elected council or shura to appoint a permanent head of state 
and ratify a government officials said 
guerrilla leaders said they would present their proposed interim 
ministers on sunday and ask the council to approve them the 
council which convened feb 10 was expected to conclude after the 
vote 
party leaders said saturday their supreme council rather than 
the interim government would remain the ultimate source of 
authority for the guerrilla alliance mohammadi leader of one of 
the seven parties was named head of the supreme council for eight 
months 
sibghatullah mojaddidi one of the guerrilla party leaders 
stepped down as acting head of the alliance to allow mohammadi to be 
supreme council head in addition to interim president officials 
said 
four of the seven guerrilla parties are made up of hardline 
islamic fundamentalists who want to establish a strict 
fundamentalist state in afghanistan the three moderate groups want 
a more liberal state along the lines of the precommunist 
governments 
the hardline parties had pushed for appointment of ahmad shah as 
president but they failed because of internal divisions he was 
prime minister of an interim government formed last year 
ahmad shah is a senior political official in ittehadiislami 
guerrilla group 
mohammadi heads one of the three moderate guerrilla parties 
harakatiinquilabiislami he is widely respected as a political 
and religious leader but his party has been weakened by chronic 
splits and poor organization 
the choice of mohammadi for acting president was seen as a 
compromise after the hardline groups insisted on ahmad shah 
mojaddidi the former supreme ccouncil head told a press 
conference saturday that moderates agreed to ahmad shah to preserve 
the guerrilla alliance 
the council apparently failed to resolve a dispute over seating 
afghan shiite guerrilla groups based in iran a deal offering them 
100 council seats was rejected by the other party leaders the seven 
main guerrilla groups are sunni moslem

leaders of warring cambodian factions 
and their neighbors meet sunday for a round of peace talks but 
there was little sign of compromise on a key issue how to share 
power after vietnams troops withdraw 
there is still a divergence of views particularly on some of 
the more sensitive internal issues indonesian foreign minister 
ali alatas told reporters saturday 
he was referring to how four factions that have fought for years 
can reconcile to rebuild their wartorn country 
alatas is chairman of the threeday meeting involving vietnam 
the administration it set up in phnom penh early in 1979 and three 
guerrilla resistance groups 
also taking part are laos and the association of southeast asian 
nations comprising the philippines singapore thailand malaysia 
indonesia and brunei 
alatas held three days of preparatory talks with cambodian 
leaders 
the possibility of reaching further common ground is quite real 
although we did not agree on all the issues at least this was 
the first time we ranged over all the major elements of a possible 
solution he told reporters these included a vietnamese pullout 
halting military aid to the resistance and a peacekeeping or other 
force to maintain stability during the transition 
the next step could be a formal international conference said 
alatas 
on arriving saturday in jakarta vietnamese foreign minister 
nguyen co thach said 50 percent of the problem has been solved 
and prime minister hun sen of the phnom penh government added 
i believe we have come to the final stage of the problem 
khieu samphan nominal leader of the largest guerrilla group the 
communist khmer rouge said in a statement he would spare no efforts 
to find a solution but he restated a peace plan already rejected by 
his foes 
the rest of the sometimes shaky guerrilla alliance includes 
anticommunists under deposed prime minister son sann and prince 
norodom sihanouk 
sihanouk heads the coalition but has refused to come to jakarta 
because his personal peace plan has been rejected his son will 
represent his faction 
the khmer rouge is considered by far the most potent of the rebel 
forces its government was ousted by invading vietnamese troops 
after it caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands in trying to 
create an agrarian communist society 
foreign ministers of cambodia laos and vietnam issued a joint 
statement in phnom penh on friday saying the withdrawal of 
vietnamese troops from cambodia no longer is a major issue the 
outstanding problem they said is to prevent the khmer rouge 
returning to power

while new englands maple sugar producers 
prepare for the coming season 150 scientists are meeting to discuss 
a littleknown pest threatening the spring tradition and 25 million 
industry 
the threeday conference this week in burlington will focus on 
the pear thrips a tiny insect that last year defoliated 469000 
acres of forest in vermont 12 million acres in pennsylvania and 
additional acreage in the other new england states and new york the 
damage in vermont compares with 21000 acres the year before 
bruce parker an entomologist at the university of vermont said 
research is continuing on the slivershaped insects which begin 
their damage in april by climbing into maple buds and feeding on the 
tender young leaves 
were going to have problems this year but the extent of the 
problems we dont know yet he said 
maple producers are beginning to bore tap holes and set up the 
tubing that collects the maple sap as they get ready for the 
sugaring season which begins in early march for them the 
overriding question is what effect the pear thrips will have on 
their source of income 
nobody knows and all you can do is guess but im optimistic 
to think its not going to be the end of sugaring said everett 
willard maple marketing specialist for the vermont department of 
agriculture 
however 54 percent of the states maple sugarers are planning to 
reduce their taps partly because of last years infestation said 
sandy wilmot the pear thrips coordinator for the vermont department 
of forests parks and recreation 
pear thrips damaged more than onesixth of vermonts maple 
forests last year significant damage was also spotted in 
pennsylvania new york massachusetts and connecticut with lesser 
damage in new hampshire and maine 
scientists believe the thrips population exploded last year 
because cool spring weather allowed the maple buds to grow more 
slowly and gave the thrips more time to feed 
many trees grew a second set of leaves salvaging the regions 
lucrative fall foliage season that draws thousands of tourists 
but damage by the thrips combined with last years spring and 
summer drought caused widespread concern about the overall health 
of the maple forest and how much stress a tree can take 
it also forced scientists to produce the first research about an 
insect that has only been considered a forest pest in this country 
since 1979 before then it affected mostly fruit orchards 
i think people are generally pleased with the fact that we 
mobilized very quickly and its such a cooperative effort to find 
out the answers said wilmot whose department has worked with the 
university of vermont state agriculture workers and the federal 
government 
weve made good progress agreed parker whose office is 
analyzing 2000 samples taken from 210 sugarbushes or maple groves 
across vermont he and six researchers are trying to determine where 
pear thrips are and how many of them exist 
parker and the state have already come out against widespread 
aerial spraying of the toxic pesticide carbaryl saying it is 
unclear whether the benefits would outweigh environmental risks 
this weeks conference will attract scientists and foresters from 
the united states canada and england 
and scientists in other states are keeping an eye on vermonts 
research and plan more studies of their own 
weve always tried to keep abreast of new developments in 
forest pests and this one which has seemed to move east in recent 
years is of particular concern said dick dearborn an 
entomologist with the maine forest service who plans to attend the 
conference

a second captured california sea lion has died and 
officials said saturday they will no longer use drugs to anesthesize 
the 600pound animals before moving them to the southwestern 
washington coast 
so far four sea lions have been captured as part of an effort to 
keep them from eating steelhead trout migrating from puget sound to 
lake washington through a ship canal two of the four have died the 
latest one friday night 
both died as they were coming out of an anesthetic said hal 
alabaster spokesman for the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration 
the second animal to survive the capture and drugging was to be 
trucked to the washington coast for release along the long beach 
peninsula the first sea lion was released there thursday 
the second sea lion to die had seemed to be recovering when it 
collapsed late friday night alabaster said it appeared to be the 
most robust and the strongest of them all he said 
an autopsy was planned 
after the first sea lion died officials said the effects of the 
anesthetic may have been aggravated by a severe lung infection and a 
bullet wound found on it the drug used was telazol a muscle 
relaxant 
alabaster said wildlife officials involved in the program plan to 
continue capturing the animals which are protected by federal law 
in a buoymounted cage and will try to find a way of fitting them 
with radio transmitters and moving them without using drugs 
weve lost two animals we need to reevaluate it he said 
the program wasnt designed to kill animals 
he said there is not a lot of experience in working with drugged 
sea lions but that drugs were used because a 600pound wild 
animal is a dangerous thing to try to handle without being under 
sedation 
the practice of using drugs had been criticized by environmental 
activists who said it was not necessary to put the animals under to 
remove them 
the sea lions are being moved because they are eating the run of 
steelhead trout that goes through the ballard locks to enter lake 
washington on their way to spawning grounds

salman rushdie author of the satanic verses had faced 
censorship before his latest novel caused an uproar in the islamic 
world and led to threats against his life 
he had two runins with censors in pakistan according to an 
essay rushdie contributed to an anthology on censorship with the 
ironic title they shoot writers dont they published by faber 
and faber ltd of london in 1984 
the satanic verses has drawn calls from the irans ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini for the authors execution several countries have 
banned the novel and a number of us book stores including the b 
dalton and waldenbooks chains have pulled it from their shelves 
moslems contend the novel blasphemes the prophet mohammed 
rushdies essay titled casualties of censorship was written 
for the magazine index on censorship in 1983 
my first direct contact with censorship took place in 1968 
when i was twentyone fresh out of cambridge and full of the 
radical fervour of that famous year rushdie wrote 
commissioned by a magazine to write his impressions of returning 
home to pakistan rushdie said he remembered little about the piece 
except images of dying horses with flies settling on their 
eyeballs 
several weeks later he learned from the magazine editor that 
official government censors had banned the article 
quizzing an uncle who served on the censorship panel rushie 
quoted him as saying publication would not be in your best 
interests 
i never found out why the author said 
on another occasion rushdie persuaded karachi tv to let him 
produce edward albees the zoo story 
i then had to go through a series of astonishing censorship 
conferences he wrote 
he was ordered to remove references in the play to pork which 
moslems arent allowed to eat sex and homosexuality he wrote 
rushdie stood his ground on pork even though he was told the 
word could not be spoken on pakistani television 
pork in albees view made hamburgers so disgusting that even 
dogs refused them rushdie wrote this was superb antipork 
propaganda 
but the television executives were unswayed and made even more 
demands rushdie wrote 
i also had to cut the line about god being a coloured queen who 
wears a kimono and plucks his eyebrows he wrote 
the point im making is not that censorship is a source of 
amusement which it usually isnt but that in pakistan at any 
rate it is everywhere inescapable permitting no appeal he 
wrote 
what are the effects of total censorship obviously the 
absence of information and the presence of lies he wrote 
but the worst most insidious effect of censorship is that in 
the end it can deaden the imagination of the people he wrote 
it becomes easy to think that what has been suppressed was 
valueless anyway or so dangerous that it needed to be suppressed

military officers from iraq and iran will 
meet wednesday at their countries common border to help stabilize 
the ceasefire in the war un peacekeepers announced saturday 
un officials last week told the associated press each country 
will be represented by 10 officers they will work with their 
governments and the un observers to resolve problems in carrying 
out the ceasefire agreement 
the un ceasefire monitoring group said in its statement that 
the meeting will be held on the ceasefire line near the iraqi town 
of khanaqin and the iranian city of qasreshirin 
the un announcement said the session will be led by the chief 
of the un iraniraq military observer group yugoslav maj gen 
slavko jovic 
foreign minister tariq aziz of iraq told a news conference 
saturday that the military group will work on purely technical 
matters 
aziz also said iraq was informed by the international committee 
of the red cross that iran will allow 260 iraqi prisoners of war to 
go home soon he said the number was too small considering iraqs 
release last month of 255 iranian pows 
an exchange of 1158 sick and disabled pows sponsored by the red 
cross collapsed last november amid mutual recriminations over the 
number repatriated only 155 iraqi and 56 iranian prisoners were 
released at that time 
the red cross has registered 50182 iraqi prisoners and 19284 
iranian prisoners but un and other estimates put the total at 
100000 
at least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war 
which began with an iraqi invasion in september 1980 after several 
border skirmishes however some estimates of the dead alone surpass 
1 million and the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of 
dollars 
a red cross official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the relief group is preparing to repatriate the iraqi pows this 
week although no date for their release has been fixed he said the 
swissbased red cross has chartered a plane to fly the iraqi pows 
from tehran to baghdad

replaced by wood as part of vermonts new bridge modernization 
program 
the meadow brook bridge which has a wooden deck and rails was 
closed last summer by selectmen who worried that its rusting steel 
support girders would no longer stand up to truck traffic 
wooden bridges save money in the short and the long run because 
they are cheaper to build dont have to be painted and are immune

a usjapanese commission should be 
established to anticipate and solve disputes before they boil over 
says a prominent us specialist on east asian affairs 
robert scalapino told a news briefing friday he hopes president 
bush will propose to the japanese such a joint commission to take up 
problems in advance instead of allowing them to reach political 
white heat level 
the two countries stand at a crossroads in our relations and 
must move toward resolution of conflicts through negotiations and 
compromise said scalapino who heads the east asian institute at 
the university of california in berkeley 
bush leaves wednesday for japan china and south korea there may 
be too little time for such matters during the planned oneday stop 
in tokyo for emperor hirohitos funeral but they need to be taken up 
soon scalapino said 
i think it is quite clear that if we are asking japan to play a 
larger and more responsible role in the world we also have to share 
some of the decisionmaking process with japan said scalapino 
prime minister noboru takeshita in a recent visit to washington 
called for closer usjapanese consultation on regional and global 
issues 
in the complex usjapanese relationship prospects are that 
acrimony will not end that this will continue to be a troubled 
marriage scalapino said 
usjapanese relations are smoother in security matters than 
trade but the united states has not made clear what is ultimately 
expected of japan scalapino said 
scalpino took issue with the view that it is inevitable for an 
economic power such as japan to become a military power 
apart from the fact that the japanese people do not want a high 
posture military position and the rest of asia does not want this 
it is also clear that the asia of the 1980s and 1990s is not the 
asia of the 1930s he said 
theres no power vacuum on the continent of asia theres no 
japanese empire to defend there are no western colonial enclaves to 
liberate 
a great fluidity in major power relations exists scalapino 
said because each of the major players with the possible 
exception of japan has serious domestic problems and they want a 
lower cost lower risk foreign policy 
hugh t patrick of columbia university forecast that japans 
trade surpluses with the united states and the world would persist 
at the same time japan has a lot of problems the runup in 
stock prices and land prices poses the specter of a crash in those 
markets said patrick who heads the japanese economy center at 
columbias graduate business school 
a key issue in any bushtakeshita talk he said would be 
cooperation in the current round of global trade negotiations while 
simultaneously enabling japan from the japanese perspective to 
protect its agriculture and from the american perspective to open 
its agriculture

its rightful owner during a ceremony saturday 
its been kept within the class said nelson zager keeper of 
the nassau inn they knew where the sign was they knew who took 
the sign but said nothing 
the handpainted 2by15 foot wooden sign which graced the 
original hotel for decades was removed as a prank by several class 
members in 1937 zager said 
after graduation responsibility for the sign fell to whichever 
classmate had a spare wall or decent storage space for example 
during the war the blackandgold sign was stored in a coal bin in 
brooklyn ny 
it feels great zager said about the signs return were 
going to be putting the sign over the front door of our inn where it 
used to be 
the inn located across the street from the university was an 
integral part of the lives of those who took the sign zager said 
they learned how to drink beer in our tap room they wanted 
to preserve their memories he said 
the sign well attached this time should be in place in front 
of the 200yearold inn by the end of the week zager said itll 
be secured to the building well enough this time so it wont be a 
tradition to take our signs he said

irans official news agency said saturday 
that salman rushdies apology to moslems for his novel the satanic 
verses was insufficient because he didnt repent and order the 
book withdrawn 
a later report from the islamic republic news agency indicated 
the apology was accepted but a dispatch later asked editors to note 
that it was in fact the personal observation of the copy writer 
and that it does not allow for any specific interpretation 
whatsoever 
the governmentrun agencys initial reaction to rushdies 
statement said it fell short of the apology demanded by president 
ali khamenei to void a death sentence imposed on rushdie by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
later irna said that rushdies apology though far too short 
of a repentance is generally seen as sufficient enough to warrant 
his pardon by the masses in iran and elsewhere in the world 
the disclaimer came two hours later 
irna also reported that the persian daily ettelaat wrote that 
to pay one man to kill another man is murder at a premium and not 
a religiouslyinspired act 
khomeini irans leader on tuesday issued a fatwa or 
religious ruling saying that rushdie should be killed because of 
his novel the satanic verses which some say insults islam 
the reported newspaper commentary amounted to an unusual 
challenge to actions by irans religious leaders who took 
khomeinis ruling as a cue to offer a total of 52 million to 
whomever kills rushdie 
rushdies book has been banned in six countries including iran 
and removed from the shelves of major bookstores in the united 
states it has prompted protests in iran india and other countries 
rushdie and his wife have been in hiding reportedly protected by 
armed guards since khomeini ordered his death 
irans president said friday that rushdie an indianborn briton 
from a moslem family might be able to save his life by admitting he 
blundered 
irna quoted the newspaper as saying the price put on rushdies 
life was typical of the dealings of the underworld and not of 
the saints or religious men 
the newspaper said that the governmentrun 15thofkhordad 
foundation and other sponsors jumping in to up the bounty had 
increased the bounty to a staggering figure completely overshadowing 
its religious implications irna said 
the newspaper was quoted as saying any person trying to kill the 
writer will be prompted by greed not religious principles 
at a cabinet meeting earlier saturday the ministers had urged 
religious leaders to keep alert to any plots against islam from the 
west similar to rushdies book irna reported 
the londonbased islamic society for the promotion of religious 
tolerance said in a statement we very much welcome mr rushdies 
apology and hope that it will now pave the way out of this 
unfortunate crisis

communist leaders proposed a new electoral 
system saturday that would reserve some parliament seats for 
independent candidates and eventually lead to fully democratic 
elections opposition spokesmen said 
in the past only partyapproved candidates were able to run for 
parliament 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said opposition leaders 
were willing to discuss with authorities the partially democratic 
electoral system which also would reserve a portion of seats for 
candidates backed by the communist party 
but they indicated it appeared acceptable only if other political 
reforms were made such as allowing access to the mass media 
ensuring independent courts and guaranteeing the right to form 
associations 
we would like the elections to be as open as possible so that 
for example solidarity candidates could compete with government 
candidates but it seems that the government wants to avoid such 
competition onyszkiewicz said at a news conference 
the authorities expect our approval of an electoral procedure 
proposed for the nearest elections that will not be 100 percent 
democratic and we did accept this principle he said 
he said the proposal was made at the latest talks between 
authorities and opposition representatives on political and social 
reforms in poland 
jacek kuron a senior solidarity adviser said the opposition 
also was told at the talks the proposed election procedure would be 
a onetime proposition and that subsequent elections would be 
totally democratic 
but he cautioned a declaration as such has no significance 
what is significant is increasing the broad democratic process 
through other political reforms he said 
under the government proposal each election district would have 
two to five seats and the opposition and authorities would decide 
in advance which seats could be contested among independent 
candidates and which would be reserved for officially backed 
candidates 
in comparison to what we have had this is a great step forward 
it opens the road to political freedom said bronislaw 
geremek chairman of the solidarity side of the working group on 
political reform 
the breakdown between the two camps was not discussed saturday 
onyszkiewicz said party sources have said privately they envision a 
system where 60 percent of the seats would be reserved for the party 
and its allies and 40 percent to independent candidates linked to 
the roman catholic church or solidarity 
anyone who collected 5000 signatures could run for parliament 
but both sides would observe a gentlemans agreement not to run 
in each others districts a highranking party source said 
this is a very important radical change in comparison with all 
other election systems after the war we treat this as a step to 
additional changes in the future said janusz reykowski a 
politburo member who led the official side in saturdays talks 
the government proposal was the latest development in a twoweek 
series of talks between authorities and the opposition 
so far officials have agreed in principle to legalize the banned 
solidarity union under terms acceptable to it to register the 
banned farmers group rural solidarity to allow independent 
organizations their own press and to ease censorship 
such concessions on the part of communist authorities would have 
seemed impossible only one year ago 
but in the allornothing format laid down by interior minister 
czeslaw kiszczak at the beginning of the talks feb 6 none of the 
agreements will be valid unless the talks as a whole succeed 
that means that solidarity and authorities still must agree on an 
economic program and on the political reforms 
the unprecedented series of talks first were proposed by the 
government during a wave of strikes in august that underscored 
growing social tensions caused by 6070 percent inflation and market 
shortages 
it is the first time since communism took hold in eastern europe 
that party officials have held wideranging formal negotiations 
with independent elements of society over how the political and 
economic system should be restructured

confirmed the meeting with arens and said the foreign minister will 
leave israel for cairo on monday 
he could not confirm the meeting with arafat 
the head of israels consular delegation in moscow arieh levin 
was contacted by the soviet foreign ministry as shevardnadze began 
planning his visit to the middle east the televison reported

shevardnadze the two met in paris last month during a conference on 
chemical weapons 
shevardnadzes 10day middle east tour began friday in damascus 
and includes stops in iran iraq and jordan in addition to egypt and 
syria 
the soviet union severed diplomatic relations with israel in the 
wake of the 1967 middle east conflict 
the two nations began to improve relations two years ago and 
exchanged lowlevel consular delegations in july 1987 
in damascus on saturday shevardnadze announced details of a 
middle east peace plan saying his country will push the un 
security council to convene an international middle east peace 
conference

within nine months 
first the foreign ministers of the security council should hold 
a special session to discuss the issue second the five permanent 
members of the council the united states the soviet union china 
france and britain should assume the function of a preparatory 
body for the conference 
third the united nations as a whole be used to help the parties 
involved work out their differences 
israel has rejected the idea of an international conference but 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has said that a ussoviet conference 
or one sponsored by the united nations could serve to bring israel 
and the arab nations together 
israel has made the restoration of sovietisraeli relations a 
condition for a soviet role in peace talks 
the soviets understand that if they want to be a serious part 
of the conflict they need contacts in israel the official said 
tuesday the director general of the prime ministers office 
yosef ben aharon urged shevardnadze to visit israel during his tour 
of the middle east 
if the soviet union really wants to have a fresh look at the 
middle east there is nothing like a firsthand look and direct 
talks with our leaders ben aharon told the jerusalem post daily 
newspaper

the decision by large bookstore chains to stop displaying or 
selling the satanic verses triggered a buyers frenzy and 
shortages at independent stores dealers said saturday 
we got in 25 copies yesterday they were all reserved said 
john evans owner of lemuria bookstores in jackson miss i wish i 
had been smart enough to order 150 i blew it 
i think the right honorable khomeini is making a best seller 
out of it said sam weller owner of the zion book stores in salt 
lake city where neither the stores nor the public library could 
keep the popular 1995 novel on their shelves 
nobody bought it until they started hollering about it 
agreed howard canada owner of howards bookstore in bloomington 
ind 
the independents said their sales heated up after the ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini offered a bounty tuesday for the killing of the 
satanic verses author salman rushdie and his publishers 
on friday the b dalton and barnes amp noble chains which have 
more than 1250 stores said they would pull the book from their 
shelves but a spokesman refused to say whether it would not be sold 
at all or simply not displayed waldenbooks the nations largest 
bookseller directed its stores thursday to remove the book from 
shelves but to sell it upon request 
rushdie apologized on saturday saying he regretted if the book 
distressed sincere followers of islam but it was not clear 
whether iran would accept his remarks 
rebecca morehouse manager of a waldenbooks store in san 
francisco said the companys president told stores saturday that 
they may display the book if they dont feel threatened 
she wanted to sell the book but im just not going to wave it 
like a red flag in front of a bull her store was out of stock and 
awaiting a second printing 
the small stores also couldnt get enough 
some of my customers called and wanted to buy it they didnt 
want to read it they just wanted to make a political statement 
said dave unowsky owner of the soldout hungry mind bookstore in 
st paul minn and a board member of the american booksellers 
association 
weve gotten hundreds of the requests in the past hundreds of 
days said an employee who identified himself only as pat at new 
york citys coliseum bookstore he said the store had sold 155 
copies since the end of december with the big sales starting 
two weeks ago 
when the book was first published we got 50 or 60 copies and 
sold them immediately yesterday by 1 oclock we had over 50 phone 
requests said fred bass owner of the strand bookstore in new 
york city 
theres been tremendous demand since wednesday and theres no 
way i can get more ive already had a call from somebody who 
offered me 40 for a copy said bass 
i think youll start seeing first editions on the market very 
quickly 50 to 75 said evans im talking about 30 days 60 
days 
even if the apology is accepted i think it will still be 
popular bass said 
readers who want to judge the satanic verses for themselves 
also have been snapping up the koran said bass the strand which 
normally sells about 10 copies of the koran a week has sold about 
200 in the last 10 days 
meanwhile authors norman mailer gay talese el doctorow 
susan sontag and robert stone planned a public reading wednesday in 
new york city of selections from the satanic verses and other 
rushdie writings 
unlike the big chains small bookstores expressed little fear of 
retribution for selling the satanic verses 
i did instruct the staff to take it out of the window on 
thursday for fear of a brick being thrown said philip lyman 
manager of the gotham bookstore in new york city which has sold out 
weve had no threats but viking had called us and told us not 
to display it in our window said the coliseum employee 
weve had some complaints with people threatening to boycott 
the store but no threats of violence said matt miller manager 
of the tattered cover in denver 
there is a question of safety obviously especially on the 
east coast said kevin morrisey an employee at the st paul 
bookstore but we havent had any threats if there are any 
fundamentalist muslims in this area im not aware of them 
nah said evans when asked if he feared moslem retribution 
in mississippi

state rescheduled the execution 
the latest death warrant bertolottis second is effective until

confessions bertolotti was walking through an orlando neighborhood 
on sept 27 1983 when he saw ms ward carrying groceries into her 
home 
bertolotti said he persuaded her to let him into the house by

raped her and stabbed her 14 times in the chest and stomach 
bertolotti wrote several letters to prosecutors after his 
conviction saying i have no regrets or sorrows for the murder of 
carol ward

from prison where he served three years of a sevenyear term for 
aggravated assault

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said saturday his country will press the un security 
council to convene an international conference to try to resolve the 
middle east conflict 
shevardnadze who began a 10day middle east tour friday 
unveiled the soviet proposals at a dinner following a sixhour 
meeting with president hafez assad 
it is our profound conviction that favorable prerequisites are 
now in place for movement toward convening an international 
conference to be attended by all parties concerned including the 
plo and five permanent members of the un security council 
shevardnadze said in his lengthy toast 
in response syrian foreign minister farouk alsharaa said his 
country welcomed a middle east peace conference under un auspices 
and accused israel of blocking it 
it is one of the most bizarre wonders that the more the arabs 
advance toward the peace choice israel progresses toward the choice 
of war and aggression alsharaa said 
he said the plo should participate and it is only natural that 
such a conference will result in israels withdrawal from all the 
occupied territories and an independent state for the palestinians 
israel television and radio said saturday shevardnadze would hold 
separate meetings with foreign minister moshe arens and plo leader 
yasser arafat during a visit to egypt this week 
israel refuses to speak to the palestine liberation organization 
which it calls a terrorist group 
arafat was quoted as saying by a rome newspaper a week ago that 
the plo has had indirect contacts with the israelis on saturday he 
said the contacts dealt with achieving a truce in southern lebanon 
where israeli troops have clashed with palestinian guerrillas 
im saying they the israelis are asking for a truce arafat 
said during taping of the cbs television news show 60 minutes 
he said the intermediaries included palestinians in israelioccupied 
territories europeans and un personnel his remarks were 
contained in a transcript released by the network 
shevardnadzes plan which he said should be carried out in the 
next six to nine months includes an initial meeting of the foreign 
ministers of the un security council 
he said the councils five permanent members then should contact 
the parties involved and assume the function of a preparatory body 
for the conference permanent members are britain china france 
the soviet union and the united states 
while the rest of the world moves toward disarmament 
shevardnadze said the middle east is marked by an escalating arms 
race including such weapons of mass destruction as nuclear arms 
and chemical weapons 
he said it was indisputable that an equitable settlement cannot 
be attained without unity among the arab countries adding he 
would be happy to host a meeting of representatives from syria 
jordan egypt lebanon and the plo 
it is also important to strengthen the link of 
syrianpalestinian interaction he said 
syria is the soviet unions most important ally in the region 
and arab media reported earlier that shevardnadzes visit may lead 
to a reconciliation between assad and arafat 
the londonbased lebanese daily alhayat said arafat might visit 
damascus after soviet mediation but it said arafat set several 
conditions including the release of up to 2000 palestinian 
detainees in syria 
arafat and assad have been at odds since 1983 when the syrian 
leader began backing palestinian groups trying to oust arafat and 
syria has been at odds with other arab nations since it backed iran 
in the 8yearold gulf war against iraq 
shevardnadzes visit came two days after the soviet withdrawal 
from afghanistan where their battle against moslem rebels was 
unpopular among arabs 
the peace proposal is the first major soviet attempt in years to 
help settle the arabisraeli dispute 
shevardnadze also plans visits to jordan cairo iraq and iran 
before returning to moscow on feb 27

premier ciriaco de mita asked his party for a vote of 
confidence in his leadership on saturday as christian democrats 
prepared to to replace him as party chief 
arnaldo forlani was expected to be chosen to replace de mita as 
party secretary considered by many the most powerful political 
position in italy the choice could possibly endanger de mitas 
10monthold government 
de mita a leader of his partys left wing called on party 
leaders to avoid making the christian democrats a party of 
conservatism and make it instead a broadbased popular party 
it is not at all a personal issue but a political question 
because the weakening or worse the collapse of the role of 
governing assumed by the christian democrats could create a much 
worse problem than the failure of a cabinet de mita said in a 
threehour speech opening the partys 18th congress this weekend 
de mita also called saturday for support for his governments 
programs to reduce the public deficit improve the environment and 
enact reform in italys political system 
the christian democrats are the countrys largest political party 
and have been the main force in italys postwar politics the party 
which dominates the fivemember governing coalition has enormous 
influence in the shape and success of government programs 
de mita insisted on remaining party leader when he assumed the 
premiership last april arguing it provided the government with 
muchneeded stability but other leaders have charged that too much 
power is concentrated in the premiers hands 
forlani 64 the only candidate for party secretary served as 
italys premier in 198081 and as christian democrat secretary from 
196973 
for several weeks de mita had backed other candidates in party 
wrangling over his successor however forlani had overwhelming 
support from the centrist faction of the party which controls about 
a third of the 1312 delegates and from giulio andreotti who 
foreign minister and de mita rival who controls about 20 percent of 
the delegates 
several newspapers said saturday that the forlani nomination 
could spell the end of de mitas government 
already the de mita phase is coming to its conclusion and the 
government will have rather the physiognomy of a government waiting 
to be definitely retired the romebased la repubblica said in a 
frontpage editorial 
many of italys 47 postwar governments have been brought down by 
division among christian democrats even when premiers were from the 
party 
the christian democrats currently rule in a coalition with the 
socialists liberals republicans and social democrats 
forlani was expected to address the congress sunday although he 
is the only candidate for party secretary he does not automatically 
win the post if he does not get enough votes delegates can 
consider other candidates

a predominantly polish catholic church 
was closed indefinitely saturday hours after the citys bishop 
summoned police to evict dissident parishioners who had occupied the 
church for a week 
a spokesman said bishop edward m egan had no other choice but to 
suspend services at st michael the archangel church on friday 
afternoon about 100 dissidents shouted down roman catholic diocesan 
officials who came to the church to convey egans offer to meet with 
them if they would leave peacefully 
they were beginning to get unruly said monsignor nicholas v 
grieco it became impossible to have services conducted there in a 
way that would be reverential 
about 200 dissident parishioners occupying the church in shifts 
staged a weeklong sitin to protest the transfer announced in 
december of a popular priest brought from poland three years ago 
regular church functions have continued during the protest 
they had vowed to maintain their vigil until church officials 
agreed to return the polish priest the rev roman palaszewski to 
the parish and remove the churchs current pastor the rev john 
bambol 
but the standoff ended abruptly early saturday morning when 
police arrived and ordered the roughly 80 dissidents present to 
leave two people were arrested on trespassing charges the rest 
left voluntarily 
how can they tell me i was trespassing in my own church said 
henry chmiel 35 one of those arrested 
the new bishop stinks chmiel said how can you call the 
police on the parishioners children in the church cried and 
several men shouted nazi germany as the protest was ending 
the dissidents many of them recent polish immigrants accuse 
bambol of engineering palaszewskis removal because he was too 
active in the polish community some say they are upset by bambols 
effort to open the church located in a largely hispanic section of 
bridgeport to ethnic groups other than poles 
ive never seen anything like it in all my life frank 
dabrowski a parishioner for 26 years said as he left the church 
saturday morning they dont even do that in communist countries 
during the afternoon about 80 dissidents huddled in the cold in 
front of the locked church while six police officers stood guard 
the dissident leaders issued two statements in the first a 
letter to pope john paul ii they appealed for his intervention and 
denounced egan accusing him of destroying the parish 
we feel very depressed and humiliated the letter said now 
we are left without our church and our priest please advise us 
where do we go now 
the protest leaders said they did not know what form their 
struggle would take now many said they would not attend any church 
services tomorrow saying they felt betrayed by the church 
how can i go to church asked chmiel thats not a church 
now id rather stay here and pray in the house 
grieco said the decision to summon police was made by the church 
corporation a board that includes the bishop and bambol 
two days of negotiations between dissident leaders and church 
hierarchy failed to resolve the crisis 
palaszewski himself pleaded with parishioners to leave the church 
after mayor thomas bucci arrived with 40 police officers he was 
shouted down by a chorus of nos 
palaszewki came to the church after an earlier angry 
confrontation between the dissidents and church officials the 
shouting incident resulted when the rev laurence r bronkiewicz 
the diocese of bridgeports vicar for clergy asked the dissidents 
to leave st michael 
some of the dissidents began crying others shouted insults 
while cries of liars and speak to our people rang through 
the church 
church leaders apparently surprised by the hostile reaction 
hurried to a back room and closed the door one parishioner followed 
them and angrily beat on the door later church leaders and 
dissidents resumed their talks but no settlement was reached 
palaszewskis fiveyear contract was terminated in december after 
three years without explanation by joint agreement between 
franciscan officals in baltimore and poland

moderate afghan groups are pushing for 
the restoration of afghanistans last king as the only way to avoid 
a bloody struggle between rival guerrilla groups 
but powerful fundamentalist parties among moslem guerrillas 
fighting the afghan government say they will never allow the return 
of the monarchy 
king zahir shah who was deposed in 1973 is the only afghan 
leader who enjoys broad support that cuts across party tribal and 
ethnic lines according to some afghan exiles and analysts 
the 74yearold king who lives in exile in rome is the one 
figure who may be able to unite a majority of afghans in the deeply 
divided nation they say 
people think the king is the only person who can command the 
support of the entire nation and form the broadest possible 
government said akbar nakiyar an official of the moderate afghan 
national liberation front 
calls for the kings return have gained urgency since the soviets 
ended their nineyear intervention in afghanistan last week by 
pulling out the last of their troops 
guerrilla commanders say the weak afghan communist government 
cannot survive long and they are preparing to take over 
zahir shah has strong support among many afghans who remember his 
liberal rule as benign and progressive analysts said the king is 
also deeply respected as a modest man they said 
a 1988 study by the afghan information center indicated up to 70 
percent of afghans would support the return of zahir shah 
crowds of up to 50000 afghan refugees have taken part in 
demonstrations in pakistan in recent months to support the return of 
the monarch guerrilla officials say hardline guerrillas with 
clubs broke up one such demonstration in early february in peshawar 
zahir shah who has lived for years in seclusion at a villa in 
rome said recently that he was willing to return to help rebuild 
afghanistan 
now that the afghan nation is about to achieve the aims of its 
heroic struggle i wish to reiterate yet again that i am prepared to 
render without any claim or precondition any service to my country 
which would reflect the will of the majority of my compatriots he 
said 
najib the president of the sovietsupported government in kabul 
said friday he had sent emissaries to rome to sound out the king a 
spokesman for the king general abdul wali denied that saturday 
saying we have not received anyone from kabul and we dont 
expect to receive anyone soon 
support for the king has increased as the seven main guerrilla 
parties long bitter rivals have feuded over power and territory 
analysts say critics charge some guerrilla leaders are intent on 
grabbing power rather than safeguarding the interests of the afghan 
people 
afghans want a leader who will represent the nations interests 
and not be selfishly fighting for power said naim majrooh head 
of the afghan information center there is no other focal point 
that everybody can agree on 
afghanistan could be plunged into new conflict if the rival 
guerrilla groups oust the communist government and then compete for 
power 
there would be a civil war if the political parties impose a 
government on the afghan people the russians found that out said 
homayoun assef a cousin of zahir shah 
the king would have to mount a drive for support if he wants to 
return to afghanistan analysts said whether he is willing to do so 
is not clear they said 
of the seven main parties that make up the guerrilla alliance 
four are considered hardline groups and they strongly oppose the 
king the three moderate factions say his return is a possibility 
that must be considered 
hardliners say royalty is no longer a viable means of government 
the king is a part of afghan history you cant go back zahir 
shah is part of the past said abdul hadi arghandehwal of the 
hezbiiislmai faction 
fundamentalists charge the king was under communist control 
because he supported modern secular reforms in the poor and 
backward central asian nation 
hardline parties trace their roots to fundamentalist groups that 
opposed the king and then his nephew mohammad daoud who seized 
power in a 1973 palace coup daoud who declared a republic was 
toppled and killed when communists seized power in a 1978 coup 
some members of the moderate guerrilla parties openly support the 
return of zahir shah others say the monarchy should not be restored 
but that zahir shah should come back as the acting head of state 
other guerrilla officials say support for zahir shah is based on 
nostalgia for the peaceful days before the civil war began in 1978 
the country has changed enormously since then and the traditional 
society on which royalist rule was based has disappeared forever 
they said

aflcio leaders hold their annual meeting this 
week united in hoping for improved relations with the white house 
but divided over what labor must do to improve its standing in the 
workplace 
the weeklong gathering in bal harbour fla will feature the 
first meeting between the federations executive council and new 
labor secretary elizabeth dole union officials are looking to begin 
on a better note with the bush administration after turbulent 
relations in the reagan era 
mine will be a message of cooperation mrs dole said last 
week she said she would encourage improved labormanagement 
relations and promise to listen to the concerns of unions 
that would be an improvement over the first meeting between the 
35member executive council and reagans first labor secretary 
raymond donovan 
the labor leaders and donovan clashed over reagans economic 
plans after their first meeting six months later reagan fired 
striking air traffic controllers effectively killing their union 
and permanently damaging the administrations standing with labor 
aflcio president lane kirkland has been cautious in assessing 
the prospects for warmed up relations between the federation and the 
white house 
i hope so more i cant say he said recently 
mrs dole will not be the only visitor from the nations capital 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine plans to be on 
hand and new democratic national committee chairman ronald brown has 
been invited to speak to the aflcios poltical committee 
the planned unveiling of a key report the evolution of work 
however has been delayed because of internal disagreements over 
organizing tactics release of the report was to have been a 
highlight of the meeting 
instead secretarytreasurer thomas donahue will offer the 
council a closeddoor verbal update on the status of the report 
now scheduled for release at the aflcios may convention in 
washington 
kirkland recently offered a brief sketch of the topics to be 
covered in the report including developing of new benefit programs 
such as cutrate credit cards and legal services designed to lure 
into unions workers who now are covered by collective bargaining but 
are not duespaying members of unions 
some of the things we are trying may not work but that tells 
us something too kirkland said then we try something else 
recent labor department figures show that while union membership 
climbed slightly in 1988 the percentage of the workforce that is 
unionized has dropped to about 16 percent meaning that labor is 
not bringing in new members to match the rapid growth of the 
workforce 
to counter that kirkland said labor must do a better job of 
organizing workers in service industries the fastestgrowing 
segment of the economy 
the first day of the meeting monday will focus on domestic 
policy including the release by the executive council of its 
positions on a number of major bills to be considered by the 
congress this year 
that agenda includes an increased minimum wage child care and 
parental leave legislation as well as tighter restrictions on drug 
testing and new protections for workers in nuclear facilities 
labor leaders also are lobbying heavily for restrictions on 
leveraged buyouts which they blame for massive layoffs because of 
the debt assumed by most buyers in such transactions 
owen bieber president of the united auto workers when asked 
recently about labors position on the buyouts compared it to new 
deal restrictions on business 
franklin roosevelt didnt put strict controls on business 
activities during the great depression because he hated business 
bieber said he did it because the business leaders of that time 
completely defaulted on their responsibilities 
he said they had been indicted in the court of public 
opinion he said well so have the wall street bloodsuckers of 
the 1980s and they should be driven from the temple 
while making its case in the national political debate there 
will be little to settle at this meeting concerning internal aflcio 
politics 
kirkland said last month that he will seek another twoyear term 
at the may convention quashing rumors he might announce his 
retirement a move that would have set off jockeying among potential 
challengers to donahue kirklands heirapparent and those with an 
eye on donahues current post 
i do not intend to quit kirkland said at a late january 
meeting with reporters the decision on my future in this 
organization is in the best possible hands god and the delegates

the government has increased by onethird its 
estimate of how much radiation an uranium processing plant has 
released into the environment over the last 38 years 
the us department of energy said that 88000 more pounds of 
uranium and 16100 more pounds of thorium an uranium substitute 
had been released than previously estimated since the 1951 opening 
of the feed materials production center in nearby fernald 
a firm estimate of emissions from the plant is needed from its 
owner the energy department before the start of a health study by 
the us centers for disease control the government now estimates 
297000 pounds of uranium and 17590 pounds of thorium were released 
the fernald plant has been the subject of intense scrutiny by 
congress and the press because of contamination problems and 
allegations that its radioactive and chemical discharges may have 
harmed people who live and work nearby the plant processes uranium 
for the us nuclear weapons program 
environmentalists said they doubt the department ever will know 
how much pollution escaped from fernald 18 miles northeast of 
cincinnati 
this makes 175 metric tons but thats just one more step along 
a long long road said arjun makhijani an environmental 
consultant for fernaldarea residents in a lawsuit against the plant 
the energy department quietly made the new estimates public in a 
news release last week the cincinnati enquirer reported saturday a 
preliminary plant emission estimate was presented in a congressional 
hearing last october 
it raises a real concern said len weiss staff director of 
the us senate committee on governmental affairs which is led by 
us sen john glenn dohio every time they look at things the 
numbers go up again 
steven wyatt of the energy departments oak ridge tenn office 
called the new data a significant increase i can only say that 
were doing our best to fine tune this data he said we still 
dont have final numbers 
robert walker spokesman for westinghouse materials co of ohio 
which operates the fernald plant for the department acknowledged 
the significance of the revised estimate 
theres no question its a chunk walker said but oh my 
god isnt an appropriate reaction from our point of view were 
trying to uncover every possible emission from this plant over the 
37 years its been here and this is one more thats been tracked 
down 
in a related fernald development a workers compensation finding 
that blamed workrelated radiation for the fatal liver cancer of an 
engineer at the plant has been appealed by westinghouse 
westinghouse which took over the management of the plant from 
nlo inc in 1986 asked hamilton county common pleas court last week 
to overturn the state agencys decision the ruling is the only one 
to officially link a death with radioactive contamination at the 
plant

british airways began inspecting passengers 
electronic and electrical equipment saturday following the 
announcement that explosives hidden in a radiocassette player blew 
up pan am flight 103 
in another development the department of transport said it was 
testing a usmade scanner that can detect plastic explosives 
which were believed used to blow up the pan am jet the department 
denied a report sunday in the weekly mail that the instrument 
already was in use at londons heathrow airport 
as it uses neutrons we have to make sure it is absolutely 
safe a spokesman said of the computer scanner the newspaper 
report said two similar computers were successfully tested at los 
angeles and san francisco airports 
british airways britains biggest airline was acting on a 
department of transport recommendation that all airlines using 
british airports examine radios computers and other electronic or 
electrical equipment for possible explosives 
a department spokesman said the suggestion was sent to airlines 
friday and is aimed mainly at batteryoperated transistor radios 
laptop computers and cassette recorders in which explosives can be 
easily hidden rather than smaller items such as hair dryers 
an airline spokesman said british airways started asking 
passengers to take all electrical and electronic equipment out of 
their suitcases for a separate security check and when the items 
were cleared to carry them aboard as hand baggage 
no major delays were reported because of the increased security 
at londons heathrow airport new yorkbound british airways 
passenger graham atkinson from surrey south of london was asked to 
unpack his suitcase to take out a small transistor radio 
i think it is an excellent move he said i go along with 
any steps being taken to stop the terrorists obviously after 
lockerbie you cant be too careful 
all 259 people on board pan am flight 103 were killed and 11 
people on the ground in lockerbie scotland died dec 21 when a 
bomb blew up the new yorkbound jet 
sheila dawson from wimbledon also bound for new york said i 
was asked if i had anything electrical in my luggage when i checked 
in in fact i had packed my walkman in my hand baggage so i was able 
to show them straight away 
its frightening to think that a bomb could be hidden in 
something as small as that i agree with the new regulation and i 
think it should be strictly enforced 
at a thursday news conference in lockerbie detective john orr 
said investigators believe a radiocassette player contained the 
explosives that blew up flight 103 
orr who is leading the international investigation of the crash 
said it appeared likely the explosives were checked in with baggage 
in frankfurt before the plane went to londons heathrow airport for 
the final leg of its trip to new york but there was not enough 
evidence to determine the identity of the bomber he said 
one group regularly linked to the bombing was ahmed jibrils 
extremist popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command a syriansponsored faction outside the palestine liberation 
organization 
plo chief yasser arafat said saturday he would punish jibril 
if he were responsible but that no evidence has been found arafat 
said he did not think palestinians were behind the bombing because 
no palestinan can think to do this awful crime 
arafat spoke in an interview with cbs televisions 60 
minutes a transcript of his remarks was released in advance by 
the network 
at a montreal meeting last week of the international civil 
aviation organizations governing council transport secretary paul 
channon outlined a program to increase airline security including 
checks on electrical and electronic equipment 
the organization agreed to consider a worldwide tightening of 
aviation security rules including possible restrictions on carrying 
electrical and electronic devices on planes 
britain decided to go ahead with the recommendation without 
waiting for the international organization to take action said the 
transport spokesman who in line with british custom is not 
identified by name

a us investigator whose report on the arms 
control delegation in geneva included charges that john tower kept 
his secretaries as mistresses was told by the state department to 
postpone a meeting with a house subcommittee the panels chairman 
said saturday 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the subcommittee said in 
an interview that hours later state department officials promised 
full cooperation with the panel but added he still was concerned 
about the incident 
dingell said berne indahl a state department security officer 
who was sent to geneva in 1986 by the arms control and disarmament 
agency to help investigate allegations of security breaches also 
apparently was questioned by fbi agents 
indahl had been scheduled to meet saturday with the staff of the 
house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations 
but dingell told cbs news that when indahl arrived on a flight 
from africa where he is currently posted he was met by security 
officials of the state department who whisked him off to a motel or 
hotel advised him that he can speak to no one until tuesday 
state brought him back for us dingell told the associated 
press then when he got back it turned out they didnt want him 
talking to us 
dingell said he later spoke with state department officials who 
said they knew nothing about the incident or why indal was told to 
delay his meeting with the committee the officials promised full 
cooperation with the committee and indahl later spoke with 
subcommittee staff members dingell said 
nonetheless the congressman told cbs interference with a 
congressional investigation is a criminal act in the meantime 
the inquiry of the committee is now expanded by this rather curious 
set of events 
the subcommittee has been conducting an inquiry into security at 
nuclear weapons facilities run by the department of energy he said 
the inquiry is not related to investigations dealing with the senate 
confirmation hearing for tower the defense secretarydesignate 
in the course of its probe the subcommittee obtained documents 
from an office of personnel management report of an investigation 
into the activities of the geneva delegation while tower served as a 
us negotiator 
tower a former texas senator served in geneva from january 1985 
to april 1986 allegations against tower included claims that he 
used his secretaries as mistresses 
dingell said information received by his subcommittee had raised 
some very serious questions and included quite colorful 
stories about the personal behavior of some delegation members he 
said the congressman said he could not say if tower was involved 
the information which dingell said had been shared with the fbi 
and the senate armed services committee also involves inability 
to keep track of records papers safes a lack of an adequate 
logging file with regard to classified documents 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
said an investigation of towers actions in geneva found no security 
breaches 
dingells subcommittee sought a meeting with indahl to discuss 
the investigation he conducted in geneva and statements attributed 
to him in the personnel office report 
congressional sources who requested anonymity said a letter was 
sent to secretary of state james a baker iii requesting a meeting 
with indahl the security officer who was in abidjan ivory coast 
returned to the united states on saturday 
indahl contacted later at a washington dcarea hotel declined 
to comment 
state department spokesman charles redman said he had no 
information on the incident an fbi spokesman said the agency would 
have no comment on an active investigation 
the allegations against tower were said to have been made to 
indahl by john grassle a geneva security official but grassle was 
quoted by knightridder news service as saying he did not make such 
allegations 
a man who answered the phone at grassles home said his father 
had gone on vacation for a few weeks 
assistant fbi director milt ahlerich said friday that the agency 
is in the latter stages of winding up the check into allegations 
about towers personal and business affairs 
tower has been dogged by allegations of drinking and womanizing 
many senators have said they are also concerned about whether tower 
could avoid conflicts of interest after receiving more than 1 
million as a consultant for major defense contractors since he left 
the senate four years ago 
a vote by the senate armed services committee on the nominee has 
been delayed while the fbi conducts its inquiry sen john warner of 
virginia the ranking republican on the panel said friday that the 
committee had forwarded additional material to the white house and 
that he and nunn would be available this weekend to review the fbi 
report 
the senate committee is expected to meet early next week to 
consider the embattled nomination

against roberto perez shortly before 9 pm 
perez is one of 10 men and a 14yearold boy who were indicted

of excessive publicity in duvall county where the incidents 
occurred

returning saturday to assess punishment but the jurors chose to 
remain friday night

in the week after the shooting stopped in 
their war with iran iraqis went on a 318million shopping spree in 
staterun stores they bought up television sets refrigerators and 
other luxury items the government released from warehouses 
six months later the staterun stores are closed to 
nongovernment employees and their shelves are empty one recently 
had only a few light sockets in its electrical department 
iraqis are beginning to realize that the 60 billion to 70 
billion their country borrowed during the 8year persian gulf war is 
going to affect their wallets for a long time 
no one has come forward to help finance reconstruction although 
neighboring kuwait has said it might offer some aid 
creditors who are owed an estimated 3 billion are pressing hard 
for repayment new laws designed to attract private money from 
iraqis and from around the arab world have attracted little interest 
the economic situations very bad salaries are low and prices 
go up and up said mukhtar 34 who recently started a chicken 
farm to try to supplement his familys government incomes 
i think things will stay bad because they have to pay for the 
war it may be five to seven years before it gets better 
diplomats conjecture that iraq is spreading the estimated 10 
billion to 12 billion a year it earns from oil exports too thinly 
by trying to pay for reconstruction buy expensive armaments 
develop heavy industry meet consumer demands and pay off its debts 
iraqi officials maintain the problems are shortterm and that the 
economy will eventually refloat on the 100 billion barrels of oil 
lying under their feet 
im optimistic that the price of oil will hold and iraq will 
remain an important oilproducing country for at least the next 
century said deputy foreign minister nizar hamdoon 
our resources are quite sufficient to pay the debts back its 
just a question of time 
hamdoon confirmed reports that iraq will not have to pay back aid 
from saudi arabia and kuwait estimated by diplomats at about 30 
billion 
our arab brothers are very considerate of the fact that iraq 
was defending not just its own interests but the interests of those 
countries he said 
diplomats said private suppliers in the persian gulf however 
were balking at writing off an estimated 6 billion to 8 billion in 
goods supplied on credit but the kuwaiti government might step in 
to pay that bill 
hamdoon called the 60billion debt figure exaggerated but 
the government will not release any exact figure 
diplomats say uncertainty over the size of the debt an 
overvalued dinar currency and a lack of trust in the governments 
commitment to the private sector are all factors keeping investors 
away 
arab investors really want the iraqis to open their books to 
say what their debts are said one diplomat 
potential investors dislike the discrepancy between the official 
and free market currency exchange rates and worry about the 
availability of foreign exchange diplomats said 
the iraqi dinar sells for about 50 cents on open markets in 
neighboring countries but baghdad fixes its worth at 3 
investors have to exchange at least 50 percent of their foreign 
currency at that official rate 
in addition foreign exchange can be hard to find especially 
with an estimated 2 million egyptian workers in the country who can 
legally send home about 2 billion a year 
harsh attacks in the press on steep price increases caused by 
businessmen passing on the cost of the official exchange rate have 
not encouraged investors 
the price of an automobile tire for example went from 14 dinars 
42 to 100 dinars 300 when private importers took over and 
thefts shot up prices like 625 dinars 1875 at the official 
exchange rate for a small color television unleashes consumer 
charges of extortion government salaries have been fixed at about 
150 dinars 450 a month since the beginning of the war 
iraqi consumers are also railing against shoddy local 
merchandise complaining about everything from heaters that dont 
heat to perfume that has no scent 
president saddam husseins privatization program aimed at 
increasing efficiency and luring back billions of dollars held 
abroad has met with limited success with an estimated 30 to 40 
percent of the staterun companies put on the block actually sold 
small factories have been snapped up but items like luxury 
hotels at 50 million each remain largely unsold state television 
nightly runs 10 minutes of ads for government enterprises on sale 
the state retains control of 80 percent of the economy and plans 
to keep control of heavy industry and the oil sector with the 
exception of gasoline stations 
in the meantime iraqis remain starved for goods 
arab tradition dictates that when a friend admires something you 
own you offer it to him but the offer is customarily refused 
an iraqi visiting from los angeles said he offered his rayban 
sunglasses a crocodile leather belt and an olympus camera to 
friends in iraq 
they took them

two serpents that poisoned the stock market in 
the reckless days before the crash seem to have slithered back into 
wall streets concrete canyons giving some strategists a disturbing 
dose of deja vu 
signs of insider trading on takeover stocks have been noticed by 
several tickertape scrutinizers 
also in the past week morgan stanley amp co one of the streets 
biggest investment firms abandoned a suspension of computerized 
program trading blamed by many investors for wild price swings in 
stocks and mentioned by some studies as a catalyst in the oct 19 
1987 crash 
insider trading and program trading were prominent in the 
5yearlong bull market that collapsed on black monday a crackdown 
on securities fraud and postcrash limits on program trading by big 
brokerages pushed those two activities into relative obscurity for a 
while 
although market officials responsible for policing trades havent 
disclosed a resurgence of insider trading irksome signs of the 
activity particularly in takeovertarget stock prices have been 
getting more frequent 
my impression is the stocks are very definitely running up 
prior to bids said charles m laloggia author of special 
situation report a widely read newsletter that focuses on takeover 
stocks 
its just the sort of environment we saw in 1986 and 1987 all 
over again laloggia said apparently its insider trading for 
some reason id say over last three or four months theres 
definitely been an upsurge 
one of the most conspicuous moves lately was in coleman co the 
recreational equipment maker that usually sleepy stock jumped in 
value days before management disclosed plans last tuesday for a 
debtfinanced takeover 
in another questionable predisclosure move the value of union 
carbide corp stock shot up a week before the chemical giant 
announced it had settled the bhopal gasleak disaster case with the 
indian government in addition there have been recurring rumors of 
a possible takeover bid for carbide 
new york stock exchange surveillance officials declined to return 
telephone calls for comment on possibly suspicious trades jay bono 
head of the american stock exchanges surveillance unit said his 
staff had not detected any significant resurgence in pretakeover 
announcement stock moves 
things are hopping but theres definitely no greater incidence 
of evidence of insider trading he said 
some of the activity could be attributed to the wall street rumor 
mill which is running overtime as usual rumors on possible 
takeover attempts abound and traders cant afford to ignore the 
reports regardless how factual for fear of missing another rjr 
nabisco 
to be sure many investment professionals believe the stock 
markets situation today differs sharply from the careless precrash 
days for one thing prices still remain depressed relative to that 
time for another they say higher corporate profits and dividends 
have justified the markets resurgence 
my feeling is investors arent getting into the 1987type 
trap said rao chalasani a market strategist at prescott ball amp 
turben inc a clevelandbased investment firm nonetheless 
chalasani said morgan stanleys resumption of program trading 
raised troubling questions 
the strategy involves the simultaneous sale of massive amounts of 
stock in new york and purchase of stockindex futures in chicago to 
profit from price differences and can jolt prices regardless of 
underlying values 
i do have some concern about the orderliness of the market and 
how orderly it will be chalasani said anything thats affected 
the market in the past could do so again in the future 
in other business and economic news this past week 
general motors corp and ford motor co reported record profits 
for 1988 but the performance was tainted by heavy costs for rebates 
and generous credit deals to customers 
foreign crackdowns on fraudulent market activities accelerated 
french authorities indicted five people on insider trading charges 
mexican prosecutors arrested four top securities brokers and 
japanese police seized a former labor ministry aide implicated in a 
sensational stock scandal 
government statistics suggested the nations tradebalance 
improvement has stalled although the economy continues to show 
considerable strength the december trade deficit shrank only 
slightly january industrial output climbed and factory utilization 
remained the highest in nearly a decade

the weathervanes of inflation have been pointing 
in opposite directions lately complicating the lives of some 
prominent forecasters 
one of those forecasters president bush said in the valentines 
day edition of the wall street journal that now was not the time to 
tighten credit to fight inflation 
the unnamed recipient of bushs valentine message federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan has been doing exactly that 
tightening credit to fight inflation 
both men have sought to play down their disagreement but it 
stands out as a classic confrontation between a president who favors 
strong economic growth and a fed chairman who worries toorapid 
growth will heat up inflation 
the consensus outlook for inflation is not bad a 47 percent 
rise in consumer prices in 1989 according to a survey of 51 
economists by blue chip economic indicators of sedona ariz thats 
not much above last years 44 percent increase 
the confusion exists because there are plenty of good statistics 
to back up the argument that inflation is a growing problem as 
well as the argument that its not a growing problem 
here is a look at some of the widely watched inflation 
weathervanes and what they are showing 
consumer prices the consumer price index finished 1988 with a 
pair of 03 percent monthly increases indicating that inflation 
remained moderate but some economists fear this wednesdays report 
on january prices will show a steeper rise 
wholesale prices one reason for the worry about wednesdays 
report is that wholesale prices shot up at a 127 percent annual 
rate in january it may have been partly a quirk but wholesale 
prices have been rising faster than consumer prices a worrisome 
sign 
factory use when factories are running flat out inflation tends 
to rise because companies have to bid for scarce raw materials and 
labor januarys operating rate was 842 percent a rate not 
exceeded in a decade 
wages some big labor contracts are up for renewal this year 
including ones covering 550000 phone workers and the four major 
steel companies unionized workers have been getting belowaverage 
raises in pay and benefits in the last few years if they hold out 
for catchup increases inflation could climb 
consumer spending since spending by consumers accounts for 
twothirds of the national consumption the latest 06 percent rise 
in retail sales in january could point toward overheating some 
economists believe 
commodity prices higher prices for raw materials produce whats 
known as costpush inflation the spot price index of the commodity 
research bureau covering everything from zinc to rubber is just 
5 percent below its alltime peak of november 1980 and up a sharp 10 
percent from one year ago on the positive side crude oil futures 
are about flat with a year ago 
the dollar the dollars strength while harmful to us 
exporters has helped restrain inflation by holding down the dollar 
price of imported products however if the dollar turns down 
because of bad trade figures import price inflation would rise 
gold investors buy gold as a hedge against inflation because it 
holds its value better in inflationary times than paper assets like 
stocks and bonds the price of gold has dropped about 15 percent 
over the past year one sign that many investors are not overly 
concerned about the inflationary threat 
monetary restraint under greenspan the federal reserve remains 
vigilant against inflation by soaking up bank reserves it has 
helped drive up shortterm interest rates the yield on the 
threemonth treasury bill has jumped to nearly 9 percent from under 
6 percent high borrowing costs should cool off the economy 
all in all the weathervanes dont give a good idea of which way 
the wind is blowing that means george bush and alan greenspan will 
have plenty to disagree about in months ahead

the sensational arrests of four top 
stockbrokers appears to reflect an expanded war on corruption by 
president carlos salinas de gortari who sees market malfeasance as 
a threat to mexicos modernization 
the arrests sent a very clear political and economic signal 
that this administration is stronger than the last said abel 
beltran del rio director of ciemexwefa a consulting firm that 
specializes in mexican economics 
to expedite his plans salinas needs to make the oncewild stock 
market a clean healthy conduit for local and foreign investors to 
finance mexican investment and generate jobs del rio said in an 
interview from the firms offices in bala cynwyd pa 
the arrests on illegal trading charges stem from the 1987 crash 
which exposed the mexican stock market as one of the worlds most 
freewheeling and fraudulent bourses hundreds of investors 
complained their money was squandered by unscrupulous traders in 
nearly all the countrys 25 brokerages 
the crackdown on white collar crime deflected criticism that 
salinas government is antilabor charges incited by another 
anticorruption campaign begun in january against the powerful 
mexican oil workers union 
among the stockbrokers seized last week was eduardo legorreta 
board chairman and cofounder of operadora de bolsa and one of 
mexicos wealthiest businessmen nabbed by federal agents at a 
mexico city restaurant 
legorreta known as one of the nations most aggressive brokers 
was charged with trading in expired treasury bills investing 
without clients knowledge and falsifying clients trading records 
gustavo diaz president of an investors association estimated 
corrupt brokers netted 433 million in profits from illegal 
trading while cesar fentanes mendez an attorney said stockholders 
lost more than 21 million through fraud the government itself has 
not revealed a figure 
up to 148 more stockbrokers face administrative sanctions 
including lifetime trading bans for other irregularities 
according to stock exchange president alfredo harp helu 
the salinasled shakedown against both the stockbrokers and oil 
unionists broke new ground for mexican presidents who had largely 
ignored questionable activities by these groups before 
alfonso martinez dominguez a former president of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party welcomed the salinas effort 
saying in our country there are no distinctions toward any 
class 
samuel del villar a political scientist with the colegio de 
mexico and adviser to former president miguel de la madrid said 
salinas moved against the oil workers and brokers because both 
threatened his economic program 
corruption is worst where the economic activity is most 
strategic and in mexico that means petroleum and the stock 
market del villar said the brokerage firms like the oil 
workers union werent filling a productive role in the economy 
both the mexican stock exchange and securities commission last 
week said they planned to tighten supervision including an 
automated reporting system that would leave a paper trail of 
questionable trades 
despite the campaign for a clean market critics still argue the 
government has failed to explain its own role in the october 1987 
crash and the boom that preceded it 
in the nine months before the crash mexicos exchange was the 
fastest gainer among world markets its 52stock index rose by more 
than 690 percent 
inexperienced investors weary of a protracted economic crisis 
their savings devastated by inflation and currency devaluations 
flocked in droves to eager brokers 
the boom was fed by a 1987 government order forcing brokerage 
houses to open accounts for anyone willing to invest regardless of 
financial considerations houses hired many rookies to meet demand 
swelling their work force to about 13000 
in one display of volatility just before the crash the market 
surged 7 percent in just 90 minutes after the announcement that 
salinas would be the governing partys presidential candidate in the 
1988 election 
the october 1987 crash hit investors brokers and the business 
community especially hard 
the market index dropped 74 percent in 28 trading days the 
steepest decline anywhere losses reached an estimated 17 billion 
said oscar espinoza villareal president of the national securities 
commission 
the crack as its known here prompted the securities 
commission in december 1987 to suspend 105 brokers trading without 
federal licenses fine 87 firms that violated trading rules and 
raise capital requirements for all the number of brokerage 
employees is now down to about 10000 
an announcement by treasury secretary pedro aspe that no more 
brokers faced sanctions soothed nerves and sent brokers back to 
concentrating on business in fact the market index registered no 
significant changes in trading last week 
what remains unclear is whether the longterm effect the 
anticorruption campaign will help further salinas economic reforms 
to make up for a reduced governmental role in the economy and 
promote growth salinas 1989 budget projects a 7 percent increase 
in private investment 
one very basic thing that mexico needs as never before is a 
very dynamic and secure stock market del rio said as long as 
there are doubts about the market it will be difficult to get 
investment as quickly and in the amounts salinas wants

louisiana has adopted temporary rules to 
safely handle radiumcontaminated pipe from oilfields although the 
states environmental chief says the tubing appears to pose almost 
no public threat 
the radium which is leached from uranium and thorium found in 
deep geological formations is brought to the surface with oilfield 
brine and tends to concentrate in the scaly residue that forms 
inside pipe 
paul templet secretary of the department of environmental 
quality said possible health problems are limited mostly to yard 
workers who cut up and process them for other uses such as 
parkinglot barriers and cattle pens 
the problem is that the dust can fall out of the pipes and then 
you can get a hot spot in the yard templet said its really 
not a problem if you get it on your skin but if you get it in your 
lungs then you have a problem 
earlier this month the department enacted temporary rules 
concerning how the pipe is handled the rules require companies with 
contaminated pipe to inform the agency and prohibit the transfer of 
land for unrestricted use where topsoil radium is above a certain 
level 
the agency said its major concerns were the safety of workers who 
cut or clean the pipe and the contamination of soil in pipeyards 
which might cause problems with radon gas if buildings were erected 
on the sites 
templet said the potential problem with contaminated pipes is 
peanuts for oil field workers and the threat to the general 
public appears to be sharply limited since radium radiation is 
nonpenetrating 
the environmental department imposed the new rules under 
emergency procedures that allow the the regulations to take 
effect before the end of a 120day period required by state law 
oil industry officials blamed news of the regulations as one 
contributor to a rise in crude oil prices last wednesday they said 
the reports incited rumors that oil and gas from louisiana was 
contaminated and unsellable 
the emergency rules merely deal with pipe that may have 
radiumcontaminated scale in them templet said 
templet said the temporary rules will allow the department to 
stop pipeyards from unloading pipe before the new regulations take 
effect 
if we went with normal procedures they pipe yards could stop 
moving it out they cant now and well go through normal 
rulemaking procedures to make the regulations permanent he 
said 
the state has no statistics on how many yards are handling the 
pipes and the new rules should help authorities find exact numbers 
templet said 
knowledge of the problem he said has been limited mostly to 
industry people familiar with radiation control a national study 
group has been working for several years to draw up recommendations 
to handle the pipe he said 
the department began studying the issue about six months ago 
after receiving reports from metal scrap yards that routinely 
monitor incoming pipe for radiation templet said 
in the future contaminated pipe probably will be stored like 
other lowradiation hazards because the process of cleaning out the 
scale is prohibitively expensive templet said

a surge in exports of manufactured goods led the nations 1988 
trade deficit to its first improvement of the reagan years 
the narrowing of the trade gap to 13734 billion reported by 
the government friday was well received by the stock market wall 
street rang up its third straight gain lifting the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials 1339 points to 232482 
although the 1988 trade performance matched or even exceeded 
market expectations the dollar showed little reaction friday and 
finished slightly lower against most major currencies 
bond prices finished little changed 
the commerce department reported that exports shot up a dramatic 
268 percent last year to an alltime high of 32222 billion that 
increase supplied much of the economys momentum in 1988 as 
factories hired more workers and expanded production facilities to 
meet the export demand 
however imports rose to a record as well climbing 83 percent 
to 45956 billion the trade deficit is the difference between 
imports and exports 
the deficit declined almost 20 percent from an alltime high of 
17032 billion in 1987 it marked the first improvement since 1980 
the last year of the carter administration in that year the total 
us deficit was a much smaller 314 billion 
through the 1980s the nations trade deficit steadily 
deteriorated posting record imbalances year after year caused in 
part by the huge federal budget deficits which increased demand in 
the economy 
the bush administration which has made reducing the budget 
deficit its no 1 priority said the new trade figures showed the 
imperative need for congress to enact the presidents revised budget 
that document projects a big drop in the deficit while calling 
for a reduction in the capital gains tax as a way of spurring 
investment in new plants and equipment

its been nearly a century since a 
typewriter salesman with poor eyesight founded the coleman co now 
his descendants are fighting to ensure the family name not only 
stays on the products but runs the boardroom 
led by wc colemans grandson who is the companys chief 
executive and a parttime rocknroll musician members of the 
coleman clan have made a 64 per share debtfinanced takeover offer 
for the worldfamous maker of camping gear 
analysts say the 332 million deal could be a defensive move to 
fend off other takeover bids for the corporation that had record 
sales of 6579 million and record earnings of 245 million in 1988 
the coleman saga began in 1899 when wc working on a wintry 
night in brockton ala saw a bright steady light coming from a 
drugstore window startled he trudged across a muddy street and 
discovered the store had a lamp that burned gasoline under pressure 
and used a mantle instead of a wick 
unlike the flickering wickfed kerosene lamps and dim carbon 
filament electric bulbs the lamp threw light that enabled the 
typewriter salesman to see well at night for the first time in his 
adult life he could even read the apothecary jar labels on the 
stores shelves 
coleman investigated to see where the lamp came from and got 
territorial sales rights and later production rights for it 
leasing lamps and maintaining them coleman developed a company 
that he moved to wichita in his native kansas from kingfisher okla 
in 1901 
he figured out his real product was light not lamps so he 
sold lighting service said craig miner a wichita state 
university history instructor who is working on a book about the 
company 
by 1914 the company developed the coleman lantern and has since 
sold more than 40 million it was called the sunshine of the 
night and was credited with lengthening farmers days 
products ranging from lanters to fuelheated irons and coffee 
pots brought the company success but wc coleman wasnt a business 
management genius and couldnt keep the company out of trouble 
during the great depression 
wcs son robert sheldon who went by his middle name stepped 
in and reorganized the companys finances by 1932 it was in good 
health again though lanterns and campstoves remained big sellers 
sheldon coleman diversified into oil space heaters and gas floor 
furnaces coleman became a major exporter 
the coleman gi stove which went from concept to production in 
60 days was called one of the most important pieces of noncombat 
equipment in world war ii it would operate on whatever fuel was 
available and in weather ranging from 125 degrees farenheit to 60 
below 
coleman lighting was so well known to americans that a battle of 
the bulge password was based on that familiarity sentries would 
call out the challenge coleman and wait for the answer lamp 
from approaching soldiers 
but by 1960 coleman was weakening again its total markets had 
declined 70 percent and another diversification push started this 
time into outdoor recreation products 
one million lanterns still are sold annually but dozens of other 
items ranging from tents to sleeping bags coolers to ski vests 
have made coleman the top manufacturer of outdoor recreation 
products worldwide 
it makes knives airguns boats canoes water skis popup 
travel trailers emergency electric generators lawn mowers and home 
and recreational vehicle heating and air conditioning equipment 
new products are the lifeblood of our company said don 
berchtold coleman co executive vice president 
robert sheldon colemans son sheldon c coleman spent some of 
his early adult years in business in california and was a 
temporary disappointment to the family historian miner said 
even when he later joined the companys management he was most 
often seen in blue jeans a casual shirt and jogging shoes mingling 
with the similarly clad employees in the outing products division he 
successfully headed 
sheldon c clearly wasnt exactly the threepiece suit 
buttondown collar type of executive and that was a change for the 
traditionally conservative company miner said 
as his alterego dewey he plays guitar and sings in a 
rocknroll band called dewey and the big dogs he also owns a small 
recording studio and nightclub called big dog studio sound stage 
it reminds me of malcom forbes who rides motorcycles and hot 
air balloons said miner those just arent the kinds of things 
you expect the ceo of a major company to do 
sheldon c coleman 36 assumed the company presidency in 1987 
became chief executive officer in 1988 and was elected chairman 
following his fathers death at 86 on sept 21 
although some analysts have speculated the takeover proposal is 
sheldon cs way of putting the company on the market a company 
insider who asked not to be identified said the coleman clan is 
committed to retaining control 
hed tell you that in a second but the lawyers would probably 
kill him the anonymous coleman executive said
