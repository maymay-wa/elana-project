millington tenn received part of a liver dec 8 from her father 
robert jones a drywall installer 
hospital spokeswoman susan phillips said dr jean emond a

drain and clear the area of infection 
she tolerated the procedure very well and was out of the 
operating room in about two hours said ms phillips adding the 
infection had not been lifethreatening 
the spokeswoman said sarina was listed in critical but stable

millions of christians jammed churches in 
eastern europe to celebrate their first christmas in freedom after 
four decades of communist rule but their thoughts also went to the 
brave romanian people 
in prague leipzig east berlin and even in battleravaged 
bucharest the spirit of defiance that had guided eastern europeans 
to their remarkable revolutions turned into hope for a brighter 
future 
the change was striking in berlin as people from both sides of 
the technically still divided city mingled freely attending joint 
church services for the first time since the berlin wall was built 
28 years ago 
east germany on sunday began allowing visafree travel by west 
germans and thousands used the opportunity to cross to east berlin 
to join relatives for a christmas service 
we had very good attendance this year many people from west 
berlin came now we really have a feeling of freedom said 
christiana winter an east berliner who was showing west berliners 
around the lutheran st marys church 
the church gave hope during all those years when there was no 
hope and now we are full of hope 
this year it was important to speak of gods message of love 
so that there are no acts of revenge the church was on the side of 
the weak for years and now its is important not to hate those who 
treated us unjustly she said 
the popes midnight mass was broadcast live for the first time 
by east german television 
in leipzig the cradle of east germanys prodemocracy movement 
pastor friedrich magerius began the service in st nicholas church 
by commemorating the thousands of romanians killed and wounded in 
their struggle to overthrow communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
in leipzig like in many other towns in east europe the church 
had sheltered dissidents during the years of oppressive communist 
rule 
in bucharest hundreds of faithful came to the mitropolia 
cathedral to hear the patriarch of the romanian orthodox church 
teocitist arapas and christmas carols played on radio for the 
first time in more than 40 years 
the patriarch thanked about 500 believers for coming to the 
service despite battles raging in the city between popular forces 
and diehard ceausescu loyalists 
we must thank god who gave us freedom after 25 years of 
terror the patriarch said referring to the length of 
ceausescus dictatorship 
i have been waiting 40 years for this now i can openly go to 
church said ion ganescu a dissident who spent 10 years in 
prison for his opposition to ceausescu 
in poland where the roman catholic church had enjoyed much more 
freedom than churches in other communist countries many people 
stayed by television sets sunday night to watch polishborn pope 
john paul ii celebrate midnight mass at the vatican 
thousands attended the midnight service at their local parishes 
and crowds filled churches to capacity on christmas day to pray and 
see traditional nativity scenes which at some churches comment on 
the changes in eastern europe one at warsaws st anns church 
showed the holy infant resting upon the fallen berlin wall 
in most of the vast soviet union christmas will be celebrated 
jan 7 according to the russian orthodox calendar but in the three 
baltic republics where there are large populations of roman 
catholics and protestants christmas was a holiday for the first 
time under soviet rule 
in vilnius the capital of lithuania roman catholic activist 
antanas terleskas said many people attended church as usual but he 
said people were not especially happy because the freedom of 
expressing religious beliefs is just an illusion we are permitted 
to toy with he said 
in riga latvia radio and television broadcast the popes mass 
and activists said church attendance was up 
in tallinn estonia people were able to watch the popes mass 
on finnish television which they receive easily and for 12 hours 
estonian television broadcast christmas carols 
on christmas eve millions of czechoslovaks watched christmas 
mass on an unprecedented live television broadcast the mass from 
pragues 13th century strahov monastery was said by the rev vaclav 
maly who the government had banned from the priesthood for 11 
years because of his human rights activities 
millions of believers jammed into churches and cathedrals 
throughout the country for midnight mass on christmas day 
90yearold cardinal frantisek tomasek said mass at the gothic st 
vitus cathedral overlooking the city delivering a sermon on the 
responsibility that freedom brings 
in central prague on the site where mass prodemocracy rallies 
turned the tide of czechoslovak history last month crowds of 
students gathered to sing and share the holiday at the statue of 
bohemias patron saint good king wenceslas

theres still doubt whether 
president fw de klerk will personally oversee the end of 
apartheid but his performance since his inauguration has raised 
hopes higher than ever for peaceful change 
even the whiterun governments most militant opponents 
acknowledge a dramatic shift in mood since pw botha quit the 
presidency they say de klerks conciliatory moves resulted from 
pressure rather than conviction but many antiapartheid leaders 
now believe for the first time that the government sincerely 
wants to negotiate with them 
exit a president named pw to be replaced by one named fw 
remarkable what a difference that one letter made wrote the 
weekly mail an antiapartheid newspaper in its yearend issue 
suddenly the logjam seemed to break good intentions twinkled 
around the country for the first time people of widely 
differing views agreed there is hope in our land 
walter sisulu a leader of the outlawed african national 
congress freed by de klerk in october said in a remarkably 
optimistic christmas message that he had reason to hope for 
relaxation of tension throughout south africa in the coming 
year 
de klerk took over as acting president in midaugust after 
winning a power struggle with botha even before his inauguration 
sept 20 two weeks after general elections de klerk made his mark 
by approving the first mass antigovernment marches in decades 
he marks 100 days from the inauguration on thursday 
since his inauguration in the words of johannesburg political 
writer peter fabricius de klerk has been a blur of movement 
making a major announcement almost every other day unraveling the 
security establishment going some way to unbanning the anc 
consulting a vast spectrum of political figures 
among those consulted was the worlds bestknown political 
prisoner african national congress leader nelson mandela the dec 
13 meeting at de klerks cape town office was seen as further proof 
that mandelas release is inevitable probably before de klerk 
opens the new parliament on feb 1 
during bothas 11 years in power the anc was depicted as a 
communistled terrorist group that had no right to enter 
negotiations unless it formally renounced violence 
de klerk by meeting mandela and unconditionally freeing sisulu 
has begun the process of acknowledging the guerrilla movements 
legitimacy the government now says it will talk with any group 
committed to peaceful solutions the demand for renunciation of 
violence has been dropped 
seeking to remove obstacles to negotiations de klerk has 
ordered the abolition of whitesonly beaches proposed repeal of 
the law that allows segregated local facilities and hinted that 
the state of emergency imposed in 1986 will be lifted 
james selfe an official of the antiapartheid democratic party 
said de klerk despite a past reputation as a conservative has 
proven vastly different from previous national party leaders 
it might even be that the man had an ideological change of 
heart after coming into office selfe said 
de klerk has vowed to end discrimination and negotiate a new 
constitution that would extend political rights to south africas 
28 million blacks but he remains wedded to the concept of racial 
groups and his critics believe he will balk at any steps that 
jeopardize the power held by the 5 million whites 
in the process of defending white control de klerk is even 
prepared to put apartheid in jeopardy said fikile bam a legal 
aid director in port elizabeth 
wrote the weekly mails editor anton harber by now de klerk 
has done enough to convince most people that he is sincere in 
wanting some form of change however few of these people are 
certain he has the strength or the vision to carry through even 
this limited vision 
the countrys most powerful black moderate zulu leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi is less skeptical 
there are now few who do not take the state president 
seriously when he talks about bringing reform buthelezi said 
1990 is probably the year in which the government is going to 
strike out in the direction of establishing justice and equality 
for all 
perhaps de klerks most significant move was curbing the 
influence of police and army commanders he halved mandatory 
military service for white men from two years to one proposed 
defense spending cuts and scrapped a bureaucratic network through 
which security force officers controlled black townships 
his achievement has been to go a long way to civilianizing the 
country again and creating a spirit of glasnost as a prelude to 
the real challenge of thrashing out a true democracy wrote 
fabricius political correspondent for the star newspaper

manuel blanco rummaged through the 
ashes that had been his home and salvaged a balpeen hammer with a 
charred handle and a blackened pair of pliers 
the two tools and the clothes on his back are what remains of 
his earthly possessions even so the 70yearold retired auto 
mechanic says he is glad us forces invaded panama and overthrew 
the dictatorship of gen manuel antonio noriega 
it hurts that ive lost everything but what are you going to 
do the gringos had to do it like they did i only wish they would 
have done it long ago he said 
he stood on blackened sheets of corrugated zinc that had been 
the roof of the twostory wooden apartment building where he lived 
with his wife and their granddaughter the only remnans of the 
building are two masonry columns that supported the communal 
bathrooms 
blanco and his neighbors had the misfortune to live a block from 
the headquarters of the panamanian defense forces noriegas 
command center 
us tanks and rocketfiring helicopters destroyed the military 
headquarters before dawn wednesday the barrage sparked fires that 
raced through housing in the working class chorrillo neighborhood 
creating at least 20000 refugees 
no one has more right to speak than we do the ones hurt most 
by the attack said ruben camargo 37 standing in front of his 
ruined home camargo a goldsmith is luckier than blanco in that 
he lived with his wife and two children in a more substantial 
cinderblock structure 
us forces evacuated the area at daybreak wednesday hours 
after the assault began 
camargo said his 4yearold daughter was traumatized by the 
hours of fire and bombing and she wakes up crying during the night 
one single person is guilty of all this so much death because 
of one man and that mans name is manuel antonio noriega said 
camargo when asked if he resents the invaders 
of a dozen chorrillo residents inteviewed by the associated 
press all applauded the us action 
the closest thing to criticism was voiced by taxi driver bolivar 
escobar 32 standing in his flooded home on the ground floor of 
the destroyed housing block most of his familys possessions were 
wrecked or looted he had salvaged a red cape embroidered with 
silver trim a costume that his 11yearold daughter had worn 
the invasion itself was correct the form no he said 
they should have come with much more personnel to establish 
positions corner by corner to prevent looting and they could have 
used less shelling a lot of people died in their sleep now we 
have to start from zero he said 
hospital authorities estimated between 200 and 300 people were 
killed in the invasion at least half of them civilians hundreds 
more were injured 
it was the only way to get him noriega out said camargo 
he could have quit and given us all the gift of a happy 
christmas not this bitter christmas were having 
the perception of the americans as liberators underscores the 
relationship the united states and panama have enjoyed since panama 
was created through seccession from colombia by president 
theodore roosevelts gunboat diplomacy in 1903 
panamas currency is the us dollar and its economy has always 
been closely linked to the usbuilt and jointly administered 
canal the national pastime is baseball and virtually all males 
over 8 years old follow the us big leagues 
not only are we happy with the invasion most people here 
would like panama to be the 51st star on the us flag said a 
middleaged woman 
camargo blanco and about 9000 chorrillo refugees are being 
sheltered and fed by us troops at balboa high school two miles 
away 
they like a dozen others interviewed in the wasteland around 
the defense forces headquarters appealed for reconstruction aid 
from the usinstalled government of president guillermo endara 
and from washington 
sergio delgado loaded some soggy sofa cushions from his house 
onto his brotherinlaws pickup 
weve suffered but finally that corruption is ended he 
said the panamanian people have been asking for a long time for 
the north americans to intervene

just last week doctors thought 
18yearold melissa missy goebel would remain in a coma for 
years 
on christmas day the mead high school honors student was 
talking and watching as family members opened presents for her at 
sacred heart medical center 
i thought the very best christmas present i could ever get was 
to hear my daughter talk again said missys father steve she 
gave me that gift with a week to spare and each day she gets a 
little bit better 
missy was injured nov 25 in a headon collision on interstate 
90 just west of coeur dalene idaho

they collided with a pickup truck traveling the wrong way ian 
mcelfish the boyfriend was treated and released the 79yearold 
driver of the pickup is now in a nursing home 
a month ago doctors family members and friends thought melissa 
would die 
missy was in a coma largely unresponsive to talking and 
touching by family members on day 19 doctors said goebel most 
likely would be comatose for years 
but just a few hours after doctors left her room that day missy 
spoke to her mother then she asked to telephone her brother 
despite her head injuries and a broken neck clavicle right arm 
and left leg 
shes a little miracle said victoria goebel missys 
mother shes quite an amazing girl 
mrs goebel said she welcomed the sound of missy bickering with 
her younger brother brian 
she calls her brother a dweeb a lot the mother said adding 
that the siblings were close friends i couldnt believe it when 
they were in there arguing the other day it was great 
missys struggle is far from over the left side of her body 
remains paralyzed 
goebel said his daughter often slips into a kind of dream 
state and gets confused easily 
shes pretty much like a rag doll he said but shes 
further along than anyone ever thought she would be

twenty years after president nixon ordered the 
destruction of the us stockpile of biological weapons the 
federal government is on the verge of making development and 
possession of the weapons illegal 
although nixons directive met with little resistance and the 
united states joined the soviet union and 109 other countries in 
signing a 1972 pact to prohibit production and possession of the 
weapons efforts to incorporate the treatys provisions into us 
law have failed until this year 
scientists defense analysts and lawmakers credit the bush 
administration the changing atmosphere for arms control agreements 
and the work of a freshman senator from wisconsin who has little 
foreign policy background 
if i had to pick any of the 100 senators it would not be him 
even the top 80 john isaacs of the liberal council for a livable 
world said in a recent interview he was the new kid on the 
block 
the kid is democratic sen herbert kohl who with the help of a 
longtime opponent of biological and chemical weapons sen david 
pryor dark convinced the justice department and the full senate 
to support the biological weapons antiterrorism act of 1989 
in the waning hours of the congressional session on nov 21 the 
senate approved the legislatio by voice vote house passage and 
presidential approval appear likely early next year 
by approving the legislation the senate has signaled the 
world that the united states is serious about controlling these 
abominable creations kohl said on the senate floor 
by definition biological weapons are a form of bacteria virus 
fungus or naturally occurring toxin a biological weapon could be 
unleashed on an unsuspecting public by using it in a liquid to 
contaminate water or in an aerosol that is dropped by bomb 
in 1925 the geneva protocol banned the first use in war of 
biological and chemical weapons but did not address the 
development production possession or transfer of the weapons 
fortyfour years later nixon ordered the defense department to 
destroy its arsenal of biological weapons the united states then 
spearheaded the fight for an international ban on production and 
possession of the weapons on april 10 1972 in washington moscow 
and london 111 countries signed the biological weapons convention 
the senate ratified the treaty two years later 
according to the pact each nation must take any necessary 
measures to prohibit biological weapons at home legislation was 
introduced in congress over the years to include the prohibition in 
us law but the measures never got far 
among the problems during the 1980s according to the 
legislations house sponsor rep robert kastenmeier dwis was 
the view of the reagan administration 
this administration is somewhat different kastenmeier said 
in an interview during eight years of the reagan administration 
candidly speaking they were not really for this legislation 
they felt we didnt need this 
but with the bush administrations support for the bill and the 
tenor of the times for arms control legislation said kohl the 
biological weapons bill won easy senate approval after just a 
handful of hearings 
it was the right time the right place the right bill kohl 
said 
the measures purpose is twofold it implements the 1972 
biological weapons convention and seeks to protect the united 
states against the threat of biological terrorism 
the legislation would prohibit the possession or development 
of germ warfare devices and authorize the punishment of those who 
attempt to help foreign nations acquire such weapons the bill 
says 
kohl believes final congressional approval and bushs signature 
would strengthen the united states hand in demanding that all 
countries comply with the 1972 treaty 
the administration is concerned about countries with the 
capability to produce biological weapons including iran iraq 
syria and israel the official list remains classified

under cloak of darkness the us army 
helicopter flew the length of the panama canal taking a pair of 
reporters a photographer and a television crew to this port city 
but soon after they arrived members of the group realized that 
theyd missed the story again 
soldiers told of entering the city on friday afternoon to the 
cheers of citizens who draped american flags from their balconies 
they told how the local groups helped the us soldiers round up 
noriega loyalists and how deeply moving the scene had been 
but more than two days after the invasion began the us 
military still was keeping the media away from its operations until 
they were over 
the pentagon news pool created to cover american military 
actions in a way that would protect important operational secrecy 
was still on its way to panama last wednesday when the invasion 
began 
arriving in the country the pool had to cool its heels for 
hours inside a us army base and found out the details of the 
attack the same way everyone else in america did on television 
based on reports from other news people already in the city 
the group arrived at the battle area around gen manuel antonio 
noriegas headquarters after the battle was over they viewed 
noriegas private retreats after theyd been disturbed by military 
investigators and saw people who had been rescued but not the 
rescue itself 
after a while the pool members decided their motto should be 
semper tardis or always late 
the us southern command showed reporters the spoils of war but 
not the war itself which was of course the reason for the pool 
in the first place 
exposure to ongoing events was almost an accident for the pool 
but it happened for example 
an alert photographer yelling whoa got the press bus to 
stop at a makeshift prisonerofwar camp 
reporters heading to a preset downtown site received an 
extraordinary view of looting and mayhem when their driver got lost 
the press corps couldnt help but witness a surprise attack on 
southern command headquarters the site of the press center 
on a trip to interview us commanders west of the city 
reporters happened upon an extraordinary scene more than a 
thousand people cheering wildly as noriega loyalists surrendered 
their weapons to us soldiers 
all around the country american gis and local citizens were 
more than happy to tell their stories but not being witnesses 
themselves reporters were forced to piece things together and deal 
with difficult contradictions 
at rio hato a panamanian army base west of panama city army 
rangers fresh from their first real combat told of parachuting into 
an intense firefight several us lives were lost and one 
paratrooper was shot in the doorway of his c130 aircraft as he 
prepared to jump they said his ranger comrades had to pull him 
back to save his life 
but back in washington the brass was saying how the attack on 
rio hato had been cleared of resistance thanks to new stealth 
fighter planes which evaded radar for a bombing run which 
distracted the defenders 
at fort amador near panama city was the witch house a 
modest residence where noriega was said to have kept his four 
brazilian voodoo witches 
reporters were shown the evidence of strange ritual a bucket of 
blood animal entrails and a variety of religious artifacts 
carefully arranged on a desk that apparently served as an altar 
but before reporters were allowed in the military removed what 
soldiers said were packets of cocaine wrapped in tropical leaves 
soldiers who confiscated the stockpile described their haul as 
about 50 pounds of cocaine at headquarters and in washington the 
generals said it was 50 kilograms which at 22 pounds per kilo 
would better back up the us claim that noriega was involved 
heavily in the drug trade 
it was possible the generals were referring to cocaine also 
recovered elsewhere but reporters never were able to reconcile the 
figures

the manslaughter conviction of a hispanic officer 
in the deaths of two blacks had raised hopes for healing a decade 
of racial tension instead the verdict has spread tensions within 
police ranks 
talk of a work slowdown by the police and an allegation that a 
hispanic policeman hesitated before responding to a backup request 
from a black officer have embroiled the force in recent weeks 
the local branch of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people even asked gov bob martinez on friday to have 
national guardsmen patrol miamis black neighborhoods 
if i needed police protection i would not feel comfortable 
calling the police because of the attitude of some of the 
officers said the naacps johnnie mcmillian 
martinez rejected mcmillians request and mayor xavier suarez 
and police chief perry anderson assured the community that officers 
of all races would act professionally 
tensions have been evident since a jury found colombianborn 
officer william lozano guilty dec 7 in the deaths of black 
motorcyclist clement lloyd and his passenger allan blanchard 
during the past two weeks an hispanic miami officer and a white 
metrodade policeman have been suspended for wearing black tape on 
their badges or black wristbands to protest the verdict 
the police benevolent association has raised funds and presented 
lozano with a brotherhood in blue tshirt a mocking reference 
to the term prosecutors used during the trial to accuse officers of 
protecting each other 
many black officers however agreed with the verdict and see 
fundraising wristbands and clemency petitions as a slap in the 
face 
for the very people who uphold law and order to take 
exception in such a blatant manner is extremely insensitive 
said officer sam harlan head of the black officers association 
but to many other officers lozano is seen as a martyr to the 
communitys desperation to avoid a fifth race riot in the 1980s 
two previous disturbances followed acquittals of officers 
charged with killing blacks and the jan 16 deaths of lloyd and 
blanchard ignited three days of riots 
it wouldnt have made a difference whether he was hispanic or 
black he didnt receive a fair trial said martin garcia head 
of the hispanic officers association 
garcia defended officers action in support of lozano he said 
some black officers cheered and gave each other highfives when the 
conviction was announced 
if the blacks were permitted to celebrate then we have the 
right to protest garcia said 
some community leaders have blamed past racial violence on a 
feeling by blacks that they are being left behind while the 
hispanic population grows in size wealth and influence 
hispanic gains in the community have been reflected in the miami 
police force during the past decade today 44 percent of the 
forces 1100 officers are hispanic 19 percent are black and 37 
percent nonhispanic white the changes have created divisions that 
didnt exist before when hispanics joined blacks in challenging 
anglos for jobs and promotions garcia said 
before we probably had better working relations with black 
officers than we did with anglo officers but not now garcia 
said 
in the week following lozanos conviction a hispanic officer 
was accused of stalling on the way to the aid of a black officer 
who had called for assistance the incident prompted a meeting of 
the hispanic and black officers associations with police officials 
to soothe the tension 
this used to be a war between the police and the criminal 
said hialeah police chief rolando bolanos who mediated the 
meeting we do not need to have a war between police and police 
the mayor also met with garcia and police unions they showed 
a lot of sensitivity suarez said 
nevertheless police unions continue to fight the suspensions of 
the two officers punished for the black bands and raise money for 
lozanos appeal members of the fraternal order of police each have 
agreed to donate 260 to defray lozanos legal expenses 
the hispanic officers association is selling its own tshirts 
and distributing black wristbands to departments around the state 
said garcia although police chiefs have banned inuniform displays 
of support many miamiarea officers wear black wristbands offduty 
roy black lozanos defense attorney said he hasnt been 
surprised by the support 
a lot of people didnt take it seriously until he was 
convicted black said i get more calls all the time from 
people many of them police officers who want to know what they 
can do

civil rights forces stunned by what they see 
as a wave of setbacks in the supreme court last june are putting a 
congressional agenda forward for next year 
well have a fight but well win because civil rights is 
looked upon with favor these days declares rep don edwards 
dcalif 
a civil rights bill set to be unveiled soon after lawmakers 
return from the holidays could focus political pressure on the 
bush administration opposition would risk alienating the black 
community while support would mean repudiation of court decisions 
that have found favor among conservatives 
the sponsors sen edward m kennedy dmass rep augustus f 
hawkins dcalif and bipartisan coalitions in both houses are 
expected to introduce the bill soon after the 1990 congressional 
session gets under way 
thus far justice department officials have been saying they see 
no problem with recent rulings on the employment discrimination 
front they have said they would monitor the results to determine 
whether legislation is needed 
civil rights forces say it is needed now while details are not 
available proponents say the measure will be designed in large 
part to counter three decisions by the supreme court last june 
the court held in a june 5 decision involving two salmon 
canneries that plaintiffs in hiring bias suits have the burden of 
proving the practices at issue have no legitimate business purpose 
prior to the socalled wards cove decision named for a packing 
company that figured in the case it was the employer who had to 
prove that there was a legitimate business reason 
the justices on june 12 cleared the way for challenges to 
longstanding courtapproved agreements giving minorities and women 
preference in hiring for government jobs the martin vs wilke 
case involving birmingham ala firefighters was viewed as a 
sharp setback for affirmative action plans 
the court ruled june 15 that a civil rights law does not bar 
racial harassment in the workplace the patterson case was brought 
by a black woman from north carolina who said she was mistreated on 
the job because of her race 
in each case the court was divided 54 
what has happened is that the supreme court in its 
mischievousness in the past year has actually gutted title 7 of 
the 1964 civil rights act said althea simmons lobbyist for the 
national association for the advancement of colored people title 7 
is the job bias portion of the 1964 civil rights act 
legislation to counter the decisions has to pass we have no 
choice but to pass it she said if you ask is it going to be 
smooth sailing i think we have to work hard to pass it but i 
think its going to pass 
actually winning approval for the measure might not turn out to 
be such a formidable task no longer the embattled underdogs of 
yesteryear civil rights forces have been getting most of what they 
want from congress often by margins as wide as 70 percent in each 
house 
we expect very substantial bipartisan majorities in both 
houses of congress to support this vital legislation said ralph 
neas executive director of the leadership conference on civil 
rights an umbrella group that includes virtually every civil 
rights organization active in washington 
both ms simmons and neas described the employment rights 
measure as far and away the top item on the civil rights agenda for 
the year ahead but civil rights forces are pressing for a wide 
array of other items 
they are hoping for legislation to counter a supreme court 
decision in a richmond va case that struck a severe blow at 
setasides that reserve a portion of government contracts for 
minorityowned business rep john conyers dmich is planning 
hearings 
legislation to guarantee civil rights for americans with 
disabilities already has been passed by the senate following a 
compromise agreement with the bush administration action in three 
house committees is expected when congress returns from its break 
pending in the senate judiciary committee is housepassed 
legislation that would order the government to gather statistics on 
socalled hate crimes directed against racial religious and 
ethnic minorities 
committees in both houses have approved legislation that would 
guarantee employee rights to medical leave in cases involving 
birth adoption and serious illness 
a conference committee currently is attempting to resolve 
differences between house and senate versions of legislation to 
provide federal aid for child care either through grants to states 
or tax credits leaders in both houses have said the measure will 
get high priority 
incorporated into legislation to reestablish the death penalty 
now pending in the senate is an amendment to bar racial 
discrimination in imposing it 
civil rights forces also are pressing the house to attach 
antidiscrimination provisions to pending legislation that would 
allow voter registration through the mail provide automatic 
registration for anyone with a drivers license and require 
government agencies to register voters 
also pending is senatepassed legislation that would reauthorize 
through 1994 discretionary programs to aid handicapped students 
civil rights forces plan to press congress again for legislation 
that would guarantee americans affordable housing

taxpayers receive their annual holiday 
greetings from uncle sam starting today as the internal revenue 
service mails out more than 107 million tax forms and instruction 
packages 
the forms which have been waiting at post offices across the 
nation for weeks should be in most taxpayers hands before jan 1 
the irs always times the mailing which costs 26 million for 
postage and printing to come right after the crush of christmas 
mail but soon enough to give taxpayers as much time as possible to 
complete their returns before the filing deadline which falls this 
year on april 16 
for taxpayers still reeling from the sweeping changes wrought by 
the 1986 tax reform act the irs has reassuring words the new 
forms look very much like last years forms 
but to the chagrin of irs officials one of the few changes 
should not have been made and it could confuse millions of elderly 
americans 
the irs is trying to get the word out to taxpayers eligible for 
medicare that they should ignore the lines on the tax form covering 
the supplemental medicare premium congress did away with the 
premium along with the catastrophic health program it was designed 
to fund 
but congress did not vote to repeal the controversial program 
until late november long after the irs forms had gone to the 
printers 
the irs hopes to keep confusion to a minimum through a publicity 
campaign to get word to the 12 million elderly taxpayers who could 
be affected in addition irs officials note that the form 
taxpayers would need to compute their medicare premium tax 
liability form 8808 does not exist 
we believe that taxpayers will not want to pay taxes that they 
dont have to pay said irs official arthur altman 
but altman said that if taxpayers still include an amount on the 
medicare premium line the irs will refund the money 
this years returns are accompanied by a special pitch from new 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr who urges taxpayers to 
consider filing their returns electronically to cut down on the 
time it takes to process their refund checks 
the irs is providing a special tollfree telephone number 
18004241040 for people to call for a list of tax preparers in 
their area who can file returns electronically 
in 1988 twothirds of all taxpayers qualified for a refund 
with the average refund totaling 875 
all of the changes in this years forms are explained in the 
accompanying instruction booklets which also include a list of 
other irs publications that offer further help in preparing taxes 
to request additional tax forms and the tax information 
publications taxpayers can call the irs at 18004243676 
among the changes featured in this years forms 
the personal exemption the amount you may exempt from taxation 
for yourself your spouse and each dependent increases to 2000 
per person up from 1950 last year 
the standard deduction claimed by people who do not itemize 
rises to 3100 for a single person up from 3000 last year the 
exemption for a couple increases to 5200 up from 5000 last 
year 
tax rates remain the same at 15 percent 28 percent and 33 
percent with about four of every five taxpayers paying only the 
lowest rate while the rates stay the same the tax brackets have 
been widened so that more income will be taxed at lower rates in 
order to compensate for inflation 
for the first time the irs will include two name lines 
instead of one in recognition that more married couples have 
different last names 
the irs is looking for 1112 million individual tax returns to 
be filed this year with 65 percent expected to opt for the 
comprehensive form 1040 designed for taxpayers who itemize or who 
have incomes above 50000 annually 
two shorter forms form 1040a and the brief nineline form 
1040ez are available for taxpayers who do not itemize and can meet 
other qualifications 
the irs form each taxpayer receives is based on the form that 
taxpayer used last year

china is the worlds largest wheat producer 
but is not keeping pace with its own consumer demand for more 
bread noodles and dumplings 
as a result china has been buying huge amounts of wheat from 
other countries including the united states an agriculture 
department analyst says import demand will continue to grow at 
least through the turn of the century 
even though it is the worlds largest producer of wheat 
chinas domestic demand exceeds supplies says frederick w crook 
of the departments economic research service wheat output has 
risen steadily as farmers have boosted yields because of greater 
irrigation and use of improved varieties 
crook in a report on chinas wheat economy said population 
growth and consumer preference for wheat products such as 
noodles steamed dumplings bread and pastries have spurred demand 
as the worlds most populous country with 11 billion people 
even slight changes in per capita use can translate into large 
numbers 
crook said per capita wheat consumption rose steadily from 29 
kilograms in 1960 to 48 kilos in 1978 then as supplies increased 
because of import and production gains the average jumped to 90 
kilograms per person in 1987 
a kilogram is about 22 pounds ninety kilos would be about 198 
pounds or approximately 33 bushels of wheat allowing 60 pounds 
per bushel 
china has been at peaks and valleys as a customer of us wheat 
farmers since the early 1970s lately beijing has been a large and 
consistent buyer of us wheat rivaling the soviet union at times 
in the 198889 wheat marketing year that ran through last may 
31 china imported almost 81 million metric tons of us wheat and 
became the largest foreign customer of american growers the soviet 
union by comparison imported 496 million tons in the same period 
so far in 198990 china has bought about 47 million tons 
against the soviet unions purchases as of dec 14 of less than 2 
million tons 
a metric ton the unit favored in world grain trade is about 
2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels of wheat it also is 
equal to 1000 kilograms 
both china and the soviet union have bought large amounts of 
wheat under a us price subsidy arrangement the export 
enhancement program under eep private exporters can sell to 
designated foreign countries at reduced prices and then collect 
usdaowned commodities as bonuses or subsidies to make up the 
price difference 
from a production standpoint china has been the worlds largest 
wheat producer in four of the last five years according to usda 
statistics 
chinas wheat output this year for example is estimated at 91 
million tons compared with 89 million for the soviet union and 
556 million for the united states 
other major producers this year include canada 244 million 
tons australia 125 million argentina 107 million india 53 
million eastern europe 423 million and the european economic 
community 793 million 
crook said that by world standards china has achieved fairly 
high wheat yields and is surpassing those in india pakistan and 
countries which have large areas of nonirrigated wheat such as 
canada australia the soviet union and the united states 
on the other hand crook said wheat yields are higher in mexico 
france poland and japan 
crook said that chinese experts predict wheat yields will climb 
an average of about 165 percent a year and that by the year 2000 
there will be some decrease in total wheat area but they claim 
that total output by then will increase to between 100 million and 
105 million tons 
chinas population will continue to grow in the next decade 
and if per capita income continues to rise demand for wheat will 
also increase crook said however prospects for rapid gains 
in domestic wheat output are dim because little arable land can 
be shifted to wheat production and yields are already high 
as a result he added the outlook for wheat exports to china 
looks promising in the near future but the rate of growth will 
depend mostly on the ability of the rest of chinas economy to earn 
foreign exchange

revolver as she sat in her wheelchair palmer said

cuba is believed to be using a remote mexican 
land route to send weapons to leftist rebels in el salvador us 
officials say 
cuba is believed to have started using the alternate route some 
time ago and indications are that use of the route beginning in 
the yucatan peninsula has increased recently said the officials 
who asked not to be identified 
cuba has traditionally used nicaragua as its primary transit 
point for weapons deliveries to its allies in el salvador 
it was not clear whether mexican officials have been approached 
by us diplomats about the alleged shipments there was no 
immediate comment from the mexican government 
historically mexico has been sympathetic to the salvadoran 
rebels but that support has been more muted since president carlos 
salinas de gortari took office a year ago 
much of the weaponry sent to the salvadoran insurgents is 
supplied by the soviet bloc and delivered via cuba according to 
officials recent administration statements indicate that it sees 
cuba not the soviet bloc as the principal villain in these 
activities 
as described by officials the cubans ship the weapons across 
the narrow channel that separates cuba from the yucatan peninsula 
from there the equipment is sent by truck to el salvador via 
guatemala although the precise route is not clear 
nicaraguas leftist government has been criticized 
internationally for its alleged collaboration with cuba in 
supporting the salvadoran rebels 
as us officials see it cubas apparent search for new ways to 
help the salvadoran rebels without relying exclusively on 
nicaragua may be an effort to limit the chances that the 
sandinista role will be exposed more than it has been 
nicaragua has denied that its territory has been used for 
subversive activities in el salvador such interference is a 
violation of central american agreements signed by nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega 
the sandinista government has been in the forefront of the 
international effort over the past week to have the bush 
administration condemned for its invasion of panama cubas 
response also has been indignant 
the administration views cubas purported use of the route 
through mexico as a supplement to the support the nicaraguans are 
providing as a transit point for cubansupplied weapons 
as evidence that the sandinista connection has not been 
abandoned the administration has cited the discovery of weapons by 
honduran officials aboard a truck said to have been headed to el 
salvador from nicaragua 
the driver of the truck involved in the oct 18 weapons seizure 
told authorities he had been making the run between nicaragua and 
el salvador monthly since august 1988 
according to officials a more revealing incident occurred on 
nov 25 when a plane carrying surfacetoair missiles crashed in el 
salvador the plane had taken off from nicaragua and its 
destination reportedly was rebelheld territory in el salvador 
the officials contend cuba and nicaragua are intent on providing 
assistance to the salvadoran rebels during the current period 
because it may be more difficult in the coming months one reason 
peacekeepers from the united nations are being assigned to central 
america to ensure that provisions of regional agreements are being 
kept 
the bush administration has been pressing un officials to 
ensure that the peacekeepers among other duties are on the 
lookout for deliveries to the salvadoran rebels from outside the 
countys borders

the key index on the tokyo stock exchange closed at 
yet another record high tuesday while the dollar edged down 
against the japanese yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average gained 25769 points or 067 
percent ending at 3868131 the index had gained 38325 points 
monday as investors welcomed the third discount rate increase by 
the bank of japan this year the previous record was 3858618 on 
dec 18 
the dollar closed at 14237 yen down 035 yen from its finish 
of 14272 yen on monday when it fell 095 yen it opened tuesday 
at 14294 yen and ranged between 14230 yen and 14295 yen 
share prices were higher almost all across the board said 
tatsuo kurokawa an analyst with nomura securities 
although stock investors are normally discouraged by a discount 
rate hike they boosted buy orders following the monday 
announcement by the central bank mainly because investors were 
reassured that there would be no more major changes in monetary 
policy for a while kurokawa said 
the bank of japan raised the discount rate to 425 percent from 
its current level at 375 percent 
the discount rate is the rate the central bank charges on its 
loans to commercial banks 
a majority of market players think all the negative factors in 
the market have disappeared kurokawa said 
in currency dealings the market was quiet becuase many overseas 
markets including those in new york and london were closed for 
christmas holidays traders said 
after the dollar hit a high at 14295 yen investors began to 
sell the currency for profittaking and small position adjustments 
they said 
toru kanai a foreign exchange analyst with new japan 
securities co said the dollaryen rate remained inactive because 
the market had already responded to the discount rate hike monday 
the market had been well prepared for the hike since the rumor 
had come out last tuesday kanai said everybody knew there 
would be a 05 percentage point hike so the hike yesterday had 
little impact 
also traders said that a mere 05 percentagepoint raise would 
not boost yenbuying because japans discount rate is still 
substantially lower than those of other industrialized nations 
market players were reluctant to buy the dollar as well due to 
uncertainties over whether the us federal reserve board will cut 
its discount rate kanai said

china says it arrested five hong kong and macao 
residents on charges of trying to smuggle dissidents out of the 
country and today accused a hong kong group of running an 
underground railroad 
china said the hong kong alliance for supporting the democratic 
movement in china helped dozens of dissidents flee abroad since the 
army crackdown on prodemocracy protests in june 
police said the arrests dealt a major blow to the overseas 
reactionary forces who attempted to use hong kong and macao as 
sanctuaries for criminals the official xinhua news agency said 
in a report monday 
the five arrests were made over the past three months and 
xinhua did not say why they were being announced only now it said 
china will punish severely those who dare to plot and ship wanted 
criminals out of the mainland 
china has said repeatedly it will not allow residents of hong 
kong and macao to interfere in mainland affairs but this was the 
first time it explicitly accused the hong kong alliance of running 
the underground railroad 
the alliance was founded after the june crackdown which 
increased anxiety in britishruled hong kong and portugueseruled 
macao about their return to chinese rule in the coming decade 
the official peoples daily defended the arrests in an editorial 
in todays editions saying hong kong and macao residents must 
obey chinese laws when on the mainland 
in excerpts of the editorial the paper accused the alliance of 
smuggling abroad important counterrevolutionary criminals 
the chinese government will never tolerate such activities 
china considers ethnic chinese from the two colonies to be 
chinese citizens and has rejected past efforts by britain to 
intervene on behalf of arrested hong kong chinese 
the arrests were likely to increase hong kong fears about 
chinese rule which already have sent many in search of haven 
elsewhere

charles hunter accepted his teachers 
semester challenge and last week he carried it to school numbers 
from one to 1 million listed on 2400 pages and weighing 50 pounds 
the project began after steve randak who teaches a biology 
class for gifted students at lafayette jefferson high school told 
the class he would give an a for the semester to anyone who wrote 
out every number from one to a million 
unfortunately hunter didnt qualify for the a because he 
generated the numbers on his home computer 
i just thought it would be really neat to show someone could 
do it and to prove how large a million is said hunter who is 
earning an a in the course anyway 
hunter said he first set out to write each number by hand but 
lost interest at about 5000 
his interest was renewed when he thought of printing the numbers 
by computer he ran the program at least seven hours a day for two 
weeks after 2 boxes of computer paper and three ink cartridges 
he reached the magic number

a western michigan university professor 
is trying to encourage serious research on extraterrestrials by 
reviving a professional journal 
the journal of ufo studies resurrected this year from a defunct 
publication of the same name aims to give researchers something 
they wouldnt be embarrassed by writing for said its editor 
michael swords 
its meant to allow the serious people to have an outlet 
which doesnt really exist right now this was a hole in ufo 
publishing that had to be filled the professor of natural 
sciences said recently 
swords who is working on the second annual issue said the 15 
journal with a circulation of about 700 is too technical for the 
general public 
for example one of the first issues three articles of about 35 
pages each discussed chemical analyses of a substance gleaned from 
the delphos case a supposed 1971 ufo landing site in kansas 
another looked at the effect of hypnosis in obtaining information 
from people who claim they have been abducted by aliens 
swords wrote a third article about whether other life exists in 
the universe he said it isnt a matter of if but of how many 
all the laws of nature are the same everywhere and what 
happens once is bound to happen twice chances of other hightech

owners of a highrise retirement home 
where a christmas eve fire killed 16 people had planned to install 
a sprinkler system in the spring the manager says 
we didnt feel uncomfortable with the safety of the building 
we just had seen fires basically on tv and other places the 
comment was made that the sprinkler system would have been a 
benefit grant trivett of mampm properties which manages the john 
sevier retirement center said monday night 
trivett says the john sevier partnership which owns the 
11story building was going to have sprinklers put in at a cost of 
100000 
the 5decadeold building did have water hoses on each floor and 
met the fire code in effect in 1977 when it was converted from a 
hotel into apartments for retirees according to lt george 
leonard fire marshal for this eastern tennessee city of 40000 
he said the current fire code requires sprinklers for buildings 
undergoing renovations 
we inherit these buildings leonard said theyre no more 
dangerous it just means they dont meet the present codes 
legally they dont have to 
the fire broke out sunday evening on the first or second floor 
of the building where about 145 people lived and sent thick smoke 
billowing through the upper floors officials said the deaths 
occurred on the upper floors probably because of smoke inhalation 
about 50 people were injured including about 15 firefighters 
the cause of the fire was under investigation but leonard said 
it appeared accidental 
in october a resident of the home died when a kerosene heater 
apparently mistakenly filled with gasoline ignited his apartment 
after that fire assistant fire chief paul souder said he 
stepped up pressure on the owners to install sprinklers 
i feel like if a building is sprinkled and if the sprinkler is 
working properly then we wouldnt have had life loss said 
leonard 
sundays disaster might have been worse had so many residents 
not been away for christmas said mayor pc snapp 
i cant think of a worse time on christmas eve snapp said 
on the other hand it could have been a good time because a 
number of people had gone to visit relatives 
fourteen victims lived in the building and the two others were 
visiting residents 
residents of upper floors waved flashlights and screamed for 
help from the windows of their smokefilled apartments 
we could hear some people over there screaming we cant hold 
out much longer then all at once we didnt hear them anymore 
said alex hambric whose 77yearold mother was rescued from her 
ninthfloor apartment 
up to 250 firefighters fought the blaze which took about nearly 
seven hours to control some of them suffered frostbite 
most of the injured were treated for smoke inhalation and 
released at least one person was seriously burned said dan 
blevins spokesman for northside hospital 
ten of 11 residents who had been listed as missing monday have 
been accounted for the 11th person is believed to have been away 
at the time 
the fire marshal said he didnt know if owners plan to renovate 
the building or tear it down he said it appeared to be 
structurally sound 
trivett the building manager said if its renovated it 
will be renovated to todays codes

facing an uncertain future thousands of 
people left homeless by the firepower of the us troops who ousted 
gen manuel antonio noriega lined up at a refugee camp for a 
christmas dinner of gi rations 
president guillermo endara and his vice presidents ricardo 
arias calderon and guillermo ford visited the camp monday for a 
mass celebrated by archbishop marcos mcgrath five days after the 
us invasion 
residents swarmed around them shouting viva endara and 
long live the civilian government endara won may elections 
that noriega annulled 
christmas dinners were served in makeshift plastic shelters and 
large us army tents 
we served more than 8000 meals last night army col 
william connolly said monday the lines were longer than we or 
they would have liked 
many of the refugees their arms and legs in casts or bandages 
quietly wondered what would happen to them now they lost their 
homes in fighting between noriega supporters and us forces that 
attacked wednesday to oust the military ruler 
well you know its a place to stay meanwhile said pilab 
rios 40 a store clerk it is safe here and there is food of 
course i am sad to have my home gone at christmas but i have my 
life and they say we will leave here in a few weeks 
the camp is at balboa stadium and high school just south of 
panama city in the former canal zone near the canal administration 
building the us army has erected 14 large tents and hopes to put 
up 14 more 
many of the homeless have patched together shelter from what was 
available 
there are between 9000 and 10000 people here but you dont 
see that many now said connolly a boston native 
a lot of them leave during the day to where their homes were 
and search for any belongings they can bring back here he said 
they come back in the evenings we can estimate the population by 
the number of meals we serve 
for many the clothes they have on are all they managed to save 
the camp is clean and orderly and connolly said it has 
extensive medical facilities 
both the troops and the homeless consider it fortunate that now 
is the start of the dry season in panama with no torrential rains 
expected 
organization of the camp has been turned over to sergio galvez 
mayor of the chorrillo district that surrounded noriegas 
panamanian defense forces headquarters the district was devastated 
in the us attack and most of the camp residents came from there 
i have been talking with presidential advisers and they are 
very willing to help rebuild galvez said we all want to go 
back to chorrillo we hope the government of president endara will 
solve this problem very quickly 
army col jack pryor said officials of the us agency for 
international development are looking into an urban reconstruction 
program for chorrillo 
galvez divided the camp into six sectors based on peoples 
neighborhoods before their homes were destroyed in the fighting 
the homeless form orderly lines for army rations a few cooked 
rice or other staples over small fires one family opened a small 
store with a few cans of food

when a fire early one morning claimed the 
lives of their three young boys dubby and diana wilcox made a 
bittersweet choice they donated their boys organs for transplant 
operations 
two days later the heart of 10yearold jared wilcox was 
beating in the body of a 48yearold woman in arkansas first heart 
transplant 
the livers of jared and his 9yearold brother jake were 
transplanted into the bodies of a 14yearold pennsylvania boy and 
a 33yearold north carolina woman 
and the boys kidneys went to four arkansas residents 
those who know the wilcoxes said their decision was typical of 
their unselfishness as word of the tragedy spread friends 
neighbors and even strangers responded to give to them 
in a few hours a radio stations plea for help generated 
thousands of dollars a restaurant planned a benefit dinner church 
groups provided food children collected pennies and employees of a 
grocery chain authorized payroll deductions 
others in bald knob a town of 2700 residents about 60 miles 
northeast of little rock contributed clothing furniture 
appliances vehicles utilities and even a house provided 
rentfree for the next year and renovated in a days time by dozens 
of volunteers 
diana wilcox smiled then cried as she recalled entering the 
home for the first time 
you couldnt move she said there were people lined up 
all along the walls and they all hollered welcome home 
the three wilcox children were sleeping in their beds the 
morning of nov 8 while mrs wilcox drove her husband to work just 
a few blocks away in those few minutes the house was engulfed in 
smoke the result of what police chief dave miller said was a short 
circuit 
fiveyearold justin died of smoke inhalation that morning 
jared and jake died the following day also of smoke inhalation 
when first approached about donating their sons organs the 
wilcoxes said no minutes later after considering what they 
thought the boys would have wanted they changed their minds 
mrs wilcox said the knowledge that her children saved lives is 
comforting 
theres people thatve got loved ones because of my boys 
she said 
the transplant of jareds heart to mary e wilson of 
jacksonville allowed her to celebrate christmas with her family 
she said monday she hoped to meet jareds parents 
i feel that it was a gift from that family a gift of life 
from that family ms wilson said im really anxious to get to 
know them i just feel like im part of their family now 
the wilcoxes generosity also has helped others who need an 
organ transplant said bobby cumberland executive director of the 
arkansas regional organ recovery agency in little rock 
we had more organ donor referrals in november than in any 
month in our history and i think a large part of that is due to 
this familys decision to tell their story he said 
their story has touched people around the country the couple 
received about 3000 letters donations have swelled to more than 
20000 
alan risener of radio station kwck in nearby searcy called the 
response to the stations onair request for donations unbelievable 
within a few minutes we had 500 he said within three 
hours we had 6000 and it just continued to climb 
a tearyeyed elderly woman walked in the stations door with a 
100 donation students from nearby harding university carried in 
jugs of nickels dimes and quarters one man who doesnt drive 
arranged a ride 15 miles into town to donate 1 
after the boys died friends of the wilcoxes feared the couple 
might leave bald knob particularly since they had no home 
i didnt want them leaving jimmy harper said i felt that 
if they left it would have been a big loss in the community our 
youth program wouldnt be the same without dubby 
harper said a small group of friends decided to take on 
renovation of the house offered by real estate agents lynn and 
verla davis more than 50 people showed up to help 
the house was little more than a shell but in nine hours 
volunteers installed electrical wiring plumbing a septic tank 
the water line a heating unit appliances and bathroom fixtures 
utilities were turned on and simms gas co of searcy filled up the 
fuel tank leaving behind a ticket that said no charge 
the workers cleaned painted hung curtains and stocked the 
pantry and medicine chest and to make the house a home volunteers 
decorated the walls with items from their own walls 
this is the closest to home right now we can get mrs 
wilcox said 
you dont realize how many friends you have til something 
like this happens wilcox added

the centuryold tournament of roses 
parade takes to the streets new years day with millions of 
flowers amazing floats and some of the worlds most distinguished 
marching bands 
then theres a group of indonesian musicians who just months ago 
couldnt play trumpets and trombones 
the 140member sampoerna band indonesia will be its countrys 
first representatives in mondays parade tournament officials said 
the band has been practicing furiously 
even their director thom jenkins didnt know at first if 
theyd be ready now he said they are 
they really have worked extremely hard jenkins said during 
a recent telephone interview from surabaya the indonesian city of 
4 million people in east java where the band is based 
marching band instruments are not their native instruments so 
when we started they didnt even know what a trumpet was supposed 
to sound like he said 
he has drilled the musicians twothirds of whom are women for 
40 hours a week for 11 months the band also has marched and 
marched and marched three to four miles a day in the indonesian 
heat 
jenkins who moved from atlanta to indonesia early this year to 
work with the band said the ensemble submitted an audition tape to 
tournament officials because we wanted to shoot for the top 
even over here the rose parade is known as the worlds 
premiere parade 
when they learned of their acceptance jenkins said they were 
thrilled i wish you could have seen their faces he said 
the indonesians who range from age 16 to 42 will join elite 
company 
they will be among the 22 bands 60 floats and 29 equestrian 
units that an estimated 1 million people are expected to turn out 
to see millions more will watch on television 
the band will march amid such hightechnology floats as the 
general motorsunited auto workers entry which is a 33footlong 
land vehicle of the future that converts into a 60foottall robot 
in seconds and the city of burbanks entry a 55footlong 
bebop malt shop that pays tribute to 50s rock music and 
nostalgia with a giant juke box and rollerskating waitresses 
other parade veterans are the marine corps and salvation army 
units as well as aggregations from japan and switzerland the 
university of southern california and michigan bands will be 
highstepping in the parade hours before the two schools football 
teams play in the annual rose bowl game 
if they hadnt passed the audition they would have tried again 
next year jenkins said 
but the group was ready said mike riffey chairman of the 
tournament of roses music committee 
they looked very good he said theyre a very good band 
for the band members the parade promises to be only one 
highlight of the trip 
most get around surabaya by bicycle or scooter and live very 
modestly jenkins said only one band member has been outside the 
country before and riffey said one person expressed concern about 
where band members would bathe in an area with so few rivers as 
southern california 
she was told about indoor showers he said 
the groups members are looking forward to sampling their first 
american hamburgers visiting disneyland and hollywood and going 
skiing jenkins said 
that latter experience might provide the greatest culture shock 
of all he said 
these guys put on coats when the temperature falls to 80 he 
said indonesia is on the equator and the temperature is usually 
90 to 100 
but whatever the weather the band is ready to play its 
repertoire of indonesian marching tuns and folk pop and patriotic 
songs all of which work surprisingly well as marching music 
jenkins said 
theyre very proud to be representing their country jenkins 
said indonesia is a young country and patriotism is not 
considered corny

with thousands of its bridges in need 
of repairs new york is turning to a building material thats 
strong and durable relatively cheap easy to work with and 
pleasant to look at 
its wood 
far from being a way to cut corners engineers say wood is in 
many respects better than the traditional steel and concrete in the 
kind of short lightly traveled rural bridges most in need of 
repair 
using wood is really our best shot at building the 
longestlasting bridge with minimal maintenance said stan 
bishop a road engineer for cattaraugus county in western new 
york nearly a fifth of the 270 bridges maintained by the county 
have some wood 
the issue is significant in new york because the state is faced 
with billions of dollars in repair costs for 7650 state and 
locallyowned spans that arent up to standards 
the deficiencies were discovered after a bridge on the new york 
state thruway collapsed in april 1987 in an accident that claimed 
10 lives 
if properly pressuretreated and preserved wood is virtually 
impervious to the enemy that rots out conventional 
steelandconcrete bridges road salt said william smith a 
professor of wood products engineering at the state university of 
new york in syracuse 
theres no reason wood shouldnt last 50 or 100 years or more 
from a strength and durability standpoint smith said 
steel and concrete bridges on the other hand can show serious 
deterioration after just 10 or 12 years on roads that are heavily 
salted in the winter bishop said 
proponents of wood point to covered bridges some of which more 
than a century old as evidence of the longevity of wooden spans 
some elm pilings examined when the london bridge was dismantled and 
shipped to the united states as a tourist attraction had been in 
service for 400 years 
the cost savings achieved by using wood can vary considerably 
according to the length of the span design location and other 
factors said thomas quinn a structural engineer with the new york 
state department of transportation costs can drop 20 percent or 
more when wood is used instead of concrete and steel for a bridges 
superstructure quinn said 
paul cooney an engineer for albany county said many road 
workers prefer working with wood to concrete 
workers tend to have more of a familiarity with wood they 
feel more comfortable with it cooney said instead of hiring 
expert welders and elaborate equipment you dont have in normal 
inventory with the wood you have workers drilling holes attaching 
bolts and using tools and equipment theyre used to 
despite the potential cost savings timber is seldom used in 
bridges around the country said clellon lovall chief engineer in 
tennessees transportation department and chairman of the 
subcommittee on bridges and structures for the american association 
of state highway and transportation officials 
wood has probably become attractive to new york highway 
officials he said because it sometimes costs two or three times 
more to build a bridge in new york than in other states due to high 
labor contracting and material expenses 
it is limited in strength and connection capabilities said 
ty lin founder and honorary board chairman of the ty lin 
international engineering firm in san francisco however there 
are certainly places where it can be profitably or economically 
used 
generally timber bridge experts say wood should be used only in 
spans shorter than 50 feet 
there are other potential drawbacks beams can split especially 
under high pressure and once that happens they must be replaced 
wood can shrink and swell in varying moisture and temperature 
conditions possibly causing weaknesses in footings 
in new york wood is most often used in construction of the 
superstructure that portion of the bridge placed atop pilings to 
support the deck or to build the deck itself in 
steelandconcrete spans both parts are highly susceptible to 
corrosion due to road salt and rust

ion iliescu romanias new president is 
a former senior communist official who was demoted for standing up 
to nicolae ceausescu and is said to be a close friend of soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
ceausescu had stripped iliescu of the prestigious post of party 
secretary and had him assigned to direct a publishing house 
iliescu 59 announced on television friday the formation of the 
national salvation committee which he described as the new organ 
of state power in romania on saturday he announced ceausescus 
arrest 
today iliescu was appointed president by the provisional 
government 
he holds a university degree in business administration and also 
studied hydrology at moscow university where knowledgeable 
romanians say he got to know gorbachev 
while originally one of ceausescus close aides in the late 
1960s as the man responsible for youth problems and propaganda he 
was demoted from the central committee in 1971 and later from the 
cabinet 
he became regional party secretary in timisoara western 
roamania and in iasi near the soviet border in the early 1970s 
and was summoned to bucharest and named chairman of a council for 
water administration 
fired from that job after a sharp exchange with ceausescu and 
the dictators wife elena at a party meeting in the mid1980s 
iliescu was named director of the editura tehnica publishing house 
his reported friendly ties with gorbachev saved him from a more 
dramatic fall informed sources said 
iliescu as a local party chief was very informal he never 
used the word comrade when addressing people and was ready to 
talk to them as soon as they knocked at his door said cornelia 
dimitriu a university professor in iasi where iliescu was sent in 
1974 to serve as regional party secretary 
he couldnt stand ceausescus personality cult and he did not 
refrain like others from expressing it she said in an interview 
he often did not obey the orders he received from bucharest 
iliescu fell out of favor with ceausescu because he was 
outspoken and frequently aired his grievances he is a technocrat 
and not an ideologist ms dimitriu said 
born in 1930 into a workers family in eastern romania iliescu 
who is married but has no children held a number of central 
committee jobs throughout the 1960s enabling him to work his way 
up through the communist party 
at one point he headed the central committees department of 
propaganda and from 1967 to 1971 he was minister of youth problems 
iliescu long rumored to be a possible successor to ceausescu 
did not sign a march 1989 letter to the former romanian leader that 
protested the dictators human rights violations and his despotic 
rule 
informed romanians said it might have jeopardized iliescu had he 
openly joined them preferring to appear unblemished in the eyes of 
ceausescu whose secret police reportedly kept close tabs on his 
private life 
he obviously managed to outfox them mircea stoica a former 
professor at bucharest university said 
iliescu stated friday that the new government would establish 
a new structure of political power 
the old structure of party and government was liquidated 
iliescu said possibly indicating the demise of ceausescus 
communist party in romania 
we will establish a provisional structure which will prepare 
free elections in april in which the people will be the decisive 
factor for pur public life iliescu said

gaming pioneer benny binion who started out 
running illegal craps games and parlayed his fortunes to become 
owner of one of nevadas bigtime casinos has died he was 85 
binion died monday at valley hospital of a heartrelated 
condition according to a statement by henri bollinger public 
relations of los angeles he had a history of heart problems and 
entered the hospital several days ago for observation 
id asked the doctors in gamblers terms what were his odds 
and they told me six or eight to one against him said his son 
jack binion this morning i could see he wasnt going to make 
it 
he said his father who owned the horsehoe casino had been 
given the last rites of the roman catholic church on friday 
benny binion was born in grayson county texas to a family that 
sold race horses on the county fair circuit a connection that 
provided his entry into the gambling world 
he started out running illegal craps games usually out of hotel 
rooms 
the craps table would have legs that folded down and it fit 
into a crate that looked like a bed crate and since hotels always 
had beds going in or out if you had 30 minutes notice that you 
were going to be raided you could clean the place out he once 
recalled 
he was said to have killed two people in gunfights during those 
days but never went to prison for them with the charges dropped 
in each case he never apologized for them either once saying 
tough times make tough people 
he did serve time in prison for selling liquor during 
prohibition and for income tax evasion in the 1950s but toward the 
end of his life he had become such a friend of law enforcement that 
police officers borrowed money from his casino to make major 
undercover drug buys 
binion moved to las vegas in 1946 and bought the horseshoe five 
years later quickly building it into one of the citys premiere

advancedtechnology stealth 
jets slipped through panamanian air defenses and dropped two 
2000pound bombs on a military base in the early hours of the us 
invasion said defense secretary dick cheney 
cheney told a monday news conference in panama that the raid 
before dawn wednesday was intended to stun and disorient the 
panamanian defense forces at rio hato before airborne troops were 
dropped there 
the troops attacked an officers school and base of the machos 
de monte battalion one of deposed gen manuel antonio noriegas 
crack units 
the raid first reported by a pentagon spokesman on saturday 
was the first combat use of the f117a fighter jet that employs 
stealth technology designed to elude radar to date the 
supersecret fighter built by the lockheed corp has been kept from 
public viewing with a squadron based in nevada 
a photograph of the plane released by the pentagon last year 
depicts a relatively small sweptwing plane with a flat underbelly 
from some angles it looks like a stingray stealth technology makes 
extensive use of exotic composite materials some of which absorb 
rather than reflect radar waves and avoids sharp surface angles 
cheney refused to elaborate on negotiations over noriega who is 
wanted in the united states on drug trafficking charges noriega 
sought refuge sunday in the vatican embassy 
it is us policy that we would like to see noriega brought 
for trial he said adding that the militarys role in the hunt 
for the general had ended and now it is up to diplomats and 
lawyers 
cheney said he met with president guillermo endara and vice 
presidents ricardo arias calderon and guillermo ford and was 
tremendously impressed with their determination to get the 
government of panama back on its feet 
he would not say what they talked about 
cheney also said us troops had discovered a larger supply of 
cuban weapons in panama than they did during the american invasion 
of grenada six years ago 
it is sure far more weaponry was found than mr noriega could 
conceivably use even if he armed his forces several times over 
cheney said im not sure what the purpose of this is 
cheney said additional troops sent for the invasion will stay 
as long as they are needed we dont want to leave too soon 
before the objective has been achieved 
cheney noted that the united states does not turn over the 
panama canal for 10 more years and said there were troops here 
before so there will continue to be a us military presence for 
the near future 
the defense secretary visited troops earlier monday and called 
the invasion the most surgical operation of its size ever carried 
out not only by our forces but by anybody elses forces

the vatican avoided a quick decision on what 
to do with gen manuel antonio noriega but said fighting in panama 
would likely end now that the ousted strongman has taken refuge in 
its embassy in panama city 
in the vaticans first official statement since noriega sought 
refuge in the embassy on sunday spokesman joaquin navarro said 
monday that the concerned parties would examine noriegas case 
navarro said one of the parties was the government of guillermo 
endara installed after the us forces invaded he declined to 
elaborate on the others 
he said it was premature to say whether noriega would be turned 
over to the united states where he is wanted on drug charges or 
given passage to another country although reports from panama 
mentioned the possibility of noriega going to spain or cuba 
in madrid spanish foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
was quoted as saying monday that asylum for noriega was the 
exclusive problem of the vatican the united states and the new 
panamanian government 
in comments to efe spains national news agency fernandez 
ordonez was quoted as saying spain is not the ideal country to 
accept noriega because of its extradition agreement with the united 
states which includes drug trafficking cases 
navarro was asked by italian state tv if a simple turnover 
of noriega to the united states was foreseeable 
well i dont think so said navarro there isnt an 
extradition treaty or anything 
earlier another vatican official said he doubted the vatican 
would hand noriega over directly to the government of an invading 
army and suggested the vatican could hand him over to the new 
panamanian government on condition of a fair trial 
the vatican depicted the situation as an opportunity to bring 
peace to the central american country and indicated it knew of 
noriegas position before he showed up sunday afternoon 
i can announce with satisfaction that the conflict in panama 
seems to be nearing a solution without further shedding of blood 
navarro said in a fourparagraph statement and this is good news 
for christmas day 
concerning the situation of gen noriega in particular i can 
confirm that at this moment he is in the apostolic nunciature in 
panama city after having expressed the will to end the conflict 
asked about any negotiations or discussions preceeding noriegas 
arrival at the embassy navarro declined to respond 
there have been previous cases of people seeking refuge at 
vatican embassies including endara the embassy in panama 
sheltered him for a month after he was beaten by noriegas soldiers 
navarro said pope john paul ii was informed of the noriega case 
sunday evening before going to st peters basilica to say 
christmas midnight mass the pope made no direct mention of panama 
in his christmas address

romanianamericans prayed for the thousands killed in the 
uprising in their homeland but few had sympathy for executed 
president nicolae ceausescu blamed for the worst nightmares in 
europe since world war ii 
i didnt want him to die its too easy said lidia 
oprean of concord calif i wanted him to suffer for a lot of 
years and understand the romanian people suffered 
ms oprean was one of about 200 who gathered on the steps of san 
francisco city hall monday to call for us aid to romania 
that was one of many gatherings around the country in response 
to the execution monday of ceausescu 71 and his wife elena 
their executions were ordered after a secret military trial found 
them guilty of the deaths of more than 60000 romanians and the 
theft of more than 1 billion from the country the new provisional 
government announced 
the warsaw pacts last hardline communist ruler was ousted by a 
popular revolt friday the uprising was triggered by the massacre 
of thousands of people protesting ceausescus harsh rule and at 
least several hundred more are believed to have died in fighting 
since friday 
in a service at st thomas the apostle romanian orthodox church 
in st louis hills mo the rev dimitrie vincent said his 
countrys glimpse of freedom was won at a high cost in bloodshed 
this is agonizing this is a terrible tragedy vincent said 
in the last 40 years there hasnt been a peaceful christmas a 
christmas where christians in romania were free to worship until 
this year 
about 100 people attended a memorial service outside the united 
nations in new york for those killed in the uprising mark sherman 
who left romania five years ago to join his mother who defected 
earlier said ceausescu got what he deserved 
hes one of the worst nightmares in europe since world war 
ii sherman said 
the group lit 48 candles at the bottom of a wooden cross on 
which hung a lantern and a sign saying in memory of the romanian 
heroes who have died for freedom of religion liberty and justice 
isai hotaran 25 who left romania in 1987 joined about 20 
other emigres in lansing mich to set up a fundraising network 
to channel aid back to their impoverished homeland 
i am not pleased with the death hotaran said killing him 
is not enough punishment letting him and his family live in prison 
would have been more just i dont think that ceausescu had any 
idea what he had done to romania 
in seattle dr v alin botoman who fled romania as a 
teenager described the despair he encountered on an august vist 
to his hometown of fagaras in southern transylvania 
i met childhood friends who looked 10 years older than i do 
just blank faces botoman said people were desperate they 
were standing in lines for bones they wouldnt feed their dogs 
here they were only giving out meat on holidays 
simona simut a romanianamerican activist in chicago said a 
public trial for ceausescu wouldnt have worked 
the people of romania hate him so much that they probably 
would have just ran to the courtroom and killed him themselves 
before he even got to a trial she said 
a group of romanian immigrants in denver held a tearful memorial 
for victims of the revolt at the end of sunday mass at the 
transfiguration orthodox church dumitru manea mourned the dead 
but celebrated the countrys chances for change 
nothing can happen without sacrifice manea said this is 
the lesson of history

iran dismissed its ambassador to romania 
for having failed to report the revolt against president nicolae 
ceausescu who visited tehran the same week he was ousted the 
foreign ministry announced today 
mohammad jamshid gowhari was sacked on orders of foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati the official islamic republic news 
agency quoted the ministrys directorgeneral for press affairs 
mohammad hassan qadiri as saying 
irna monitored in nicosia said the dismissal was due to 
gowharis failure to furnish the foreign ministry with a 
comprehensive report on the internal situation in romania before 
ceausescu flew to tehran for a threeday visit dec 18 
also today the foreign ministry announced recognition of the 
new romanian government reported tehran radio monitored in cyprus 
iran joins the united states the soviet union and a host of other 
eastern and western nations in recognizing the countrys new 
leadership 
gowharis dismissal reflected what appears to be mounting 
embarrassment in tehran stemming from ceausescus visit at a time 
when his countrymen were in open revolt against him two days after 
ceausescus return to bucharest he was overthrown by the uprising 
that began a week earlier 
bucharest radio reported that ceausescu and his wife elena 
were executed monday after they were found guilty during a secret 
military trial of genocide and grave crimes during his 
tyrannical 24year rule 
gowhari was dismissed only three months before he was due to 
return to tehran irna reported 
ceausescu was given a red carpet welcome in tehran romania was 
irans secondbiggest trading partner in eastern europe and during 
his visit ceausescu signed an agreement to buy 1 million barrels of 
oil a year 
after ceausescu left and reports from romania underlined the 
brutality of his regime as the mass graves of victims of his secret 
police were uncovered iranian newspapers demanded an official 
explanation why the romanian leader had been allowed to visit 
tehran 
velayati responded sunday by saying the visit had been arranged 
after frequent requests from bucharest but he stressed that 
iranian leaders repeatedly advised ceausescu to bow to his 
peoples demands while he was in tehran 
during ceausescus visit however irna praised romania as the 
sole east european country rigidly adhering to its past 
government 
irna reported that legislator hojatoleslamn sadeq khalkhali 
strongly objected to ceausescus visit 
khalkhali was president of the revolutionary courts in the early 
days of the 1979 islamic revolution and was notorious for 
sentencing thousands of counterrevolutionaries to death often 
on the flimsiest of pretexts 
iran has also hotly denied european reports that iranians were 
fighting alongside ceausescus security police against rebel forces 
and that ceausescu had stashed a fortune in gold in tehran banks

south african archbishop desmond tutu today 
defended his criticism of israels treatment of palestinians and 
said that former israeli leaders engaged in terrorism in the past 
minister of religion zevulun hammer told the nobel peace prize 
winner that he showed a simple lack of understanding toward the 
problems of the middle east 
hammer who held a onehour meeting with the anglican leader 
was the only israeli official to meet with tutu during his fiveday 
christmas pilgrimage to the holy land 
tutu has visited bethlehem and the christian village of beit 
sahur in the occupied west bank met with palestinian leaders and 
prayed at yad vashem israels memorial to the 6 million jews 
killed in the holocaust 
israelis have been highly critical of tutus remarks and he 
told reporters that an israeli shouted black nazi pig at him 
during one rally 
when asked if he would condemn palestinian attacks on israelis 
as terrorism and whether he considered palestine liberation 
organization chief yasser arafat a terrorist tutu said the 
definition of terrorism must include military attacks on civilians 
tutu also said israeli leaders have practiced terrorism 
there are people in high positions in israel who did things 
which they would now call terrorism for example the bombing of the 
king david hotel he said he was referring to the july 1946 
bombing that killed 91 britons arabs and jews 
the attack on the hotel which contained british military 
headquarters was carried out by the jewish irgun underground led 
by former israeli leader menachem begin 
that was a terrorist act and mr begin later became prime 
minister tutu said 
tutu said he did not meet with israeli politicians because of 
his tight schedule but added if he had met prime minister yitzhak 
shamir he would have repeated his call for israel to end its harsh 
treatment of palestinians 
i would say to him that i cannot myself understand people who 
have suffered as jews have suffered inflicting suffering of the 
kind that i have seen on the palestinians tutu said 
he rejected israelis criticism of his comparison of south 
africas oppression of blacks with israels treatment of 
palestinians which he has repeated throughout his visit 
some of the things i have seen here are things i have seen at 
home he said when i find injustice in the world whoever 
perpetrates it must know that i will condemn them 
if i am accused as i am often accused of being antisemitic 
tough luck he said 
hammer who joined tutu in an informal news conference after 
their meeting said the bishops views of the middle east showed 
to my sorrow a simple lack of understanding 
i tried to explain that with us in judaism and in the state 
of israel freedom is part of the rights of man and part of our 
beliefs he said the ones who have been denied their 
historical rights are us and we are the ones who were persecuted

china and iran which had cordial ties with 
romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu today joined countries 
including the united states and soviet union that have pledged 
support for romanias new leadership 
but the united states and some other governments regretted that 
ceausescu and his wife elena who were executed in romania on 
monday after a secret military trial were not tried publicly 
the soviet foreign ministry called the executions an internal 
affair spokesman vadim perfiliev said the decision has probably 
been made taking into account the aspirations and will of the 
romanian people 
the dutch government said it was concerned that the 
ceausescus had been executed after a secret trial and expressed 
hope that the high principles of the rule of law will find their 
place in the new romania for which so many have fought to the 
utmost 
in britain a foreign office spokesman said normal accepted 
standards were difficult during a civil war situation 
although one may regret a secret trial at the time it was not 
really surprising said a foreign office spokesman who by custom 
was not identified 
dracula executed blared the banner headline in britains 
daily mirror tyrants are executed said the rival daily 
express 
britain china greece and iran today joined at least 13 other 
nations in pledging support for romanias provisional government 
which took over after ceausescu fled the capital in a helicopter on 
friday 
the beijing government also said the red cross society of china 
would provide immediate humanitarian aid but it did not elaborate 
ceausescu was esteemed by chinese leaders for maintaining good 
relations with beijing over the decades when china and the rest of 
the soviet bloc viewed each other with hostility 
ceausescu was one of the few socialist leaders to praise the 
chinese leaderships crackdown of the studentled prodemocracy 
movement in june when hundreds perhaps thousands were killed by 
troops in the streets of beijing 
iran said today it recognized the romanian government and tehran 
radio said irans red crescent society was ready to send medical 
aid but it dismissed its ambassador to bucharest for failing to 
inform tehran of growing opposition to ceausescu before the 
romanian leader visited iran last week 
the united states and france said saturday they would not oppose 
soviet bloc intervention to support romanians fighting against 
police units loyal to ceausescu but the soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman said monday the provisional government had not for soviet 
support 
on monday food and medical aid began to flow into the hardhit 
country 
french education minister lionel jospin said on french 
television monday night perhaps one would have wished that 
ceausescu could have been judged and said what he had to say 
naturally we prefer public trials but these are tragic and at the 
same time very hopeful events we are seeing now in romania 
philippine president corazon aquino said the staggeringly 
high number of casualties reported in romania is truly shocking and 
deplorable we join the rest of the world in wishing that country 
and its people the blessings of peace freedom and wellbeing

rescuers today searched through charred 
wreckage at the nations secondlargest petrochemical refinery for 
a worker missing in the aftermath of an explosion and fire that 
killed another man 
separately heating oil futures prices shot higher in early 
trading today in new york on speculation that the damage combined 
with the nations recent recordsetting cold wave would tighten 
already short home heating oil supplies 
they are searching now and theyll search through the night in 
the units where weve gotten clearance to go through exxon 
spokesman travis joslin said monday night weve got to get 
assurance before we send people back into the dangerous areas 
seven people were injured and one contract worker was killed 
when his pickup truck caught fire 100 to 200 feet from the 
christmas eve explosion the blast at the plant on the mississippi 
river in north baton rouge shattered windows up to six miles away 
and ignited a fire that raged 15 hours 
the name of the missing worker was withheld 
coworkers reported seeing the missing man after the explosion 
and officials wouldnt ruled out the possibility he wasnt at the 
plant 
the fire which burned into monday morning engulfed eight 
storage tanks holding more than 4 million gallons of oil and 
lubricants and two separator units which remove water from oil 
the company said 
it was believed to have begun in gas that was somehow released 
but the cause remained under investigation said plant manager ed 
galante 
production was halted at the refinery but exxon officials said 
they did not know whether heating oil shortages would worsen as a 
result 
generally the limit to fuel oil seems to be due to 
transportation problems in bad weather and not supplies said 
spokesman ron embry the refinery has a capacity of more than 19 
million gallons of crude oil a day 
on the new york mercantile exchange the january contract for 
no 2 heating oil jumped 401 cents a gallon to 8575 cents in

messianic jews are not entitled to automatic 
israeli citizenship israels supreme court has ruled concluding 
that their belief in jesus makes them christians instead of jews 
the ruling published in israeli newspapers today was a boost 
to ultraorthodox religious interpretations of the states 1950 law 
of return the law forms the basis of jewish immigration to israel 
the law and its subsequent amendments defines a jew as a person 
born to a jewish mother or who converts to judaism and professes no 
other faith 
orthodox politicians have long sought a more precise definition 
and the courts christmas day ruling has resolved one issue 
the 100page decision said that belief in jesus makes one a 
member of another faith and ineligible for automatic israeli 
citizenship the jerusalem post hadashot and yediot ahronot 
dailies reported 
supreme court spokesman shmaryahu cohen declined on two 
occasions today to show the 100page ruling to the associated press 
or comment on its contents 
according to the newspapers justices menachem elon aharon 
barak and avraham halima acted on an appeal by a south african 
couple gary and shirley beresford who belong to a messianic 
jewish sect 
members of such sects often are referred to as jews for 
jesus 
the beresfords challenged a recent refusal by the interior 
ministry headed by aryeh deri of the ultraorthodox shas party to 
grant them citizenship on grounds they were not jews both 
beresfords were born jewish 
the jewish mainstream rejects the central principle of christian 
faith that jesus was the messiah several small messianic jewish 
sects however do believe in jesus as christ while considering 
their followers as jews 
in their ruling the israeli justices rejected this view 
messianic jews attempt to reverse the wheels of history by 
2000 years elon wrote but the jewish people has decided 
during the 2000 years of its history that messianic jews do not 
belong to the jewish nation and have no right to force 
themselves on it those who believe in jesus are in fact 
christians 
the law in question has been a repeated source of tension 
between secular and religious jews in israel 
the main quarrel is over attempts by religious leaders to amend 
the law to recognize only converts to judaism by orthodox rabbis 
such a change would make it more difficult for many american and 
canadian jews who belong to reform and conservative streams to 
immigrate

the communist party central committee today 
directed mikhail s gorbachev and other top party officials to 
travel to lithuania to try to heal the break with that 
independentminded baltic republics party 
gorbachev on monday bitterly criticized lithuanian communists 
for their declaration of an independent party the first crack in 
the unity forged by vladimir lenin before the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution 
but he also urged caution lithuanian communist leader algirdas 
brazauskas who urged the republics dec 20 break with moscow was 
quoted as telling lithuanian radio that such a visit by kremlin 
officials would be good and useful 
the twoday meeting of the policymaking party central committee 
found it reasonable for soviet communist party general secretary 
mikhail s gorbachev to make a trip to lithuania said an 
announcement by the tass news agency 
gorbachev and other officials will meet with lithuanian party 
officials and members of the public to find out their opinions on 
lithuanias drive for independence 
after a visit by gorbachev and other officials another central 
committee meeting will be held to make a firm decision on the 
dispute with lithuania tass said there was no indication when the 
visits or the next central committee meeting would be 
tass said the central committee also approved gorbachevs 
opening statement to the meeting in which he mixed tough criticism 
of brazauskas and other party officials with calls for restraint 
and reason 
thousands of lithuanians rallied today in vilnius cathedral 
square in support of the split said eduardas potasinskas an 
editor at lithuanian television 
potasinkas also reported on brazauskas comments saying the 
lithuanian leader praised the central committee decision in a radio 
interview shortly after the meeting ended today 
at mondays meeting gorbachev said no part of the soviet 
communist party has the right to decide the question about its 
independent existence with its own program and rules not taking 
into account the position of the soviet communist party as a whole 
and this means that the communist party of lithuania was and 
remains a part of the united soviet communist party said 
gorbachev who is party general secretary as well as the countrys 
president 
tass in a report on the first day of the central committee 
meeting said gorbachev accused the leaders of the lithuanian party 
as having gone over to playing up to nationalist separatist 
forces 
gorbachev tried for several months to head off the split that 
the lithuanian party declared in vilnius and at the congress of 
peoples deputies meeting in moscow on saturday lashed out at 
separatists 
today to realize the right to selfdetermination through 
secession means to blow up the union set the people against each 
other and sow conflict and blood and death gorbachev said at 
that meeting thats what separatists are pushing us toward 
he also told the central committee that the soviet government 
should consider the legal status of public movements that are 
carrying out separatist activities and whipping up nationalist 
terror 
gorbachev did not identify any such organizations but in the 
context of the debate he likely was referring to lithuanias 
sajudis and other organizations pushing for broad sovereignty and 
ultimately complete independence from the soviet union 
nevertheless according to a text of his statement published by 
the communist party daily pravda today he urged maximum 
restraint to allow emotions to calm down

military tribunal and executed christmas day for genocide and 
other crimes they were captured saturday a day after a popular 
uprising forced them from power 
we are people carried away by a very spontaneous process 
iliescu told french television so there was a general demand 
which pushed us to follow this process first of all under the 
pressure of the terrorist groups who wanted to free him 
the new prime minister petre roman told the network the 
tribunal sentenced ceausescu to death because officials had 
information concerning possible attacks on the place where he 
was 
by trying the couple putting them to death swiftly and showing 
the bodies the revolutionary government apparently was trying to 
persuade ceausescus ruthless security troops to surrender to the 
army which joined the people in revolt thousands have been killed 
since the revolt began 11 days ago 
the new government blamed ceausescu for the deaths of 60000 
people the death toll was for the whole of ceausescus 24year

foreign banks

shooting to be heard for the first time in days and according to 
the radio and romanian sources ceausescu loyalist forces were 
surrendering en masse 
power stations factories dairies and bakeries have resumed 
production the official news agency agerpress said this morning

of the new leaders who included dumitru maziliu as vice chairman 
of the governing council

appointing roman prime minister until elections promised for early

executions were announced 
tv footage showed ceausescu being helped out of an armored 
vehicle by a soldier then submitting to a blood pressure test 
unshaven gaunt and visibly tired ceausescu smiled a few times 
for the cameras and once patted the hand of his wife and 
secondincommand who sat forlornly a beige furlined coat pulled 
tight around her and her head swathed in a scarf 
romanians at the intercontinental hotel clustered eagerly around 
a tv set as the footage appeared around 145 am cheering and 
even spitting at the television screen at their hated exrulers 
oh what wonderful news the antichrist died an 
unidentified bucharest radio announcer exulted minutes after the 
announcement was made 
today we removed the most hideous tyrant who soiled with 
blood the history of romania added another unidentified man on 
radio hours later 
word of the execution came three days after the ceausescus fled 
bucharest by helicopter toppled by a popular revolt that began 
dec 15 in the western city of timisoara with unrest that led to a 
massacre of antigovernment protesters by security forces 
word of the execution the first of a communist leader in 
eastern europe since imre nagy was hanged in 1958 for his part in 
the 1956 uprising in hungary came without warning 
today china and iran which had maintained friendly ties with 
ceausescus romania joined other countries including the soviet 
union west germany japan and the united states in recognizing the 
new government romanian ambassadors in at least 27 countries also 
declared their support

mass graves and estimated the total number of dead at 4670 the 
austrian press agency reported quoting finnish journalist marita 
vihervuori as its source 
unconfirmed reports of casualties have run as high as tens of 
thousands but victor ciobanu health minister under ceausescu and 
now in opposition to him said 500 people had died in bucharest 
alone over the past four days with 2000 wounded 
a skittish calm that settled over much of bucharest earlier 
monday was shattered christmas night by a flurry of automatic 
weapons and artillery fire 
heavy explosions boomed near the intercontinental hotel in 
downtown bucharest volleys of sniper fire were answered 
immediately with staccato bursts of automatic weapons that drowned 
out the christmas carols playing for the first time in 42 years on 
romanian radio

road in front of his farm christmas day the driver longtime 
friend william reedy 53 of detroit was charged with driving 
while intoxicted broome county sheriff anthony ruffo said 
neither man was wearing a seat belt reedy told authorities 
its like losing part of my own family said new york 
yankees principal owner george steinbrenner who hired and fired 
martin five times as manager he was one of a kind 
if somebody rubbed wrong against him hell punch ya in the 
nose no sooner than look at him said yogi berra a former 
teammate and a friend for 40 years but he was a great man a 
kindhearted man and he loved baseball 
martin died of a broken neck and spinal cord compression at 
wilson memorial hospital in johnson city after the 545 pm crash 
according to hospital spokesman michael doll 
the truck went off a hairpin curve and came to rest at the 
driveway of martins 148acre farm near binghamton about 150 miles 
northwest of new york city near the pennsylvania line 
ruffo said the hairpin curve has a history of accidents 
people who live out in that area and use that road know its 
there he said today but reedy was from detroit and that could 
have been a factor that he wasnt familiar with the area if youre 
not familiar with it it doesnt take much to end up in the ditch

hardrunning game dubbed billy ball

season marked by his shoving match with slugger reggie jackson in 
bostons fenway park in june 
the next season jackson was suspended five days after ignoring 
martins instruction to bunt 
five days later martin lashed out at jackson and steinbrenner 
saying ones a born liar the others convicted a reference 
to steinbrenners guilty plea to violating federal elections laws 
for a 1972 campaign contribution to president nixon 
martin resigned in tears a day after his statement only five 
days later however steinbrenner announced he would bring martin 
back a promise he fulfilled the next year 
his latest firing was on june 23 1988 but steinbrenner 
retained him as a consultant

nobel prizewinning author samuel beckett who 
created a world of everlasting despair and left theatergoers 
waiting for godot died at age 83 of respiratory failure and 
was buried today his publisher said 
the playwright poet and novelist whose work depicted death and 
decay as mankinds sole and inescapable destiny was buried this 
morning at montparnasse cemetery in a private ceremony said 
publisher jerome linden 
beckett died friday in paris linden said 
jack lang culture minister of france becketts adopted home 
called him an immense writer exceptionally exacting who has 
profoundly marked his century 
the irishborn author of godot and endgame rejected the 
redeeming optimism that might have made him more accessible to a 
mass audience and gained him earlier recognition as one of the 
centurys greatest writers 
his was a stark world peopled with vagabond couples trapped by 
an apocalyptic sense of doom and caught in a neverending 
masterslave dialectic often laced with wry irish humor 
becketts work was a cry of agony and compassion at the hopeless 
misery futility and loneliness of human existence which he called 
a slow death 
that theme reappears in the dozens of plays novels poems and 
short stories he wrote in both french and english during a career 
that spanned more than 50 years 
he was a man of great imagination he was in a sense a quiet 
leader british playwright harold pinter told independent radio 
news he was in the forefront of modern literature he was 
totally original and a man of great courage not only in himself 
but in his work his work knew no bounds really he didnt accept 
any limitations 
critics were scandalized by his experiments on the stage 
breath which premiered in 1970 had no actors no dialogue and 
no action just a heap of gloomily lit garbage cans onstage a 
babys screams and the amplified sound of heavy breathing the play 
lasted just 30 seconds 
until french director roger blin rescued the longpublished but 
never performed waiting for godot from obscurity in 1952 
becketts pessimistic and often difficult style limited his 
audience to an intellectual elite 
the play about two tramps waiting for a third was a huge 
success and brought the author instant world renown it was 
translated into and performed in more than 20 languages and it 
helped beckett win the nobel prize for literature in 1969 
always shy and withdrawn beckett refused to attend the award 
ceremonies in stockholm he sent his publisher instead and fled to 
tunisia to escape the news media the citation described beckett as 
a pioneer of a new modesty of expression in fiction and the 
theater whose writing rises like a cry for mercy from all 
mankind 
beckett was secretive about his private life he granted only 
rare interviews and was one of the few writers to refuse to appear 
on apostrophes frances most popular book review television 
show 
even the date of becketts birth was wrapped in mystery he said 
he was born in dublin on good friday april 13 1906 but his 
biographer deirdre bair suggested he was really born a month 
earlier with beckett shifting it to the anniversary of the 
crucifixion as a symbolic boost to his selfmade legend 
the son of a surveyor beckett enjoyed a comfortable 
uppermiddle class protestant upbringing though he said he had a 
happy childhood he once admitted to always feeling lonely 
he studied modern languages at trinity college dublin and 
first came to paris in 1928 to lecture in engish at the prestigious 
ecole normale superieure 
in paris he met another irish exile james joyce who was to 
have a profound influence on his future writing joyce had a 
moral effect on me beckett said later he made me realize the 
meaning of artistic integrity 
after becketts father william france beckett died in dublin 
in 1933 his mother urged beckett to drop his literary ambitions 
and take up some serious profession 
to escape her and the middleclass atmosphere of his family 
beckett settled permanently in paris in 1937 
becketts move came at a time when international tension was 
mounting but he said i preferred france at war to ireland at 
peace 
in 1938 beckett was stabbed in a paris street brawl a deep 
knife wound pierced his lung and narrowly missed his heart a 
pianist passing by on her bicycle stopped to help the gravely 
injured man and have him taken to hospital 
the girl suzanne deschevauxdumesnil though six years his 
senior became his lifelong companion and they finally married in 
secret in 1961 
ms deschevauxdumesnil died july 17 in paris at the age of 89 
the couple had no children 
during world war ii the couple worked with the underground 
resistance movement in nazioccupied france and beckett was awarded 
the croix de guerre with a gold star in 1945 
beckett who all his life shunned politics later said he joined 
the resistance not to help france win the war but to fight the 
germans who were making life hell for my friends 
indeed despite his rejection of the limelight beckett was a 
loving and loyal friend he would spend hours in left bank cafes 
listening to his painter friends including hollands van velde 
brothers the english painter jack b yeats william butler yeats 
brother and alberto giacometti talk about their work 
he also met frances leading surrealist writers and eventually 
translated several poems of paul eluard and andre breton 
beckett was not just a serious intellectual and he was known as 
the man who preferred referring a newspapers sports pages to 
reviews of his own plays 
beckett attributed his success to an intuitive sense of 
despair rather than to talent 
he once described himself as doomed to spend the rest of my 
days digging up the detritus of my life and vomiting it out over 
and over again 
optimism is not my way i shall always be depressed but what 
comforts me is the realization that i can now accept this dark side 
as the commanding side of my personality he said 
in later plays written in french and first performed on the 
paris stage beckett developed his theme of mans losing battle 
against destiny in endgame a blind paralytic laments his fate 
while his senile and crippled parents die of despair in garbage 
cans 
there are no landmarks in my work he said we are all 
adrift we must invent a world in which to survive but even this 
invented world is pervaded by fear and guilt our existence is 
hopeless

lebanon in more than a year the later air raid was israels 17th 
such strike in lebanon this year at least 18 people were killed 
and 109 wounded in the previous 16 air raids 
in beirut police said army sappers defused a car packed with 
165 pounds of explosives near prime minister salim hoss office

misdemeanor riot convictions against three 
teenagers in connection with the howard beach racial attack in 
which a black man was killed have been overturned on appeal 
the threepage decision by a panel of brooklyn appellate 
division judges on the three defendants convicted in 1988 was 
handed down dec 11 and reported in todays new york post 
three other youths were convicted in a separate trial of 
manslaughter and assault in the fatal racial attack 
the case involved an attack on dec 20 1986 by a group of 
white males on several blacks one of whom michael griffith was 
chased onto a busy highway where he was hit by a car and killed 
the defendants william bollander thomas farino and james 
povinelli were sentenced in september 1988 to 34 days in jail to 
be served on weekends over a fourmonth period they were acquitted 
of a more serious felony riot charge 
under the ruling the indictments and convictions of the three 
are thrown out prosecutors can resubmit the case to a grand jury 
or drop the charges 
a lawyer for the three defendants spiros a tsimbinos said 
today he had not yet seen the ruling 
the appellate judges reversed the conviction because of errors 
in the verdict sheets provided to the jury and because the trial 
judge justice thomas demakos failed to give the panel the option 
of finding the three guilty of disorderly conduct which carries a 
maximum sentence of 15 days

police stormed a cell block controlled 
by drug traffickers holding 18 hostages and six traffickers were 
killed and five hostages wounded authorities said today 
police late monday gained the release of all of the hostages 
including two children and the situation at the la picota jail in 
southern bogota had returned to normal a justice department 
spokesman said 
the spokesman asked not to be identified so he would not become 
the target of revenge by any of the prisoners involved 
the rescue came after two days of fruitless negotiations with 
the prisoners who had taken the hostages after a failed jailbreak 
sunday 
the prisoners subdued guards during visiting hours at the jail 
and were putting on their uniforms in an attempt to escape 
bogotas el tiempo newspaper reported today 
the paper quoting prison sources said authorities discovered 
the plan and sealed off the cell block before the prisoners all 
held on drug trafficking charges could flee 
the trapped criminals then took hostages including some 
civilians who had been visiting their jailed family members and 
made a series of protests and demands el tiempo reported 
the paper said the prisoners began by protesting the death of 
gonzalo rodriguez gacha the trafficker of the medellin cartel who 
was killed dec 15 in a gunfight with police on colombias northern 
coast 
the prisoners said they would release the hostages only if the 
administration of president virgilio barco agreed to end its 
extradition of drug traffickers to the united states el tiempo 
said 
the administration has extradited 11 drug suspects since august 
when it decreed the policy 
the prisoners also demanded a meeting with the colombian justice 
minister roberto salazar and other officials they said that they 
wanted to be transferred to another less crowded jail el tiempo 
reported 
the justice ministry official reached by telephone said he could 
not confirm the details of the takeover

its 959 pm on new years eve in little rock ark at a 
downtown bar the revelers are already chanting the countdown 
four three two one its closing time 
new years eve or not when its sunday in arkansas the bar 
closes at 10 
most states have some sort of law restricting liquor sales on 
sundays so when new years eve falls on a sunday as it does this 
year its a lessthanfestive holiday for those who make a living 
selling alcohol 
i think it will hurt the industry said ray brezzo who owns 
a liquor store in glastonbury conn were very very 
pessimistic 
in connecticut as in many states in the northeast bars and 
restaurants can serve alcohol on sundays but liquor stores cannot 
for new years eve brezzo is hoping his customers will buy what 
they need on saturday but hes far from confident 
nobody knows what to expect he said everybodys sort of 
sitting on the edge of their seat 
liquor stores in new york city are posting signs to remind their 
customers to buy early in grand forks nd happy harrys bottle 
shop is taking out newspaper advertisements with a similar reminder 
still owner hal gershman said no matter how much advertising 
you do and how much you try to tell people there are still 60 
percent of the people who dont pay attention and will show up at 
the last minute 
although north dakota has among the nations toughest blue laws 
the legislature did agree this year to allow bars and taverns to 
apply for special sunday permits 
but some communities such as minot opted against issuing the 
permits much to the dismay of bar owners 
were put in an unfair disadvantage to the other major 
cities complained jim mellow manager of the international inn 
in minot which caters to canadian tourists the people i have 
talked to are bypassing minot and heading to bismark or williston 
in alabama where restaurants and nightclubs cant sell alcohol 
between 2 am and midnight sunday some places will hold parties 
the night before others will start their festivities at midnight 
as in several other southern states private clubs are exempted 
from the law 
chris fuller general manager of american pie a 2monthold 
montgomery nightclub without a private license said hed throw a 
bash on saturday night 
but its just not going to have the same whizbang as new 
years eve he said obviously its a big loss a 
daybeforenew years eve party that sounds pretty goofy 
some states such as pennsylvania specifically exempt new 
years eve from blue laws in baltimore county md liquor store 
owners successfully sued this year to open arguing that a 
convoluted liquor law was intended to exempt new years eve from 
sunday restrictions but unintentionally had the opposite effect 
were real happy the customers are happy said craig 
button president of the baltimore county licensed beverage 
association after a judge ruled that the stores could open its 
the second biggest day of the year for us after christmas eve it 
would have cost us a lot of money 
in south carolina the executive director of the state hotel and 
motel association said she feared that restrictions on public 
venues selling liquor on sundays would lead to an increase in 
drunken driving 
what happens is so many people might have spent the night 
in the hotel rather than drinking and partying and driving on the 
road said susan young the associations executive director 
others noted that south carolinas blue laws send some people 
over the border into lessrestrictive north carolina to drink 
not all liquor sellers are upset about being forced to close 
robert mcintyre the owner of old town liquor in englewood colo 
said he was quite content to spend this new years eve in the quiet 
of his own home 
mcintyre said he wasnt worrying about any loss in business 
its just going to be nicer for me he said

business executives bank officers attorneys real 
estate brokers and even car dealers have been drafted into the war 
on drugs whether they like it or not 
armed with stiff new regulations passed under the bank secrecy 
act of 1988 the irs and other federal agencies are forcing 
businesses and financial institutions to help track the estimated 
220 million in profits generated daily by illegal drug sales in 
this country 
all that cash does no good stored in boxes they have to turn 
it around that necessarily involves legitimate businesses said 
miami lawyer charles intriago who has started a publication that 
promises to make sense of the regulatory maze and keep subscribers 
on the right side of the law 
the government has conscripted the entire business community 
and required them to submit their paper trails intriago said 
its saying ok youre in the war now play by the rules or 
face severe penalties 
money laundering alert is an eightpage monthly newsletter of 
advice statistics and reports on what criminals do to hide the 
source of their money and what government is doing to uncover their 
schemes 
as trade journals go alert has a sizeable niche says intriago 
a former chief counsel for the house committee that oversees all 
banking regulatory agencies he also has prosecuted whitecollar 
criminals and drug traffickers as an assistant us attorney in 
miami 
amid growing calls for the legalization of drugs and evidence 
that interdiction efforts have failed to reduce the cocaine flowing 
into this country money laundering controls have become the 
governments weapon of choice intriago said 
the money laundering initiative has a higher probability of 
success than the others such as interdiction it hits the profit 
motive he said 
enlisting the help of banks and other often unwitting 
handmaidens to drug traffickers has already yielded impressive 
results 
days before billionaire medellin cartel enforcer gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha was gunned down in colombia on dec 15 us and 
swiss officials traced his profits and were able to freeze 618 
million of his assets in several countries 
under money laundering laws banks are required to report large 
cash transactions soon the treasury department could also force 
banks to put names and addresses on the estimated 125 trillion 
transferred daily around the world on telephone lines details of 
that initiative are laid out in alerts november issue 
these new money laundering laws are still in their infancy and 
many have yet to be enforced many otherwise lawabiding businesses 
may be unaware of the penalties they face intriago said 
alert costs 295 a year but intriago notes that the treasury 
department can now impose 500 fines for every negligent error a 
bank teller makes on one of the required forms 
tell me these institutions wouldnt like to receive a 
publication that could spare them thousands of dollars in fines to 
say nothing of the bad publicity intriago said 
with the fourth issue going to press alert has more than 200 
subscribers ranging from banks thrifts and credit unions to 
lawyers and accountants foreign governments and diplomatic offices 
intriago doesnt mention drug kingpins on his list and he 
bristles at the suggestion that his newsletter could be as useful 
to criminals as to lawabiding citizens 
we dont do criminal background checks on our subscribers nor 
does the wall street journal he said a number of criminal 
defense attorneys have subscriptions however 
one of those attorneys sits on the newsletters editorial board 
as well neal sonnett of miami who represented panamanian gen 
manuel antonio noriega when he was indicted on drug trafficking 
charges in florida 
hes a very respected attorney intriago said no matter 
what his clientele is

an unsigned poster mocking deposed romanian 
leader nicolae ceausescu and chinas hardline leaders went up at 
beijing university birthplace of chinas spring democracy 
movement a source confirmed tuesday 
lost dog read the poster which was put up over the weekend 
after ceausescus flight from his palace in bucharest and before 
his arrest and execution 
it said the dog named ceausescu might be coming to china to 
join four other dogs a reference to chinas senior leader deng 
xiaoping premier li peng president yang shangkun and communist 
party chief jiang zemin 
the poster which authorities swiftly took down violated 
martial law regulations in force since may when beijing university 
students led massive protests for democratic reform in china deng 
ordered the army into beijing in june to crush the protests 
leaving hundreds and possibly thousands dead 
it was the third illegal big character poster in beijing 
this month according to chinese and western sources one urging 
students to remember those killed in june went up at the central 
drama academy in early december and another appeared briefly 
inside the residential compound of the peoples daily the 
communist party newspaper 
that poster read down with the illegal li peng government 
at a dec 8 dance students at the drama school also played 
songs about the june crackdown from a usrecorded album titled 
china 1989 the sources said 
no arrests have been reported in connection with any of the 
incidents however at least six and possibly eight people were 
arrested dec 9 when students from the beijing college of 
aeronautics unfurled a banner reading motherland why are you so 
poor 
the incidents indicate that anger over junes events has not 
subsided despite intense political education and a scaling down of 
the troop presence in beijing 
if anything tensions have increased as authorities have 
increased controls among other measures students say the 
government appears to be closing the door slowly on study abroad 
for all except statesponsored students by making it impossible for 
other students to take the necessary tests or obtain college 
transcripts 
in this atmosphere news of the democratic changes in east 
europe has been greeted with pleasure but also bitterness by some 
chinese students that their movement did not also succeed 
romanias uprising has aroused the greatest excitement because it 
was the only other country where hardline communist leaders 
resorted to violence 
at one college some students held a party to celebrate 
ceausescus ouster 
the official news media has carried only sparse reports on the 
uprising and omitted any explanation of its cause 
at least one hotel in beijing stopped selling foreign newspapers 
late last week after the uprising began apparently because of 
their reports from romania but hotels were not stopped from 
showing satellite transmissions of foreign tv networks such as 
cable news network 
chinese workers at one hotel clustered silently around a tv set 
tuesday as cnn showed the bodies of ceausescu and his wife after 
their execution 
north korea will be next that is my prediction said one 
chinese intellectual who was gleeful over ceausescus downfall 
but he did not believe china would follow in the dominolike 
toppling of hardline leaders 
china is too big and poor he said a widespread sentiment 
others speculated it would only make chinese leaders more 
convinced of the correctness of their june crackdown and the need 
for tighter surveillance

us troops at the cuban embassy and the 
ambassadors residence in panama city are refusing cuban diplomats 
the right to leave or enter either location and are engaging in 
threatening military activities a cuban official said today 
in response the state department said us forces do not 
intend to prevent normal diplomatic activity by cuban personnel 
charges to the contrary are not true the department said us 
troops are stationed around the cuban embassy and several other 
places in panama for security reasons 
the statement did not address the specific question of access to 
the cuban missions or the cuban claim that the troops were engaged 
in threatening activities 
angel pino spokesman for the cuban diplomatic mission here 
said the situation is particularly serious at the ambassadors 
residence where the cuban diplomats and their families have been 
staying since the us invasion last week 
supplies of food and medicine are running low and the sense of 
unease among those at the residence has been aggravated by 
overflights of us warplanes and helicopers he said 
the situation is becoming grave pino said adding that any 
incident could provoke unforeseeable consequences he said his 
government has protested insistently to american authorities 
he had no estimate of the number of cubans at the residence 
in a telephone interview pino said the cuban government was 
informed by us officials in washington and havana over the 
weekend that the situation would be resolved shortly but there was 
no change as of late morning today pino said 
a state department official said he had no information that 
cubans in panama were being denied the right to enter or leave the 
embassy grounds 
he said a cuban diplomat in panama reportedly told a cuban radio 
station on saturday that access to and from the residence was not a 
problem but pino said us troops began blocking access both ways 
that same afternoon 
the state department official asking not to be identified said 
the troops outside the residence and the chancery are providing 
security at those locations 
but pino said cuban diplomats were told by a us military 
officer in charge outside the residence that his instructions were 
to prevent anybody from leaving or entering the embassy 
he identified the us officer only as major acksun 
initially us officials had been concerned that panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega might try to seek refuge in either the cuban 
or nicaraguan embassies in panama city the installations of both 
countries were surrounded late last week prompting the nicaraguan 
government to dispatch two tanks to the american embassy in managua 
noriega turned himself in to the vatican embassy in panama city 
sunday afternoon pino said the us troop presence at the cuban 
ambassadors residence has been reinforced since then

andrei d sakharov in the speech he was writing 
when he died said legislation allowing prosecutors to prolong 
maximum pretrial detention threatened society with a return to 
stalinist times a report said 
the respected weekly literaturnaya gazeta in its dec 27 
editions published a text of the speech that it said the nobel 
peace prize winner was working on when he collapsed and died in his 
study dec 14 
other soviet publications have said a text of the final speech 
of sakharov was circulated last weekend at the congress of peoples 
deputies where sakharov would have given the speech but they have 
not published it 
literaturnaya gazeta did not say how it obtained the text 
sakharov said that by trying to lengthen the amount of time 
soviets can be held before trial the procurator generals office 
was trying to free its hands entirely and return the country to 
the stormy times of illegality of the cult of personality 
stagnation and other rather gloomy periods 
the cult of personality is a reference to the rule of josef 
stalin during which prosecutors unencumbered by legal tradition or 
judicial oversight had all of stalins potential opponents and many 
other soviets imprisoned or killed 
the maximum length of time a suspect may be held has been nine 
months after which only the presidium of the supreme soviet could 
prolong detention 
the new law allows the deputy procurator general to extend such 
detention to one year and for the countrys top prosecutor to 
extend it to 18 months 
for decades prisoners in the soviet union have had no access to 
a lawyer during most of their pretrial detention 
soviet practice has been to allow the presence of a defense 
lawyer to prepare for trial only after the prosecutor has finished 
questioning the suspect and building his case 
this will not improve the results of the war with crime but 
only make our already sick society more cruel sakharovs text 
said the whole country will justly see a new lie in the new 
law 
sakharov cited the laws of many western countries limiting the 
amount of time suspects can be held without trial 
he criticized vice president anatoly i lukyanov for what he 
said were irregularities in conducting the supreme soviet 
legislative session nov 28 at which the new law was approved 
sakharov 68 was elected to the congress of peoples deputies 
in march and during the congress session earlier on dec 14 had 
spoken out in favor of declaring a group of reformminded deputies 
a political opposition to the communist party and government

the vatican likely will allow gen manuel 
antonio noriega to go into exile in another country rather than 
turn him over to the united states to face drug trafficking 
charges sources said tuesday 
vatican and us diplomats were at work tuesday to resolve the 
diplomatic stalemate involving noriega who took refuge in the 
vatican embassy in panama city on sunday after four days of eluding 
american invasion troops 
an embassy spokesman said the us ambassador to the holy see 
thomas p melady has been discussing the case with highranking 
vatican officials but gave no details 
the vaticans deputy spokesman monsignor piero pennacchini 
said contacts were under way between the concerned parties 
including the newly installed panamian government the united 
states and the vatican 
its very delicate situation pennacchini said it has to 
be treated with much discretion to find the best solution for all 
of the parties 
a state department source in washington said monday the united 
states had demanded in extraordinarily tough terms that the 
vatican turn noriega over to us custody for trial on drug charges 
but church authorities had rebuffed the request and were trying 
so far unsuccessfully to find another country to take noriega the 
washington official said 
we want him alive to stand trial in the united states the 
us embassy spokesman in panama city terrence kneebone said 
we see this as a criminal matter this is not a case of 
poltitical or religious persecution 
but a rome diplomatic source who is close to those involved in 
negotiations on tuesday said the possibility of the vatican 
handing over noriega to us authorities was very dim and he 
would more likely go to another country 
spain cuba and the dominican republic have been mentioned as 
possible refuges 
a senior vatican official who is not directly involved in the 
case but follows foreign policy issues said no rules of any 
kind would permit the vatican to turn over noriega to us 
invasion forces 
they could only hand him over to the country where hes held 
or arrange safe passage to another country said the official 
adding that exile in a third country was the more likely solution 
of the two 
he noted that the issue of granting asylum for noriega is not 
new 
noriegas representatives had negotiated with the united states 
in the past and again this year about the possibility of stepping 
down and taking up exile in another country 
the official also wondered how eager washington is to bring 
noriega to the united states for trial referring to published 
reports that he might reveal embarrassing details of former links 
with the cia 
on monday chief vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said i 
dont think so when asked if the vatican would simply turn over 
noriega to the americans noting the holy see does not have an 
extradition treaty with the united states 
there were reports from washington and panama that the vatican 
was having trouble finding another country to accept noriega 
spanish newspapers tuesday quoted the spanish ambassador in 
panama tomas lozano escribano as saying spain has formally denied 
noriega political asylum foreign minister francisco fernandez 
ordonez told the national news agency efe on monday that spain was 
not the ideal country for noriega because of its extradition treaty 
with the united states 
sources indicated it was likely a deal was struck between 
noriega and the vatican ebassy before he took refuge there under 
this scenario noriega sought guarantees that he would not be 
turned over to the americans while the vatican demanded that he 
renounce the conflict in panama 
in fact navarro said noriega sought refuge at the vatican 
mission after having expressed his will to end the conflict 
the spokesman indicated the vatican knew of noriegas position 
before he showed up at the embassy 
analysts noted that it was unlikely noriega would have gone to 
the embassy if there was any chance he would be turned over the 
americans 
the vatican stressed that noriegas move marked an opportunity 
to bring peace to panama 
the legal aspect is certainly interesting navarro said on 
monday but more important is the announcement that now with his 
noriegas declared intention to contribute to the pacification of 
the whole country one can bring an end to the violence

a panamanian officer accused of helping deposed 
dictator manuel antonio noriega smuggle cocaine for the medellin 
cartel was jailed in florida today after surrendering in panama 
the justice department said 
lt col luis del cid who commanded a panama defense forces 
unit in the province of chiriqui was placed in the custody of us 
drug enforcement administration agents after he surrendered 
saturday said deborah burstionwade an agency spokeswoman in 
washington 
he was flown to the united states under tight security monday 
and held at the federal metropolitan correctional center south of 
miami ms burstionwade said 
del cid pleaded innocent to drugrelated charges today before 
us district judge william hoeveler and was ordered held without 
bond pending a jan 2 hearing 
del cid 46 repeated his claim that he turned himself in to 
fight the charges i surrender myself i wanted to be brought 
here he told the judge through a translator 
frank rubino one of noriegas attorneys said he came to the 
court session today to monitor the situation and arrange to speak 
with del cid who is now represented by a public defender rubino 
said he does not think he will defend del cid 
we are confident that we have the evidence to convict him 
us attorney dexter lehtenin said at a news conference this 
morning before heading to del cids first court appearance 
lehtenin described del cid as one of noriegas righthand men 
and said he was the ousted panamanian leaders liaison courier and 
emissary in drug trafficking deals with colombian drug lords 
del cid was one of 15 noriega associates named in an indictment 
unsealed feb 5 1988 by a federal grand jury in miami he was 
wanted on four counts related to cocaine possession and laundering 
drug profits the spokeswoman said 
according to the indictment del cid acted as a liaison and 
money courier between colombias medellin cartel and noriega the 
indictment accused noriega of accepting a 46 million bribe from 
the organization to protect shipments of cocaine launder money 
supply drug laboratories and shield drug traffickers from the law 
a federal grand jury in tampa indicted noriega on charges of 
taking a separate 54 million bribe from the colombia drug cartel 
if convicted on all counts del cid could be sentenced to 70 
years in prison and fined 550000 according to lehtinens office 
after del cids surrender he declared loyalty to the government 
of guillermo endara installed as president last week after us 
troops invaded panama to remove noriega from power 
he remained in custody in the central american country until dea 
agents escorted him to miami 
normally he would have been flown in by us marshals but 
this was not an ordinary case ms burstionwade said 
the justice department has said that if noriega is brought to 
the united states he would be tried first in miami because the 
prosecutors case there was stronger than in tampa

temperatures rose and snow melted tuesday in the south but 
thousands of people had no water or little pressure because of 
pipes cracked by the record cold wave 
temperatures stayed below the freezing point overnight 
throughout much of the south but were expected to reach the 60s in 
the carolinas by the end of the week the national weather service 
said 
airlines resumed normal schedules tuesday at charleston sc 
after reducing flights because of snow which piled up 15 inches 
deep in places along the coast sunday the myrtle beach jetport 
closed for a third straight day monday was able to operate only 
during daylight because runway lights were covered by snow said 
todd crawford deputy airport director 
at least 96 deaths from the plains to the east coast had been 
blamed on the cold since dec 15 
the worst of the water problems was at jackson miss where an 
estimated 60000 homes and businesses were without water or had 
greatly reduced pressure frozen pipes had cracked but the biggest 
problem was that the pearl river had frozen around intakes for the 
municipal water system 
jacksons city government closed tuesday because of the water 
problem and several businesses that normally use a lot of water 
agreed to close tuesday or reduce operations mayor kane ditto said 
that with luck water could restored to all areas by late wednesday

samuel beckett the shy irishborn author whose 
despairing vision of the world in waiting for godot symbolized 
the pessimistic strain in modern writing has died in paris his 
adopted home he was 83 
the poet playwright and novelist died friday but the death was 
not announced until after a small private funeral service tuesday 
his publisher jerome linden said beckett died of respiratory 
failure 
the model of an artist who makes no compromise for the sake of 
popularity the nobel prizewinning writer attributed his success 
to an intuitive sense of despair 
there are no landmarks in my work beckett once said we 
are all adrift we must invent a world in which to survive but 
even this invented world is pervaded by fear and guilt our 
existence is hopeless 
after the announcement of his death several mourners gathered 
amid the neogothic mausoleums of montparnasse cemetery to place 
flowers on his simple granite marker 
i admired him very much said a french philosophy student 
who lit a candle at the graveside but refused to give his name 
ive read most of his works and found them very moving i cannot 
believe hes dead 
at first becketts audience was limited to an intellectual 
elite but the reclusive writer and his plays especially waiting 
for godot came to be emblematic of a difficult modern style of 
literature even for people who never read or saw the works 
he was in the forefront of modern literature british 
playwright harold pinter said tuesday he was totally original 
and a man of great courage not only in himself but in his work 
his work knew no bounds 
jack lang frances culture minister called beckett an 
immense writer exceptionally exacting who has profoundly marked 
his century 
beckett lived in paris since 1937 working with the resistance 
in nazioccupied france during world war ii for which he won the 
croix de guerre with a gold star in 1945 he once said he preferred 
france in war to ireland in peace 
he wrote some of his some works in french and some in english 
translating them himself into the other language 
becketts last published work was an 1801word novella in march 
called stirrings still a meditation on old age only 200 
copies were published and sold for 1720 each 
becketts world echoed with cries of agony and compassion at the 
futility and loneliness of human existence peopled with vagabond 
couples caught in a neverending masterslave dialogue 
critic jd ohara once called beckett one of those artists 
for whom the miseries of the world are misery 
the miseries first caught an audiences eye in 1952 when french 
director roger blin rescued from obscurity becketts twoact fable 
about two tramps waiting for a third godot 
their grim jokes are interrupted by a brutal fat man driving a 
slave with a heavy burden the fat man later returns blinded and 
moves on the tramps end the play still waiting for godot 
the play was translated and performed in more than 20 languages 
when it was staged last year at new yorks lincoln center with 
robin williams and steve martin as the two tramps it sold out 
the stunning triumph of the 1952 production focused attention on 
becketts earlier works with their recurring theme of the 
despairing vagabond 
later plays developed becketts themes of mans losing battle 
against destiny 
in endgame a blind paralytic laments his fate while his 
senile and crippled parents die of despair in garbage cans 
in krapps last tape first performed in 1969 a nearly 
blind old man plays back a 30yearold tape of his own voice and 
realizes he no longer understands the words he used in his youth 
beyond hope or ambition he remains interested only in trivial 
reminders of his sex life and other bodily functions 
beckett won the nobel prize for literature in 1969 always 
secretive about his personal life he refused to attend the award 
ceremonies in stockholm fleeing to tunisia to avoid attention 
even the date of becketts birth was wrapped in mystery he said 
he was born in dublin on good friday april 13 1906 but his 
biographer deirdre bair suggested he was really born a month 
earlier with beckett shifting it to the anniversary of the 
crucifixion as a boost to his selfmade legend 
the son of a surveyor beckett was brought up in a comfortable 
uppermiddle class protestant household 
he studied modern languages at trinity college dublin and 
first came to paris in 1928 to lecture in english at the 
prestigious ecole normale superieure 
in paris he met another irish exile james joyce joyce had a 
moral effect on me beckett said later he made me realize the 
meaning of artistic integrity 
after becketts father william beckett died in dublin in 1933 
his mother urged beckett to drop literature and take up a serious 
profession 
to escape her and her family beckett settled permanently in 
paris in 1937 
in 1938 beckett was stabbed in a paris street brawl a woman 
passing by on her bicycle stopped to help the gravely injured man 
and have him taken to a hospital 
that woman suzanne deschevauxdumesnil became his lifelong 
companion and they finally married in 1961 she died in july the 
couple had no children

lights and decorations brighten the city on 
both sides of the berlin wall during the christmas season but dark 
humor holds sway in the streets of the stilldivided city 
for decades jokes poking fun at the oncemighty communist 
regime remained among family and friends in east berlin but biting 
humor surfaced openly this fall with the decline of the communists 
and the secret police 
most of the jokes floating across the nowporous borders focus 
on ousted east german leader erich honecker and the corrupt 
communist party he once headed as well as the rotten economic 
situation he left behind 
a favorite joke concerns the future of the east german flag with 
the familiar compass and sickle emblem embroidered on the 
orangeandblack national colors an unadorned version serves as 
the west german flag 
what is the new emblem for the flag goes the question a 
suitcase is the answer a reference to the more than 320000 
east germans who have left for west germany in search of a better 
life this year alone 
although honecker who is reportedly seriously ill was stripped 
of power on oct 18 and has been in seclusion ever since 
variations of jokes about him are told over and over in bars 
stores and taxis 
why has honecker checked into a hotel on the hungarian 
border asks one east german because all the best doctors pass 
by there replies another 
other jokes concern the east german communist party which has 
lost some 700000 members since the political trouble began earlier 
this year 
what does a party member who finds one new party member get 
went a joke that circulated during a recent party congress that 
swept away remnants of the old guard he gets to leave the 
party 
what does a party member who enrolls 10 new members get the 
joke continues a certificate that he was never a party member 
goes the reply 
a few of the jokes are simply unquotable i know a lot of 
jokes but you could never print them and this isnt the right 
place to tell them said an east german border guard at the 
famous checkpoint charlie crossing point 
not all of the humor is aimed at east germany west german 
chancellor helmut kohl a target of sometimes vicious jokes in his 
homeland has found similar treatment in east germany

william c mclucas a senior lawyer at the 
securities and exchange commission was named today as the new head 
of enforcement of the sec 
sec chairman richard breeden in his first major decision since 
taking over as head of the sec in october made the announcement of 
mclucas appointment at a news conference 
the nomination of an enforcement director does not require 
senate confirmation but it is considered the secondmost powerful 
position at the agency because it is the enforcement division which 
has the job of policing the multibilliondollar securities industry 
mclucas a senior sec enforcement lawyer had been considered a 
top contender to get the nod to succeed gary lynch who announced 
he was stepping down last may after serving for four years as the 
head of enforcement 
lynch received widespread praise for the job he did in breaking 
open a series of big insider trading cases beginning with the 
exposure of stockbroker dennis levine continuing through a 100 
million settlement with speculator ivan boesky and culminating with 
the settlement of a massive civil fraud case with junk bondgiant 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
lynch took over the enforcement division at a time of turmoil 
for the sec after his predecessor john fedders stepped down amid 
allegations that he beat his wife 
lynch was credited with restoring morale at the agency and 
spearheading a series of major investigations 
in may 1986 the sec filed charges against levine whose 
cooperation led to boesky who in turn implicated drexel burnham in 
the largest securities fraud case ever brought by the government 
the scandals in recent years have forced wall streets big 
brokerage houses to reevaluate their compliance and ethics codes 
and led congress to increase the penalties for insider trading

the bush administration announced its 
intention today to seize millions of dollars in assets that deposed 
dictator manuel antonio noriega allegedly shipped out of panama 
while it continued diplomatic efforts to bring him to trial in the 
united states on drug charges 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the assets are 
all liquid and are primarily in bank accounts in half a dozen 
countries many of them in europe they amount to in excess of 
10 million he said 
he refused to name the countries where noriega placed his money 
which the spokesman referred to as illegal drug money 
noriega touched off a behindthescenes diplomatic struggle on 
sunday when he presented himself at the vatican embassy in panama 
city and asked for asylum us troops have surrounded the facility 
president bush remained at his camp david retreat while an aide 
said he was monitoring the situation closely bush sent roughly 
14000 troops to panama a week ago in an effort to restore 
democracy there and apprehend noriega 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters today the 
administration has told the vatican very directly of its desire 
to noriega returned to the united states to stand trial 
at the same time fitzwater declined to rule out the possibility 
that some other option might be under consideration in the 
international negotiations that began over the weekend when noriega 
turned up at the vatican embassy in panana city requesting asylum 
sources have said the discussions have included sending noriega to 
a third country 
runkel told reporters that noriega has 10 associate thugs in 
the papal nunciature with him runkel said he did not know their 
names 
our position is we mean to bring him back to the united 
states fitzwater said 
he said this was the primary goal although he would not rule 
out the possiblity that some other option might be under 
consideration the vatican has ruled out simply turning noriega 
over to the united states according to a spokesman who noted that 
the holy see does not have an extradition treaty with the united 
states 
fitzwater said ustroops would continue to ring the vatican 
embassy as long as hes there 
although bush has not directly communicated with pope john paul 
ii on the subject or with other vatican officials we told them 
very directly what our feelings were fitzwater said 
the spokesman said that the united states had offered noriega 
wanted in florida on drug trafficking charges a deal as recently 
as october in exchange for his stepping down from power 
voluntarily but he did not accept it and now such deals are off 
fitzwater said 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said today that when noriega 
turned himself in at the vatican embassy he was said to be so 
exhausted from the chase that he could barely speak he said 
noriega had been on the run since the us operations began on 
tuesday and that he was never in command of the panamanian defense 
forces resisting us soldiers 
williams also said the panama canal was now open 24 hours and 
panama citys two major airports torrijos and tocumen are open 
during limited hours 
its much quieter in panama city than it has been since the 
operation began williams said 
he said some u s troops remained in city streets and others 
were moving west to check the countryside he said they were 
meeting very little resistance with citizens turning in their 
weapons to us soldiers 
the spokesman said about 33000 weapons have been captured 
discovered or turned in including 6000 under a program which 
offers rewards to former pdf members who give up their arms 
earlier an administration source said that the united states 
was talking in extraordinarily tough terms in its bid to 
convince the vatican to turn over noriega 
defense secretary dick cheney just back from a christmas day 
visit with the 26000 troops in panama said today he hoped a 
quieting situation will allow the united states to speed up the 
withdrawal of some american forces but in an interview with abc 
news he did not provide a timetable for troop movements 
papal representatives have contacted several latin american and 
european countries in hopes one will agree to accept noriega said 
the us official he described the situation as a mexican 
standoff 
he has no place to go yet the official said nobody wants 
him 
the white house disputed an account in todays editions of the 
washington post that bush had talked by telephone monday with the 
papal nuncio in panama monsignor sebastian laboa popadiuk said 
bush engaged in no such conversation 
the post also said cuba indicated it would be willing to give 
political asylum to noriega 
spain cuba and the dominican republic were mentioned in the 
past as possible exile sites when noriegas representatives were 
negotiating with the united states in 1988 and again this year 
about the possibility of noriega stepping down 
but spain might not be acceptable to noriega because it has an 
extradition treaty with the united states and cuba might not be 
palatable to the united states because that country would reject 
any us request for noriega to be turned over to us custody 
the state department official said most of the discussions have 
been carried out between the state department and church officials 
at the vatican

musician neil young is taking the bitter with 
the sweet his recent album freedom has been critically 
acclaimed but isnt getting much radio play time to display its 
creative wares 
freedom recently hit a modest no 35 on the billboard 
charts even though music critics have praised it lavishly young 
says he fails to get radio play time because he has dared to be 
experimental with his work during the past decade and because he 
often gets boxed in as a classic rock artist on tightly 
formatted radio stations 
if something doesnt fit a stations image or sound then it 
doesnt get played young said in a recent interview and there 
are certain stations that wont play me regardless of what the 
record is like they dont want to play music that their parents 
listened to because it doesnt fit their image 
pop music critics have hailed freedom as the most accessible 
and interesting work young has done since such hit records as 
1970s after the gold rush and 1972s harvest

timothy curry took his first name from 
an old newspaper his last from some writing he spotted on the wall 
of a soup kitchen 
curry cant recall his real name or where he came from indeed 
he cant remember anything from before january 1988 
he said thats when he woke up in a boston bus station his mind 
a total blank 
i feel like a lunatic sometimes because i dont know who i am 
i have no identity the only thing i know is how to live on the 
street said curry who appears to be in his 20s 
susan grislis director of the rhode island affiliate of 
literacy volunteers of america tested curry and concluded he has 
at least a high school education 
but curry said he was unfamiliar with world war i and watergate 
he knows the beatles were a rock group because he read about them 
in boston but doesnt know their songs 
curry lived on the streets of boston afraid to seek help 
because he thought they would lock me up in a mental hospital and 
i wouldnt get out 
he was befriended by a bellingham mass construction worker 
who spotted him near fenway park in august 1988 ralph guisti 54 
visited curry weekly and sometimes gave him money for food 
he didnt look human guisti said of his friend with 
deepgreen eyes and a scraggly brown beard he was a person in 
need 
after months of urging guisti persuaded curry to go to the 
homeless shelter in woonsocket about five miles from bellingham 
and get help curry arrived oct 24 and can stay six months 
shelter officials and woonsocket police take currys claim of 
amnesia seriously 
i havent found anything to indicate that he might be 
feigning said shelter director paul dempster its genuine 
he said curry does not smoke drink or use drugs 
woonsocket police sent currys fingerprints to the fbi which 
determined he has no criminal or military record 
the police also distributed currys description 5 feet 7 145 
pounds to police departments nationwide 
so far the police have turned up nothing 
if it turns out that this individual doesnt have much in way 
of family then we might run into a roadblock said detective lt 
michael richardson if nobodys filed a missing person report 
theres nothing we can do about it 
curry has undergone psychological counseling at the northern 
rhode island community mental health center 
richard crino a registered psychiatric nurse said it is 
impossible to diagnose currys problem until he takes some more 
medical tests he said several illnesses including a brain tumor 
epilepsy and alcoholism can produce memory loss 
to rule out an organic cause officials at the health center 
ordered a brain scan physical examination blood tests and a test 
that checks the brains electrical potential curry has taken the 
first two but refuses to take the others 
he said the brain scan made his eyes sensitive to light and 
irritated his sinuses 
curry said he struggles to regain his memory 
id look at people and try to picture what my relatives must 
look like he said but theres nothing for me to remember 
dempster said he would like curry to get a drivers license and 
social security card in his adopted name soon so he can start 
living a normal lifestyle 
for his part curry said the only thing i can think of is if 
the police find my identity or my memory comes back thats the 
only hope i have

china marked the 96th birthday of mao tsetung on 
tuesday amid official claims that young people disillusioned with 
western philosophies are rediscovering truth in the works of the 
late great helmsman 
the official press says there is a quiet resurgence of interest 
in mao the father of communist china who since his death in 1976 
has also been blamed for bringing great suffering to china with his 
radical policies 
young people the media report have abandoned their sartre and 
nietzsche and have returned to the works of mao marx and lenin 
college students shanghais wen hui daily said after traveling 
the winding road of fascination with western thought have 
returned to our forefathers to ask for advice is this not a 
good omen 
the implication is that college students after the governments 
bloody suppression of their prodemocracy movement this year and 
months of heavy political indoctrination now realize that mao and 
marx were right all along 
young people questioned privately said they had heard of no one 
rushing out to buy the selected works of mao tsetung 
mao is a kind of cover said one graduate student 
journalists have to perform their job they have to write 
something and mao is a safe subject that adheres to party line 
he said 
crowds at maos mausoleum in tiananmen square where his body 
lies in state were far smaller on his birthday tuesday than in 
previous years a bitingly cold siberian wind may have kept many 
away as did the continuation of martial law in beijing that limits 
access to the square to those with proper ids 
one vender outside the mausoleum said 10000 to 20000 people a 
day viewed maos body before june now the number is 4000 to 
5000 daily 
the overseas edition of the official peoples daily tuesday 
reported the increased popularity of shaoshan maos birthplace in 
rural southern china it said shaoshan will receive 600000 
visitors this year up from last year but still far below the 
nearly 3 million pilgrims a year during maos lifetime 
the daily also said maos 96th birthday was being marked with 
the release of a tape titled a truly great man of no equal in his 
time on which 12 of maos poems are set to traditional music a 
book chronicling maos family line back to the yuan dynasty 
12711368 was also published 
however a check of several bookstores found neither tape nor 
works by mao a clerk at one of beijings larger bookshops said 
maos works had been sold out since june but a saleswoman at a 
smaller shop said we havent carried maos works for five 
years 
another clerk corrected her saying we havent carried them 
for 20 years every family already has his works so theres no 
need to buy them 
during the 196676 cultural revolution maos disastrous attempt 
to purge the bureaucracy and restore ideological purity to the 
revolution all chinese were required to possess his little red 
book of quotations and study from it daily 
official reports of a revival of interest in mao have also been 
tempered by warnings against nostalgia for the personality cult 
around mao that his successor deng xiaoping has tried to eschew 
everyone knows that mao tsetung was a man and not a god 
the beijing daily said 
it quoted deng as saying mao was a great man and if it were 
not for chairman mao our country would have groped in the dark for 
an even longer period of time but it cautioned against great 
mass fervor among young students for the great helmsman 
there is little sign of that although some chinese embittered 
by the governments corruption and harsh suppression of democratic 
reform look back fondly on the revolutionary ideals represented by 
mao in the early days of the peoples republic 
people prefer mao to now said the graduate student the 
present government is too corrupt at least mao was for the 
people

kitzmiller he took care of her from morning until night around 
the clock 
williams 67 appeared briefly in court tuesday accused of 
shooting his wife of 44 years in the head with a 38caliber 
revolver while she sat in a wheelchair in the dining room of their

mrs williams 64 had suffered for 20 years from multiple

after the shooting williams telephoned police to turn himself 
in and waited for them at home the officer said he was released 
into his daughters custody after a christmas day court hearing 
his health wasnt the best and hers was deteriorating 
palmer said he said williams had learned that a heart problem for 
which he had to undergo surgery two years ago had recurred 
he said he would be unable to take care of his wife and 
himself palmer said palmer said williams told police that all 
his wife did was complain about how much she was suffering and she 
begged him to end it 
williams daughter told police she had spoken to her father 
earlier sunday and that he told her his doctor had advised him that 
he required a second major heart operation and he wouldnt be able 
to care for his wife palmer said 
i know gerry was taking her to the doctors quite frequently

very much 
ciezczak who lives across the street from the williams home 
said he did not hear the shooting sunday 
we saw all the squad cars and the ambulance and the fire 
department he said the first thing that came to my mind was 
that she had died like on her own because everybody knew that she 
was in very bad health 
said ed hearnes another neighbor to take a life that way i 
couldnt visualize gerry doing that

samuel beckett repeatedly refused to explain his 
own work leaving it to critics and audiences to interpret puzzle 
over and argue about the writings of one of the 20th centurys 
greatest playwrights 
i meant what i said was all he would ever offer about a 
body of work that encompassed the darkest of despair about the 
human condition in scores of plays novels and poems that defied 
convention 
he didnt write plots he didnt construct plays with stories to 
tell his masterpiece was waiting for godot the tale of two 
tramplike figures estragon and vladimir waiting for the 
mysterious godot who never arrives it had no beginning and no 
end futility and funny business exist side by side when asked for 
a summary of the play the great clown bert lahr who played 
estragon on broadway said simply its about two bums 
the plays history in the united states mirrors becketts 
gradual acceptance by american critics and audiences in early 
1956 it had a disastrous tryout in florida where twothirds of the 
openingnight audience walked out after the first act playing 
waiting for godot in miami was like doing giselle at 
roseland lahr said later 
partially recast and with a new director the play opened on 
broadway to widely divergent reaction columnist walter winchell 
vilified it audiences were mystified and so were many of the 
reviewers critic brooks atkinson called it a mystery wrapped in 
an enigma adding that theatergoers can rail at it but they 
cannot ignore it but waiting for godot folded after a run of 
only 59 performances 
it has taken the world a little while to catch up with sam 
beckett said alvin epstein who was in the original broadway 
production of godot the source of his greatness is that he 
tapped into the universal unconscious of western society in the 
20th century he expressed something so deeply felt by people who 
were shook up by war destruction and technology he was not really 
a writer he was a visionary 
thirtytwo years later there were no quibbles about waiting 
for godot when mike nichols directed an allstar version starring 
steve martin and robin williams at new yorks lincoln center 
whatever their thoughts about the particular production critics 
and audiences embraced the play as a modern masterpiece 
becketts influence on other playwrights was enormous edward 
albee harold pinter david mamet and particularly tom stoppard in 
his rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead acknowledged 
becketts hold over them in his use of language time and images 
becketts plays are filled with indelible images most of them 
of people trapped unable to move or even sometimes to speak in 
endgame one character cannot sit another cannot stand while 
two more are encased in trashcans in rockaby an old woman 
rocking slowly in a chair confronts death in play three 
voices are imprisoned in large earthen jars in happy days a 
woman is buried up to her neck in sand 
as he grew older his plays became more minimalistic and more 
nihilistic in acts without words he wrote a play with no 
dialogue only sounds in not i a onecharacter play he wrote 
for actress billie whitelaw only the outline of the draped 
performer is visible with a spotlight focused on her mouth 
he was to playwriting what einstein was to physics in the 20th 
century said gregory mosher artistic director of the lincoln 
center theater after he figured out what he did which seems so 
simple and obvious because it was so true nothing ever was the 
same afterwards its the idea that all thats left to us is trying 
to live a decent life in a world that has gone completely nuts 
take woody allens great joke 90 percent of life is just showing 
up thats a line straight out of samuel beckett

the virginia army national guard performed 
in a highly professional manner during labor day disturbances 
in virginia beach according to findings of an independent review 
announced tuesday by the national guard bureau 
lt gen herbert r temple jr chief of the bureau said the 
review was conducted by a team led by brig gen john h mcdonald 
of delaware army national guard at the request of sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the senate armed services committee and sen 
john warner rva 
he said the reviewers found no evidence to support contentions 
that delays in deployment of the guard on the morning of sept 3 
contributed to the damage from looting and vandalism 
the study showed that alert and callup procedures worked 
remarkably well considering the number of troops mobilized and 
deployed the short time period that elapsed between initial alert 
and actual deployment and the fact that it took place in the 
middle of americas busiest summer holiday weekend 
temple said no instance of physical abuse by a national guard 
member had been verified during the disturbances sept 15 he said 
several members of the guard received minor injuries but none 
required hospitalization

of hussein gave civil courts jurisdiction over cases ranging from 
political offenses to price hike violations and homicide 
the action is the last in a series of liberalizing measures in 
the kingdom which this year held its first general elections in 
more than two decades and reversed a controversial 1988 law that 
nationalized all daily newspapers 
the changes were sparked by four days of rioting in april in 
which at least 10 people died following price hikes of many 
subsidized goods and services and the appearance of government 
indifference to the economic situation of many jordanians 
the cabinet said civil courts will immediately start handling 
cases involving firearms gunplay at weddings homicide price 
gouging forgery assaults on officials violations of martial law 
orders and the ban on membership in political parties as well as 
the law against communism 
military courts have handled such cases since martial law was 
imposed during the 1967 arabisraeli war in which jordan lost the 
west bank with much of its economy and population to israel 
the cabinet also said that a ministerial committee will study 
whether to remove economic and security offenses from martial law 
jurisdiction and will report its findings within two months 
the action comes the same week that the newly appointed 
government of prime minister mudar badran must by law seek a vote 
of confidence from the recently elected parliament most of whose 
members campaigned for an end to martial law 
the king earlier this year promised to limit martial law

the freeze that struck florida citrus and 
vegetable crops should drive up food prices somewhat but not very 
much an agriculture department expert said tuesday 
the expert ralph parlett of the departments economic research 
service said an earlier forecast that food prices generally may 
rise 3 percent to 5 percent next year is still valid 
overall food prices are up an average of about 57 percent this 
year the largest annual gain since a 78 percent jump in 1981 
much of this years increase was due to lingering effects of the 
1988 drought and poor weather early in 1989 
im not worried about my overall forecast for 1990 at this 
point parlett said in a telephone interview but therell be 
some impact and possibly higher prices in the first quarter 
parlett said he and other agency analysts are still trying to 
assess the damage to citrus and vegetable crops in florida 
the main thing is oranges he said vegetables tomatoes 
bell peppers celery theyre some of the big volume things that 
would be coming out of florida now 
parlett said 90 percent of the florida oranges are for 
processing and that a lot of them can be salvaged for juice the 
main source of fresh market oranges is california 
there will be some retail price impact he said but 
since we do have decent supplies in california this year the 
supply impact will be minimal 
with the supply of florida orange juice reduced by the freezing 
weather parlett said imports from brazil will probably rise 
sharply 
weve got super supplies in brazil this year but the price 
has been fairly low because of the higher supplies he said 
but now that we probably will be importing that will push the 
price up some 
parlett said he had not seen damage reports from texas where 
state officials have estimated losses of 70 percent of the citrus 
and 80 percent of the winter vegetables 
vegetable losses are a more temporary kind of thing because 
those crops can be replanted he said growers were just starting 
to harvest floridas main supply of winter vegetables when the cold 
weather struck 
california is still producing vegetables however and this 
time of year we start getting produce out of mexico too parlett 
said 
theres no doubt that some of the supplies will be cut short 
and well probably see higher prices at produce counters he said

ambassador ion stoichici and a few aides 
struggled to conduct diplomacy from the barricaded eggsplattered 
romanian embassy tuesday consulting with us officials and 
helping romanians who want to return home 
the embassy was closed while the staff shifted gears and 
loyalties from the deposed nicolae ceausescu to the revolutionary 
national salvation committee which televised pictures of the 
executed despot and his wife tuesday morning 
we have the same feelings as other romanians said 
stoichici who declared his loyalty to the new government on 
saturday before the outcome of the fighting was clear 
another embassy officer vasile leca said all the staff 
fully support the national salvation committee we condemn the 
crimes that were done to the romanian people by nicolae and elena 
ceausescu 
stoichici and leca refused to allow a reporter inside the 
embassy speaking instead through iron bars on a window in the 
consular section 
splattered frozen eggs coated the white brick walls of the 
embassy a turnofcentury mansion on sheridan circle along embassy 
row 
wooden police barricades and yellow plastic tape stretched 
alongside the sidewalk where scores of romanians braved frigid 
temperatures over christmas weekend to vent their rage against a 
symbol of ceausescus 24year rule 
the ambassador said his first order of business was to work to 
improve relations with the united states which had grown 
increasingly critical of ceausescus human rights policies 
last evening the state department informed us that they 
recognized the staff of the romanian embassy as the 
representative of the new government said the ambassador he said 
he was in telephone contact with state department officials 
a state department official said no meetings were scheduled 
between stoichici and american diplomats but we remain in 
contact with them as much as we can 
they are in telephone contact with us but when we call them 
they dont answer said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity press calls to the embassy were not answered either 
romanian consular officials were also accepting through the 
barred window visa applications from romanianamericans who wanted 
to return home 
i want to go back to help the people who are suffering i 
would like to offer blood money anything i can said ilie 
aurelian a romanian emigre artist who lives in springfield va 
his wife is part of romanias hungarian minority and subject to 
official persecution under ceausescu they emigrated from romania 
five years ago 
ioan buburuzan 38 a taxi driver and artist from brooklyn 
ny was also at the embassy seeking a visa to visit his father in 
the village of turdaa in the klug region of romania he emigrated 
eight years ago 
buburuzan said his only regret is that ceausescu and his wife 
had been executed so quickly 
i wish they had put him on trial that would have given the 
people a chance to see his crimes and some of the evidence might 
have been embarassing to people who are still in power now said 
buburuzan 
aurelian disagreed saying it was necessary to kill ceausescu to 
prevent security forces from rescuing him and restoring him to 
power 
so now the killing has stopped that is good said aurelian 
us officials also regretted the secret trial 
we would have preferred it if there had been a public trial 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said

ku klux klan groups have kicked off a 
campaign to rid lakeland streets of crack cocaine dealers a move 
that the naacp and police view with suspicion 
a krush krack kocaine initiative calls on klan members to 
act as eyes and ears for police gathering the goods on drug 
dealers and forwarding the information to lawenforcement 
authorities group leaders say 
were not requesting that our people become vigilantes said 
thom robb grand wizard of the national knights of the ku klux klan 
in harrison ark 
but two recent incidents involving leaders of separate klan 
groups have caught the attention of police and the naacp 
george david kirkland of lakeland the 44yearold state kleagle 
of the knights of the ku klux klan was questioned by police last 
month after he tried to make a citizens arrest of a uspected 
prostitute and drove her to the police station 
the woman who was black told police kirkland identified 
himself as a police officer and told her she was under arrest the 
woman did not want to press charges and police released kirkland 
on dec 13 undercover detectives stopped donald lloyd spivey of 
kathleen the 40yearold grand dragon of the florida knights of 
the ku klux klan on suspicion of impersonating a police officer 
authorities decided not to accuse him of the thirddegree felony 
because he did not try to assert authority 
the two klan groups which are not affiliated are both focusing 
on the north side of lakeland which is preodminantly black and 
which city officials say is the area suffering most from drug and 
violent crime problems 
spivey in a recent interview said his followers began citizen 
patrols about eight months ago splitting up in teams of five to 
cruise crimeridden areas 
we have come into contact with several drug dealers and have 
dealt with them accordingly we talked to them and prayed with them 
a little bit and they moved to tampa 
kirkland said of drug dealers we can get the addresses and 
send them in and let the law take care of it 
we would look at the klan as we would any informant said 
police chief ron nenner 
but he warned that any law violations would be vigorously 
pursued 
sheriffs lt francis hart declined to confirm whether the klan 
had offered its informationgathering services saying it would be 
unfair to all informants if he revealed their identities 
i see no problem with them as long as they conduct themselves 
appropriately we dont promote anyone taking the law into their 
own hands he said 
don brown president of the lakeland chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said his group 
often offers tips to law enforcement authorities he welcomed the 
klans participation unless they are targeting certain ethnic grups 
if the klan is sincere in their endeavor and their efforts are 
to expose the drug dealers whether black white or hispanic i 
commend them he said but if they are doing this to target 
certain ethnic groups i think it is appalling and they should be 
punished without mercy and with passion 
in north carolina a klan group tried to join the states 
adoptahighway program an antilitter campaign which credits 
volunteers who spruce up a section of highway by erecting a sign 
bearing their names in october state transportation secretary jim 
harrington denied the groups request

a panamanian officer considered one of manuel 
noriegas righthand men and accused of helping the deposed 
dictator smuggle cocaine for the medellin cartel pleaded innocent 
before a federal judge tuesday 
i surrendered myself i wanted to be brought here lt col 
luis del cid told us district judge william hoeveler 
del cid 46 faces racketeering drugsmuggling and 
moneylaundering charges in the same february 1988 indictment that 
accused noriega and medellin cartel figures of importing cocaine 
into the united states 
the commander of a panama defense forces unit in the northern 
panama province of chiriqui del cid surrendered to us forces 
saturday after last weeks invasion and was brought to miami on 
monday he is the first key noriega aide named in the case to be 
brought into court 
del cid was a liason courier and emissary for manuel noriega 
dealing with drug trafficking us attorney dexter lehtinen 
said we allege he personally imported shipments of cocaine and 
he personally transmitted large amounts of cash 
lehtinen called del cid one of the righthand men of gen 
noriega 
wearing faded jeans and a blue polo shirt del cid strongly 
denied the four counts in court and demanded a jury trial 
hoeveler appointed a public defender as del cids temporary 
counsel after the panamanian testified he carried only 7000 in 
cash with him and had no access to a frozen savings account in 
panama 
the judge turned back efforts by the us attorneys office to 
ask detailed questions of del cid in an effort to uncover any 
additional assets saying such testimony could affect the 
racketeering counts against him 
outside the courtroom lehtinen said federal investigators are 
convinced the conspirators are sitting on large amounts of cash 
they were dealing with large amounts of drugs that makes a 
potential for a lot of profit lehtinen said weve always 
believed they made a lot of money 
one of noriegas criminal attorneys frank rubino appeared at 
the hearing he said he did not expect to represent del cid but 
wanted to monitor the case 
lehtinen asked the judge to bar any consultations between del 
cid and noriegas attorney saying the defendant might not 
understand that rubino might not have del cids best interests in 
mind but hoeveler refused 
asked if his real concern was that noriega might try to pressure 
his former aide lehtinen said only id rather go with my 
explanation 
the us attorney referred any questions about noriega to 
officials in washington lehtinen refused to say what contacts his 
office had made with del cid or if he had indicated a willingness 
to testify against noriega 
del cid faces a maximum of 70 years in prison and fines of 
550000 he was ordered held without bond at the metropolitan 
correctional center outside miami until a full hearing jan 2 
the miami indictment accuses noriega del cid cartel leader 
pablo escobar gaviria and 12 others of running drugs and using 
panama as a safe haven noriega using del cid as an emissary 
allegedly allowed the cartel to process drugs launder money and 
ship cocaine through panama accepting a 46 million bribe from 
the colombians 
del cid is accused of having a personal role in a 400kilogram 
cocaine shipment to florida in december 1982 
he also allegedly picked up 100000 from noriegas personal 
pilot floyd carlton cacerez in november 1982 and delivered 
200000 to carlton at the military headquarters in panama city a 
month later carlton is one of the principal witnesses in the case 
two minor defendants brian alden davidow and william 
saldarriaga were to go on trial here jan 8 but lehtinen 
indicated tuesday he expects to ask for a delay in that case 
it will not take long to begin any prosecution of del cid 
however the us attorney said 
we are confident that we have the evidence to convict him 
lehtinen said were ready to try him 
a separate federal grand jury in tampa indicted noriega and 
others on charges of taking a 54 million bribe from the medellin 
cartel but the justice department has said if noriega is brought 
to the united states he would be tried first in miami because the 
prosecution case there is stronger 
del cid was not named in the tampa indictment

securities and exchange commission chairman 
richard c breeden on tuesday selected agency veteran william c 
mclucas as the secs new head of enforcement and announced creation 
of a new fraud unit covering the sale of securities by financial 
institutions 
mclucas 39 will succeed gary lynch who resigned as sec 
director of enforcement in july after heading some of the agencys 
biggest insider trading investigations 
the enforcement job which does not require senate confirmation 
is considered the second most powerful position at the sec and it 
is breedens first major appointment since president bush tapped 
him as chairman last summer 
mclucas who has worked in the enforcement division for the past 
12 years had been considered one of the frontrunners for the 
post but breeden said he had considered three other sec attorneys 
and several persons from outside the agency before making the final 
selection 
breeden said the sec had decided to create a 25attorney special 
unit to investigate overly aggressive sales of securities by 
savings and loans and other financial institutions 
such sales have been a major focus of congressional hearings 
into the activities at lincoln savings and loan association the 
irvine califbased sampl whose failure is expected to be the 
biggest in us history costing taxpayers as much as 2 billion 
lincoln savings parent company is american continental corp 
headed by arizona businessman charles h keating jr when american 
continental filed for protection under the bankruptcy laws it left 
shareholders and investors holding nearly worthless stocks and 
bonds 
included in this group were some 22000 small investors who 
purchased nearly 200 million in corporate bonds at lincolns 29 
southern california branches about twothirds of these investors 
were elderly depositors at congressionaly hearings some of these 
investors testified that they wrongly believed that the bonds they 
were purchasing were federally insured 
breeden said that the new sec unit would try to prevent other 
financially troubled sampls from turning to fradulent practices in a 
desperate effort to raise cash 
we intend to see to it that when people are sold securities 
they are provided all the necessary information breeden said 
lynch who resigned to join a new york law firm received 
widespread praise for a series of big insider trading cases 
beginning with the exposure of stockbroker dennis levine lynch 
also spearheaded cases that resulted in a 100 million settlement 
with speculator ivan boesky and a record 650 million settlement of 
a massive civil fraud cause with junk bondgiant drexel burnham 
lambert inc 
in may 1986 the sec filed charges against levine whose 
cooperation led to boesky who in turn implicated drexel burnham in 
the largest securities fraud case ever brought by the government 
lynch took over the enforcement division in 1985 at a time of 
turmoil after his predecessor john fedders stepped down amid 
allegations that he beat his wife 
lynch was credited with restoring morale at the agency the 
scandals in recent years have forced wall streets big brokerage 
houses to reevaluate their compliance and ethics codes and led 
congress to increase the penalties for insider trading 
at the news conference breeden noted that congress has boosted 
the sec budget by almost 20 percent this year to 168 million 
providing enough new money to hire an additional 100 lawyers 
he said it was important for the sec to police the securities 
industry in such a way that individual investors will have renewed 
confidence individual investors have left the market in droves in 
recent years partly out of fears raised by the huge gyrations in 
stock prices that occurred in october of 1987 and 1989 
during the 1970s the secs enforcement division first gained 
attention under stanley sporkin for pursuing corporations that 
maintained political slush funds and paid bribes to win overseas 
business

mayor edward i koch said tuesday that his 
biggest regret in 12 years at city hall is that he did not get 
credit for helping blacks 
many people in the black community do not perceive that i was 
their friend he said in his annual yearend meeting with 
reporters the last scheduled major press conference of his 
mayoralty 
koch who lost his reelection bid to david dinkins who is 
black claimed credit for appointing the citys first black police 
commissioner benjamin ward and the first black deputy mayor for 
economic development stanley grayson 
he said that under his administration the percentage of civil 
service jobs held by members of minority groups grew from 31 
percent to 62 percent 
he said he created operation giant step a program to put 
4yearolds in kindergarten that he said was helpful largely to 
black children 
i believe this administration has been more helpful to the 
black minority than all administrations before us he said i 
dont think we got credit for it 
he discussed a remark that contributed to his political demise 
his statement during the 1988 presidential campaign that jews 
would be crazy to vote for jesse jackson 
that caused a black backlash that carried into this years 
mayoral primary when dinkins took 97 percent of the black vote 
koch maintained however that the black outpouring for dinkins 
was a matter of ethnic pride rather than an attack on him 
he said the second half of his remark about jackson went 
unheeded it was in the same way that blacks and supporters 
of black causes would be crazy to vote for george bush 
asked how history would judge him in the light of dealing with 
new problems such as the drug abuse aids and homelessness he 
said they know that within the confines of what a mayor can do 
that i did a lot 
after 25 years in city and federal government koch 65 a 
former congressman and city councilman will be embarking on a new 
career as a newspaper columnist radio and tv commentator and 
university and guest lecturer

supervisor in the pittsburgh office of the state police bureau of 
liquor control enforcement nothing in the liquor code prohibits an 
unlicensed establishment from giving away free beer wine or liquor

an autopsy on former new york yankee 
manager billy martin was canceled tuesday at his familys request 
and a prosecutor said that could make it harder to charge the 
driver of the truck in which martin died 
the broome county sheriffs department reported slow progress in 
investigating the christmas night accident that killed martin 61 
and injured a longtime friend william reedy of detroit who was at 
the wheel of martins pickup 
sheriff anthony ruffo said it would be another day or two before 
the alcohol level in reedys blood was confirmed through laboratory 
tests 
reedy was charged christmas night with a misdemeanor charge of 
drivingwhileintoxicated and faces a fine of up to 1000 and a 
year in jail 
authorities said the pickup skidded off an icy road monday 
evening in front of martins 148acre farm near binghamton 150 
miles northwest of new york city neither man was wearing a seat 
belt authorities said 
ruffo said the accident happened at a hairpin curve that has a 
history of accidents 
icy slippery roads and reedys unfamiliarity with the area were 
believed to be factors in the accident ruffo said he said the 
speed limit on the road was 55 mph but did not know how fast the 
truck had been going 
mechanical failure of martins fourwheeldrive pickup was ruled 
out the sheriff said the truck checked out fine he said 
an autopsy scheduled tuesday was canceled at the request of 
family members said michael doll spokesman for wilson memorial 
hospital in johnson city 
broome county district attorney gerald mollen said he hoped to 
persuade county coroner patrick ruddy to conduct an autopsy in 
spite of the familys wishes in order to pinpoint the exact cause 
of martins death 
but ruddy said an autopsy would reveal little that an external 
examination did not 
he died basically of a fractured neck ruddy said the 
chest xray was reasonably intact belly was normal blood count 
was normal its all in the neck area 
reedy owner of reedys bar near detroits tiger stadium 
suffered a broken hip and possible broken ribs in the accident he 
was listed in fair condition tuesday at the upstate medical center 
hospital in syracuse 
reedy said he and martin had gone to a store and then stopped 
for a quick drink at a binghamton bar said deputy steve glanville 
mollen said it would be days at least before he decides 
whether to charge reedy with anything more serious than driving 
while intoxicated such as manslaughter 
the lack of an autopsy would not preclude further charges 
mollen said 
martin purchased the farm in september 1988 three months after 
he was fired by yankee owner george steinbrenner for the final 
time he said he was attracted to the area for its fishing and 
quiet surroundings 
the feisty martin made a good name for himself by narrating the 
binghamton symphony orchestras production of billy the kid and 
speaking at a local girls softball league dinner but he and his 
wife jill were also in the news for confronting a group of 
children riding horses 
mrs martin and an unidentified man with a gun chased the youths 
off the land saying they were destroying property and setting 
fires and martin confronted the manager of the stable that 
organized the ride the stable said it had negotiated an easement 
with the previous owner of the land 
the internal revenue service last summer placed a 35562 tax 
lien on the property reportedly to cover an alleged underpayment 
on martins 1987 income tax return laurie ruffino an irs 
spokesman in buffalo said the lien had been paid recently 
in addition to martins wife survivors include one son and one 
daughter both from previous marriages 
funeral services were not immediately announced

the bush administration still struggling to 
get custody of deposed dictator manuel antonio noriega said 
tuesday it wants to freeze millions of dollars in assets he 
allegedly transferred out of panama 
justice department spokesman david runkel said us officials 
will file papers wednesday in more than a halfdozen countries 
where he said noriega had hidden illegal drug money amounting 
to more than 10 million 
runkel said the us would try to freeze cash or liquid assets 
which are in european bank accounts he refused to identify the 
banks although he did say that none of noriegas money has been 
traced to the united states 
the administration was training its legal sights on panamanian 
money assets as officials remained embroiled in tense negotiations 
over noriega wanted in this country on drugtrafficking charges 
the administration sought to pry noriega from the custody of the 
the vatican embassy in panama city 
in panama city gen maxwell thurman head of the us southern 
command conferred three time on the street outside the embassy 
with monsignor sabastian laboa the papal nuncio 
despite the negotiations defense secretary dick cheney said the 
situation with noriega might be prolonged for an indefinite period 
of time it could be that theyll have a longterm resident in 
their embassy in panama city he said 
the vatican which has no extradition treaty with the united 
states refused to simply hand noriega over to washington and it 
has maintained that stand since the deposed panamanian leader 
along with what runkel described as 10 associate thugs sought 
asylum at papal nunciature sunday afternoon 
our position is we mean to bring him back to the united 
states white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said but he 
refused to rule out the possibility that other options might be 
considered one scenario is that noriega might stand trial in 
panama another had him possibly going to a third country 
everybody is talking to everybody fitzwater said but he 
said its too soon to characterize it as progress 
although bush has not talked directly either with pope john paul 
ii or with the nunciature in panama about noriega fitzwater said 
us officials have used diplomatic channels to press their demand 
we told them very directly what our feeling were he said 
fitzwater spoke at the white house as president bush was having 
a working lunch with top advisers at his camp david md and as 
the chief pentagon spokesman said conditions had stabilized in 
panama 
bush was briefed by cheney newly returned from a visit to us 
troops in panama along with national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and gen colin d powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff 
defense department spokesman pete williams revealed that when 
noriega turned himself in sunday he was said to be so exhausted 
from the chase that he could barely speak williams said noriega 
had been on the run since the us operations began six days 
earlier and said he never was in command of the panamanian defense 
forces which resisted us soldiers 
a task force composed of officials from the departments of 
state justice and defense as well as national security council 
was formed to tackle the negotiations on noriegas fate the group 
conducted most of its meetings in telephone conferences 
the united states has rejected the idea that noriega might be 
entitled to political asylum under international law such asylum 
can only be granted on the grounds that a person is subject to 
persecution because of religious or political views runkel said 
noriega does not fit either category he said his fears 
are of prosecution in the united states on two indictments 
fitzwater said the united states had offered noriega a deal as 
recently as october if he would step down but noriega refused the 
united states will not compromise with noriega now he said 
meantime one us official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the popes representatives have contacted several 
latin american and european countries in hopes one will agree to 
take noriega 
he has no place to go yet the official said no one wants 
him 
officials said there was no way noriega could flee from the 
nunciature because it is surrounded by us troops intending to 
remain in place as long as noriega is inside 
theres no way he can get out cheney said in an interview 
on abctv but by the same token we do not have the authority to 
go in and take him out because of international law 
cheney back from a christmas day tour of panama where visited 
an estimated 26000 troops said the situation in the country was 
much quieter than its been since the us invasion last week 
despite occasional sniping incidents cheney said the 
overwhelming sense is a return to normalcy cheney said the 
us military did its job and now the lawyers and the 
diplomats have to take over 
if the situation in panama continues to improve cheney said 
the united states might speed up the withdrawal of troops he gave 
no timetable though 
williams said panamanian citizens have been turning weapons over 
to us troops and revealing the whereabouts of large weapons 
caches 
the best i can tell you is that about 33000 weapons have now 
been captured discovered or turned in he said

us drug agents have been poring 
over thousands of seized documents that are providing valuable 
intelligence on international drug trafficking authorities said 
tuesday 
they said the information could be used against panamanians 
under us drug indictments such as gen manuel antonio noriega 
and his associate lt col luis del cid who has been arrested and 
taken to the united states 
one windfall was the headquarters of panamas antinarcotics 
special force 
us soldiers stormed the headquarters monday and detained three 
men after being tipped off by an informant said us army lt col 
william leszczynski commander of the 3rd battalion 9th infantry 
regiment 
authorities reported finding rifles shotguns handguns and much 
ammunition as well as cocaine marijuana morphine and drug 
paraphernalia 
torture apparently was carried out in the same building 
leszczynski said his troops found electronic devices that could 
be hooked up to people for electric shocks 
they found a room filled with immigration files of foreigners 
from more than two dozen countries including cuba nicaragua and 
colombia the files in racks that reached the ceiling contained 
detailed information on foreigners entries and exits each file 
had a small photo of the subject 
one miamibased agent of the us drug enforcement 
administration who visited the white stucco house tuesday said that 
at first glance it seemed to be a legitimate antinarcotics 
operation 
what i find unusual is that these files were kept in a 
house she said i need to find out whose house this is in 
whose name its registered she spoke on condition of anonymity 
the files largely were from the 1960s through the 70s 
its good for us the agent said this tells me whos been 
in an out of the country i already found some files of colombian 
drug traffickers so now i know they were here now i go for the 
more recent files 
she would not say how many dea agents came here although she 
said it was far fewer than 20 the us military has provided 
transport communications and other support she added 
three makeshift jails at the back of the house seemed to have 
been inhabited recently a plastic container with urine stood in 
the corner of one cell where the occupant had slept on a dirty mat 
and cardboard placed on the cement floor

more than 150 members of an outlawed 
tamil militia surrendered to the sri lankan army tuesday after 
trekking through the jungle for three days to escape rival tamil 
guerrillas 
the weary members of the outlawed tamil national army contacted 
the sri lankan army monday in northeastern nidamwela town and were 
brought to a makeshift detention center 30 miles away military

tigers of tamil eelam attacked a tamil national army camp killing 
44 militants in the batticaloa district the officials said on 
condition of anonymity

indians have armed and trained 4000 members of the tamil national

national army which has been outlawed by president ranasinghe 
premadasas government 
indian troops started arriving in sri lanka july 30 1987 under 
an accord with india in an effort to settle the insurrection but 
the tigers reneged on the accord and attacked the indians who were 
supposed to oversee a surrender of arms

but later said it was unlikely to meet that deadline an estimated 
25000 indian soldiers remain 
tamils who make up 18 percent of the islands 16 million 
people claim discrimination by the majority sinhalese and tamil 
militants want a separate homeland the revolt has claimed 11000

of food but had been spotted and pursued by the tamil tigers one 
of the militants told reporters who were flown to polonnarywa 100 
miles northeast of colombo

minister is a young intellectual who faces the daunting task of 
finding ways to mend a country torn by bloody strife and a battered 
economy

the economy 
what we have achieved so far is to solve only emergency 
problems roman told the vremya news program the questions 
ill be dealing with are connected with restoration of the economy 
under new conditions 
romania was badly mishandled during ceausescus rule leading to 
widespread shortages of basic foodstuffs commodities and energy

in the soviet bloc advocated a stalinisttype centrally planned 
economy entirely disregarding market forces and outlawing private 
property

a numbing christmas freeze caused 
widespread damage to florida crops but citrus growers were 
optimistic tuesday that trees suffered little damage and much of 
the iced fruit can be turned into juice 
floridas third major killer freeze in six years was not 
believed as disastrous to citrus as those in december 1983 and 
january 1985 
but neartotal losses were reported in winter vegetables much 
of it destined for northeastern markets in large areas of the 
state 
agriculture officials said it was too early to estimate the 
financial losses in some cases the full extent of damage will not 
be known for weeks or months 
elsewhere texas officials estimate 70 percent of that states 
citrus crop and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were 
destroyed by the cold weather 
sleet snow rain and wind combined with temperatures ranging 
from the teens to the high 20s throughout the florida peninsula 
during the weekend the cold contributed to at least seven deaths 
and caused burst water pipes and other problems for residents used 
to subtropical december weather 
the multibilliondollar citrus industry was still recovering 
from the earlier freezes that wiped out some 250000 acres of trees 
but many growers believed the major damage this time was 
confined to the fruit 
i dont think it was a treekilling freeze said dan gunter 
executive director of the florida department of citrus 
more than 80 percent of the citrus crop was still on the trees 
when the cold arrived and few groves escaped damage in the 
700000acre citrus belt 
vegetables strawberries ornamental plants and other crops were 
also hard hit 
florida agriculture commissioner doyle conner said there were 
heavy losses of beans squash corn tomatoes and watermelons he 
said he hoped enough citrus and vegetables could be salvaged to 
maintain market supplies 
with shortages naturally prices will go up i just hope that 
we have enough fruit to keep a rather stable market because 
everyone prefers to have product in the marketplace rather than 
heavy limitations on supply and unreasonable prices the 
commissioner said 
central florida growers said thousands of acres of carrots 
radishes cauliflower and broccoli were destroyed and little would 
be salvageable 
the 1 billion foliage industry one of the states 
fastestgrowing agriculture commodities suffered a minimum of 20 
percent losses statewide said earl wells executive vice president 
of the florida nurserymen and growers association 
almost 90 percent of the florida orange crop goes into juice 
gunter said the citrus industry had large stocks of juice 
concentrate that stock and the largerthannormal brazilian citrus 
crop should stabilize juice prices somewhat he said 
because of that there might be a more moderate impact than we 
might expect for a freeze year gunter said 
nevertheless commodities traders sharply bid up the price of 
orange juice futures tuesday speculating that the freeze would 
cause a scramble for supplies the january contract for frozen 
concentrated orange juice rose 161 cents to 1531 a pound on the 
new york cotton exchange 
harvesting crews were out in force in bright sunny weather 
tuesday citrus growers rushed to pick early and midseason oranges 
and grapefruit and get them to processing plants to be turned into 
juice before spoilage 
ironically growers now hope the cool weather will stick around 
for a week or so during the citrus harvesting and roundtheclock 
processing temperatures forecast in the 60s and 70s later in the 
week would hasten juice loss in the damaged fruit 
rapidly rising temperatures in texas blocked efforts to salvage 
frozen fruit for juice growers said they were dealt the fatal blow 
monday when temperatures shot into the mid50s reducing the frozen 
fruit to mush 
it appears to me even the canneries wouldnt accept it because 
the fruit has been frozen so bad said joe kutzenberger 
president of ky farms in harlingen texas its turning soft and 
even bleeding through the skin of the fruit i would say its a 
total loss 
losses to texas citrus industry are estimated at 200 million so 
far and could top 500 million as trees begin to show effects from 
the freeze said david galvan of the texas department of 
agriculture 
the florida citrus commission said tuesday it would not invoke 
emergency rules limiting shipments of fresh fruit that suffered 
icing commission chairman bill becker said the industry was 
relying on the florida fruit and vegetable inspection service 
affiliated with us department of agriculture to ensure the 
quality of freshfruit shipments

china is blocking security council debate 
on the revolt in romania because it fears comparisons with 
beijings own violent encounter with prodemocracy protests 
diplomats said tuesday 
the security council put off discussion on romania on tuesday 
because of resistance by china the diplomats said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
a un spokesman said only that the romanian question which had 
been placed on the agenda had not been taken up there was no 
comment from chinese diplomats 
weeks of prodemocracy protests in china earlier this year were 
crushed by troops in beijing china says about 300 people died 200 
of them civilians witnesses and western security sources say the 
toll may range from 500 to 3000 
in romania the new revolutionary government says more than 
12000 people were believed slain during a week of protests against 
the rule of ousted leader nicolae ceausescu who ordered troops to 
shoot demonstrators mass graves were found in the western city of 
timisoara 
un diplomats said china government wants to avoid any 
comparison with romania china has reacted sharply to international 
criticism to its crackdown 
un diplomats familiar with council proceedings said china 
with the support of some developing nations argued that the 
situation in romania was strictly an internal affair and the 
international community should not become involved 
other diplomats argued however that the instability in romania 
threatens europe and that maintaining international peace and 
stability is a legitimate concern of the 15nation security council 
austria hungary west germany and italy last week requested 
that the issue a statement about the crisis in romania they 
suggested the council could deplore the violence among the 
demonstrators army and security forces and call for an orderly 
transition to democracy 
china however refused saturday to permit security council 
president enrique penalosa of colombia to read an informal 
statement of concern to reporters 
china is one of the five permanent council members with veto 
power and can block a statement a council statement requires a 
concensus the five permanent members are the united states 
britain china france and the soviet union

the central committee of the ruling 
communist party recommended tuesday that the party adopt a proposal 
to end its 45year monopoly on power in yugoslavia 
the party will consider the proposal at its january congress in 
belgrade 
the yugoslav communist party was the first to break with the 
monolithic communist bloc in 1948 but yugoslavia has been slower 
to adopt many of the democratic reforms now sweeping eastern europe 
secretary stefan korosec told the 165member central committee 
the party is ready for competition of equal political partners 
korosec said the party will embark on reforms not to reject 
the idea of socialism but to preserve and develop it further 
the draft is a result of ambition to prove that we do not 
find ourselves at the tail of reforms in socialism he said 
other political parties have already been allowed in slovenia 
and croatia two of the six republics in the yugoslav federation 
serbia the largest republic decided this month to allow other 
parties with some restrictions 
yugoslavia has a population of 235 million

the leader of the national farmers 
organization urged president bush and congressional leaders tuesday 
to work with farmers to increase agricultural exports to eastern 
europe 
food will assist eastern bloc nations more than dollars and 
at the same time help the us agricultural economy said devon 
woodland of blackfoot idaho a rancher and president of the 
iowabased nfo 
woodland said studies indicate that countries that received 
assistance under the us food for peace program have become 
friends of the united states and developed into trading partners 
the same cannot be said of countries receiving us financial aid 
he said 
why dollar aid when people in the eastern bloc countries have 
no food available to buy we are the richest and most abundant 
agriculture country in the world we should use this food to or at 
least a portion of it for assistance to the hungry woodland 
said in a statement released by nfo headquarters in corning 
the group represents more than 250000 farm families and markets 
farm commodities for its members 
woodland said food shipments to eastern europe would reduce 
grain surpluses and thereby push up the prices us farmers 
receive for their crops 
he urged president bush agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
and members of the house and senate agriculture committees to 
consider establishing a federal agriculture conference to help 
increase exports of food to eastern europe

official and newly active opposition groups 
the action came after an independent trade union podkrepa 
proposed warning strikes for wednesday presumably in selected 
places and a general strike thursday to push demands for the talks 
it was not clear whether the politburo offer was in response to 
podkrepas threat of the first general strike in bulgaria since the 
communist takeover after world war ii 
it also was not clear whether the strikes would go ahead as 
planned podkrepa is one of several opposition groups that have 
been allowed to function publicly since todor zhivkov was ousted as 
communist leader nov 10

gen manuel antonio noriega 
probably went by himself to the vatican embassy and decided to seek 
asylum after his aides abandoned him or were arrested the us 
southern command said tuesday 
it said noriega was never in charge of his defense forces after 
the us invasion on dec 20 and did not contact any of its members 
for fear of a trap during the fighting military spokesmen had 
said the resistance was centrally directed and noriega was involved 
in a brief communique released to reporters southern command 
gave an account of noriegas time after the invasion based on what 
it said were interviews with his cronies 
noriega at one point considered fleeing to the mountains to 
mount an insurgent attack but he was concerned about his heart 
while living in difficult terrain without the opulent luxuries and 
intensive medical care to which he had become accustomed 
according to the communique 
it quoted aides who were interviewed as saying noriega wore red 
underwear to ward off the evil eye 
the communique said that before the invasion noriega had 
dismissed the possibility of an attack by us troops and was in 
colon 50 miles north of panama city inspecting a new military 
facility 
he was aware of increased us force activities but discounted 
the notion of an attack passing the increased activity off as more 
us posturing the communique said 
it said that about 6 pm on dec 19 he was dropped off at a 
panamanian defense forces club in tocumen near the omar torrijos 
airport 
there he was provided a prostitute by one of his aides 
apparently a routine occurrence it said 
when tocumen was attacked about 1 am noriega left the club 
and evaded us forces by driving around panama city according to 
the communique 
southern command said noriegas first telephone call after the 
invasion was to his mistress vicky amado and that he never tried 
to contact his wife felicidad 
it said noriega was agitated and spent the days at various 
locations mostly at the home of relatives of his private 
secretary marcella tason 
his supporters tried to make him leave town but he refused it 
said 
it added that at one point noriega was believed to have 
contacted the cuban ambassador and considered going to cubas 
embassy but backed off because the compound was surrounded by us 
troops 
the bush administration had set a 1 million bounty for noriega 
southern command said noriega decided to go singlehanded to 
the vatican embassy after one of his commanders luis del cid 
surrendered to us forces in david 200 miles west of panama city 
del cid was indicted in 1988 along with noriega on drug trafficking 
charges he was flown to miami monday 
other people were seen entering the vatican embassy at various 
times on the same day noriega went there justice department 
spokesman david runkel said tuesday in washington that 10 
associate thugs of noriega sought asylum sunday afternoon at the 
embassy the papal nunciature

deposed dictator nicolae ceausescu 
defiantly denounced the revolt that toppled him from power and 
refused to recognize the legitimacy of the tribunal that sentenced 
him to death a videotape of his trial showed late tuesday 
waving his arms and shouting with his forlorn wife elena 
seated nearby ceausescu branded as lies the charges that the 
couple was responsible for the deaths of 60000 during their 
24year reign and the crackdown on protesters last week 
everything that was said here was false and i dont want to 
talk any more he declared at one point 
im not guilty im not guilty i will answer only in front of 
the grand national assembly and in front of the workingclass 
these are lies he said as the couple sat behind a table with no 
other people in the room visible 
later the videotape broadcast on romanian television showed the 
bodies of the couple sprawled by a wall after their executions 
monday by firing squad the first confirmation for romanians that 
their revolution had been won 
an official said the couple that ruled their country together 
were granted their last wish that their executions be carried out 
simultaneously hundreds reportedly volunteered for the 
threemember firing squad 
the revolutionary national salvation committee which says it is 
a provisional government until free elections can be held in april 
chose ion iliescu as chairman of a new 37member governing council 
on tuesday 
it also named as prime minister a professor who said he 
convinced the army to join the revolt 
additionally the new government issued a decree that throws out 
some of ceausescus most vicious and oppressive laws including 
those prohibiting contact with foreigners free travel and even 
ownership of typewriters 
the government also ordered the interior ministrys brutal 
security forces be put under control of the defense ministry which 
oversees the army that sided with the revolutionaries 
according to radio and romanian sources security forces loyal 
to ceausescu were surrendering by the hundreds tuesday apparently 
convinced of defeat by news of their ousted rulers execution 
but sporadic gunfire still rang through parts of the capital 
where many buildings were burned or battered by the fighting 
between army units backing the revolution and secret police loyal 
to ceausescu 
ceausescu and his wife were reported captured on saturday and 
tried and executed two days later television early tuesday 
broadcast the first footage of the couple in captivity along with 
the film of their bodies 
the 71yearold ceausescu looked gaunt and unshaven and denied 
that he ordered the brutal suppression during last weeks protests 
against his rule 
his wife sometimes restrained from speaking by her husband 
defiantly blasted back at unseen prosecutors accusing the family of 
stashing hard currency in swiss banks 
prove it she retorted this is a base provocation 
ceausescu denied that there were deaths in bucharests palace 
square on thursday when there were reports that troops fired on 
protesters who turned out for his failed progovernment 
demonstration 
nobody was shot in the palace square ceausescu said 
do you know that you were sacked as president and as supreme 
commander of the army the court asked at point 
no i do not recognize this i am the president of the 
socialist republic of romania he replied 
the government said the couple was tried by a secret military 
tribunal for grave crimes against the romanian people including 
genocide and ruining the economy it said the genocide involved the 
deaths of more than 60000 people during their 24 years in power 
the government also said the couple had stashed more than 1 
billion in foreign banks 
a military officer who asked not to be identified said 300 
soldiers volunteered for the firing squad but only three were 
chosen the ceausescus last wish was to die together he said 
all of us wanted to see the dictator shot you have seen it 
the dictators have been executed exulted a bucharest radio 
announcer 
for some however even death was too good for ceausescu who 
ran a network of terror with 700000 secret police and imposed 
rationing on his people while exporting food to pay for monuments 
to his own glory 
he should be stripped naked and his body paraded through the 
streets said dimitru minca whose 14yearold grandson was among 
ceausescus victims 
still in custody and facing trial was ceausescus eldest son 
nicu and a daughter zoia 
thousands of people were reported killed as ceausescu tried to 
crush burgeoning protests that began dec 15 the army joined the 
uprising friday forcing ceausescu to flee and thousands more are 
believed to have been killed during the fighting with proceausescu 
forces 
a group of dissidents intellectuals disaffected government 
officials and rebellious army commanders have been trying to run 
the nation under the umbrella name national salvation committee 
on tuesday the committee said iliescu 59 would remain 
chairman of the committee reputed to be a college chum of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev he was an early rising star under 
ceausescu but was demoted in 1971 after disagreements over the 
dictators style and his pace of reform 
it also named petre roman a 43yearold professor of hydraulic 
engineeering with no political background as prime minister 
the government has been headquartered at the tv station scene 
of some of the heaviest fighting during one attack friday roman 
told reporters he was on the committee because he helped persuade 
the army to join the revolt 
named as defense minister was gen nicolas militaru who retired 
eight years ago from the army as commander of the bucharest 
garrison one of many military men toppled by ceausescu whose 
distrust of the army grew after an attempted military coup in 1984 
because of the new decree militarus duties now will include 
command of all security troops under the new law the only 
paramilitary units under the interior ministry will be traffic 
police firefighters and prison guards 
the changes also scrap laws forbidding unauthorized contact with 
foreigners requiring intellectuals to live in the same city where 
they work a measure frequently used to banish outspoken voices to 
remote towns 
laws prohibiting abortions to women with less than five children 
and requiring registration of typewriters also were abolished as 
were ceausescus plans to destroy thousands of villages and force 
people into shoddy new housing in towns 
about 10 new political parties have been formed since saturday 
all weak and badly organized and a small but noisy demonstration 
has already denounced the new government some of whose members 
have promised free elections 
about a thousand people gathered outside of the central 
committee building to demand that no communists be included in any 
new government they objected that the television station refused 
to cover them 
these are the first days of liberty and already they are 
suppressing us said christian radulescu a doctor

romanian tv on tuesday broadcast 
footage of the secret trial of nicolae and elena ceausescu showing 
the dictator and his wife defiant unrepentant and dismissive of 
the tribunal that sentenced them to death 
ceausescu gaunt and looking his 71 years repeatedly told the 
court he would answer only to the countrys rubberstamp parliament 
and the workingclass for his actions 
his wife restrained from speaking several times when her 
husband put his hand on her arm or leg blasted back at unseen 
prosecutors accusing the family of stashing cash in swiss banks 
prove it she retorted this is a base provocation 
ceausescu alternately remained silent after questions about his 
24 years of dictatorial policy or shouted replies in the raised 
voice he used in his most strident speeches 
everything that was said here was false and i dont want to 
talk any more he said 
this was a coup detat and i dont answer your questions he 
proclaimed at another point 
the couple sat silently as the indictment was read charging 
them with genocide of more than 60000 people the undermining of 
the state and the economy the destruction of historic monuments 
and attempting to flee by hiding more than 1 billion in foreign 
banks 
ceausescu refused to answer key questions about who ordered the 
dec 17 shooting of unarmed civilians in the western city of 
timisoara that precipated the popular rage that drove him from 
power 
elena ceausescu who was effectively in charge of romania dec 
1820 while her husband was in iran acted unconcerned when asked 
if she knew of the shooting in timsisoara 
what are you talking about she demanded 
who ordered the shooting in bucharest a voice asked 
referring to the shooting of protesters in bucharest last thursday 
a day before the army backed the revolt and the ceausescus were 
forced to flee 
nobody was shot in the palace square ceausescu said he was 
referring to the square where he addressed a progovernment rally 
thursday that backfired and turned into a demonstration against him 
the ceausescus were captured saturday in an underground bunker 
at an undisclosed location they were tried sentenced and shot to 
death by firing squad on monday 
earlier tuesday the television broadcast scenes of their 
bulletridden bodies slumped against a wall a closeup showed 
ceausescus face his eyes open and blood on the right side 
it has not been disclosed where and exactly when they were tried 
and shot after the secret trial 
do you know whats happening now why are these people 
fighting in the street the prosecutor demanded referring to 
street battles between security troops loyal to ceausescu and the 
army which backs the revolutionaries 
the people are fighting the gangs of traitors who in collusion 
with foreign forces organized this coup detat ceausescu 
answered 
do you know that you were sacked as a president and a supreme 
commander of the army the prosecutor asked 
no i do not recognize this i am the president of the 
socialist republic of romania ceausescu replied 
asked why he exported food grown in the country and left his own 
people scraping by on meager rations ceausescu characteristically 
cited the inflated statistics he loved to use to justify his 
stalinist policies 
its a lie that the people are hungry he said 
why were the peasants going to bucharest to buy bread 
retorted the prosecutor ceausescu was silent 
at another point in the 40minute broadcast he defended his 
hated plan to systemize the countryside by moving peasants from 
villages to shoddy new housing in agroindustrial centers he 
claimed the plan would bring more civilization to romanias 
traditionrich peasantry 
i didnt want to destroy the villages on the contrary it was 
a buildup of villages they were supposed to get doctors 
schools he said 
it was an improvement not a destruction they were to be the 
best villages in the world 
the couple also was asked about the luxurious lifestyle of their 
daughter zoiaelena captured by soldiers on sunday 
television has shown footage of her opulent villa containing 
jewels and other artifacts from national museums and her two 
lapdogs said to have been fed with imported meat weighed on golden 
scales 
we dont have any villa ceausescu defiantly replied both 
he and his wife laughed when asked about the imported meat for pets 
we lived like normal citizens its incredible what you are 
accusing us of ceausescu said 
did you ever suffer from any mental disorder elena was 
asked at one point 
oh what a base provocation answered the woman who only a 
week ago reigned supreme in romania

iran recognized romanias new government 
tuesday and lawmakers demanded to know why nicolae ceausescu was 
warmly welcomed to the tehran just days before he was deposed and 
executed iranian media reported 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said the foreign ministry 
announced recognition of the provisional government in bucharest 
irans foreign ministry is certain that the two nations ties 
will continue and that after the establishment of the popular 
government in romania these relations will expand the statement 
said 
the ministry also informed the romanian ambassador in tehran 
that irans red crescent society the moslem equivalent of the red 
cross is ready to send medical aid to bucharest to help people 
wounded in the fighting that toppled ceausescu the radio reported 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia said the 
majlis or parliament summoned foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
to explain ceausescus official visit to tehran from dec 1820 
ceausescu was deposed by a popular uprising on friday he and 
his wife elena were executed monday after they were found guilty 
during a secret military trial of genocide and other grave 
crimes during his 24year rule 
ceausescu left for iran in the midst of huge protests against 
his rule his security forces fired on demonstrators reportedly 
killing thousands on friday the army turned against him and 
ceausescu was forced to flee his palace 
the islamic republic news agency said the issue of ceausescus 
visit was snowballing as the biggest goof of the iranian foreign 
ministry 
the government appears increasingly embarrassed by its embrace 
of ceausescu who also had close ties with china china on tuesday 
seeking to avoid any comparisons to its own crackdown on protesters 
in june succeeded in blocking debate on romania by the un 
security council in new york 
the iranian news agency said 45 deputies in the 270seat majlis 
demanded that velayati appear 
the majlis foreign relations committee which met with velayati 
a day earlier said tuesday that his answers to their questions 
were not satisfactory enough 
no details of the exchange were provided but the majlis and 
velayati sit in opposing political camps in iran the majlis is 
dominated by hardliners of the islamic revolution opposed to 
opening iran to foreign investment and other pragmatic measures 
that velayati supports 
irna said in an earlier report that velayati ordered irans 
ambassador to bucharest mohammad jamshid gowhari be fired 
irna said the dismissal was due to gowharis failure to 
furnish the foreign ministry with a comprehensive report on the 
internal situation in romania before ceausescus visit 
gowhari was dismissed only three months before he was due to 
return to tehran irna reported 
ceausescu was given a red carpet welcome in tehran romania was 
irans secondbiggest trading partner in eastern europe and during 
ceausescus visit he signed an agreement to buy 1 million barrels 
of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of gas a year 
he met president hashemi rafsanjani who termed ceausescus 
visit successful and noted that the grounds for economic 
cooperation were completely fertile 
after ceausescu left and reports from romania illustrated the 
brutality of his regime iranian newspapers demanded an official 
explanation why the romanian leader had been allowed to visit 
tehran 
velayati responded sunday by saying the visit had been arranged 
after frequent requests from bucharest but he stressed that 
iranian leaders repeatedly advised ceausescu to bow to his 
peoples demands while he was in tehran 
iran also has denied european reports that iranians were 
fighting alongside ceausescus security police against rebel forces 
and that ceausescu had stashed a fortune in gold in tehran banks 
during ceausescus visit irna praised romania as the sole 
east european country rigidly adhering to its past government a 
reference to the reform movements that have changed poland 
hungary czechoslovakia bulgaria and east germany 
irans staterun television network lauded ceausescu while he 
was in tehran this week it broadcast commentaries criticizing his 
rule 
irna claimed tuesday that ceausescu received a cold welcome 
and said that irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali khamenei 
called off a scheduled meeting with him 
the agency also said that while ceausescu was in tehran 
protests were made in the iranian parliament about the visit 
none of the reported protests were mentioned by irans 
statecontrolled media while ceausescu was in tehran

kean said in a statement he was an individual of strong and 
firmly held positions and possessed a willingness to express them 
forcefully and articulately he fought for his beliefs both as a 
public servant and as a private citizen 
jacobson a longtime labor union official joined the state 
casino control commission in 1981 his tenure was marked by his 
vote against issuing a gaming license to hilton corp and his 
runin with sinatra 
in 1984 he characterized the singer as someone who walks into 
a casino and exhibits himself like an obnoxious bully forcing men 
and women to commit infractions because of the fear of losing their 
jobs 
the comment came after sinatra and fellow entertainer dean 
martin forced a blackjack dealer at the former golden nugget casino 
to deal from her hand instead of a plastic shoe which holds the 
cards jacobsons remark so angered sinatra that he refused to 
perform in the state for a time 
outgoing casino control commission chairman walter n read said 
jacobson never feared letting others know what he thought 
joel had a lot of influence in a lot of areas for a long 
period of time read said 
jacobson resigned from the commission in june 1986 and was 
appointed by us district judge harold ackerman to run union 
citybased teamsters local 560 ackerman had ruled in february 1984 
that the 8000member local 560 had suffered under an orgy of 
criminal activity for 25 years 
in may 1987 ackerman removed jacobson saying more needs to 
be done in order to insure that the documented egregious pattern of 
racketeering activity does not reemerge the moment that the 
trusteeship is ended 
jacobson later accused the government of trying to bust the 
union with the appointment of edwin h stier a former assistant 
us attorney and director of the state division of criminal 
justice the union in 1988 held a government monitored election and 
returned to selfadministration 
in 1974 jacobson became a member of the state board of public 
utilities and its president in 1976 
he became the first commissioner of the state department of 
energy now part of the state department of commerce energy and 
economic development upon its creation in 1977

the following is an account of fighting in timisoara filed on 
tuesday by anatoly bocharov a special correspondent for the soviet 
news agency tass

timisoara romania shots can still be heard in timisoara a 
city in the western part of romania there are killed and wounded 
supporters of the overthrown dictator nicolae ceausescu mostly the 
personnel of the former security service securitate continue to 
offer armed resistance to the insurgents 
in an attempt to hide from popular indignation the extremists 
try to flee the city as a rule they take these desperate steps at 
night firing at random at passersby we learned from our own 
experience that the insurgents had a good reason when taking 
measures for ensuring the safety of work and travel of foreign 
journalists in timisoara and in the area around it eight 
journalists were wounded danny huwe a belgian journalist was 
shot dead by extremists on monday his car in which he was driving 
together with his three colleagues was fired at by antiinsurgent 
sharpshooters 
army units are combing timisoara districts and separate 
buildngs they are acting in close cooperation with the democratic 
committee which assumed the duty to bring the situation in the city 
back to normal 
facts show that they are facing a strong and treacherous enemy 
trained in advance to stage repressions against the population for 
example a regular arms cache was found in the house of one of the 
heads of the security force it is believed that there are many 
such arms caches in the houses of security officers this is the 
explanation for continuing armed clashes in the streets of the city 
members of the democratic committee told tass that the 
securitate had been created to serve as the mainstay of the ousted 
regime it had included wellequipped specialized units and a large 
network of informers 
one should see the eyes of the people looking at the arrests of 
extremists they are full of tears of grief over the death of 
defenseless people during the shooting of the demonstration and 
hatred for the totalitarian regime 
there is no doubt that the last hotbeds of resistance will soon 
be suppressed the situation in the city is getting back to normal 
with difficulty and step by step residents met with satisfaction 
the order of the national salvation front of romania that all the 
armaments should be urgently handed over to the authorities people 
heeded the appeal of the democratic committee to return to their 
working places some grocery shops were opened tram trolleybus 
and bus traffic was resumed 
victor and victoria are now the most popular names in the city 
to commemorate the victory of the people they were given to its 
youngest residents a boy and a girl who were born after the 
overthrow of the regime a proposal is being discussed in timisoara 
to make dec 22 the day when the revolutionary rejuvenation of 
romania was started a national holiday 
on our way from timisoara to yugoslavia we saw trucks carrying 
the red cross flag they were transporting to romania food 
medicines and clothes aid to the romanian people that suffered 
from the ousted regime is coming from many countries

a fire that killed 16 people in a 
highrise retirement center started on the first floor but 
investigators have not narrowed down the cause the citys fire

the retired in 1979 a year after the hotel closed it was built as 
a hotel in 1924 
this was an apartment house with the residents all supposed 
to be able to care for themselves cook their own meals and keep 
their own places clean grant trivett said it was not a nursing 
home he said 
we were planning to upgrade our facility with a sprinkler 
system he said we didnt feel uncomfortable about it we felt 
it would be a good investment 
souder said a sprinkler system would have held the fire in 
check until we got there 
the center which housed 145 residents has long concerned city 
officials said city manager john campbell 
you have to be concerned any time you have so many elderly 
people in a 10story building campbell said 
when the building was opened as a retirement center in 1979 it 
was brought up to code campbell said but the building code at 
that time did not require sprinklers 
sprinklers are required under present code only if renovations 
are being done

several nations and the human rights group amnesty 
international criticized romanias new leaders tuesday for 
executing dictator nicolae ceausescu and his wife without a public 
trial saying a free romania should live by the rule of law 
but there also were expressions of understanding of the 
treatment meted out to the ceausescus and the countrys new 
government gained increasing international support 
by wednesday at least 18 countries including such past 
ceausescu supporters as china north korea and iran had 
recognized romanias national salvation committee which overthrew 
ceausescu friday following a popular uprising 
tons of international aid streamed into romania 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev sent a message to 
romanias leader of the new provisional government ion iliescu 
noting that he took charge of the country at a difficult moment 
when romanian patriots resolutely came out to save the nation from 
forces of despotism and terror 
in the message carried by the official news agency tass 
gorbachev assured the new government of soviet support 
the soviet foreign ministry called the executions of the 
ceausescus an internal affair spokesman vadim perfiliev said the 
decision has probably been made taking into account the 
aspirations and will of the romanian people 
the united states joined several nations in criticizing the 
secret trial and the italian office of amnesty international 
deplored the executions 
the idea that the use of the death penalty can survive during 
the passage from the old regime to a democratic system provokes 
worry the human rights group said 
the dutch government said it was concerned and expressed 
hope that the high principles of the rule of law will find their 
place in the new romania for which so many have fought to the 
utmost 
the dutch said however that ceausescu was responsible for 
the inhuman suffering inflicted on the romanian people and said 
they were willing to take into account the possible connection 
between his death and efforts to quickly end the senseless 
bloodshed caused by elite police units loyal to the dictator 
in britain a foreign office spokesman said normal accepted 
standards were difficult during a civil war situation 
although one may regret a secret trial at the time it was not 
really surprising said a foreign office spokesman who by custom 
was not identified 
but george robertson of the opposition labor party called the 
secret trial a sad birth to the new nation 
iolanda stranescu president of the british romanian 
association echoed his assessment saying our feeling is 
ceausescu should have had a public trial it is not an excellent 
start for the new government 
fundraising for romania gained momentum worldwide 
two west german military planes carrying medical supplies and 
other relief equipment landed in bucharest tuesday and the german 
red cross prepared a convoy to leave by land 
the british red cross which launched an appeal saturday said 
tuesday that it had received as many as 12000 callers an hour and 
had raised more than 700000 it said it had sent 30 tons of drugs 
and medical supplies to romania 
libyas official news agency jana said libya was sending a 
planeload of medicine libya again denied that libyans were 
participating in events in romania on the side of the proceausescu 
forces jana said 
czechoslovakia sent two cargo planes with medical aid and food 
to bucharest following two trains and ambulance convoys sent over 
the weekend the official ctk news agency said 
in israel where 400000 romanian immigrants and their 
descendants live a twohour radio show was held tuesday to seek 
donations and pass on information about jews in romania 
israels foreign ministry planned to send a sixton shipment of 
medical supplies to bucharest israel radio said two 
romanianspeaking doctors would accompany the supplies 
britain chile china colombia greece hungary spain and iran 
on tuesday joined the united states the soviet union and at least 
nine other nations in pledging support for the national salvation 
committee 
on wednesday the official north korean central news agency 
said communist north korea recognized the new government kcna was 
monitored in tokyo 
we respect the road chosen by the romanian people and 
recognize the council of the romanian national salvation front as 
the representative of the romanian people read a statement of 
the north korean foreign ministry quoted by the agency 
hungarian foreign minister gyula horn said in a statement that 
hostilities between hungary and romania were at an end and pledged 
his governments support for the new leadership 
relations between the two countries were traditionally strained 
over hungarys claims that the ethnic hungarian minority in romania 
was discriminated against under ceausescu 
tensions aggravated as hungary increasingly embraced democratic 
reforms while ceausescu remained staunchly opposed to such reforms 
iran announced its recognition hours after dismissing its 
ambassador to bucharest for failing to inform tehran of growing 
opposition to ceausescu before he visited iran last week 
parliament demanded that foreign minister ali akbar velayati 
explain why ceausescu was warmly received by iranian officials 
the foreign ministry announcing recognition of the new 
government said relations between the two countries will 
expand romania was irans secondbiggest trading partner in 
eastern europe and during ceausescus visit he signed an agreement 
to buy 1 million barrels of oil and 1 billion cubic meters of gas a 
year 
the chinese foreign ministry said tuesday it was ready to 
continue to maintain and develop its friendly relations with 
romania 
ceausescu maintained good relations with beijing over decades of 
hostility between china and the rest of the soviet bloc and was one 
of the few socialist leaders to praise the chinese leaderships

taxpayers receive their annual holiday 
greetings from uncle sam starting today as the internal revenue 
service mails out more than 107 million tax forms and instruction 
packages 
the forms which have been waiting at post offices across the 
nation for weeks should be in most taxpayers hands before jan 1 
the irs always times the mailing which costs 26 million for 
postage and printing to come right after the crush of christmas 
mail but soon enough to give taxpayers as much time as possible to 
complete their returns before the filing deadline which falls this 
year on april 16 
for taxpayers still reeling from the sweeping changes wrought by 
the 1986 tax reform act the irs has reassuring words the new 
forms look very much like last years forms

most states have some sort of law restricting liquor sales on 
sundays so when new years eve falls on a sunday as it does this 
year its a lessthanfestive holiday for those who make a living 
selling alcohol 
i think it will hurt the industry said ray brezzo who owns 
a liquor store in glastonbury conn were very very 
pessimistic 
in connecticut as in many northeastern states bars and 
restaurants can serve alcohol on sundays but liquor stores cant 
sell it for new years eve brezzo is hoping his customers will 
buy what they need on saturday but hes far from confident

most reporters dread the end of a year this is 
because they are told to write a long story about the years major 
stories and what it all means but there are those who enjoy such 
work 
his name is andy rooney he is at cbs news and he gets to grouse 
on 60 minutes each week this thursday he has 60 minutes of 
his own a little less technically speaking to grouse or be 
amused about this year 
his show a year with andy rooney 1989 will arrive two 
nights after abc news images of the eighties and one after nbc 
news the eighties those are specials about the decade not 
just one little year 
rooney who is more comfortable with a year doesnt mind doing 
yearenders as theyre called by journalists 
as a writer its a lot of fun all you need is something to 
write about and here it is all sitting there for you and every 
event spurs an idea or observation its a great thing for an 
essayist 
he is asked if this weeks print and broadcast flood of 
yearenders and decadeenders has any real virtue 
well he muses does virtue have any real virtue but i 
think if looking at where weve been helps us where were going 
yes to that extent they have some virtue 
rooney 68 has done five other onehour essays of the kind 
airing thursday the last was in 1985 when he took a helicopter 
across the united states for a birdseye perspective of the nation 
in preparing a gimleteye perspective of 1989 he went by 
subject rather than proceeding chronologically business 
education guns communisms decline and even certain tv people 
were among the subjects inspected 
for example he notes that abcs diane sawyer was induced to 
leave cbs for 2 million a year and the chance to work with sam 
donaldson 
in contrast connie chung in leaving nbc for cbs only got 
15 million but she got to work alone 
rooney began work on 1989 last summer when interviewed last 
week he had just heard bad news from cbs officialdom they said 
that what he turned in exceeded an hour by one minute 
this is not good as he only really has 47 minutes he can call 
his own commercials and promotions for other shows get the rest of 
the hour he returns with heavy heart and producer robert forte to 
the editing room and starts throwing things out 
a reflection on the death of the famous race horse secretariat 
runs 24 seconds out who won the superbowl the world series and 
lesser championships run 40 seconds adios 
the obituary of the anguished announcer who reported the flaming 
crash of the dirigible hindenberg in 1937 took 40 seconds farewell 
to that likewise a slightly shorter thought on former secretary of 
defense nominee john tower 
a lot of good weather got the boot too rooney says 
although we kept hurricane hugo 
thirty seconds here 40 there 16 here it adds up but it is a 
heartbreaking task taking it all out after all that work to put it 
all in on the bright side rooney does have 47 minutes 
theyre doing the decade on the cbs evening news in two 
sevenminute sections he marvels how the hell do they do 
that

perhaps no decade this century has begun amid 
greater economic unpheaval challenge and potential than the 1990s 
and it isnt due solely to the fall of communist regimes in eastern 
europe 
western europe too is in the midst of historic changes scheduled 
to begin in little more than a year with integration of the 
european economic community japan is facing adjustments because of 
competition 
the american challenge is as big as any of them it must 
solidify the great accomplishments of the 1980s bring down 
inflation steer the way through an economic downturn reduce the 
trade deficit and balance budgets 
japan which ascended to economic dominance in many trade areas 
during the 1980s is faced with demands to make its economy more 
receptive to imports to reduce its trade surplus and perhaps to 
develop its infrastructure 
china is trying to lift itself to world economic standards in 
the production of goods hong kong faces a change of sponsorship 
from britain to china taiwan south korea singapore and other 
small asian nations face the challenge of remaining competitive 
while lifting living standards 
confronted with evidence of superior lifestyles in more highly 
developed countries much of africa latin america and the mideast 
are in political and economic ferment that no longer can be 
repressed 
amid the confusion there are few blueprints for the future so 
carefully defined as that of the european economic community there 
is no clear procedure for turning centrally planned economies into 
market economies 
nor is there time to develop plans instant communication 
produces instant change but contributes little toward identifying 
programs for carrying out the changes the demands for change are 
swift the implementation remains slow 
through all of the changes however there is at least one 
constant factor opportunity 
for major trading nations it means new markets for 
underdeveloped nations it means the chance to radically lift 
depressed living standards for all nations it means a more 
productive allocation of resources and skills 
managed well the changes could be a great leap forward for the 
world community prospects for western europe for example already 
had brightened with the scheduled removal of trade barriers among 
12 nations in 1992 
now says albert cox jr economic analyst with the investment 
counseling firm bil trainer wortham inc there is the 
possibility of massive growth in international trade in the next 10 
years 
if that happens he concludes history tells us that greatly 
enhanced world economic prosperity will be the end result 
no matter what economic changes occur throughout the world they 
are bound to have an impact on domestic politics and economic 
direction within the united states 
already washington is debating the possibilities of the 
socalled peace dividend or billions of dollars in funds that 
supposedly will be available as a result of a cutback in defense 
programs but that is only the beginning 
if the worlds experimentation with market economies continues 
it will provide a showcase for those seeking to direct the american 
economy toward the most efficient ends 
conceivably it could even mean an approach to that longsought 
american goal of shrinking the federal government while maintaining 
and even improving services to the public

the soviets couldnt move into their chancery until the united 
states moved into its chancery in moscow that was by agreement 
one of several that took 13 years to reach in tense careful 
negotiations every major move had to be precise simultaneous and 
symmetrical it was like two mafia families trying to arrange a 
truce for a wedding 
it took less than two years to build the 102story empire state 
building in new york in 1931 in moscow the soviets were into year 
seven and still not finished with the eightstory office building 
of the us embassy when the united states threw them out 
the problem was bugs mysterious multitudinous ubiquitous 
antiamerican subversive preglasnost godless russian communist 
bugs 
in columns and walls in concrete and steel in breathtaking 
numbers and novel ways that confounded american experts we were 
told the soviets had sown the chancery with diabolic devices to 
overhear record and transmit american secrets 
the united states refused to move in until the bugs were moved 
out but getting them out appeared tougher than evicting a poor 
relative so tough in fact two administrations spent four years 
figuring out what to do both concluded the only safe course was to 
build a new building 
historically there is no louder uproar among politicians and 
press than the thunder evoked by the suggestion that foreigners 
especially the backward soviets had outwitted uncle sam the 
devilish dither of the embassies had all the makings 
sites after 10 years of negotiations we gave them mount alto 
along wisconsin avenue one of the highest points in washington 
they gave us a plot along konyushovskaya ulitsa down near the 
moscow river 
uproar the united states had given away a strategic height from 
which electronically the kgb could look down the throats of the 
white house and pentagon 
the view is terrific but the intelligence advantage is 
considerably less said james schlesinger former director of 
the central intelligence agency whats more other witnesses 
testified mount alto was not the soviets first choice for an 
embassy and in moscow the united states had turned down an offer 
of lenin hills to be downtown the highlow plot wouldnt play 
sidewalks a hearing of the subcommittee international 
operations of the house committee on foreign affairs back from 
moscow rep dan mica dfla reported where the new building 
is the soviets built us a 16inch sidewalk so that there is no 
place to walk that is harassment 
rep olympia snowe rmass asked if the state department 
pursued a reciprocity of harassment in building the soviet 
embassy in washington she seemed to think it should 
james e nolan director of the office of foreign missions 
replied in the district of columbia one does not cut down 
sidewalk size in half simply because the state department thinks it 
is a good time to do it or because we think that it is leverage to 
do it 
off site here was the real trouble in washington americans 
poured concrete for the soviet embassy on site where the soviets 
could watch in moscow soviets poured concrete off site where 
americans couldnt or didnt watch 
the soviet union works at the problem of security penetration 
24 hours a day 365 days a year testified schlesinger who 
investigated the embassy muddle for president ronald reagan if 
one signs an agreement that permits the soviets to precast columns 
and beams off site the principal party to blame is oneself as 
napoleon once observed there are limits to rascality there are no 
limits to stupidity 
the result said the expert witness was the bestbugged 
building ever built 
it contained a full array of intelligence devices for which we 
do not yet understand either the technology or underlying strategy 
we failed to allow for the boldness thoroughness and extent of 
the penetration 
during the building of their embassy in washington the 
suspicious soviets watched every blow of the hammer for every 
american working said an american official observer of the soviet 
observers there was a soviet watching 
they xrayed every inch of steel before it went up said an 
architect they watched concrete poured on site if the work went 
too fast to watch carefully they slowed the work they insisted 
that window units assembled off site be disassembled and 
reassembled before their eyes 
one result of their vigilance the soviets alleged was the 
discovery of pencilthin microphones in the walls and bugging wires 
in the weatherstripping of the windows put there by their american 
hosts 
another result the windows now leak 
both embassy complexes include a chancery or office building 
consulate residential apartments school gym swimming pool 
playground theater und underground garages 
the new soviet compound is in a residential area of washington 
the new us embassy in moscow like the old us embassy next 
door is surrounded by highrisers where it is assumed the kgb is 
in constant attendance

across the street is an old russian church no longer used as 
such among american intelligence people who say the place is 
loaded with electronic equipment for monitoring its neighbors the 
old church is now known as our lady of telemetry 
such was their mutual distrust the superpowers needed 10 years 
to agree on an exchange of sites to be used free of charge for 85 
years the united states got 119473 acres in moscow the ussr 
got 125258 acres in washington 
it took three more years to agree on conditions of 
construction in two stages each using local labor and materials 
in stage one and each using a mutually agreed maximum number of 
their own specialists imported for the second or finishing stage 
the original agreements stipulated simultaneous exchange of 
sites simultaneous completion of construction simultaneous 
occupancy of the chanceries they also agreed to exchange 
architects drawings and each would have veto power over the other 
and since the soviet union had no market economy on which to base 
costs they agreed that cost calculation for the moscow 
construction would be based on washington prices 
congress originally appropriated 192 million for the whole 
project now says a state department official it will be asked to 
come up with 270 million more for the new chancery it will cost 
that much because to play safe all the labor will have to be 
brought in from the united states at american scale to build a 
building free of soviet ears 
time schedules meticulously negotiated by the superpowers bent 
in the fluctuating heat of their cold war and the numbing pace of 
soviet labor 
it took two years to finish most of the embassy in washington 
the soviets moved into the residential and support quarters in 
1979 it took seven years to complete the equivalent in moscow and 
the americans moved into those in 1986 
all work had stopped the united states had locked out all 
soviet employees the year before for building an office building 
abounding in intentional defects 
the invisible presence in the woodwork should have surprised no 
one in moscow spying on visitors was older than borscht the 
czars kept informers busy and their proletarian heirs bugged the 
american embassy for years 
so regularly that guests at spasso house the ambassadors 
residence were given cards welcoming and warning them 
every room is monitored by the kgb and all of the staff are 
employees of the kgb we believe the garden also may be monitored 
your luggage may be searched two or three times a day nothing is 
ever stolen and they hardly disturb things if you have 
anything sensitive to talk about please call and make an 
appointment with the ambassador to discuss it in his office 
the soviets liked ambassador w averill harriman so much that 
they gave him a handsome replica of the great seal of the united 
states it was years before the next ambassador found a tiny 
microphone nestled in the carved wooden eagle 
americans have also found they said more than 40 mikes in the 
walls of the old chancery bugs in electronic typewriters signs of 
microwave assaults on the building wires leading to a tunnel 
between the embassy and a nearby soviet apartment building and 
traces of a spy dust called nitrophenylpentadienal by which the 
movements of people and objects could be tracked 
unintentional defects were equally hard on the psyche of 
americans trying to get a new embassy built in the land of lenin 
which brings us to a tale of bricks told with a lingering shudder 
by charles bassett chief architect 
the plans called for the eightstory chancery to be faced in 
brick no problem said the soviets bassett quickly found 
problems available soviet bricks were rough and unattractive 
lithuania looked promising but that didnt pan out likewise the 
kilns of western europe 
finally the right bricks were produced in augusta ga and 
more than a million were carefully strapped and packaged on pallets 
and shipped by boat to helsinki and by train to moscow tenderly 
chaperoned all the way by americans there the soviets had to be 
stopped from ruining the bricks by heaving them into dump trucks 
for delivery 
then bassett watched with horror as soviet bricklayers went to 
work using no strings or levels and setting bricks from inside a 
wall on irregular lines among soviet workers meeting quotas was 
allimportant it didnt matter if the wall fell down the next 
day 
all work was stopped until master masons with proper tools could 
be flown in from the united states to teach and supervise and it 
was stopped again with the discovery of the bugs before the 
building was closed in properly and the welltraveled bricks could 
be protected from the weather 
in their original negotiations in what seems like another age of 
man the two parties set up a cumbersome process to arbitrate 
disputes the united states has since claimed 299 million in 
damages resulting from soviet delays and defective work it has 
also given notice of intention to claim an undetermined amount for 
intentional defects the ussr struck back with damage 
claims for 18 million resulting from us delays settlement is 
not just around the corner 
proving he was no imprudent country bumpkin uncle sam took out 
a 42 million policy with the granite state insurance co 20 years 
ago this was to insure the government against unforeseen and 
sudden physical loss or damage during construction 
when last heard from the state department had collected 14287 
from granite state to cover the theft of construction materials 
from the construction site on konyushkovskaya ulitsa 
among the exclusionary clauses of the policy the complex is not 
insured against damage from defects intentional or unintentional 
and should the united states embassy in moscow be destroyed by 
nuclear war granite state makes clear it will not pay

once considered a miracle fiber asbestos is now 
recognized as a serious health threat and will be taken off the 
us market in a series of bans beginning this year but for 
utility workers like kevin quinn who says he was exposed to 
asbestos on the job the damage may already have been done 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
kevin quinns father began working for 
consolidated edison in the 1940s when asbestos was still 
considered a miracle fiber and no regulations governed its use 
william quinn died in 1980 of cancer linked to asbestos 
his son was hired by the same utility in 1979 in the years 
since his father first came in contact with asbestos numerous laws 
had been passed to protect workers from what was now acknowledged 
as a prime health risk 
but in 1987 quinn says he was working at a plant when 
asbestoscovered doors were removed from boilers and dropped to the 
floor the doors remained for weeks while workers went about their 
duties without protective gear amid clouds of asbestos dust he 
says 
i used to walk past that area every day he says they 
told us it was safe and it turns out it wasnt 
now quinn has joined 180 coworkers and the environmental 
protection agency in suing con ed charging that he was exposed to 
the same material that killed his father 
eighteen years after passage of the first federal law regulating 
asbestos thousands of workers at utilities like con ed and in 
other industries where asbestos was used as an insulator still 
face its effects 
we are talking to people who are extremely surprised that 
asbestos is still a problem said heather maurer executive 
director of asbestos victims of america but the incidence of 
asbestos disease is on the increase instead of the decrease 
despite restrictions that have been applied to make the use of 
asbestos safer 
a recent unionsponsored screening of 538 con edison workers 
found that 20 percent had either scarred lungs or mesothelioma an 
asbestoscaused cancer of the lining of the abdomen or the lungs 
since 1987 con ed has been cited by the occupational safety and 
health administration for more than a halfdozen alleged violations 
mostly failure to monitor the level of asbestos fibers in the air 
at the indian point nuclear plant in buchanan a plant in 
astoria queens and at quinns 74th street plant in manhattan 
some allegations are still under investigation some have been 
contested and dropped by osha and con ed settled others by paying 
a fine 
prior to 1973 we didnt know what the asbestos risks were 
said con ed spokeswoman rosalie zuckerman were not denying that 
prior to that time there was exposure but now that were aware of 
it whenever we do any asbestos work we follow all the 
regulations 
she added that since 1973 the company has had two medical vans 
visiting con ed plants carrying xray machines to test for 
asbestos scarring 
she would not comment on kevin quinns suit but quinn says the 
company was negligent in 1987 when he was exposed the workers he 
says were kept in the dark 
we didnt realize we were working around asbestos til a shop 
steward took an air sample to the white lung association he said 
because asbestos cancers can take 20 to 35 years to develop 
workers like quinn who believe they have been exposed recently may 
not become sick until the year 2020 and people who were exposed to 
asbestos in the 1950s 60s and 70s are just now getting sick 
a study by dr irving selikoff perhaps the worlds most noted 
asbestos researcher and his colleagues at the mount sinai school 
of medicine projects that asbestos cancer rates wont peak until 
1992 and wont drop off significantly until after the year 2000 
smoking exacerbates the risk of asbestosrelated lung cancer 
which is incurable in 70 to 95 percent of cases said dr stephen 
levin who works with selikoff mesothelioma is always fatal 
asbestos exposure also increases the risk of colon cancer which 
has an 80 percent cure rate if caught early 
the study predicts that 9739 deaths from asbestos exposure will 
be recorded in 1992 in just 11 industries including utilities 
construction car and railroad engine repair shipbuilding and 
asbestos manufacturing 
many con ed workers fear they might surface among those 
statistics 
gene duffy 46 has worked for con edison for 25 years his 
chest xrays show lung scarring he often has trouble breathing 
duffy said he cant even cut his lawn without taking a rest halfway 
through to catch his breath 
artie sagevick 58 a 31year veteran he gave up smoking 25 
years ago but he has coughing fits 15 minutes at a time a couple 
of times a day 
says steven amato a 21year employee if you had to do a 
strenuous job go up and down stairs i could not do it in the 
wintertime i throw the phlegm all day long im 51 years old 
and i feel like an old man 
all three want compensation from con ed more help from their 
union and along with many of their coworkers they are suing 
asbestos manufacturers 
lawyer chris placitella is handling similar suits by 130 con ed 
workers his firm represents 3300 additional workers from other 
utility companies who are involved in similar suits and the number 
of plaintiffs rises daily 
con edison has other asbestosrelated worries city officials 
have raised concerns about public exposure to asbestos from con ed 
accidents in several recent incidents asbestos insulation wrapped 
around underground con ed steam pipes has blown off when the pipes 
or nearby water mains burst 
one explosion killed three people and contaminated manhattans 
entire gramercy park neighborhood with asbestos forcing hundreds 
of people to relocate 
con ed was faulted for failing to report the presence of 
asbestos for several days which delayed the cleanup and increased 
health risks other accidents contaminated streets and subways 
the city department of environmental protection has called on 
federal officials to come up with new techniques to deal with these 
outdoor and underground emergencies since the usual procedures 
have not always applied 
most asbestos products will be taken off the us market under a 
threestage epa ban that begins in 1990 and ends in 1997 advocates 
for asbestos victims applaud the ban but wish more were being done 
asbestos manufacturers have filed a lawsuit challenging the ban 
claiming todays products are safe because the fiber is encased in 
hard materials like cement and wont deteriorate 
whether or not the manufacturers are successful aflcio 
occupational safety expert peg seminario predicts its going to 
be some time before our asbestos problems are over

they get most of their training in the slums and 
ghettos of the inner cities but officers of the salvation army 
also must go to a special school for two years its a tough school 
to enter and a tough school to stay in 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
more than a century ago salvation army founder 
william booth bade his charges go for souls and go for the 
worst from a brick campus on the edge of atlanta officer 
candidates spend two years in classes and working in ghettos 
preparing to carry out that order 
the public image of the salvation army is that of a brass band 
the rattle of a tambourine and a bluehooded woman on the corner 
with a bell and an iron kettle 
less visible are the officer cadets men and women in their blue 
uniforms and sensible shoes who some day will run one of americas 
most leastunderstood churches yes it is a church a worldwide 
one with more than 260000 members in the united states alone 
it costs the salvation army about 40000 to put a cadet through 
the training program described by maj phillip needham principal 
of the atlanta officer school as a total immersion heavy in 
handson fieldwork usually in atlantas inner city 
the school one of four in the country has about 90 students 
the others are located in chicago a suburb of new york city and in 
ranch palo verdes in the los angeles area 
typically needham says about half of the students who are 
commissioned will stick with the work until mandatory retirement at 
age 65 most will start helping run smaller salvation army missions 
or other programs and advance from there probably in the south and 
probably not in their home areas 
work will include organizing shelters for the homeless 
christmas dinners and summer camps for poor kids helping poor 
families with rent and food money and of course spreading the 
word 
classes run the range from bible study to social work to 
computer programming its a tough school to enter a tough one to 
stay in many who make it are dropped usually within five years of 
graduation 
some cant set limits for themselves needham says 
caregivers want to help they are oriented that way and some 
people overextend themselves they dont realize that they cannot 
be all things to all people 
about twothirds of the cadets are married and both husband and 
wife must be in the program 
the average cadet here is 27 probably finished high school and 
comes from a salvation army church in the 15 southern states and 
the district of columbia that the atlanta training school serves 
cadets live on campus and are not allowed to work during the two 
years they get a barebones budget for basic needs and can look 
ahead to more of the same 
an officer couple with more than 20 years in the program and two 
teenage children receive living quarters a car and about 250 a 
week that may increase slightly with years of service but not 
with rank 
there is no financial incentive needham says were 
comfortable but we dont have any money 
needham and his wife keitha both are fifthgeneration 
salvation army officers and one of their children is interested in 
signing on needham holds graduate degrees from princeton and emory 
universitys candler school of theology but that much education is 
rare 
this is not primarily an educational institution needham 
says educational institutions tend to create reactive modes 
with students regurgitating what the teacher tells them 
we prefer to nurture proactive leaders who find their own 
talents and their own leadership abilities formal education is low 
on our list we seek out people with basic competencies 
the school insists on a 12thgrade reading capability and 
candidates undergo rigorous psychological testing and interviews 
before being accepted 
minorities are encouraged needham says and hispanics 
especially are heeding the call black enrollment has begun to 
increase 
aside from salvation army officers there are soldiers and 
adherents adherents needham says consider the salvation army 
to be their church but do not submit to the discipline 
soldiers and officers for example cannot use tobacco or 
alcohol adherents can 
most of the training is done in slums and ghettos of inner 
cities much like the east london slums where the salvation army 
was founded in 1865 
booth needham says broke off from the methodist church to 
create an evangelistic ministry that would inspire the working 
class poor and get them into established churches 
but the local churches didnt want them he says they 
were smelly they dressed shabbily they couldnt afford pew 
rental so they went back and the salvation army became their 
church it adopted and retains a workingclass culture 
in britain a brass band is a working mans orchestra its 
tremendously popular 
the iron collection kettle originated in san francisco about 100 
years ago when the salvation army was collecting relief funds for 
families of victims of a shipwreck 
it worked

with public financing of higher education waning 
and the pool of potential freshmen dwindling college alumni 
associations across the country are following the example set by 
the university of michigan long known for its fundraising 
success 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
twice a year 84yearold bert wertman 
makes the sixhour drive from his home in buffalo ny to his 
alma mater the venerable 172yearold campus of the university of 
michigan 
wertman who graduated in 1928 from the school of business 
administration returns to meet with other former directors of the 
alumni association to discuss the universitys future much of 
which depends on alumni support 
its a continuous selling job to keep students interested 
after they graduate wertman says and i still do my part 
spreading the gospel of michigan as i call it 
since graduating 61 years ago wertman has kept track of his 26 
classmates of the class of 28 bringing the remaining few together 
for reunions and keeping them active in university affairs 
its his contribution to a vast network that tries to keep track 
of some 330000 alumni more than any other college or university 
in the country according to the new york citybased council for 
aid to education 
in the last decade as public financing of higher education has 
decreased and the pool of potential freshman has shrunk 
statefunded colleges and universities have taken a lesson from 
michigans longestablished alumni programs considered one of the 
most successful in the country even among its private counterparts 
our job is to cultivate alumni and keep them informed about 
whats going on here and the challenges were facing says robert 
forman executive director of the michigan alumni association for 
25 years 
that might involve an alumni associationsponsored african 
safari one of 35 trips abroad this year a week at one of the 
universitys two family summer camps or a few courses at the alumni 
university a summer school for past grads 
of course the highlight for the second consecutive year is an 
alumni trip to the rose bowl to root for the big ten football 
champion wolverines 
the bottom line is that the better alumni feel the more likely 
they are to reach for their checkbooks 
you used to find such professional programs only at your yales 
and harvards but in the last 10 years or so public institutions 
have gone after and cultivated their alumni with a similar degree 
of sophistication and success says paul miller vice president 
of the council for aid to education its gotten so now you can 
phone in your credit card number to contribute 
todays efforts to keep alumni interested in alma maters go 
beyond newsletters reunions and football telecast parties at local 
alumni clubs some associations have turned increasingly service 
oriented selling members insurance planning vacations and 
sponsoring continuing education courses 
the strategy seems to be working private support of colleges 
and universities has nearly tripled in the last 10 years says 
miller whose organization tracks higher education fund raising 
in 198788 alumni contributed about 2 billion to their alma 
maters up from 12 billion in 198283 and totaling 25 percent of 
all voluntary support at michigan about 22 million was raised by 
alumni not counting the corporate gifts that result from having an 
alumnus on the board of directors or in the chief executive 
officers seat 
but at michigan and many other colleges the alumni association 
rarely asks members for money thats the job of the universitys 
development office and its 17 individual colleges which mail out 
two or three requests a year 
the alumni association works closely with the fundraisers but 
is an independent selfsupporting organization with 80000 
duespaying members about onequarter of all michigan alumni 
while fund raising and recruiting students remain the goals of 
most alumni associations many also are enlisting members in a host 
of other activities from advice on curricula and graduation 
requirements to screening prospective students and providing 
externships in which students shadow alumni for a week or so to 
learn about prospective careers 
those schools who use alumni as a source for money only are 
missing the boat forman says 
some alumni clubs are even turning their efforts toward social 
service projects within their respective communities tutoring at 
innercity schools and volunteering at homeless shelters and soup 
kitchens says sarah hardesty vice president of communications for 
the council for advancement and support of education of washington 
dc 
a university of notre dame alumni club in washington dc is 
renovating apartments in a public housing project and a duke 
university club in the same city has adopted an innercity 
elementary school even small private institutions are getting 
into the act 
more than 100 members of the boston alumni club of williams 
college enrollment about 2100 regularly volunteer at a food 
bank 
we still have happy hours football telecast parties and golf 
outings but this is something we can get together and do for the 
community says notre dame grad sheila mcdaniel and it makes 
us feel good about where we went to school 
still reunions remain the mainstay of alumni contact michigan 
holds about 75 class reunions each year there are michigan alumni 
clubs in about 200 cities across the united states as well as a 
few in other countries in 1971 the allmichigan crew of apollo 15 
established the first extraterrestrial club when they planted a 
michigan flag on the moon 
the list of famous michigan alumni ranges from president gerald 
ford and general motors corp chairman roger b smith to rock star 
madonna and the late gilda radner it also includes john a 
dibiaggio president of big ten rival michigan state university 
alumni associations arent waiting until a student leaves the 
campus to get him or her thinking like alumni about 180 students 
are involved in michigans student alumni council at notre dame 
the first thing a student sees when he comes to the south bend 
ind campus is the mobile alumni association welcome wagon 
from day one i felt at home at michigan and ive never lost 
that feeling says virginia nicklas class of 49 and a former 
director and vice president of the alumni association she also 
travels to ann arbor twice a year for the directors meeting from 
her home in pennsylvania where she works in the development office 
at the university of pittsburgh 
though she received her graduate degree there her commitment to 
michigan runs deep shes always in the market for a new outfit in 
the schools colors of maize and blue 
it seems almost every place ive traveled in the world ive 
met u of m graduates and right away theres that common bond

three trekkies who began operating out of a 
basement in colorado have found theres money to be made in fan 
magazines and movie memorabilia theyre cashing in on the 
popularity of such tv and big screen hits as star trek star 
wars and back to the future 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
three high school buddies who started a 
modest newsletter for fellow star trek fans a decade ago are 
now managing a multimilliondollar nationwide enterprise 
star trek the official fan club is the creation of dan madsen 
john davis and robert allan who were drawn together by a common 
fascination with anything to do with star trek the television 
series that inspired subsequent movies 
the club today just part of the mens enterprise called fan 
clubs inc was inspired by the release of star trek the motion 
picture in 1979 madsen now president of fan clubs inc and 
publisher of the clubs magazines began putting out a small 
photocopied newsletter for fellow trekkies 
we ran the thing out of my basement madsen says you 
know there were posters and all kinds of star trek stuff on the 
walls 
madsen began with 15 subscribers to his newsletter today 
35000 people subscribe to the star trek fan magazine 
their club is licensed by paramount pictures as the only 
official star trek fan club fan clubs inc also operates fan 
clubs for back to the future and lucasfilms the movie company 
of george lucas producer of star wars and american 
graffiti headquarters is a nondescript building in an aurora 
business park 
allan estimates that fan club magazine sales will account for 
about 50 percent of the 1 million the company will earn this year 
up from 400 in earnings just three years ago he says that besides 
the 35000 subscribers to the star trek magazine the companys 
lucasfilms magazine has about 15000 readers the inaugural issue 
of the back to the future fan club magazine should have about 
16000 readers 
the men have high hopes for the back to the future magazine 
because of the release of the movie back to the future ii over 
the thanksgiving weekend 
the magazines are slick fourcolor publications averaging 25 
pages they feature interviews with stars letters to the editor 
behindthescenes looks at the technical wizardry and special 
effects of the movies and a list of upcoming conventions and 
events they also contain order forms for merchandise and 
classified advertisements for members who want to buy sell trade 
and swap 
allan says the magazines boast impressive renewal rates 
big magazines like time and newsweek are happy if they get a 
15 percent renewal rate he said back when we had 5000 
subscribers we had a 95 percent renewal rate now with 60000 
subscribers we have a 70 percent renewal rate thats nothing to 
laugh at 
the company also markets movie memorabilia such as star 
trek mugs and action figures and indiana jones fedoras 
merchandise sales have shot up from nothing two years ago to about 
500000 this year the entrepreneurs say 
allan says fan club members include lawyers 4yearolds 
grandmothers and priests schools and libraries subscribe as well 
the three men initially took some ribbing from friends and 
relatives who were skeptical of the fan clubs potential but they 
learned the necessary skills to make it a success 
madsen worked in a print shop where he learned how to lay out 
and design the newsletters davis got a college degree in english 
and allan worked as a waiter to make ends meet 
soon after they began marketing merchandise in 1982 paramount 
pictures contacted them 
they were concerned at first because we were operating and 
handling merchandise without a license madsen says but they 
saw our newsletter and they were fairly impressed so we signed a 
contract with them they thought it had the right amount of 
fanaticism and the right amount of professionalism they were 
looking for 
madsen davis and allan have since traveled around the world to 
meet and interview the stars of the movies and series they write 
about the license gives them exclusive rights to interviews and 
photographs and allows them to sell officially licensed merchandise 
the three admit that aurora isnt exactly where one might expect 
to find the official star trek fan club but davis says the 
location makes sense 
well we live here for one thing he said and denver is 
one of the hottest markets for star trek in the country we can 
do just as good a job from aurora as we could from california or 
new york we do a lot of phone interviews and travel when we have 
to 
allan says their respective interests may eventually take them 
to new frontiers 
were looking at expanding into rock fan clubs and celebrity 
fan clubs he says 
madsen says there may still be other prospects on the horizon 
were looking at films he says john has considered 
writing for movies or episodic television and ive always thought 
about being a director wed like to make our own movie 
eventually 
madsen says a genuine interest is what has made their efforts 
successful 
everything weve done so far was because we were fans of it 
were interested in what were doing he said 
it isnt just a business

tall and powerful craig t nelson seems right 
for the role as the tough federal agent in the forthcoming nbc 
miniseries drug wars the camarena story 
but nelson is equally at home doing comedy hes also currently 
starring in the comedy series coach which abc recently 
returned to its hit tuesday schedule coach had previously 
aired in the spring and summer 
in coach nelson plays hayden fox who at 45 clings to a 
coaching job in a small college that a younger man would regard 
only as a steppingstone his oldfashioned ideas bring him into 
conflict with the women in his life a coed daughter he had not 
seen in years his longtime girlfriend and a new college president 
who has some feminist ideas about sports 
curiously enough nelson began as a standup comic and comedy 
writerperformer but coach is the first comedy hes done after 
years of dramatic roles in feature motion pictures frequently as 
the heavy and in such series as chicago story and call to 
glory 
at one time no producer would even consider him for a dramatic 
role in 1972 he got so discouraged he packed up his family and 
moved into a log cabin with no electricity and no running water in 
a wilderness area 
after five years he hitchhiked back to los angeles and found a 
company willing to back a documentary series on people who drop out 
of society he tried to interest his former comedy partner barry 
levinson in helping him edit the series 
instead he found levinson had just written a movie called 
and justice for all levinson asked him to audition for a 
role and he was cast as the calculating prosecutor 
suddenly nelson became a much soughtafter actor for movies and 
television after a time people forgot he had done comedy 
drug wars which nbc will broadcast in three parts sunday 
monday and tuesday tells of the 1985 kidnapmurder of us drug 
enforcement administration agent enrique camarena in guadalajara 
mexico and its aftermath dea agents believe camarena was killed 
with the knowledge of mexican police and that a coverup reached 
the top levels of the mexican government the story is based on the 
book desperados by elaine shannon 
i play james jaime kuykendall the agent in charge of the 
guadalajara office although the name is changed to harley 
steinmetz nelson says hes a big texan softspoken with a 
drawl i talked with him several times because i needed to know how 
he reacted during certain situations 
he was reaching into areas that werent accessible to him and 
it was frustrating to him in one scene he watches the police 
question one of the men who interrogated camarena after his 
abduction he goes berserk because the questions are so absurd 
jaime confirmed that it was a very difficult time and some punches 
were thrown 
nelsons new show coach began with a call from 
producercreator barry kemp 
the idea of doing a comedy again really intrigued me he 
says people no longer thought of me as a comedy actor i liked 
what barry had in mind for the character hes a guy in a midlife 
crisis hes not necessarily a nice guy as a coach he hasnt been 
exposed to a lot of other values 
one of the things i liked is they wanted to bring him to a 
confrontation of his values and have him change through his 
daughter and girlfriend the ladies in his life have certain ideas 
of how he should be adapting to what they bring him but he doesnt 
see it that way 
nelson came to los angeles from arizona in 1967 after he 
received a scholarship to the oxford theater from the eddie cantor 
foundation 
i had a baby and a wife and a car that was falling apart he 
says i met barry who was also on a scholarship he was living 
in his car it smelled like cologne and cigarettes we teamed up 
and did a comedy act at various clubs and trade fairs it was a way 
to get into the business but at first i also had a job as a 
security guard and later as a security analyst 
during that time they worked as writers and performers on a 
lohman and barkley television variety series the tim conway 
comedy hour an alan king special and the john byner comedy 
hour 
nelson has not written any coach episodes but says he has a 
lot of input he is writing ideas for movies and other stories 
im doing right now exactly what i want to be doing he says

in the middle of the musical grand hotel a 
young german baron suddenly declares his feelings for an older 
woman a ballerina making the last of her many farewell tours 
he sings a passionate love song that soars from the stage and 
over the audience the singer is david carroll one of a new 
generation of goldenvoiced leading men making their mark on the 
broadway musical this season 
among the others are gregg edelman who plays a writer of 1940s 
detective novels and james naughton who plays the writers 
fictional creation in city of angels bob gunton who shaves 
beards and slits throats as the murderous barber in a revival of 
sweeney todd and cris groenendaal now starring in the 
longrunning but still soldout phantom of the opera in the 
tradition of alfred drake john raitt richard kiley and john 
cullum these men are performers who can act as well as sing 
carroll ranks among the best of them love cant happen his 
big number in grand hotel gets hearty applause its a 
smashing musical moment in a show that celebrates movement over 
music director and choreographer tommy tune never lets the story 
stop in this adaptation of vicki baums novel about the goingson 
in a luxury hotel in 1928 berlin 
and grand hotel may finally give the 39yearold carroll the 
long broadway run he deserves it almost happened in 1988 when he 
played the russian grandmaster in chess the show had a 
glorious score but a short life in new york although carroll got a 
tony nomination out of it 
most people remember grand hotel from the 1932 mgm movie 
not the novel the film starred john barrymore as the baron and 
greta garbo as the ballerina but the motion picture is not what is 
on stage at broadways martin beck theater 
were not doing the movie especially where my part is 
concerned carroll was saying the other day the baron is 
supposed to be much younger than the ballerina in the book its 
beautifully written when he sees her fragility and the wrinkles on 
her face thats what were playing 
i saw the movie on tv the other night and barrymore looked to 
be in his 50s and garbo looked younger than he was but they were 
doing louis b mayers version 
tune made sure everyone knew the novel he gave everyone in the 
cast a copy of it before they began rehearsals 
carroll has been with the show from its first workshop 
production last year the show rehearsed at the shabby hotel 
diplomat near the theater district the hotels oncesplendid 
ballroom provided the right ambiance for rehearsals and its 
architecture even inspired tony waltons set design 
tune the man behind such musical hits as the best little 
whorehouse in texas nine and my one and only reworked 
the show extensively in boston before bringing it to broadway in 
november 
the book was revised and maury yeston the composer of 
nine edited and augmented the original score by robert wright 
and george forrest it was yeston who wrote when love comes for 
the baron 
this song came along and all of a sudden it crystallized the 
two characters carroll says the ballerina finally said 
youre young and the baron finally said i like older women 
it hadnt been clear enough i dont think the audience could tell 
if i really like her or not if i was trying to pull the wool over 
her eyes that would have made me an unsympathetic character 
carroll has been stagestruck forever 
my parents had a lot of show albums he says as 
newlyweds they saw south pacific on a fluke about 11 days after 
it opened it was played a lot around the house 
growing up on long island and in connecticut with two brothers 
and two sisters carroll always sang we played the records and 
sang at the top of our lungs he recalls he also journeyed into 
manhattan to see musicals 
i saw oliver from the balcony and loved it of course i 
wanted to be one of those kids right away i went home and told my 
parents i was going to the high school of the performing arts like 
the kids on wonderama and that was it but it didnt quite work 
out that way 
dartmouth came first and detours into art and architecture 
but i was spending so much time in the theater department that 
i said lets try it 
since he started to sing professionally in 1974 carroll has 
worked in all kinds of musicals 
fortunately when i came to town i found a voice teacher who i 
still have he says he taught me how to sing so ill be able 
to sing until im 60 
carrolls resume is diverse he has done a revival of wheres 
charley and a revue called rodgers and hart and he sang 
opposite linda ronstadt in a pop englishlanguage version of la 
boheme he has also had his share of shortlived shows such as 
seven brides for seven brothers oh brother and wind in 
the willows 
i always liked doing musicals but i didnt want to be some 
stiff musical comedy leading man who couldnt dance and couldnt 
act carroll says i like doing the whole thing 
he got to california with the national tour of deathtrap 
starring brian bedford los angeles meant a lot of television 
movies playing roles such as valerie bertinellis husband or 
melissa gilberts boyfriend but the parts werent very challenging 
and the directors not inspiring he came back to new york in 1983 
and hasnt left 
i missed the theater and just realized i was more of a city 
person carroll says besides the driving drove me nuts im 
not a car person i dont have one in the city now and get along 
just fine as long as i can crank out eight performances a week

west europeans are looking anxiously eastward as 
they plunge ahead with elaborate plans for the 1990s in a climate 
changing so quickly that answers are coming faster than questions 
their grand design is a single europe of 12 economic 
community members starting at the end of 1992 a melting away of 
internal barriers and a blending of policies under the umbrella of 
the north atlantic treaty organization 
but after the berlin wall crumbled and as a 44yearold iron 
curtain buckles everything from the pace of integration to the 
overall strategy has been thrown into doubt 
some europeans suspect that against soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs image of a common european home the smaller 
single europe structure is a shaky house of cards 
nato is under mounting pressure to stand down in the face of 
former enemies who are now acting like friends 
the official view stressed at a european community summit at 
strasbourg in december is that a united western europe is crucial 
to helping eastern europe 
ec leaders moved closer to a central bank a common currency and 
uniform social benefits they also agreed to set up a bank of 
europe to help newly democratic eastern neighbors 
the ec called for a flexibility yet to be defined and most of 
its leaders applauded washingtons plans to support a stronger ec 
and to broaden nato into a political forum for solving problems 
us secretary of state james a baker iii speaking on a visit 
to berlin in december suggested a greater dialogue with the east 
not only on european problems but also to ease tensions elsewhere 
in the world 
as europe changes the instruments for western cooperation 
must adapt he said working together we must design and 
gradually put into place a new architecture for a new era 
whatever shape a new europe takes its leaders agree the 
cornerstone will be germany in many ways the divided nation has 
already united much hangs on how this union is formalized 
germany would grow from a reasonably sized ec partner to a 
colossus of 80 million inhabitants with a gross national product of 
14 trillion approaching the soviet unions 
without a separate east germany the soviet unions warsaw pact 
military alliance is reduced to a few satellites that are fast 
slipping away 
foreign minister hans dietrich genscher of west germany insists 
that a reunited germany would demilitarize europe and draw the 
soviet union and other eastern european countries closer to the ec 
but president francois mitterrand of france maintains it is too 
early to predict the direction europe now will take 
france clearly prefers separate germanys while publicly 
supporting the germans right to settle the issue themselves 
french leaders expect moscow to block any formal reunification 
other ec partners while encouraging the lightningfast changes 
take a similar stance for varying reasons 
spain portugal and greece fear investment and development funds 
they counted on will be diverted to the east italy argues that 
postwar borders should remain intact 
britain which has resisted ec monetary and social integration 
may find an ally in a west germany anxious to preserve some 
independence within a single europe 
but prime minister margaret thatcher after an emergency summit 
in november made it plain that britain was not anxious for a rapid 
blurring of eastwest lines in germany 
all military matters must continue to be conducted through 
nato and the warsaw pact she said at a time of great change 
its necessary to keep the background of stability and security 
in west germany reunification is already a dominant issue in 
general elections still a year off 
chancellor helmut kohl has thrown open the door and encouraged 
investment to speed unification in bonn west german officials 
already refer to the eastern part of the country 
if kohls centerright coalition stays in power it will have a 
mandate to push reunification in such circumstances kohl is 
likely to have reluctant support from mitterrand among others 
in broad terms western europes mood is buoyant the 
organization for economic cooperation and development estimates put 
growth at 27 percent for 1991 higher than in the united states 
the soviet union would like a share of that prosperity some 
officials say the soviets now prefer trade to domination in europe 
on dec 18 the soviet union and the ec signed a 10year trade 
pact opening the way for a larger western role in a changing 
soviet economy 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze remarked this is a 
result of a gigantic effort made by the peoples of europe to 
overcome political and military confrontation to overcome the 
economic division of our continent 
in short he said the cold war is over

an aging unpopular leadership a faltering 
economy and a restive population make for an uncertain and troubled 
future as china enters the last decade of the 20th century 
pessimists hold the field as china emerges from one of the worst 
of many bad years under communist party rule a year in which 
troops gunned down young demonstrators in the streets of beijing 
longnurtured ties with the west collapsed and a decade of economic 
reforms ground to a halt 
chinas goals for the end of the century the quadrupling of 
national income compared to 1980 the smooth reversion of hong kong 
to chinese sovereignty in 1997 and the triumphant staging of the 
olympic games in the year 2000 are all suspended in doubt 
the key question is how long china can resist the storms of 
change that have swept through the communist autocracies of the 
soviet union and eastern europe 
much depends on the health of the 85yearold deng xiaoping the 
pragmatist who brought prosperity to millions of chinese with his 
marketoriented reforms but who also represents the old 
revolutionaries using stalinist repression to stifle popular 
dissent 
dengs chosen successor is jiang zemin 63 a relative unknown 
who became head of the 48millionmember communist party in june 
after reformist zhao ziyang was accused of supporting the 
prodemocracy movement and purged from all his party posts 
jiang the former shanghai party boss is believed to favor 
economic reforms but following the current line has come across 
as a hardliner since taking office he needs time to develop his 
weak political base and cultivate his political image but if deng 
believed to be in frail health goes quickly jiang could face a 
rapid ride into oblivion 
his rivals for power are ideological conservatives such as 
premier li peng and octogenarian president yang shangkun 
their ascendancy would not mean a return to communes backyard 
steel mills and international isolation but it would accelerate 
the trend already in progress of reemphasizing central planning 
stifling private initiative and retreating on economic and 
political reforms 
their demand for unquestioning loyalty to the communist system 
and communist party rule also would put them on what many chinese 
feel is an inevitable collision course with the forces of reform 
the tiananmen square movement for a more democratic open 
society crushed by the military is quiescent but is certain to 
reemerge when the government lets down its guard events in 
eastern europe have bolstered beliefs that the chinese government 
cannot forever resist popular demand for reform 
tiananmen also has clouded chinas future relationship with hong 
kong and complicated its longterm goal of reuniting with taiwan 
the nationalist island 
china has promised not to touch hong kongs capitalist system 
for 50 years after the british depart in 1997 but the nearly 6 
million people of hong kong were badly shaken by the events of 
june setting off a wave of emigrations among the colonys most 
talented people that is likely to continue until 1997 
the rival nationalist government on taiwan in recent years has 
eased restrictions on trade with and visits to the mainland 
raising chinas hopes of eventual reunification but tiananmen 
reinforced anticommunist sentiments on the island and probably 
strengthened the growing movement for taiwanese independence 
internationally chinas relations with the west will remain at 
a subnormal level as long as suppression of political dissent is an 
issue that could spell bad news for the nations economic 
planners who badly need western investment and technology to carry 
out the modernization drive 
the bloom is off the rose said one western economist who 
noted that western businessmen will be inclined to spend their 
money in more politically palatable places like eastern europe or 
the soviet union 
investors are also concerned about the current governments 
backsliding on reforms and moves to reestablish the primacy of 
central planning fixed pricing and party influence in the work 
place 
a retrenchment program to continue at least until 1991 has had 
some success in cooling an overheated economy and bringing down 
inflation 
but china is seen by outside experts as being unable to compete 
with other rising economic powers such as taiwan and south korea 
unless it pushes ahead with reforms notably making prices 
correspond to market value 
economists see a possibility of china becoming another 
yugoslavia where high expectations for reform were followed by 
poor followthrough and years of dismal performance 
beijings leaders trying to reassert state authority over the 
economy also are likely to run into a growing trend of 
provincialism and regional rivalries fostered over the last decade 
when local powers were delegated greater autonomy there is a real 
danger that the provinces such as the prosperous southern china 
area near hong kong will increasingly defy orders from beijing 
china with 11 billion people now will have nearly 200 million 
more mouths to feed in the year 2000 and must substantially improve 
its stagnating agricultural output if it is to remain 
selfsufficient 
the nation faces other staggering problems 
repayment of international debts of 44 billion reaches a peak 
period in the early 1990s and the government will be hard pressed 
to find the hard currency 
the education system is badly underfunded and little headway is 
being made in reducing an illiteracy rate of 20 percent more than 
200 million people 
the average annual income is less than 300 a person the urban 
housing situation is abysmal and the welfare system surprisingly 
inadequate for a socialist country more than 20 percent of the 
labor force is said to be surplus or redundant and little is being 
done to prepare the nation for a serious unemployment problem 
china in transition is a china that will be struggling to 
resolve formidable contradictions us ambassador james lilley 
said in a recent speech 
it may be some years before we can put a name or theme to the 
new chapter china will write in the 1990s in the meantime we must 
be prepared for twists and turns that may defy attempts to label as 
pragmatic or political liberal or conservative reform or 
retrogressive

efforts to end the arabisraeli conflict 
and other disputes in the middle east are slow but growing 
superpower detente could nudge the region toward greater stability 
in the 1990s 
iraniraq peace talks have stalled and both sides are rearming 
amid a widening proliferation of longrange missiles in the region 
this is eroding israels longheld technological superiority and 
heightening superpower concern of a new arms race including 
nuclear and chemical weapons in the volatile region 
the pace of the arabisraeli peace process is unlikely to gather 
momentum for some time until israels rightwing prime minister 
yitzhak shamir relaxes his hardline position of refusing to 
negotiate with yasser arafats palestine liberation organization 
many observers believe this is unlikely unless there is intense 
pressure from washington shamir at odds with a faction of his own 
likud party as well as his labor coalition partners is in no 
position to start making concessions 
egypt is expected to remain the crucial mediator between israel 
with whom it signed a peace treaty in 1979 the palestinians and 
other arab states in trying to reach a comprehensive mideast peace 
settlement 
the current focal point of the peace process is a 10point plan 
produced by egypts president hosni mubarak designed to break the 
deadlock over israels blueprint for elections in the troubled 
occupied west bank and gaza strip torn by a palestinian uprising 
for the last two years 
the main stumbling block is the israeli governments refusal to 
negotiate with palestinians they believe will speak for arafats 
plo 
arafat backed by the arab league insists there can be no peace 
conference not attended by the plo which arabs acknowledge as the 
palestinians sole representative 
despite israeli claims the uprising is foundering it shows no 
sign of collapsing the fear is that if there is no discernible 
progress in the peace process it will intensify 
analysts believe arafat after publicly renouncing terrorism and 
recognizing israels right to exist has gone as far down the road 
to moderation as he can without alienating the plos hardliners 
a yearold dialogue with the united states has failed to result 
in washington jarring any concessions from the israelis failure to 
produce substantive results will leave arafat exposed and his peace 
initiative discredited from within the plo 
hardliners like george habash of the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine have made clear their patience is running 
out 
the arabisraeli peace process which has dragged on for more 
than 20 years with only egypts peace treaty to show for it has a 
profound impact on the regions other conflicts 
this is most pronounced in lebanon the middle easts proxy 
battleground where the arab league was finally jolted into taking 
forceful action to end 14 years of civil war 
but the peace settlement it brokered has stalled because the 
christian leader gen michel aoun rejects it citing its failure 
to provide castiron guarantees of a syrian withdrawal 
the syrians their efforts to pacify their unruly neighbor 
thwarted yet again by lebanese christians are becoming frustrated 
and may yet move against aoun 
radical syria which needs lebanon as a security buffer between 
itself and israel is likely to come under pressure from moscow to 
moderate its stand on the overall middle east settlement as detente 
improves 
moscow increasingly crucial to the peace process after years of 
being edged out by washington is already seeking to persuade syria 
to abandon its drive for military parity with israel 
the kremlin increasingly concerned with economic and social 
upheaval at home has made clear that syria must end its rifts with 
iraq egypt and the plo to achieve the longelusive arab unity that 
is a prerequisite for an international peace conference 
iran syrias ostensible ally also is in transition following 
the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and the election of 
hashemi rafsanjani leader of the socalled pragmatists as 
president last summer 
he seeks to open up iran after a decade of isolation attract 
western investment and technology to revitalize the moribund 
economy following the 1988 ceasefire in the 8year war with iraq 
he is opposed by revolutionary hardliners and much will depend 
on whether he can fend off the challenge and ease economic 
hardships for irans 55 million population growing at an alarming 
35 percent a year 
if he can one key consequence could be the release of western 
hostages held by proiranian militants in lebanon and the removal 
of a major source in instability in the region

at the dawn of a new decade key far east nations 
are growing economically stronger pulled along by the mighty japan 
japans economy is predicted to hum along at an annual growth 
rate close to 5 percent the best among the big industrial 
democracies and the powerful engine helping other fastgrowing 
economies like south korea taiwan hong kong and singapore the 
little dragons 
the only real problem japan faces as the 1990s begin is in the 
political realm the governing probusiness liberal democratic 
party beset by scandals and an unpopular tax is heading for a 
crucial election most likely in february 
the japanese electorate will have a chance to pass judgment on 
whether the cozy governmentbusiness relationship that has helped 
make japan rich is too corrupt to continue the result is hard to 
predict though it seems likely that a political stalemate will 
harden doing nothing to change japans postwar reputation for 
sterile politics 
japan and the little dragons harnessed welleducated dedicated 
work forces to the aim of exporting with the huge us market as 
the target their success however has finally stung the american 
giant into demanding reciprocal export markets 
the old formula for economic success in the far east thus is in 
question and countries are increasingly looking to each other as 
markets with washingtons backing and initial membership a 
conference of asiapacific nations was held in australia in 1989 to 
improve economic coordination 
japans overall trade surplus has declined but the troublesome 
surplus with the united states seems stuck around 50 billion a 
year american demands for quality japanese consumer products 
machinery and hightech gear are unlikely to abate 
trade negotiators will be busy for the foreseeable future as 
washington seeks greater sales in japans market the us strategy 
now is to change fundamental ways of doing business in japan and 
us officials can expect tough slogging 
traveling right behind the negotiators are businessmen from the 
united states and many other countries seeking niches in 
japans lucrative market 
other countries in the region will be similar targets of the 
international businessman and like japan the explorer will find 
in them vibrant local markets and complex political situations 
hong kong for instance the british colony is to revert to 
chinese rule in 1997 and the question now is how many of the 56 
million people will still be in hong kong then the colonys morale 
slumped in june when the chinese army stamped out the prodemocracy 
movement and the future of hong kong depends on developments in 
beijing and london 
china casts a shadow over other far eastern economies it had 
become a key source of cheap labor and land for businesses 
searching for lower overhead costs the stunning political 
repression in beijing set back many plans for investment in china 
while south korea and taiwan moved forward with democratic 
political reforms the philippines young democracy took a heavy 
shock in december with a bloody military coup attempt the 
mutineers probably shot as many holes in the countrys chances for 
strong economic growth as they shot in the highrises of the makati 
district of manila where the coup sputtered out 
elsewhere in southeast asia malaysia thailand and indonesia 
are bidding to follow the regions other new economic powers 
cambodia is in perpetual civil war and vietnam is so poor that its 
citizens are still fleeing almost 15 years after the indochina war 
ended 
vietnam however may be a new entry in the regions 
economicgrowth stakes if it is able to shed the pariah status it 
earned by invading cambodia 
the vietnamese occupation officially ended in september after 10 
years an indication of how long it can take to make a political 
change in the region burma for instance remains stuck with an 
authoritarian government 
and north koreas communist regime still under the helmsmanship 
of kim il sung after 44 years was not steering to east 
europeanstyle political changes as the decade ended the leaders 
son and possible successor kim jong il said the north korean 
party must on no account admit heterogeneous ideas into it in 
party activity the unity of action based on a single ideology can 
be realized through monolithic leadership

the idyllic south pacific saw its first 
coups political violence and secessionist battles in the 1980s 
but in the decade ahead the century of the pacific beckons and 
the island states expect to have a small but assertive voice in the 
world 
speaking in unison across a vast expanse of water will be the 
voices of a new generation of postcolonial leaders with 
intractible problems malnutrition fragile economies with scant 
export prospects and urban unemployment brought on by villagers 
flocking to towns with increased expectations 
one of the continuing difficulties of the small island states 
is that many will remain dependent on foreign aid and in some 
respects more in the past as they continue to grapple with these 
problems said an australian government offiical 
the decade of the 1980s saw unprecented turmoil in the region 
fiji had two racially inspired military coups civil lawlessness 
in papua new guinea claimed more than 50 lives the capitals of 
vanuatu and french polynesia suffered destructive rioting 
hostagetaking in new caledonia triggered a bloody french assault 
added to that was a perceived soviet military threat to the 
region concern about moscows growing economic inroads and anxiety 
that libya was making a foothold in an area better known for its 
tranquility and palmfringed lagoons than as a political hothouse 
covering 22 percent of the worlds surface the south pacific is 
home to 5 million people excluding australia and new zealand 
environmental problems like depletion of the ozone layer over 
antarctica and the earths global warming has caused serious 
concern in a region of lowlying atolls that could be swamped by 
seas swollen by melting polar ice 
the future of antarctica is assured a big debate as countries 
like australia push for protected wilderness status against others 
who view the worlds last great wilderness as a minerals treasure 
house 
if for nothing else that will happen because of the sheer 
importance of antarctica in regard to the worlds weather 
patterns said the australian official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
driftnet fishing the casting of huge nets over a large area of 
the sea to scoop up tons of fish at once was a problem virtually 
unheard of six months ago but it moved into world forums after 
island governments banded together to draw up an international 
convention and propose united nations resolutions that forced japan 
and taiwan to scale down the practice 
the 1980s gave birth to an antinuclear new zealand and the 
declaration of a south pacific nuclear free zone adopted by 15 
island states 
they are increasingly becoming very effective in articulating 
their point of view and building up cooperation among member 
states said the australian official 
it is a small but growing voice helped by a new generation of 
more assertive leaders 
against that he said there are no new bonanzas looming that 
are going to provide them with any riches 
the concept of the century of the pacific took a first 
tentative step in 1989 when 12 major pacific rim countries 
including the united states met in canberra australia to plan 
the future 
they agreed to meet again in singapore in early 1990 and 
probably again in bangkok thailand later in the year to plan an 
asianpacific cooperative venture an idea all agreed was one 
whose time has come 
the canberra meeting brought together us secretary of state 
james a baker iii with his counterparts from japan south korea 
australia new zealand thailand singapore malaysia the 
philippines brunei canada and indonesia they represented 19 
billion people and 280 billion in transpacific trade 50 percent 
more than transatlantic trade 
the meeting was described by us state department officials as 
the most important economic initiative in 50 years

afghanistan pakistan india and sri 
lanka a swath of turbulence through south asia enter the 1990s 
still trying to sort out their individual and overlapping destinies 
each of the four nations is on the threshhold of change 
teetering between the possibility for passable stability and the 
specter of more chaos political military or both 
the most dramatic conflagrations are the two wars anchoring each 
end of this geographical arc that begins at afghanistan and ends in 
sri lanka off southern india 
afghanistans civil war through the 1980s was a proxy 
battlefield for the ideological war and balance of power between 
the united states and the soviet union with the red armys 
withdrawal in early 1989 the superpower involvement is less overt 
but not yet over 
in contrast sri lankas tangle of ethnic and political killing 
is one of those messy and obscure wars that have little bearing on 
the affairs of other nations 
for india and pakistan the coming decade offers a testing 
ground for democracy and a chance to continue the thaw of 
hostilities that took them to war three times in the past 
in indias case both the concept and practice of democracy have 
been entrenched since independence from britain in 1947 
but the derailment of the prime minister rajiv gandhi in 
novembers elections has given indians the opportunity to prove 
their democracy has truly come of age 
as new prime minister vp singh contends with his implausible 
coalition of hindu rightwingers secular centrists and 
increasingly anachronistic communists india will discover whether 
it can find enduring leadership outside the congress party dynasty 
of prime ministers that began with gandhis grandfather jawaharlal 
nehru and except for brief hiccoughs passed on to gandhis 
mother indira gandhi 
in his first few days of office singh took encouraging steps 
toward resolving the separatist sikh revolt in punjab and now must 
capitalize on them 
in pakistan which also became independent in 1947 when it was 
carved out of british india to give moslems a nation separate from 
the hindus democracy has had a far more spasmodic and difficult 
birth 
prime minister benazir bhutto who attained office through the 
ballot box in 1988 after the death of the coupinstalled president 
gen mohammad zia ulhaq must tread carefully her government 
supplanted 11 years of military rule but is still juggling an array 
of threats 
moslem fundamentalists reject the very idea of a woman heading a 
government less dogmatic politicians simply want their chance to 
grasp power and although the armed forces may have retreated from 
the front lines of political officeholding they are unwilling to 
relinquish their notsobehindthescenes power 
afghanistans president najib the exsecret police chief who 
with soviet backing muscled aside an even harsher kremlin protege 
in 1986 has proved an adept player of the afghan game but he is 
only a survivor not a victor ostensibly his chief enemies are 
the mujahedeen the fractured alliance of moslem guerrillas armed 
by the united states and neighboring pakistan 
but najib must also contend with the powerhungry opponents 
within his own peoples democratic party of afghanistan as 
communist party power delines in eastern europe so too could it 
subside in afghanistan whose tribal society has never been fertile 
ground for either marxism or centralized government 
the soviets continue to supply and coach najibs government 
while the united states continues to aid the mujahedeen or islamic 
holy warriors through its ally pakistan 
india the regions strongest military power is still embroiled 
in a border dispute with pakistan over kashmir on the indian side 
of the contested frontier increasingly violent moslem militants 
want kashmir to join pakistan or become independent 
india also must reassess the role of regional policeman it 
eagerly embraced in the late 1980s when it sent troops to the 
maldives in the indian ocean to thwart a coup and to sri lanka to 
try to halt internal strife between the sinhalese majority and 
tamil minority 
the maldivian deployment was a success but india had mixed 
success as a peacemaker in sri lanka and is now pledging a speedy 
end to its 2year military adventure 
indian intervention set in motion the longoverdue but still 
incomplete formula to help tamils wrest more political power from 
the sinhalesecontrolled central government 
but this foreigninspired political pact coupled with indias 
bulldozer approach to peacekeeping touched off even greater 
violence by popping the cork on a bottle full of evil genies 
tamils and sinhalese rarely fight each other any more instead 
tamils are killing tamils and sinhalese are killing sinhalese in 
fights for dominance within each ethnic community 
still the 1990s offer sri lanka the chance perhaps its last 
to climb out of anarchy before the skeleton of democracy succumbs 
to the flames of war

having struggled through a lost 
decade of crushing debt and economic stagnation south america 
limps into the 1990s with the grim prospect of more tough times 
its many young democracies still fight to establish firm roots 
in troubled societies inherited in many cases from nowretired 
military governments 
at the same time they face the daunting challenge of halting a 
continental slide deeper into underdevelopment 
the 1980s began with what is now generically known as the 
crisis plunging prices for south americas products accompanied 
by skyrocketing foreign debts 
the decade ended with those debts approaching 300 billion 
overall with surreal inflation averaging nearly 1000 percent a 
year with spreading poverty and with widespread social unrest at 
the close of the decade per capita production was 8 percent less 
than it was at the start 
the troubles struck not only in countries with a tradition of 
political and social commotion such as peru and argentina even 
longsteady venezuela was jolted by price riots in 1989 colombia 
another economic and political stalwart waged bloody war with a 
billiondollar cocaine underworld that was deeply entrenched in 
several other south american countries 
the experts see few signs of a better decade ahead 
as far as perspectives for the 1990s there is a certain 
temptation to predict that the crisis will continue said gert 
rosenthal director of the united nations economic commission for 
latin america and the caribbean 
in an interview in santiago rosenthal said there were grounds 
for pessimism in the inertia of latin americas deep and 
longlasting recession which has prompted him to call the 1980s 
a lost decade 
he said he also harbored the suspicion that the prolonged 
expansion of world development cant last much longer and any 
recession in the international economy surely will hit latin 
america very hard 
in addition he noted theres little prospect of badly needed 
fresh credit for the debtor countries trying to refinance loans 
that drain the region each year of 30 billion money that could be 
put to use at home 
nonetheless rosenthal cited several positive developments that 
could help in coping with the future 
he said south america learned a hard lesson in the 1980s its 
archaic economies run by creaky state bureaucracies must be 
overhauled if it is to compete in the world marketplace also he 
said both creditor banks and debtor countries were adopting 
evermore flexible positions on foreign debts 
he also cited a certain revitalization of the old battered 
concept of latin american cooperation and integration 
the 1980s began with nine of the continents 12 countries 
controlled by authoritarian military governments the decade ends 
with elected leaders governing all but in chile where elections in 
december set the stage for the first civilian government since 1973 
few of those new civilian governments have shown any success in 
solving economic problems but none has yet to fall indeed while 
particular governments have sometimes suffered from slumping 
popular support surveys indicate little inclination for the return 
of military rule periodic uprisings at argentine garrisons have 
been quickly snuffed 
despite the entire decades critical economic situation it 
appears clear that the democratic regimes are becoming consolidated 
in the principal countries said jose joaquin brunner director 
of the independent latin american faculty of social sciences 
there is no reason to believe the democratic processes will 
be interrupted in the foreseeable future brunner said even 
where the situation is most precarious such as peru the 
institutional machine keeps working despite everything 
the wave of democracy has produced a spirit of fellowship and 
cooperation reflected in numerous summit meetings among south 
american nations involving as many as a halfdozen presidents 
brunner said a new political and economic coherence is emerging 
everyone sees the need for relatively pragmatic programs 
aimed at economic restructuring he said no one is turning to 
ideological alternatives there is no south american wave in favor 
of socialism for instance 
in deeply indebted brazil a probusiness conservative fernando 
collor de mello edged out a socialist luis inacio lula da silva 
in presidential elections dec 17 
brunner said deep ideological divisions and animosities that 
often fractured south american societies are being erased 
the range of possibilities has become so narrow its obliging 
everyone to be pragmatic he said

the caribbean which comprises some 
of the worlds poorest and most heavily indebted nations faces the 
prospect of increasing economic and social pressures in the 1990s 
problems confronting the two dozen island states south of 
florida range from rising unemployment and shrinking markets for 
sugar and bananas to the spread of aids and drug trafficking 
some analysts believe the strain could be severe enough to 
produce a resurgence of radical politics and civil unrest 
there is just no way for stable democracy to continue in these 
islands unless more jobs and income are generated said john 
collins adviser on the caribbean for gov rafael hernandez colon 
of puerto rico 
while celebrating the 500th anniversary of colombus discovery 
of the new world in 1992 the caribbean will likely find itself 
still coping with the effects of events dictated far from its 
shores 
caribbean leaders have expressed concern for example that the 
cold war thaw could divert western investment from their region to 
the nations emerging from communist domination in eastern europe 
likewise cuba could be forced to reduce its economic dependence 
on the soviet bloc said norman girvan of jamaica president of the 
association of caribbean economists 
whats happening in western europe is changing our external 
environment he said whats happening in eastern europe must 
change the environment of cuba 
for much of the region one of the darkest clouds on the horizon 
is the proposed single european market after 1992 a unified market 
would lift trade barriers within the 12nation european economic 
community and harmonize foreign trade agreements 
among the nations most at risk are the windward islands of 
dominica st lucia st vincent and grenada which together ship 
240000 tons of bananas a year to britain after 1992 they could 
lose preferential access to the british market and face fierce 
competition from more efficient banana producers elsewhere 
many also fear the loss of benefits as a result of the new 
uscanadian trade accord and proposed changes in the caribbean 
basin initiative the program set up by the reagan administration 
to promote usoriented economic and political development in the 
caribbean and central america 
the next decade is going to test the very theory that 
microstates can survive in a world increasingly dominated by 
massive trading blocs said larry birns director of the 
washingtonbased council on hemispheric affairs 
propects for the sugar industry meanwhile are dimmed by years 
of sharply declining us import quotas low world prices and 
increasing reliance on corn sweeteners and us and european sugar 
beets 
compton bourne professor of economics at the university of the 
west indies in trinidad said he thought pressure would build on 
caribbean governments to follow through on commitments to integrate 
their economies and pool limited resources 
but he said propects for the 1990s largely depended on the 
willingness of developed nations to reduce the regions debt burden 
and provide sorely needed investment 
analysts said the expected loss of revenue from traditional 
exports would probably accelerate a move into tourism already the 
no 1 earner of foreign exchange for several islands and enhance 
such industries as computer data entry that use cheap semiskilled 
labor 
birns said there was a danger that environmental considerations 
will be overwhelmed by the rush to exploit the islands lucrative 
tourism potential tourism is also regarded as a significant factor 
in the rapid spread of aids prostitution and drug use throughout 
the caribbean 
although conservative prous governments dominate the region 
birns said the approaching crisis could give rise to radically 
leftist leadership and possible destabilization 
if western lending institutions such as the international 
monetary fund and the world bank force further economic austerity 
on such debtridden nations as guyana jamaica and trinidad 
youre going to see an increasingly dangerous situation birns 
said 
he added that the caribbean of the 1990s would figure more 
prominently in us policy because of increased immigration and 
closer scrutiny of the regions role as a major drugtrafficking 
route and source of moneylaundering through offshore banks 
haiti the caribbeans perennial trouble spot approaches the 
new decade at a political crossroads 
opinion is divided over whether haitis military leader lt 
gen prosper avril will fulfill his pledge to turn over power to a 
civilian government in elections scheduled for the fall of 1990 no 
one expects a swift solution to the countrys profound economic 
problems

bedeviled by wars corruption 
mismanagement and a burgeoning population africa is ending a 
decade of economic decline and facing what some experts say could 
be a nightmare scenario in the 1990s 
the nightmare increased hunger disease poverty and conflict 
on a continent already desperately poor and largely unable to 
survive on its own without huge doses of foreign aid 
while warning of possible new violence elsewhere many observers 
predict an end to war in the coming decade in mozambique ethiopia 
sudan and other embattled african countries as combatants fight to 
stalemate and exhaustion 
namibia ended the 1980s with an election for a constitutional 
assembly and will enter the world of independent nations in the 
coming year peace also seems close at hand in neighboring angola 
whiteruled south africa which has long meddled in both those 
countries appears to be changing its racial policies albeit too 
slowly for some 
but with the exception of south africa the possibility of 
greater stability in those countries will not automatically bring 
prosperity to them or to the vast continent as a whole say 
economists for the world bank and other institutions 
the 46 countries of subsaharan africa a region of 450 million 
people that includes all of the continents nations except morocco 
algeria tunisia libya egypt and south africa had a combined 
gross domestic product in 1987 of about 135 billion 
that was about the same as belgium with a population of only 10 
million 
that comparison as well as any illustrates the depths of 
poverty from which most african nations are struggling to emerge 
only in many cases to slip deeper and deeperinto debt and 
deprivation 
the world bank in a study that took nearly three years to 
complete and was released in late november says there is a 
solution for africa one that depends largely on africans 
themselves and calls for a sharp reversal of past practices 
the bank a leading multinational lending institution blames 
many of africas problems on corruption poor government marked by 
bureaucratic bungling and misguided economic practices rooted in 
marxistleninist theory all that it said must end 
it was perhaps the bluntest assessment the bank has ever made of 
any of the worlds economies but it may have been far easier and 
faster to write than the suggested changes will be coming to a 
continent whose rulers have too often equated power with plunder 
the world bank and others have also stressed the need for a 
sharp reduction in africas birth rate at 32 percent it is the 
highest ever seen anywhere in the world and one that inexorably 
accelerates pressures for land food and jobs and threatens new 
internal and crossborder conflicts 
the population of subsaharan africa in 1965 was only half the 
450 million it is now and if current trends continue it will double 
again to 1 billion in 20 years the world bank estimates that even 
if fertility fell tomorrow to two children for each african family 
the continents population would continue to grow for the next 60 
to 70 years 
no region of the world has ever managed to develop with so 
high a rate of population growth the bank said 
even in those countries where peace has arrived or is on the 
horizon it is likely to take most of the new decade to revive 
their warshattered economies given optimum circumstances some 
have fallen not just 10 years behind in the development process 
but 20 or 30 
the world banks prescription for africa called for increased 
aid of about 4 percent a year through the 1990s from the developed 
nations but many african politicians and planners worry that the 
east european countries emerging from behind the iron curtain 
poland hungary czechoslovakia east germany and possibly others 
will siphon off aid dollars as they attempt to restructure their 
economies with western help 
as if those problems werent enough a new peril arose in the 
1980s that threatens africa in the coming years with a catastrophe 
comparable to the droughts and famines that periodically sweep the 
continent 
it is aids 
health authorities estimate that 15 million to 2 million 
africans mostly young adults will die of aids in the 1990s 
draining even further the continents already shallow pool of 
skilled workers and forcing many countries to spend more scarce 
money on medical services

its a curious irony that the leading commercial filmmaker of 
the cynical 1980s is a devout romantic 
throughout his career steven spielberg has taken a sunshiny 
view of the human situation his heroes notably indiana jones 
always triumph over insuperable odds life may hold its miseries 
as in the color purple but the struggle is always worth it in 
the long run even spielbergs space visitors close encounters 
of the third kind et the extraterrestrial prove benign 
always is spielbergs most romantic film yet the new movie 
stems from his fondness for the happyending films of the 1940s 
especially a guy named joe that film provides the basis for 
always which is not likely to win the hearts of hardbitten 
critics but should appeal to the millions who embraced field of 
dreams early in 1989 
in the new version the air war of world war ii has been 
supplanted by the battle against devastating forest fires the 
sense of jeopardy is not the same hence the dramatic tension is 
diminished 
richard dreyfuss is the hotshot pilot of the tanker bomber base 
taking risks that alarm his sweetheart holly hunter an air 
controller he believes he is invincible but during a daring 
rescue of his buddy played by john goodman his plane explodes 
dreyfuss finds himself on a grassy oasis amid a burnedout forest 
getting instructions from an angel audrey hepburn in a white 
designer pantsuit 
the guardian angel tells dreyfuss his mission to return to 
earth unseen and help hunter overcome her grief and pass on his 
flying prowess to another pilot enter brad johnson a klutzy flier 
who needs dreyfuss help but is handsome enough to sway hunters 
heart 
spielberg lavishes all his craft on always and no director 
makes better use of the camera the fire scenes have a frightening 
immediacy and the flying is among the best in recent times 
the fault lies in the script credited to jerry belson and the 
late diane thomas but seemingly the work of many hands consistency 
of tone is lacking and the plot has certain confusions as though 
important scenes had been cut 
the cast performs admirably dreyfuss displays the solidity of 
spencer tracy who originated the role hunter is highly effective 
especially after she drops her downhome cuteness goodman neatly 
fits his large frame into the ward bondalan hale kinds of roles 
johnson has the looks of a 40s screen idol and is likely to become 
a star of the 90s 
always is a universalunited artists picture produced by 
spielberg frank marshall and kathleen kennedy the rating is pg 
probably for mild swearing and excitement running time 121

great balls of fire orion home video vhsbeta 8998 
rated pg13 
 
some of the best movie biographies are films such as lawrence 
of arabia gandhi and raging bull all carefully 
researched and written and based on a variety of sources 
and with such standardbearers why does hollywood continue to 
seek out books usually best sellers that give only a fragmented 
and sometimes biased account of an event or life and rush to 
make movies of them are the creative minds of the film industry 
incapable of doing original research and stories 
these questions come to mind with great balls of fire jim 
mcbrides movie on the life and times of the pianopumping rocker 
jerry lee lewis based on the book by myra lewis with murray 
silver mcbride and jack baran did the screenplay 
the movie is a kinetic romp through the early years of rock n 
roll when elvis was king and pretenders like jerry lee threatened 
to topple him the music is nonstop fun whether songs by presley 
and lewis or gene autry singing rudolph the red nosed reindeer 
or dave baby cortez stomping through happy organ 
dennis quaid is a treat as lewis hes manic lewd adorable and 
crazy he swaggers about with childish abandon and dances with the 
piano like a careless lover at times though quaid becomes almost 
cartoonish in his portrayal but thats ok because jerry lee lewis 
was a walking comic book 
myra winona ryder was jerry lees third wife she also was his 
third cousin and 13 years old when they married he was 22 
ryder heathers continues to impress with her film work 
she is a great casting choice for the pubescent pulchritudinous 
bubble gumchewing myra she is wideeyed and dreamyeyed giggly 
and pouty lusty and innocent 
their wedding scene is a wonderful slice of life ryder stares 
blankly at the justice of the peace mouth ajar like hes the 
purple people eater later at the dinner table with her parents 
she bursts into giggles knowing that shes married and they havent 
a clue 
the year was 1958 and lewis had already shot to the top of the 
charts with whole lotta shakin goin on and great balls of 
fire but his marriage to myra shocked a staid postwar public 
and lewis career crumbled 
the movie is centered on myra and jerry lees relationship it 
should have been titled jerry and myra and abruptly ends with 
the birth of their son steve allen who drowned in a swimming pool 
when he was 3 
the late trey wilson costars as sam phillips whose sun records 
launched presley and othersalec baldwin is deliciously 
selfrighteous as lewis cousin and boyhood buddy tv evangelist 
jimmy swaggart 
great balls of fire is a harmless piece of entertainment for 
a saturday afternoon its fun to watch especially quaids 
gymnastics and clownish grimaces 
but the movie lacks authenticity it seems to be laughing at 
itself and at the era it purports to chronicle theres also an 
element of racism a scene at a black nightspot for example 
depicts black patrons as lewd animals doing bumps and grinds and 
crawling over each other in the most suggestive ways

louder than love aampm soundgarden 
 
the future of heavy metal is here and its name is soundgarden 
on louder than love its debut album for a major label the 
seattlebased quartet has stripped the genre down to its 
bareknuckled essentials loud guitar shrieking vocals and 
crashing drums its loud but it is by no means just noise 
the parents music resource center obviously broke out in a cold 
sweat over the repetition of gonna kill your mother in the 
cynical hands all over hence the albums warning sticker but 
the pmrc didnt bother to read a little deeper into the lyrics 
which are really a commentary on the destruction of the 
environment the mother becomes mother earth 
soundgarden responds though when lead singer chris cornell 
sings hands all over words i utter change them into what you 
want to like balls of clay 
and yes obscenities are chanted about a zillion times in big 
dumb sex but thats the point the song is a wicked spinal 
tapish blast at all the big dumb sex songs floating around the 
radio it seems as if soundgarden figured that everyone else beats 
around the bush about sex in their songs so we might as well say 
exactly what our intentions are 
on tracks such as gun and power trip the band points 
out the problems that arise when power surfaces in violence and 
exploitation 
the biting i awake looks at an abusive relationship from the 
viewpoint of the abuser cornell sings you have a good day 
its not your fault i know it hurts the real kicker comes in 
the repeated line remember i love you 
soundgarden follows the path blazed by metallica and janes 
addiction in reminding listeners that we dont live in a pretty 
world its a shame that their music like that of metallica and 
janes addiction will probably make the radio waves

in the land of salvation and sin elektra the georgia 
satellites 
 
give the georgia satellites credit for candor they make no 
attempt to camouflage their many influences 
the liner notes for in the land of salvation and sin salute 
among others hank williams jr the replacements and tom petty and 
the heartbreakers the songs recall among others steve earle 
bottle o tears lynyrd skynyrd all over but the cryin 
and the rolling stones stellazine blues 
theres nothing wrong with a few borrowed riffs when theyre 
well used and salvation and sin is a solid set it sounds like 
a tight bar band on a good night 
lead songwriter dan baird while not terribly original 
nonetheless has talent his two ballads another chance and 
sweet blue midnight are particularly appealing the former is 
about growing older dont want to die asking for another 
chance the latter with nicolette larson providing lovely 
harmony vocals concerns the search for comfort amid lifes 
uncertainties 
most of bairds uptempo tunes work too with drummer mauro 
magellan and bassist rick price usually able to find a groove 
the georgia satellites potential likely is limited because of 
bairds singing and rick richards slide guitar both are 
nondescript performers but bairds songwriting and the bands 
ability to distill their diverse influences make salvation and 
sin worth a listen

the combination of a volatile star and a 
director of international renown might seem potentially explosive 
but jessica lange and constantin costagavras claim the expected 
fireworks didnt happen in their collaboration on music box 
after her disastrous debut in king kong lange began taking 
charge of her career she has reportedly clashed with directors 
over interpretations of her film roles and has developed and 
produced her own projects such as country 
costagavras is known as the uncompromising greekborn director 
of such politicallythemed films as z missing and 
betrayed music box deals with guilt from the holocaust 
i had input as far as the development of the character says 
the actress who plays a chicago lawyer defending her father 
against charges he murdered jews in his native hungary 
i wasnt involved at a production level i had such respect 
and confidence in costa that i didnt feel the need to get in there 
and make my opinions known i agreed with what he was doing which 
made the filmmaking much easier for me its difficult when youre 
not in agreement with how the film is being made you have to 
expend a lot of energy arguing or opposing the way things are 
happening 
in this case everybody was in sync but its rare 
she is strong and extremely nice costagavras said about 
his star it was a big pleasure because the relationship 
developed little by little getting very close as we spoke about 
the character in a very intimate way i think it was quite a unique 
experience to me she looks a little distant but shes absolutely 
not 
in one of her infrequent interviews lange was asked if she 
encountered any resentment because a star insisted on making her 
opinions known 
she laughed and replied i suppose there was some of that im 
certainly not the first person to do that and i wont be the last 
sometimes youre just an actress for hire you go in and do your 
part and thats it at other times your commitment is deeper than 
that 
lange approached her music box role with her usual 
thoroughness hanging out in courtrooms and reading endless legal 
briefs ultimately you can observe behavior she said but 
when you get down to playing it it all has to come from the 
character 
but i learned a lot about legal proceedings its a very 
tricky business one thing i learned about law is that its not 
synonymous with truth they do not exist sidebyside which is too 
bad because originally i think thats what it was meant to be now 
so much of it is rhetoric tricks and manipulation 
the 40yearold lange reigns as one of the five mostindemand 
film actresses a position no one would have predicted 10 years 
ago after repeating the fay wray role in king kong she didnt 
work for two years finally bob fosse gave her a small part as an 
angel in all that jazz although the remake of the postman 
always rings twice with jack nicholson was a failure lange was 
impressive as a dramatic actress 
that promise was fulfilled in tootsie frances sweet 
dreams and country all resulting in academy nominations she 
won the 1982 oscar as supporting actress for tootsie 
her acting dreams began as a child in rural minnesota where she 
fell in love with gone with the wind and played melanies death 
scene with every sickness 
from the time i was 9 i was obsessed with gone with the 
wind she confessed it was an obsession that lasted until i 
saw the french film children of paradise then my obsession 
switched these two films got me through childhood and adolescence 
all the way up into my 20s 
lange is intensely private but she has provided the gossip 
writers with plenty of copy her liaison with dancer mikhail 
baryshnikov produced a daughter alexandra 7 she and 
playwrightactor sam shepard are parents of hannah jane born in 
1986 and samuel walker shepard born in 1987 she and shepard who 
are not married make their home in rural virginia 
the farm is great but every once in a while you want the 
bright lights big city she remarked the trick is to find an 
equilibrium 
music box was partly filmed in hungary before the recent 
political upheavals 
you could feel there was something in the air when we were 
there in the spring the actress said there was definitely a 
change beginning to happen you could tell from the spirit of the 
people i had never been to an eastern bloc country before so it 
was real interesting to me i was real relieved to get home 
though

real adobe bricks and mud are rarely used 
these days to build houses and even the supply of real cornhusks 
to wrap homemade tamales is drying up 
nowadays plaster stucco gives that adobe look and restaurants 
wrap tamales in paper even popular forms of folk art such as the 
ubiquitous howling coyote are massproduced in china 
it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish authentic 
santa fe art from imitation but rather than diluting the genre 
those who help define santa fe style believe new mexicos unique 
amalgamation of indian hispanic and angloeuropean cultures will 
sustain its popularity long after the fad has faded 
people talk about the fad aspect but the fact remains that 
santa fe style is rooted in centuries of human history says 
christine mather coauthor of the book santa fe style 
thats good news for the thousands who came this christmas 
season in search of a wreath of red chili peppers a classy poster 
from a famous southwestern or indian artist or simply to experience 
christmas eve singing christmas carols around a pinon bonfire on 
delgado street 
it means that santa fe style its architecture simplicity and 
warmth will never go completely out of style 
i dont think it will ever die says joan cawley an art 
wholesaler with a gallery on fashionable san francisco street 
if anything its popularity is expanding with sales of more 
than 100000 copies mathers book has helped put santa fe style 
into the american vernacular ellen bradbury who operates a santa 
fe tour service says this christmas season seems busier than ever 
cawleys art business is growing on every continent 
the style emerged from the traditions practices and 
architecture of the pueblo indians with their heavy asymmetrical 
multistory homes and the spanish who brought european religious 
traditions to new mexico in the 1500s 
popularized by a colony of artists in the 1920s and 30s santa 
fe culture is reflected in simple comfortable clothing turquoise 
and silver jewelry and honest spicy cuisine along with an 
affinity for dirt streets tolerance of the eccentric appreciation 
of a stunning blue sky and in some quarters almost paranoid 
defense of the fine and folk arts 
the most enduring features of the santa fe look will be its 
building styles which some experts believe will join the gallery 
of classic historic and architectural styles such as colonial 
american victorian and old south 
the decision to copy california mission style and establish and 
foster a santa fe architectural movement was made early in the 
1900s when it became apparent that the city relegated to the end 
of a spur off the santa fe railroad main line would never again be 
a major trading center 
community leaders adopted what architectural historian boyd 
pratt calls spanish pueblo revival style and passed the citys 
first historic styles ordinance which has remained relatively 
intact 
its characteristics are typified by the heavy lowprofile 
palace of the governors and the state museum of fine arts facing 
the central plaza renovated soon after statehood in 1912 
the latest wave of santa fe popularity began more than a decade 
ago at about the same time northern new mexico artisans began 
producing small carved animal figures including howling coyotes 
the coyote has mythical meaning to many indian tribes sometimes 
creator and benefactor often mischiefmaker and destroyer more 
than that it has a distinctive image that is simple decorative 
and affordable says gallery owner davis mather 
mather husband of the author began featuring the carvings of 
several local artisans in 1978 now the work of felipe archuleta 
and a halfdozen others resides in museum collections on display 
at mathers gallery is the next fad carved wooden painted 
wallhanging snakes 
the carved coyotes snakes and their knockoffs and 
reproductions on tshirts pottery and canvas are not universally 
popular among some santa fe residents who say they trivialize the 
value of their town 
its stupid there are coyotes everywhere says artist corri 
merritt somebody said it would peak next month but i doubt it 
cartoonist jerry milord has lampooned the excesses and 
capitalized on the local pique with a colorful hit poster entitled 
another victim of santa fe style 
the poster is set in a classic santa festyle room with beamed 
ceilings a kiva or beehive fireplace with stucco benches and a 
niche with a small santo wooden figure representing a saint 
inside against the walls are a carved wooden trastero hutch a 
chili ristra a buffalo skull and carved painted snakes against 
the walls a howling coyote and leather drum rest on the mexican 
tile floor 
a woman lying supine on a woven navajo rug is decked out in 
turquoise squash blossom necklaces and silver concha belts wearing 
a velvet shirt and pleated skirt and cowboy boots a painted snake 
which appears to have wriggled off the wall and bitten its owner 
slithers out the door 
the people who buy them are like laughing at themselves 
says milord its not a mean thing 
an old classy town such as santa fe which has withstood 
conquests revolts reconquests and immigration of all varieties 
may see the coyote fade from popularity knowing it will likely 
return 
twenty to 30 years from now mather predicts a clever santa 
fean will dig into his trunk and emerge with paper napkins 
emblazoned with a bandanascarfed coyote its mouth pointed upward 
howling at the moon 
it will begin yet another revival of santa fe kitsch

sting did it linda ronstadt did it even marvin 
gaye and lou reed did it so melissa manchester reasoned lets do 
it lets sing standards 
this music has been out in the universe for decades said 
manchester whose first album in four years tribute includes 
stardust over the rainbow and other lushly produced songs 
from the prerock n roll era 
these are magnificent melodies and long intricate stories to 
wrap your voice around them makes you want to rise to the occasion 
of these songs its different than singing short bits of rock n 
roll phrases which i find more difficult 
in 1985 manchester had had enough a dozen years of making 
records had erased the thrill there were children to raise an 
interest in theater to pursue it seemed a good time to finish the 
career that took off in 1975 with the ballad midnight blue 
but this show business veteran once a backup singer for bette 
midler has seen how tentative retirements usually are a few 
years away and manchester got the urge to belt em out again not 
new material however old material 
when i gained distance and perspective from the music 
industry it came to me as to what i was really up to doing she 
said once i became clear it was the right thing to do and it was 
basically in my truth all the details fell into place 
having grown up on manhattans upper west side the 38yearold 
manchester was drawn to sophisticated ladies of jazz such as billie 
holiday and ella fitzgerald and the polished compositions of hoagy 
carmichael and george gershwin she knew however that it was best 
to step lightly into shoes so large 
i felt i was ready and had grown enough to pay tribute to 
these women who were heroines in my youth she explained it 
was not at all about competing with these women that would be 
folly it was simply to acknowledge their greatness and the 
greatness of their songs 
so manchester wasnt looking to cover the songs just polish 
them up a little on over the rainbow she wrestled with the 
memory of judy garlands anguished performance at carnegie hall in 
1961 a sad departure from the innocence of the the wizard of 
oz 
to this day its riveting and gutwrenching and a testimonial 
to her experience manchester said 
im bringing my own experience and i see it as an anthemlike 
optimistic song there is an inner life to songs particularly if 
you have signature songs that youre going to have to sing all your 
life its interesting how your life affects a song youre 
singing 
young singers wishing to pay tribute to manchester might skip 
the 1982 grammy winner you should hear how she talks about 
you and go back to midnight blue which manchester cowrote 
with carole bayer sager 
they wanted dionne warwick to sing it but producer vini poncia 
was so impressed with the demo that he used manchester instead 
midnight blue peaked on the charts at no 6 
i was really unconscious in those days were on the charts 
what does that mean are we all suppose to do something open a 
bottle of champagne i was very young and i had no sense of 
packaging i just wanted to write and sing i didnt care what i 
looked like that i looked a mess or not 
talks about you with its snappy updated girl group 
sound wasnt her idea manchester insists by then her career 
needed a boost and she agreed to take chances with a slicker more 
aggressive sound it worked but at a price 
the risk is you shave off a little slice of your soul i was 
shaving more and more pieces and in real danger of giving the whole 
thing away my soul was too important to me stevie wonder wrote 
where is my spirit im nowhere near it 
fourteen years after midnight blue manchester is still 
thinking about warwick capping her tribute record with the hit 
walk on by which first came out in 1964 
i was always touched by walk on by it was always this very 
traumatic and dark and moody song about whats not said in a 
relationship i wanted to produce the record to be deeper and more 
spacious and more dramatic 
and when it was time to make a video manchester resisted a 
straight romantic interpretation transferring one of todays 
issues onto one of yesterdays hits 
i thought of the title walk on by the description of what 
we did in society when we pass images that are disquieting such as 
homelessness she said 
i came up with this idea of playing a homeless woman with two 
children and having to leave the two children at the shelter we in 
fact filmed at a shelter in los angeles and i got to speak to 
several of the women there it semed like a good idea and turned 
into a real educational experience

mordecai richler has a standard answer ready for 
those who wonder about the apparent similarities between the 
fictional gursky family in his new novel and a certain reallife 
canadian dynasty that soared to wealth and prominence in the 
whiskey business 
my reply will be that i wouldnt want five years work reduced 
to the level of prurient gossip he says 
indeed richler closes the lively new book solomon gursky was 
here with an authors note that simply states i made the 
gurskys up out of my own head 
the montrealbased writer is frequently repeating his answer on 
the promotional tour that is helping to make the novel his first 
since joshua then and now in 1980 one of the big books of the 
canadian fall publishing season it will appear next spring in the 
united states and a short while later in britain 
i think there are two or three superficial resemblances in 
their early careers but its not about that family at all 
richler 58 said of the bronfman family who built seagrams into 
the worlds largest distilling company 
he noted that the novel not only includes those superficial 
resemblances to the bronfmans in montreal but also ranges over 
canadian territory from the prairies to the arctic and covers 
subjects from antisemitism to the search for the northwest passage 
you write a novel and its very difficult to follow it around 
with explanations richler said i feel ive had my say 
the atmosphere of montreals prominent jewish community has 
served richler well in his past novels such as the 
apprenticeship of duddy kravitz and st urbains horsemen 
its certainly the most complex novel ive ever attempted 
richler said of his new work he was interviewed looking slightly 
rumpled and smoking small dutch cigars at breakfast during his 
visit to toronto for an authors festival 
its his longest novel yet and by far his most ambitious and 
imaginative reviewer william french wrote in torontos globe and 
mail newspaper whether its his most satisfying is open to 
debate 
richler works regularly as a journalist and is one of the 
canadian writers turned to frequently by foreign publications 
seeking a homegrown view of the country 
he has been working lately on an article about the 
englishfrench language tensions in quebec the provinces english 
minority lives for the most part in montreal the largest city in 
quebec 
its a quarrel more appropriate to a schoolyard whichever 
side youre on its somewhat embarrassing to be quarreling about 
signs richler said 
quebec provincial laws restrict the language on all outdoor 
commercial signs to french 
its a very wasting tribal quarrel it has little to do with 
the real problems of the country he said 
during the hardfought 1988 campaign over whether canada should 
go ahead with a freetrade agreement with the united states he 
lined up not with such writing heavyweights as robertson davies and 
margaret atwood against the pact but with a lesser known group 
supporting it 
i just felt that it was a trade deal richler said i hope 
it will work out well the test will be if it creates more jobs 
the opponents of the pact which took effect last jan 1 argued 
that canadian culture could be overwhelmed if trade barriers were 
lowered with the united states 
i thought there was a certain amount of hysteria richler 
said i dont think the free trade deal is going to destroy the 
cbc canadian broadcasting corp or canadian publishing if i 
thought so i would be against it 
richler sees an ironic touch to his having taken positions that 
made him anathema to hardcore canadian nationalists and his now 
having written a resoundingly canadian novel 
he said his publishers seem to believe the material will be 
considered exotic elsewhere and not be harmed by readers lack of 
knowledge about canada they think its a very commercial 
novel he said 
richler lived in europe mostly in london for two decades 
returning to his native montreal in 1972 
he also has worked as a screenwriter including the screenplay 
for the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz and written two 
wellreceived childrens books

jeff brock has never recorded a hit 
song but people who watch tv frequently hear his music 
the 39yearold brock is president of a music house a 
company that provides tunes for tv commercials brock music his 
company has won or shared five clios or addys national awards for 
excellence in advertising 
some of his bestknown music accompanied these spots 
actor richard farnsworth posing in a desert eating chips with 
the tag line the flavors a legend 
fastfood hamburger containers open their lids and talk to 
each other 
a bleach with the hook line dont just get em clean get 
em vivid 
brock provides music to advertising agencies that have contracts 
with major corporations he comes up with original music or 
arranges a wellknown song that already has been chosen for an ad 
brock who supervises a staff of four plus several freelance 
music writers and arrangers says music is important to the overall 
content 
i think music plays an immense role in the memorability of a 
spot when you have 5yearold kids running around singing jingles 
all day you know it has a lot of impact on peoples minds he 
said 
he estimates that 70 percent of his work is post scores 
seeing the ad without music and writing a tune to emphasize whats 
happening visually 
the music is supposed to be poignant and jump out brock 
said 
the guidelines vary 
they will say they want something appealing to kids age 12 to 
young adults age 25 in that age group you go for something hard 
hitting something a little more rock n roll 
sometimes they say they want music like and they name the 
artist i come up with something similar to that artist or that 
style he said 
sometimes we go out on a limb and say we dont think it will 
work and heres what we suggest 
and in other cases they say they have no earthly idea what 
they want but they know it when they hear it those are the 
toughies you may come up with something you think is incredibly 
good but the client doesnt 
for a recent spot about food to be taken to work he was 
instructed to come up with music that sounded classical english 
very proper 
when i wrote those scores i wrote from an acoustical 
standpoint with strings and woodwinds and light fun 
britishsounding music it came out beautifully and they are airing 
nationally 
he writes some lyrics but most of the time they are written by 
the ad agency we sort of pick up the ball and run with it 
wherever they decide to pass it off to us brock said 
he always knows the client but sometimes it is top secret 
were not supposed to let out what were doing or the 
campaign and this can be painful because youve just done a 
wonderful session for someone and they are not going to break the 
campaign for three months and you cant even play it for anybody 
in most cases the spots are 30 seconds long some only 15 
seconds 
you dont get a chance to say much in 15 seconds he said 
the companies and products he has worked with include general 
mills century 21 k mart the walt disney co cbs news folgers 
mcdonalds long john silvers and ralston purina 
brock music is one of about 15 nashville companies doing music 
for jingles 
our value is our versatility brock said we do all 
musical styles we do a lot of different things well 
brock was raised in anderson ind and worked as a jingle 
singer in dallas before he began writing jingles in 1975 he moved 
to nashville the next year ten years ago he wrote the music for 
political advertising including the music for dan quayles first 
campaign for the us senate in indiana 
we helped to elect a lot of candidates said brock who also 
was a judge in the 1989 miss america pageant 
he turned to jingle writing because he didnt want to continue 
doing political ads 
his office complex has a small studio in the rear where most of 
the ad music is created he plays keyboards himself as needed 
i think when you have some leeway and the agency allows you 
to be creative and do the job you feel is needed for that project 
and it comes out wonderful its very satisfying

william harmon used to spend each day tied to 
a chair in a nursing home sometimes in a stupor sometimes 
pleading for release 
theyd just sit there all day long everybody tied in 
restraints said mabel harmon who moved her 70yearold husband 
out in august i dont think he would be living now if he hadnt 
gotten out of there 
harmons situation was not unique two out of five residents of 
american nursing homes routinely are tied to their beds or chairs 
ostensibly to prevent injury yet concern is mounting that 
restraints may do more harm than good 
harmon now is at stapeley in germantown a philadelphia home 
that is one of the growing number in the united states using no 
restraints 
since hes been over at stapeley hea a completely different 
person mrs harmon said he does what he wants to do he 
answers your questions he walks up and down the hall he goes into 
the lounge 
nursing homes say they use restraining devices such as lap 
belts wheelchairs with locking trays and vests tied to beds or 
chairs mainly to keep residents from falling or wandering away and 
to control aggressive behavior 
critics say restraints often are used for convenience and seldom 
eliminate the risk of injury they say restraints can create 
problems including emotional withdrawal depression injuries 
incurred trying to get free strangulation constipation 
incontinence pressure sores loss of bone mass weakened muscles 
decreased ability to walk and eventual invalidism 
we have to ask ourselves what price safety said jill 
blakeslee director of health services for the kendal corp a 
nonprofit pennsylvania corporation governed by quakers that has 
pioneered the concept of restraintfree nursing homes in the united 
states safe and quality care can be given to our frail old 
people without tying them to their beds and their chairs 
kendal and the senate committee on aging this month sponsored a 
symposium untie the elderly quality care without restraints 
where blakeslee urged think about yourself as you grow old is 
that what you would want 
michael plevyaks family chose to place his 74yearold mother 
genevieve who has alzheimers disease at friends hall in west 
chester pa because it uses no restraints 
the only thing she desires to do is move about and walk he 
said thats why were so thrilled that she is in a facility that 
allows her to engage in the one activity she gets any joy out of 
fortyone percent of nursing home residents were restrained in 
1988 up from 25 percent in 1977 federal surveys show thirtyfive 
people in us and canadian nursing homes strangled or suffocated 
because of restraints from 1980 to 1987 and two burned to death 
trying to escape by lighting their restraints the presstelegram 
of long beach calif reported in a 1987 investigation 
in us and canadian nursing homes studied over the last decade 
restraint rates ranged from 25 percent to 85 percent neville 
strumpf and lois evans of the university of pennsylvania school of 
nursing reported in the january 1989 issue of the journal of the 
american geriatrics society 
family members initially may be horrified that a relative is 
restrained but medical professionals can talk people into a big 
variety of things that afterwards they must wonder about said 
lynne mitchellpederson a nurse at st boniface general hospital 
in winnipeg manitoba st boniface has nearly eliminated 
restraints since a patient strangled in 1981 
on the other hand there are attorneys and family members 
wanting and willing to sue if a home doesnt use protective 
devices to protect the safety of the resident said fred watson 
administrator of the christian city convalescent center in atlanta 
weve got to get over that hurdle 
christian city was restraintfree when it opened 12 years ago 
but began using the devices under pressure from insurers doctors 
and families watson said it now restrains 20 percent to 30 
percent of its patients but is reducing that 
the widespread use of restraints is widely attributed at least 
in part to nursing homes fear of being sued but some attorneys 
say reliance on restraints as a shield against litigation is 
largely unneeded 
a study of cases found that use of restraints led to more 
successful lawsuits than nonuse said philadelphia attorney alan 
reeve hunt chairman of kendals board for example an alabama 
jury in june held a nursing home liable for 25 million in the 
strangulation of an 86yearold woman in a restraint vest that was 
on backwards the ruling is under appeal 
restraints became a standard of care without ever being 
tested said sarah burger a consultant for the national 
citizens coalition for nursing home reform everybody just 
assumed they did good 
growing concern about negative effects and recognition that 
restraints dont eliminate legal risk are spurring a reduction in 
their use thirteen us nursing homes are known to be 
restraintfree according to kendal tough new federal rules take 
effect in october and florida has untied 3000 people since august 
theres a contest going on to see whos going to be the first 
restraintfree facility said florida licensing director connie 
cheren 
this is not a movement in its infancy said nancy dubler an 
attorney in the department of social medicine at montefiore 
hospital and medical center in new york this is a discussion on 
the verge of bringing change 
the new federal rules ban physical restraints imposed or 
psychoactive drugs administered for purposes of discipline or 
convenience and not required to treat the residents medical 
symptoms nursing homes for the first time will have to show 
that they have tried every other conceivable means to solve the 
problem burger said 
removing restraints requires creative individualized 
alternatives said beryl goldman kendal associate director for 
health services for example doors that sound a buzzer when opened 
might be installed on wanderers rooms brightly colored tape in 
front of exits helps discourage confused residents from leaving 
and rocking chairs can soothe residents who need to be in motion 
one home was able to avoid restraining an 85yearold woman who 
constantly paced with a doll but needed rest so her ulcers could 
heal said joanne rader director of mental health at benedictine 
nursing facility in mount angel ore 
staff members filled the doll with seven pounds of birdseed 
now when shes walking with the doll she has a very heavy baby 
so they said oh that babys so heavy why dont you sit down and 
put your feet up thats a heck of a lot more fun than tying a 
person down rader said 
st bonifaces mitchellpederson cited the case of an 
alzheimers patient who disrupted meals and stole food when we 
asked could he be hungry and doubled his calorie intake he 
stopped stealing food in this case it was his diet that needed 
attention restraints compounded the problem 
an 85yearold woman restrained in a chair for fear she would 
wander off and fall down the stairs was given rubbersoled shoes 
instead of slippers and was thus allowed to wander at will 
throughout the building she said 
theres tremendous excitement out there toward developing 
and implementing a nonrestraint philosophy rader said its 
no fun to be the one who has to tie someone down when they dont 
want to be tied down

some nursing home officials however caution that there are 
cases where there are no clear alternatives to restraints 
while we all can agree that overuse or wholesale use of 
restraints is not desirable it is equally wrong to say no 
restraints should ever be used said david mettler of hillhaven 
corp which runs 345 nursing homes in 38 states 
this is not a blackandwhite issue mettler said 
sometimes it may even be necessary to restrict the rights of an 
individual resident in order to provide for the health and safety 
of others 
for dramatic reduction in restraints residents and families 
must accept that if people have a certain amount of freedom then 
they also run the risk of getting hurt said attorney joanne 
ivancic of hfic management co which handles insurance claims for 
hillhaven 
benedictine has eliminated most restraints but theres maybe 
5 to 10 percent of the people that i cant figure out how to get 
restraintfree rader said citing as one example those who pull 
out tubes unless restrained 
nursing home staffers who initially are skeptical about managing 
residents without restraints usually find they prefer it said 
kendals goldman she quoted from a recent letter from a nurse at 
friends hall which in 1987 adopted a norestraint policy i 
wouldnt work any other place now i wouldnt have said that or 
believed it two years ago 
nine nursing homes in a kendal demonstration program have 
reduced restraint use without an increase in falls staff or costs 
goldman said 
that is possible because residents who can move around generally 
stay healthier and require less care blakeslee said also it 
takes a lot of time to properly apply restraints and remove them 
for exercise and use of bathrooms 
stapeley in 1988 set a goal of untying five residents a month 
and a year later removed the last restraint said henrietta 
roberts executive director 
i cant tell you how the families have been pleased by this 
she said the sense of humanitarianism the sense that you are 
dealing with a person has made a great deal of difference the 
patients are easier to care for 
supporters of the change at stapeley include bernie lieberman 
whose 89yearold mother frances had been routinely restrained 
after she fell and broke a hip now staffers help her walk and she 
wears no restraints while seated 
she seems much more cheerful and positive as a result of 
having more freedom lieberman said even though her mind was 
not working well she was just the kind of person who wanted to get 
up and walk

connie cheren doesnt like the phrase 
untying the elderly but she wholeheartedly supports the 
concept 
cheren who oversees 4300 health care facilities has led an 
effort to reduce nursing home use of restraints untying 3000 
people in four months the only thing that i feel bad about is 
that i didnt do it earlier 
when cheren became director of the state office of licensure and 
certification two years ago 41 percent of the 55000 people in the 
states 550 nursing homes were restrained at least part of the day 
by vests that fasten to beds or chairs wrist ties lap belts and 
specially designed chairs several elderly people had strangled in 
recent years struggling to free themselves 
use of restraints rose to 437 percent by april 1989 but was 
down to 39 percent last month federal statistics show cheren did 
not have statistics on the use of tranquilizers but said 
regulators would try to ensure that chemical restraints are not 
overly used and do not replace physical restraints 
cheren stepped up regulation of restraint use in august when 
she told ambrosia nursing home in tampa it could not admit new 
residents until it stopped illegally using restraints simply to 
prevent wandering 
under florida law restraints can be used to keep people from 
falling or from disturbing medical equipment such as feeding 
tubes they cannot be used without a doctors permission and 
people must be released every two hours 
restraint reduction has caught on in the industry because 
first of all its right she said second it feels good 
nobody likes to put somebody under restraint you interact 
differently with somebody in restraint three its working and 
success builds on success 
cheren a registered nurse with 20 years involvement in 
longterm care dislikes the phrase untying the elderly because 
it casts the elderly in a passive role just like release 
women or free the blacks she said 
also physical restraints came into use out of sincere concern 
for safety however she said it is time to focus on better 
nursing home care that involves helping peple keep and restore 
their abilities 
about 1000 nursing home owners and operators attended three 
workshops on restraints in october and november instead of being 
apprehensive about meeting new standards people were bragging 
about the progress they had made 
people called me afterwards and told me their goal for 
this year was to completely move toward a restraintfree 
environment said mary ellen early of the florida association of 
homes for the aging 
the 454bed miami jewish home and hospital for the aged for 
example cut use of restraints 18 percent said associate executive 
director terry goodman the residents are much happier less 
agitated and the staff has noted a significant decrease in the 
amount of agitation and less acting out 
many operators have reported resistance from families who think 
nursing home residents are safer if they are restrained early said 
but cheren and other advocates of reducing restraints say the 
losses that occur in mobility bladder control and dignity far 
outweigh the small risk of a serious injury due to a fall 
the bottom line really is that the risk of falling really 
aint so bad said martin casper executive director of 250bed 
greynolds park manor in north miami beach which now restrains four 
people compared to 8590 this summer 
and while there has been concern that restraint reduction would 
increase costs florida homes operate on a profit margin of less 
than 05 percent casper said he has found the cost of staff 
supervision remained the same 
cheren can even count among her supporters the administrator of 
ambrosia nursing home which lost an estimated 60000 because of 
the moratorium the toughest stricture possible short of license 
revocation 
i think connie cheren has done a fine thing said albert 
shepard who had 10 of 80 beds empty during the 60day penalty 
connie cheren having zeroed in on this particular thing has 
made the difference 
the home has fixed an alarm system that sounds when a door is 
opened and set up a buddy system in which workers even office 
and housekeeping staff adopt a resident for special daily 
attention including walks except for six or eight gerichairs 
for people who cant sit alone it has no restraints 
were very much in agreement with the whole philosophy of 
nonrestraint facilities shepard said its an excellent thing 
to give people the freedom of movement

keith grant never considered hed ever have to 
choose a nursing home for his wife an active intelligent 
52yearold mother of five 
then virginia grants personality began to change and months of 
tests pointed to alzheimers disease after three years of home 
care mrs grants behavior became so erratic her family made the 
painful decision in 1985 to place her in tel hai retirement 
community in honey brook pa 
she would wander off pick up things to eat anywhere out on 
the road hitchhike stop cars grant recalled when family 
members visited however they were troubled to find that more 
often than not mrs grant was strapped down to keep her from 
wandering and eating foreign objects 
she seemed very upset and so were we said her daughter 
susan mctyier mom no longer was able to speak but she would 
often look very angry or grumpy whenever we visted dad often made 
the comment it looks as if shes saying why are you doing this 
to me 
last january tel hai launched a program to reduce its use of 
restraints cutting the rate from 43 percent of patients to less 
than 10 percent confused residents who once were tied down now are 
free to stroll an outdoor wandering garden those who were 
restrained because they were unsteady on their feet have been 
fitted with sturdy walking shoes 
i remember from my nursing school days it was considered a 
standard of good care to restrain residents who might fall and 
injure themselves said assistant administrator betty petersheim 
but now theres been a bubbling up from within the healthcare 
providers saying theres a better way 
the resulting new freedom has improved mrs grants demeanor and 
that of other residents ms mctyier said at a recent symposium on 
restraints 
shes calmed down visibly and weve also noticed an overall 
happier attitude in the whole facility it used to disturb us when 
we would walk in and hear the residents moaning and crying for 
help since the change the noise level has dropped considerably 
 
the nursing home doesnt seem like such a prison anymore when 
you walk through and dont find people strapped down all the time

when considering the use of restraints weigh potential benefits 
such as safety and comfort against potential negatives including 
the loss of mobility depression and anxiety says the nursing home 
coalition of new york state 
in addition family members and nursing home residents should 
watch for these signs of possible abuse of physical restraints 
discoloration is there redness bruising blanching or welts 
pain do the restraints cause pain in wrists waist chest or 
feet 
behavior is there squirming in an attempt to get comfortable 
does the resident bend forward trying to loosen restraints or rock 
back and forth

people trying to choose a nursing home can gather important 
information by relying on their senses sarah burger of the 
national citizens coalition for nursing home reform suggests 
considering these factors 
sight how do resident look are they up dressed clean 
chatting among themselves and staff or slumped in a wheelchair do 
rooms look personal or institutional 
sound is there a general level of chatter as in a normal 
household or is there noise blaring from the tv and cries of help 
or nurse 
smell does the home smell good or does it smell of urine or a 
coverup of heavy disinfectant does the food from the kitchen 
smell good 
taste eat a meal if you can if not ask residents how the 
food is are they eating it 
touch are handrails bathrooms etc clean to the touch 
residents will reach out to you take their hands are they clean 
with welllubricated skin and trimmed nails or are the hands 
sticky or dry with ragged nails 
also ask about quality of care and payment policies the 
coalition says 
quality of care ask residents and their families physicians 
clergy and others what they think about various facilities visit 
as many nursing homes as possible find out about staff is there a 
trained social worker and a trained activities director do they 
have assistants how does the home handle potential staffing 
shortages does staff turn over quickly 
payment most nursing home residents even if they pay 
privately when they enter run out of money unless someone is sure 
they can pay indefinitely with private funds they should choose a 
home that accepts medicaid find out what their states medicaid 
eligibility rules are and what their rights are or will be as a 
medicaid nursing home resident 
contact your state office on aging to get the name and telephone 
number of the nearest longterm care ombudsman program ombudsmen 
are empowered by law to serve as advocates for nursing home 
residents and to assist with complaints

frieda anderson strides into her 
exercise class warmed from a brisk bicycle ride and puts away her 
helmet 
shes ready for her threetimesaweek class of stretching 
floor exercises and physical activity to music ranging from 1950s 
doowop to classical to the grateful deads touch of gray 
most in the class have their own touches of gray 
this is the walnut creek ymcas older adults fitness program 
some of the older americans walking biking and swimming their way 
to better health 
mrs anderson 73 logged 1886 miles last year just completed 
her ninth ragbrai an annual bicycle ride across iowa and rode 
her bicycle at least 10 miles a day this summer she posted the 
most miles last year in a walkingjogging program which credits 
three miles of bicycling as one mile of walking 
in cold weather i walk at valley west mall she said the 
rest of the time i ride my bike alone 
others in the program are just discovering the rewards of 
fitness 
by age alone there is no limit to when a person can 
begin an exercise program said dr john rachow of the university 
of iowas college of medicine its as fine if theyre 89 as if 
theyre 63 and about to retire 
norma casserly 62 of des moines joined the senior fitness 
class in february the first time i went i didnt think i would 
be able to get off the floor seven months later she weighed 10 
pounds less had cut her bloodpressure medication by a third and 
felt better physically and emotionally 
becky harkema director of the walnut creek older adults fitness 
program said it has grown from seven members in 1981 to about 100 
it is one of 34 ys in iowa with such programs which generally 
include 25 to 50 participants 
most people walk or bike in addition to the organized class and 
keep logs of ground covered they also meet monthly for lunch and 
get together frequently to tour iowa talk about trips or discuss 
the restoration of the statehouse 
the activity leaves participants with more energy to do more 
both physically and mentally harkema said they can go to the 
grocery store and not be short of breath they can stay up an hour 
later the seniors who may have lost a spouse will regain new 
friendships they realize they have strengths they never knew they 
had 
arlene lapscheske 70 attends the program with her best friend 
of 47 years 72yearold maxine dolan and describes it as our 
own special time both have been in the senior fitness program 
for six years im able to get up the stairs when other people my 
age are out of breath she said 
rachow advises patients to start an exercise program slowly by 
walking riding a stationary bicycle or swimming someone who wants 
to gain strength can start by lifting the weight of your own 
limb he said it doesnt have to be a fancy nautilus machine 
regular exercise tends to decrease anxiety and depression and 
the severity of muscle shrinkage brittle bones and high blood 
pressure he said theres already a tendency as you age to lose 
muscle mass once you get weak you end up going down into a chair 
and not being able to get back up again 
exercise also burns calories and avoiding obesity can help 
prevent high blood pressure high blood cholesterol and diabetes 
one reason 75yearold nate bernstein attends the class is so he 
can eat a little more but the main reason he said is for 
the girls

when families lived together older people 
were a link between the past and future reminiscing about the 
history theyd lived today families are farflung and often out 
of touch but the need for a link remains 
one of the important lessons of the book roots is that 
family and society are enormously interested in the past 
experiences of individuals that they know said dr gene cohen a 
psychiatrist and deputy director of the national institute on 
aging look at how excited people are to look at old photo 
albums thats a form of reminiscing 
a lot of people have stories in them but they havent written 
them down because theres just no place for their writing to 
appear said jay thomas collins who with partner william 
michaelian offers just such a forum 
the two in may 1988 launched harvest a literary magazine 
featuring the reminiscences of people over 50 michaelian 33 and 
collins 29 who both grew up in storytelling families arent 
interested in family histories that merely list the comings and 
goings of a particular family or group of people harvest is filled 
mainly with the remembrances of everyday people whose good times 
and bad times preceded shopping malls freeways and fastfood 
restaurants 
the bimonthly magazine has grown in circulation to about 1500 
and gets about 40 or 50 submissions a week from around the country 
harvest doesnt pay but people whose articles are published get 10 
free copies some stories are sent by professionals but most 
writers have never had anything published 
were looking for stories that really have something to say 
whether its polished or not is not our major concern we just want 
to present simple honest stories michaelian said 
we look for something that has lasting meaning to someones 
life collins said there used to be a role for older people as 
storytellers they used to be valued for that theyve been through 
good times and bad times they have perspective and some of their 
reflections can teach you a great deal 
consider thanksgiving 1930 a story in the novemberdecember 
issue albert bessler recalls waiting for several days during the 
depression to get a free food basket from the salvation army 
bessler describes huddling with his brothers and sister in the 
familys model t to keep warm after their meal 
when youre in a warm place and your belly is full and you 
have someone to hold what more could you want i was thankful for 
thanksgiving day i was satisfied i had a good deal 
such reminiscences offer younger people new perspectives 
they invariably derive new insights about themselves while 
being a healthy experience for older people cohen said for a 
number of people it can be a very helpful and therapeutic process 
that brings them back to a broader perspective in terms of what 
their life has been 
the past has undoubtedly contained a number of situations 
which at the time might have seemed insurmountable but yet we found 
that weve gotten over them those reminders are very important to 
help restore someones perspective on the present

the speed with which society has responded 
to the aids epidemic is heartening yet there is one group that 
society has not begun to attend to in terms of its risk older 
americans 
the fact is 10 percent of all reported cases of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome have involved people aged 50 and over and more 
older people are believed to be infected although not yet 
experiencing symptoms 
with increased age comes a decline in immune system functions 
making older people more susceptible to a variety of illnesses such 
as cancers and infections because of these changes in immune 
function aids may affect older people differently than it does the 
young data from the centers for disease control suggests that most 
older people infected with the aids virus have developed disease 
symptoms more quickly than younger patients 
the older population also receives the highest rate of blood 
transfusions blood banks now assure safer blood products than 
before 1985 when the public blood supply was not yet being 
screened for the virus by then however many older people had 
already been exposed to possibly contaminated transfusions as a 
result blood transfusions are the second most common cause of aids 
in people over 50 after sexual contact moreover no one knows 
how many people received infected blood and are now unknowingly 
infecting spouses or sexual partners 
older aids patients who have early symptoms also risk going 
undiagnosed because early symptoms of aids such as fatigue loss 
of appetite and swollen glands are similar to other more common 
illnesses many people including health professionals may 
dismiss them as minor ailments 
medical experts predict that a cure or vaccine against aids is 
not likely to be found in the near future so preventing the spread 
of aids will very much depend on behavioral changes such as using 
condoms when sexually involved with someone other than a mutually 
faithful uninfected partner 
prevention also begins with education aids is not spread by 
casual contact but rather through sexual relations use of 
infected needles and blood transfusions reliable uptodate 
information is available from many sources the public health 
service sent a brochure understanding aids to every home in 
the country call the national aids hotline 1800342aids for 
another copy other hotlines also can answer specific questions 
researchers are working to understand aids and how to treat 
people who are infected treatment for the symptoms usually 
involves some drug therapy such as azt azidothymidine which 
currently is being used in many patients to prolong life other 
promising drugs are also being tested 
people exposed to the virus should stay in touch with a doctor 
who is wellinformed about the latest research for help finding an 
expert call a medical schools infectious disease department or 
the national aids hotline 
you can make a valuable contribution by offering to help groups 
in your community who work with aids patients many operate on a 
shoestring and depend heavily on individual contributions of time 
and money these groups include the american red cross march of 
dimes boys clubs and girls clubs and the local ymca their phone 
numbers are listed in your directory and they will be glad to tell 
you how to get involved with education fundraising drives or 
volunteer programs 
in the years ahead individuals willing to offer their services 
to aids patients will be increasingly needed volunteers can 
contribute a great deal without endangering their health for 
example as people with aids become more disabled they have 
trouble meeting their daily needs they appreciate help with 
shopping cooking meals or just regular visits for talking 
for more information on volunteer programs call your health 
department or the national aids hotline

if maintaining a home landscape is more work than 
pleasure a few changes may help retirement offers a splendid 
opportunity to take time for a detailed assessment and its worth 
doing whether youre 20 or 70 
start by determining what you and the family like dislike or 
have no strong opinion about be realistic be pragmatic be 
diplomatic but above all get an honest reading then have a 
little fun and adopt kiss as the game plan keep it simple 
stupid 
for example is it worth the effort to plant water weed 
fertilize and prune that bed of annual flowers or bulbs would 
lowmaintenance flowering shrubs be as pleasing dont apologize if 
the choice is the bed of flowers just be sure and say kiss often 
when looking at things that take time 
before i retired my home had a gorgeous lawn there was bermuda 
grass in summer and in this subtropical climate even greener 
ryegrass all winter at least once a week id empty the mowers 
grasscatcher seven or eight times the family loved that lawn 
badminton croquet just sprawling on the grass 
but children and grandchildren grow older it was used less and 
less water bills kept climbing decomposed granite and native 
shrubs and trees became an increasingly attractive alternative 
now i fill only one grasscatcher each time i mow the saving in 
time alone is considerable 
one persons solution of course can be anothers horror story 
but the basics never change simplify maintenance by eliminating 
unnecessary things 
folks who move to a different climate also need to forget 
nostalgia heroic urban horticulture may keep alive longtime 
favorites from other states but its usually timeconsuming 
expensive and generally selfdefeating make sure say that a 
lilac or ceanothus will grow in the new neighborhood can you even 
tell the difference between the easts lilac and the wests 
ceanothus 
take the time to understand your plants needs can they be 
replaced with something better or simpler the cooperative 
extension service listed under the us department of agriculture 
in most telephone books is a good source 
hybrid tea roses are an example of something that can be changed 
without much difficulty their floral display is seldom matched 
yet they need enormous care one solution is to have a hybrid tea 
or two for cut flowers and replace the others with less demanding 
types such as floribunda or shrub roses 
systemic insecticides eliminate a lot of mixing of chemicals and 
spraying just be sure to follow the label directions carefully 
fertilizing often can be simplified with slowrelease types though 
these tend to be expensive and can be deadly if timing of the 
application induces plant growth when it should be slowing but 
theyre a great convenience and unmatched in container growing 
avoid scattered plantings if cutting the grass can you keep 
going for long periods without backing and turning does a certain 
shrub have to be where it impedes the mower would a mowing strip 
eliminate hand trimming 
perhaps stone or gravel would look better in areas under garden 
benches or house overhangs is a raised bed called for does 
traffic make grass a losing battle in a certain area dictating 
paving would ground cover hide litter from a tree do some plants 
always seem to be nibbled by grasshoppers attacked by aphids or 
sunburned why not replace them consider the same approach for a 
tree or shrub that requires frequent pruning or leaf raking 
a preemergence herbicide will control many weeds before they 
start vegetationkilling sprays formulated with glyphosate are one 
of the most important gardening developments in recent years even 
toughies like bermuda are a soft touch but dont get it close to 
anything green you want to keep 
sometimes changing the lands contour just an inch or two is all 
thats needed to improve drainage maybe a shadeloving plant is 
getting too much sun while moving it a few feet will make it 
happy a mulch can give a neat appearance save moisture and 
protect against climate extremes 
the list of potential problemsolvers is just about endless 
but no solution is possible until the problem is pinpointed

actor david keith wants america to stop 
wasting a precious resource the wisdom of its aged 
to harness this power of experience and challenge the energies 
of youth to put the power back in the hands of experience i 
proposed the grand corps said keith who envisions building an 
organization of people 60 and older to speak out on the issues from 
pornography to ecology 
when i look around the country i see young people pushing 
their grandparents and the older people into a corner putting them 
in front of the tv and saying here keep your mouth shut 
keith said 
and i dont see the older people fighting back i dont see 
them saying my mind is still alive ive got good ideas that you 
ought to listen too 
keith 35 who most recently played oliver north in a tv 
miniseries and elvis presley on the big screen hopes to form the 
first grand corps chapter in his hometown of knoxville he thinks 
senior citizens once unified could carry tremendous clout both 
locally and nationally because of their sheer numbers 
noting the growing percentage of elderly americans he said 
imagine 52 million letters arriving in congress on the same day 
to get a pornography bill put through they are going to listen 
keith said he didnt expect to get anything more from the grand 
corps than a chance to honor the love he received from his late 
grandparents

many of the retirees who move to 
florida to enjoy their golden years wind up prisoners in their 
homes because of their fear of crime a state task force on crime 
and the elderly reported 
the 65page report concluded that people over 60 are victimized 
less often than younger people but the resulting injuries or 
incurred damages are more devastating for the older victims 
older persons live in abject terror of such everyday occurrences 
as going to the grocery store or merely stepping outside to pick up 
their social security checks it said 
florida has the oldest population in the united states by next 
year more than 24 million people 65 and older will live in the 
sunshine state 
the high concentration of the aged in one environmental 
setting acts as a magnet to criminals said the report by the 
attorney generals task force on crimes and the elderly public 
housing especially for the elderly is a prime target for purse 
snatchings robberies and burglaries 
additionally the elderly are more likely to be harmed or held 
hostage during a burglary attempt as failing vision or hearing 
leave them unaware there is someone in the house and the elderly 
are perceived by juveniles as easy targets for violence and 
crime said the report 
in addition to threats from unknown criminals the elderly are 
particularly vulnerable to smoothtalkers it is extremely easy to 
control someones assets merely by having them sign a power of 
attorney and some unscrupulous funeral homes are adept at catching 
the elderly at vulnerable times the report said 
among its recommendations the task force urged creating a 
department of elderly affairs a measure already approved by voters 
in 1988 the report said the department of health and 
rehabilitative services had become too large and bureaucratic to 
function efficiently and that the agencys division of aging and 
adult services appeared to be the poor stepchild of a cumbersome 
system 
the report based on research and testimony gathered during four 
months last winter also noted that the state has begun revising 
its guardianship laws and imposing tougher penalties for crimes 
committed against elderly citizens

the tokyo stock exchanges key index closed at yet 
another record high today while the dollar edged down against the 
japanese yen for the fourth consecutive trading day 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues gained 25769 
points or 067 percent closing at 3868131 the previous record 
closing was 3858618 set on dec 18 
the dollar closed at 14237 yen down 035 yen from mondays 
finish of 14272 yen it opened at 14294 yen and ranged between 
14230 yen and 14295 yen 
the dollar now has fallen 186 yen in the last four trading days 
currency trading was inactive as the new york london and some 
other overseas markets were closed for christmas an estimated 
414 billion traded hands in spot trading 
the dollar fell in tokyo on profittaking and small position 
adjustments traders said 
minori takeuchi a trader with chemical bank in tokyo said 
the yen strengthened despite dollarbuying by some participants 
who had taken short dollar positions following yesterdays central 
bank discount rate hike 
overall she added there was little incentive to buy the 
dollar in the long run the discount rate hike will make the 
yen stronger 
the bank of japan raised the discount rate the interest rate it 
charges for loans to commercial banks to 425 percent from the 
previous 375 percent higher interest rates usually make a 
countrys currency more attractive to investors 
on the stock exchange the nikkei which had lost more than 341 
points after last tuesdays discount rate rumor climbed more than 
640 points in this weeks first two days 
while interestrate increases usually dampen stock investment 
dealers said the index rose because many investors felt the banks 
action removed a major cause of uncertainty 
kazuyuki suzuki a dealer with daiwa securities co said the 
market reacted to the hike positively because of the timing and the 
amount of the hike which was exactly what the market had 
expected 
the indexs rise slowed in the afternoon as buying in 
anticipation of higher prices was offset by selling to take 
profits he said 
trading was moderate with an estimated 600 million shares 
changing hands on the first section up from mondays 500 million 
among gainers were machinery and electrical issues

for financial analysts seeking an audience there 
is an almost sure formula forecast that the housing market is 
going to be reduced to rubble 
anything about housing has a wide audience more than 60 percent 
of households own their homes and many renters would like to own 
homeowners have big investments they worry about their money 
and they are alert to anything said or done that might affect it 
that includes forecasts and helps explain why forecasts of housing 
debacles never cease 
several years ago in fact a book was written about the coming 
collapse of housing prices the event was never recorded by any 
economic statistic or seismograph but it didnt deter the 
forecaster 
similar warnings have been issued throughout 1989 and the surest 
bet you can make is that the outpouring of doom much of it from 
financial people who tend to measure housing as an investment only 
will continue in 1990 
at the moment in fact there exists a popular notion that 
singlefamily home sales and prices have declined sharply in much 
of the country especially in the northeast specific collapses 
always available are used to illustrate 
the specifics however dont always make a generalization 
national data show that the median price of existing 
singlefamily homes in october 1988 was 88900 one year later in 
october of this year it was 92100 thats a gain of 36 percent 
data for the northeast compiled by the national association of 
realtors shows the price of typical new singlefamily homes in 
october 1988 was 144400 and in october 1989 143300 thats a 
decline of 08 percent hardly a disaster and one barely worth 
mentioning in the stock market 
at that the significance might be overdone oddly that decline 
in the price of new houses tiny as it is might indicate strength 
rather than weakness to wit 
falling interest rates in 1989 encouraged buyers who earlier had 
been priced out of the market clearly these people wouldnt seek 
the most expensive homes they would buy in the middle ranges 
creating a lower median 
in spite of warnings and forecasts home prices have been 
remarkably stable or strong year after year industrial and 
commercial real estate might not have done well but singlefamily 
housing is distinct from them 
what has changed is the fortunes of banks that made bad loans 
and in this way a banking problem becomes a socalled crisis in 
real estate 
since 1972 census bureau figures show not one year in which 
prices of new and existing homes have failed to rise nationally 
although there have indeed been been regional or local declines 
but while bad news in one stock unless it is ibm or general 
motors rarely is used to suggest a general market decline that 
reasoning isnt always applied to housing 
housing is in fact an even better investment than shown on 
some popular wall street charts of relative values most charts of 
comparative investments relate the percentage gains in housing to 
the total price however most americans put down but a fraction of 
the price when buying homes they take loans instead 
when ordinary folks buy stock they usually pay full price rather 
than go on margin or borrow from the broker to borrow may be 
unwise because of volatility so if a 10 stock rises 1 they 
usually have a 10 percent gain 
when a 50000 house bought with 5000 down rises in value to 
55000 the apparent gain is also 10 percent but since it was 
purchased with only 5000 down the real return to the homeowner is 
100 percent 
the homeowner pays interest on the mortgage and real estate 
taxes insurance and upkeep but he or she also receives big income 
tax deductions not available to shareowners and gets to sleep in 
the homeinvestment 
remember it the next time financial experts proclaim the end 
of the world in housing and remember some of these are the same 
ones who created a brokerage house recession and billions in bad 
loans for banks

daiwa securities co has been punished for 
compensating a customer for losses in stock transactions a company 
official said tuesday 
the official said the company had not violated any laws but 
quoted daiwa president masahiro dozen as apologizing for unfairness 
to other investors 
the finance ministry has prohibited daiwa one of four major 
japanese securities firms from raising capital through public 
share offerings for the time being said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the ministry also ordered the company to refrain from corporate 
customer business for two days he added 
finance ministry officials were not available for comment after 
office hours tuesday 
kyodo news service said the ministry had discovered that daiwa 
securities compensated for a corporate customers losses in stock 
transactions between 1975 and 1980 but could not find out whether 
daiwa had entered into a contract guaranteeing the customer against 
losses in stock transactions a violation of the securities and 
exchange law 
kyodo said the ministrys investigation showed daiwa had 
obtained about 12 billion yen or 84 million from selling a 
subsidiarys stock and paid 113 billion yen to a customer that had 
lost in stock transactions and 700 million yen as a commission to a 
company that settled the matter 
the daiwa official confirmed such transactions but declined to 
give figures 
he said four former daiwa employees involved in the affair would 
resign 
the pay of dozen and 11 other executives would be cut by 10 
percent for periods of three months to one year the official said 
kyodo said the ministry investigated after press reports alleged 
that daiwa had filed false business reports to cover up losses it 
incurred in compensating the customer

the number of working domestic oil and gas rigs 
dropped by 18 to total 1061 after rising by 21 last week 
officials of baker hughes inc reported tuesday 
the company said the latest rig count is up from the 940 posted 
a year ago 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 
but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 42gallon barrel in 
the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the rig count that 
bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began compiling 
figures 
among the major oil producing states california showed the 
largest gain with seven while michigan posted six more rigs and 
colorado and louisiana each added two 
of those showing losses for the week texas and kansas each 
dropped 13 rigs ohio had four and new mexico and pennsylvania

grain and soybean futures prices slipped in early 
trading today on the chicago board of trade with much of the 
selling stemming from warming temperatures in the great plains and 
midwest 
moderating temperatures after a twoweek spell of severely cold 
weather eased transportation problems as well as demand for 
livestock feed 
early selling in the soybean market also was linked to reports 
of light rain in southern brazil over the weekend and forecasts for 
more moisture in that area one of the worlds major 
soybeanproducing pockets 
it is early summer in brazil dry weather during the planting 
season had stirred drought fears but those concerns have faded as 
growing conditions improved in recent weeks

higher with the contract for delivery in march at 410 a bushel

the frigid weather that swept through much of the 
south over the holiday weekend has caused substantial damage to 
floridas 35 billion citrus crop and hurt other important winter 
crops agriculture officials say 
this freeze has just devastated us said anne goodnight 
commissioner in collier county which has many winter vegetable 
crops and some citrus she said she planned to ask gov bob 
martinez for disaster aid this week 
in texas state officials estimate 70 percent of the citrus crop 
and 80 percent of the winter vegetable crop were destroyed when 
temperatures plunged into the low 20s and upper teens 
losses there were estimated at 200 million but some texas 
officials and growers predicted they would be higher because 
warming temperatures ruined any hopes of salvaging the frozen fruit 
for juice 
although florida officials havent released actual production 
losses the freeze damage is likely to be substantial since much of 
the states crop was still on the trees when temperatures dipped 
blow freezing starting on saturday 
the plunging temperatures taxed the states utilities over the 
weekend and again today the power companies tried to divide the 
misery by cutting electricity to different areas for short periods 
of time but the moves wreaked havoc on citrus groves 
most growers abandoned traditional methods of protecting their 
crops such as using smudge pots or wind machines and instead used 
networks of microjets which spray water on the trees to protect 
them from freezing 
when the power went off the protective irrigation systems 
failed 
there was nothing i could do about it said john heist a 
lake county citrus grower they turned off the electricity at 
about 9 am sunday but it was too cold and the system froze in 
parts 
we would have been better off not to turn on the system at 
all 
immokalee a winter vegetable production center was hit hard by 
the chill 
farmers said the area lost more than 90 percent of its tomatoes 
peppers and other vegetables which are worth more than 200 
million yearly 
among the few happy farmers were strawberry growers who came 
through the hard freeze better than others 
no wind no problem said roy parke of parkesdale farms a 
berry farmer in plant city 
a lack of wind allows irrigation systems to build an even layer 
of ice on fragile plants to protect the bloom wind scatters the 
water from sprinklers allowing colder temperatures to get to the 
plants and damage or kill them 
parke estimated that the 162 million berry industry likely 
would suffer only half the loss expected 
growers were not the only agricultural workers suffering from 
the freeze migrant workers found their livelihood endangered 
if there arent any other crops to pick these people dont 
have any other place to work said charles esposito program 
manager for the bethel mission in plant city 
more than 10000 migrant workers living in immokalee for the 
picking season which runs from november through may may be 
unemployed before the freeze they earned 40 to 125 a day

said tuesday that 1990 could be the toughest year in a decade for 
the auto industry which already is hurting from declining sales 
and temporary layoffs

million cars and 51 million trucks mark a return to a more 
normal trend after four years of combined industry sales of 152 
million to 163 million vehicles

million light trucks are based largely on costly incentive programs 
across the industry in an attempt to drum up buyers iacocca said

trucks

toughest year the industry has faced in a decade

on its minivans the incentive which ends jan 31 was the 
firstever rebate on the automakers popular minivans

corp and ford motor co last week announced temporary shutdowns 
of many assembly lines in january

three days before federal bank regulators 
approved a delay in seizing lincoln savings and loan in may 1988 
the private accountant whose audits influenced the decision 
switched jobs and went to work for the thrifts owner according to 
documents and interviews 
the two regulators whose votes delayed the seizure for a year 
say they did not know at the time that the accountant jack d 
atchison had taken the new job said by one member of congress to 
pay 900000 annually 
but in recent statements former federal home loan bank board 
chairman m danny wall and board member roger f martin said their 
decision concerning the fate of lincoln the nations costliest 
thrift failure might have been different if they had been 
informed 
certainly it would have had an effect on the decision had he 
known said karl hoyle an aide to wall could it have swung 
the other way in favor of immediate seizure maybe 
attempts to reach atchison for comment proved futile his lawyer 
also declined to discuss the matter first reported by the arizona 
republic and said that atchison would not talk about it with 
reporters 
by a 21 vote on may 5 1988 the threemember bank board 
decided against a recommendation from san francisco regulators to 
seize the troubled savings and loan the group decided instead to 
launch a new federal examination of the thrifts books the effect 
of the decision was to permit the bank to continue operating for an 
additional year under the ownership of charles h keating jr 
by the time the regulators ousted keating and took control on 
april 14 1989 the cost of protecting depositors had soared and 
may now total more than 2 billion 
wall earlier this month resigned as head of the bank boards 
singleadministrator agency the office of thrift supervision 
under pressure from congress because of his handling of the lincoln 
case he remains in the job until a successor is named 
the delay in seizing lincoln generated a barrage of news stories 
about keating especially the 13 million he and associates 
contributed to campaigns and causes of five senators who intervened 
with the regulators on his behalf 
the senate ethics committee has begun a formal investigation to 
determine whether the intervention was linked to the money all the 
senators have denied any wrongdoing 
since 1986 favorable audit reports on lincoln had been written 
by atchison who was managing partner in the phoenix office of the 
large accounting firm of arthur young now ernst amp young 
bradley boland keatings spokesman said atchison began working 
for lincolns parent firm american continental corp of phoenix 
on may 2 1988 three days before the crucial meeting of the bank 
board house banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas 
said atchisons salary with american continental was 900000 a 
year 
an arthur young memo confirmed the timing of the job change 
saying that atchison decided to accept a position with american 
continental corp effective may 1 1988 
last nov 7 atchison refused to answer questions before 
gonzalez committee claiming a fifth amendment constitutional 
right against selfincrimination 
at the time atchison switched jobs the san franciscobased 
regulators were telling the bank board that lincoln was in such 
serious trouble that it should be taken over by the government 
but atchisons audits according to a transcript of the bank 
boards may 5 1988 meeting concluded that the thrift had enough 
reserves to cover losses and had met net worth requirements 
faced with the differing opinions the bank board conducted its 
21 vote to freeze lincolns level of investments transfer the 
bank board investigation from san franciso to washington and begin 
a new probe of the irvine calif thrift 
wall and martin voted in the majority while board member 
lawrence j white constituted a singlevote minority who favored 
immediate government seizure 
martin said in an interview that he didnt know that atchison 
had gone to work for american continental three days before the 
meeting he said he would have been concerned had he known and 
absolutely would have raised questions about the impartiality 
of the audits 
we were were very dependent on the accountants opinion he 
said 
wall spokesman hoyle said his boss did not have any 
knowledge of the job change 
at a minimum he would have wanted to go back and check with 
arthur young hoyle said no doubt we would have looked at 
things differently because it would have made the data suspect 
its a significant factor if you knew perhaps these numbers were 
tainted 
d jeffrey hirschberg associate general counsel for ernst amp 
young said we clearly have no evidence atchison committed any 
impropriety when he was a partner at arthur young 
we have partners that leave all the time for betterpaying 
jobs in industry he said its not unusual just because jack 
left does not mean the audit was improper

orange juice futures prices soared tuesday after a weekend 
freeze in the south that damaged a portion of the florida orange 
crop and wiped out 70 percent of the texas citrus crop 
heating oil futures prices also climbed dramatically following 
an explosion at the nations secondlargest petrochemical refinery 
on other commodity markets coffee and cotton futures rose 
sharply precious metals futures fell livestock and meat futures 
advanced and grains and soybeans retreated 
on the new york cotton exchange the contract for january 
delivery of frozen concentrated orange juice jumped 161 cents to 
1531 a pound an 118 percent gain the contracts for march and 
may delivery rose their permitted daily limits of 5 cents a pound 
florida officials said it was too early to estimate the damage 
that occurred to the states 35 billion citrus crop when 
temperatures plunged below freezing over the weekend 
celeste georkakis of cargill investor services inc said her 
firms early assessment was that 20 percent to 30 percent of the 
florida orange crop had been destroyed which would be less than 
was lost in christmas day 1983 freeze 
but the markets reaction tuesday indicated the damage was 
probably worse than most traders had expected ms georkakis said 
orange juice prices had been falling before the freeze threat 
surfaced last week a reflection of increased brazilian orange 
production which is expected to reach a record 290 million boxes 
in 1990 
analysts said imports of brazilian orange juice should make up 
for damage to the florida crop so instead of a sharp price 
increase at the retail level because of the freeze ms georkakis 
said us consumers may simply see a halt to falling prices or 
only a slight rise 
but robert behr economic research director for the florida 
department of citrus said he had heard rumors that at least one 
florida processor planned to raise its wholesale price of frozen 
concentrated orange juice to 150 from 137 a pound because of 
the freeze 
heating oil futures prices surged on the new york mercantile 
exchange in the wake of a weekend explosion at an exxon corp 
refinery in baton rouge la raising prospects of further spot oil 
shortages 
the accident at the plant aggravated a price spike caused by the 
recordsetting cold snap that has hit much of the nation supplies 
of home heating oil already were tight before the explosion and the 
accelerated demand has pushed retail prices as high as 1 a gallon 
in some areas 
heating oil futures climbed 175 cents to 1074 cents with 
january settling at 9248 cents a gallon crude oil settled 53 
cents to 63 cents higher with february at 2191 a barrel unleaded 
gasoline was 19 cents to 549 cents higher with january at 6094 
cents a gallon

reports of a weekend freeze in mexicos coffeegrowing region 
coffee settled 418 cents to 45 cents higher with march at 8267 a 
pound 
cotton futures rose sharply on the cotton exchange on a 
combination of technical factors and rumors that china had 
purchased a large amount of us and pakistani cotton cotton 
settled 113 cents to the limit 2 cents higher with march at 7071 
cents a pound 
the easing of tensions in panama and romania prompted a selloff 
of preciousmetals futures on new yorks commodity exchange 
gold futures finished 640 to 670 lower with december at 
40680 a troy ounce silver was 48 cents to 5 cents lower with 
december at 5512 a troy ounce
