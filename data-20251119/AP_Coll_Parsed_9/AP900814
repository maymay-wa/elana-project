the call by saddam hussein for arab forces 
to rise up to protect islam is being seriously heeded in egypt but 
thousands of eager young egyptians are signing up to fight the 
iraqi president not his enemies 
on monday as they have for days crowds of university 
graduates civil servants and unemployed youth milled outside the 
embassies of saudi arabia the united arab emirates and kuwait in 
hopes of enlisting in those oilrich countries armies kuwait has 
been occupied since aug 2 by iraqi forces 
some said dreams of big money as mercenaries were alluring 
however most emphasized their goals were to save islams holiest 
shrines in mecca and medina from desecration either by iraqis or by 
westerners fighting to repel what some believe is an imminent iraqi 
invasion of saudi arabia 
a saudi official said 4000 men had registered since saturday 
for duty 
if mecca falls were finished said ashraf ahmed a 
25yearold schoolteacher i want to go fight because the iraqis 
are bad people because we want to free our brothers there in 
kuwait and because we want to defend the islamic holy places 
ahmed was among at least 200 men overflowing into the street 
beside the saudi embassy filling out papers and stuffing them 
through a small window to an embassy employee 
the scene was being repeated blocks away at the embassy of the 
united arab emirates the uae and saudi arabia are among persian 
gulf countries who asked other arabs for help to defend themselves 
against a possible iraqi incursion 
egypt morocco and syria are among those countries committing 
troops in line with a resolution adopted by 12 states at an arab 
summit friday the resolution also supported saudi arabias request 
for us military help which has led to deployment of a 
multinational force near its 500mile border with iraq 
as the summit was going on saddam issued a statement urging 
arabs to attack western forces in the gulf region he also said the 
saudi ruling family should be overthrown to protect and rescue 
the shrines of islam in the kingdom 
the enlistment queues at the saudi uae and kuwait embassies 
appeared to have formed spontaneously 
the saudi embassy official who spoke of 4000 registrants said 
the embassy had not advertised for volunteers they just came on 
their own he said 
a letter is all that is needed including a volunteers name 
age profession military experience and willingness to join the 
armed forces 
the saudi official who spoke on condition of anonymity said he 
has no idea what will become of the offers 
we will later transfer all these forms to the egyptian 
government he said some of the volunteers ask me about 
payment but i tell them we havent heard of that at all 
the volunteers were discussing figures of 2600 saudi riyals per 
month about 695 monthly at current conversion rates to 10000 
riyals or 2674 for the whole mission 
egypts latest per capita income is about 670 annually 
one of the volunteers said he would be surprised if they were 
not rewarded for their service said salem sayed outside the 
kuwaiti embassy there will probably be some kind of appreciation 
for standing by them 
about 3000 egyptian soldiers have arrived in saudi arabia a 
significant contribution by an arab country but small compared to 
the estimated 50000 us forces scheduled to be sent there 
another 1000 egyptian troops are expected soon in saudi arabia

arabs who support president saddam 
hussein of iraq often cite one simple fact he is a fellow arab 
while most of the troops arrayed against him in the persian gulf 
region are foreigners 
almost half the 21 members of the arab league find his 
annexation of kuwait more palatable than the armed forces from the 
united states britain and france deployed to defend saudi arabia 
these countries in arab eyes are identified with the creation 
and support of israel colonial exploitation and even the crusades 
of the middle ages 
saddams invasion of a fellow arab state was a shock but many 
arabs consider the wests intervention to thwart an arab leader who 
has challenged israel is a greater reason for alarm 
veteran middle east analyst charles snow noted the west and 
indeed the international community as a whole may see the invasion 
in blackandwhite terms as a simple case of aggression by a 
large and powerful country against a virtually defenseless 
neighbor 
but he wrote in mondays edition of the middle east economic 
survey that in the arab world there is a profound ambivalence 
about president saddam and there are many who are prepared to 
overlook the attack on kuwait for the sake of iraqs willingness to 
stand up to outsiders both on its own behalf and if defense of arab 
causes like the struggle to regain palestine 
violent antiamerican demonstrations have erupted in jordan 
yemen sudan mauritania and the israelioccupied west bank and 
gaza strip 
nine arab league members rejected fridays initiative to send 
troops to saudi arabia and support un sanctions against iraq 
one of the opponents libya has been opposed to the united 
states since col moammar gadhafi seizing power in 1969 
another the palestine liberation organization has been 
frustrated in the failure to translate its dialogue with the united 
states into concrete moves toward a state 
yemen is a longtime saudi rival and gets massive aid from saddam 
but many moderate states some with good relations with the 
united states see its intervention as a bald attempt to protect 
american wallets not a stand on principle 
the use of international law to justify the american presence 
on islamic soil is only a means of defending western interests 
rabah bitat president of the algerian peoples national assembly 
said monday 
the different people of the region should find their solutions 
under an arab and regional umbrella without any outside 
interference 
but the arabs cannot agree on a solution 
fridays arab league resolution to send troops and respect 
unmandated sanctions had the support of the kings and emirs of 
the gulf along with king hassan ii of morocco they see iraqs 
aug 2 overthrow of sheik jaber alahmed alsabah of kuwait as a 
bad precedent for all monarchs 
president hafez assad of syria has a personal dispute with the 
iraqi leader aggravated by a 20year rift between the rival 
branches of the arab baath socialist party that rules in both 
countries 
president hosni mubarak believed saddam insulted him by breaking 
a promise not to invade kuwait 
there is a widespread feeling among arabs that the united states 
has a double standard when held against washingtons reluctance to 
push israel out of the territories it has occupied since the 1967 
middle east war 
the united states said jordanian political analyst kamel abdel 
jaber maintained a dark and horrible silence when israel 
continues 23 years later to occupy the west bank jerusalem and 
the former syrian golan heights 
wrote the independent tunisian daily assabah the united 
states has only caused misfortune to arabs 
it is a sentiment saddam appeals to repeatedly in his speeches 
he tried to justify his annexation of kuwait as correcting an 
injury of colonial map makers 
on sunday he linked his possible withdrawal from kuwait to 
israels unconditional withdrawal from the occupied territories 
including jerusalem islams third holiest city 
saddam also accused the saudi kings of defiling the holy city of 
mecca and medina calling for their overthrow for allowing american 
troops into the kingdom 
the basis for arab unity reaches back to harun alrashid the 
islamic caliph who ruled a truly united arab world from baghdad to 
the atlantic in the 9th century the last time it was one piece 
the first violations of that unity were the crusades which to 
the arab public might have happened yesterday 
notes lebanese historian amin maalouf the arab east still 
sees the west as a natural enemy and there can be now doubt 
that the schism between these two worlds dates from the crusades 
deeply felt by the arabs even today as an act of rape

experts say moral and political considerations would keep the 
united states from retaliating in kind to a chemical weapons strike 
by iraq but there is another constraint the weapons would 
accomplish little 
much of the us arsenal of poison gas weapons is old and 
defective what could be used is designed for a closequarters 
fight in european fields and forests not the hot open expanses of 
the desert moreover nearly half the 30000 tons of us chemical 
agents sits in storage tanks in arkansas indiana and other states 
what chemicals the united states could get there would be in 
artillery shells and that doesnt figure into the kind of response 
wed want to make said gordon burck a washington consultant and 
former director of studies on chemical and biological warfare at 
the federation of american scientists 
the united states and other powers pledged in an international 
pact during the 1970s not to be the first to use chemical weapons 
the use of chemical weapons in war were banned under the geneva 
conventions after world war i 
experts like burck agree there is little chance us forces 
would ever use chemical weapons in response to an iraqi attack the 
nation and its allies could not abide their use the united states 
would lose whatever moral high ground it now has in the arab world 
following iraqs invasion of kuwait 
it would put the president on the same moral plane as iraq 
president saddam hussein in the eyes of people who havent made up 
their mind on the issue said matthew meselson a harvard 
biochemist who has advised arms control negotiators since 1963 
although this country has not used lethal chemical agents since 
world war i large quantities of tear gas known as cs were used 
during the vietnam war 
they shipped 11 million pounds of it in 155mm shells and 
500pound bombs said meselson the purpose was to force men 
out of protective cover so they could come into the line of fire 
it was called a force multiplier but it didnt multiply the 
force much it wasnt very successful 
the united states arsenal of lethal chemicals includes mustard 
gas which can burn the skin and lungs the lethal nerve gas known 
as ga or sarin and vx a more deadly nerve agent that can kill 
after limited contact to the skin 
the weapons and chemicals are kept in alabama arkansas 
colorado indiana kentucky maryland oregon and tooele utah 
where 40 percent of the us arsenal is stored 
chemical artillery shells kept in europe are slated to be moved 
to johnston atoll in the pacific later this year to be destroyed 
brad roberts a chemical arms expert at washingtons center for 
strategic and international studies said these weapons were 
stockpiled over the years as a deterrent in any european land war 
with the soviet union 
but in the mid1980s a presidential commission reported that 
only 11 percent to 28 percent of the us stockpile had any 
military application half the stockpile is simply chemicals stored 
in bulk 
most of the chemical bombs rockets and land mines produced 
from world war ii until 1969 are outdated and unreliable roberts 
said much of the chemical artillery shells are for 105mm cannon 
which is now in limited use 
the artillery weapons that remain available would have little 
military value in any conflict envisioned in the middle east 
the war we seem to be looking at is not of artillery duels or 
ground attacks as we envisioned in europe but of air 
superiority said roberts the only kinds of these weapons that 
could be used would be air delivered bombs and we dont have any 
the military and political limitations of chemical warfare 
raised in the iraq crisis and the new strategic situation in europe 
are likely to renew debate over eliminating us chemical weapons 
entirely 
if they couldnt use them in this scenario where could they 
use it asked burck we made a gross mistake in past years and 
made things we probably didnt need we may reevaluate keeping any 
stockpiles at all

rock singer don henley and other luminaries from 
music and politics launched an effort monday to preserve walden 
pond by buying some adjoining land slated for development

woodland made famous by literary recluse henry david thoreau to 
forestall plans for a 139unit condominium 
the project along with a group called the trust for public 
land also is negotiating to acquire another section of woods 700 
yards from the pond which is scheduled to be an office park

down payment on the proposed condominium site 
hearst officials said all advertising revenues from the first 
issue of their new publication countryside will be donated to 
eight land trust programs around the country 
about 500000 people visit walden pond every year and for many 
of them its the closest they come to a natural wilderness 
experience said peter forbes new england regional director for 
the trust for public land 
walden pond is a 62acre body of water in a 333acre state 
reservation on the edge of concord an affluent town of 12500 
about 20 miles from boston

thoreaus 1854 meditation on solitude and the wilderness it lies 
less than a hundred yards from a highway and is next to a garbage 
dump 
henley organized the efforts after seeing a tv report earlier

four cubans seeking political refuge have 
forced their way into the belgian ambassadors residence in havana 
the mexican government news agency notimex reported 
the action monday complicates cuban efforts to end a series of 
embassy invasions last month that strained cuban relations with 
european nations eighteen cubans remain at the spanish embassy 
notimex said the belgian embassys second secretary illy 
leeman said the four cubans aged 20 to 40 entered the residence of 
ambassador loie cornet 
he said that police surrounded the building after the belgians 
notified cuban officials 
belgian officials said they would not release the names of the 
refugeseekers for security reasons 
cuban president fidel castro has insisted that refugeseekers 
should surrender unconditionally to cuban authorities although it 
has given promises not to prosecute many of them 
spain has insisted that all those in its embassy should be given 
asylum 
asylumseekers also had entered homes of czechoslovak and 
italian diplomats earlier this summer but eventually departed

president bush has asked japan to increase its aid 
to middle eastern nations affected by the persian gulf crisis 
foreign ministry officials said today 
the foreign ministry did not specify which nations were 
considered for increased aid egypt jordan and turkey are among 
japanese aid recipients affected by the increaed tensions following 
iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
bush telephoned kaifu monday night us time which was this 
morning in japan and asked japan to boost its support of countries 
involved in the crisis said a foreign ministry official speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
kaifu was quoted as replying that japan was studying how it 
could cooperate with the international effort to restore peace and 
stability in the region and he would consider expanding support 
for nations affected by the crisis 
japan is debating how to increase its backing for the 
international effort to make iraq withdraw its invaders from 
kuwait and kaifu on monday postponed a trip to five middle eastern 
countries in order to concentrate on the gulf crisis 
japans constitution forbids the use of force to resolve 
international disputes and the country could not send military 
units to join the usled multinational force that is quarantining 
trade with iraq 
in 1987 confronted with similar demands from its western 
partners to aid the effort against iraqi and iranian attacks on oil 
tankers in the gulf japan eventually gave indirect financial help 
tokyo financed a navigation system to keep track of ships in the 
gulf gave jordan loans and grants worth about 550 million and a 
credit line of 300 million and increased the money it paid to 
support us troops based in japan 
but the japanese government decided against sending a 
minesweeper to the gulf as other countries did because of the 
constitutional ban on sending troops into action overseas 
a high foreign ministry official told reporters monday that 
japan is determined to decide on concrete measures to help in 
the gulf crisis makoto watanabe director of the ministrys middle 
eastern affairs bureau said the government will examine all 
possible measures while observing the provisions of the 
constitution 
japan has agreed to a full trade embargo on iraq and kuwait 
which were supplying 112 percent of japans oil in the first half 
of 1990 
turkey borders iraq and has shut down iraqs parallel pipelines 
egyptian president hosni mubarak convened an arab league meeting 
last week that condemned iraqs invasion of kuwait and called for 
an arab force to be sent to saudi arabia the first arab troops to 
arrive there were egyptians

once again in the persian gulf as in korea 
and the cuban missile crisis an administration is seeking soft 
words for harsh actions 
president bush vows a total bar to iraqi shipping but avoids 
calling it a blockade 
us warplanes are conducting fighter missions over the gulf 
but the president says the united states is not at war 
more than 3000 americans are trapped in kuwait and iraq but 
nobody will call them hostages 
the semantic distinctions have legal as well as political 
reasons behind them experts say but they also suggest it is wise 
to pay attention to what the administration does not just what it 
says 
it does seem to be functionally a limited naval blockade 
said w thomas mallison professor emeritus of law at george 
washington university and a specialist in the law of armed conflict 
if you are stopping ships it sounds suspiciously like a 
blockade doesnt it said si hayakawa the former california 
senator who is the author of widely used books on semantics 
the administration avoids calling it a blockade because the term 
can be interpreted as meaning an act of war 
lets not use the word blockade secretary of state james a 
baker iii said in a television interview sunday lets just say 
we have the legal basis for interdicting these things 
bush at his home in kennebunkport maine said no point 
getting into all these semantics the main thing is to stop the oil 
from coming out of there and that is what were going to do 
asked whether food shipments to iraq would also be blocked the 
president replied just watch everything 
a spokesman for australias foreign ministry announcing monday 
that his government will join the action used the term 
blockade and said the aim was to prevent any supplies from 
going into or out of iraq 
mallison as a retired naval officer worked with navy lawyers 
on the 1962 quarantine of soviet vessels carrying offensive 
missiles to cuba the soviets at first challenged the blockade but 
later diverted their ships 
mallison said the word blockade was avoided because it 
conjured up pictures of the us and british blockades of 
world war ii which said in effect to the axis enemy that you cant 
use the oceans 
perhaps the interdiction terminology is used here as it was in 
the cuban situation to indicate that there are limitations on it 
he said 
in his televised address before flying to kennebunkport last 
week bush assured the nation that were not in a war in the 
persian gulf 
at the moment i guess were not said mallison 
hayakawa agreed saying that at this time it is something 
very much short of a war 
the united states has committed 50000 troops to the region and 
warplanes from the carrier uss independence have been conducting 
fighter missions over the gulf for several hours a night since a 
few days after iraqs armed takeover of kuwait on aug 2 
in 1950 president truman used the phrase police action to 
describe the dispatch of united nations troops most of them 
american to korea before the war ended three years later about 
580000 un and south korean troops and 16 million north korean 
and chinese fighting men were killed or wounded 
you could again call it korea a limited war functionally 
mallison said 
he said the laws of armed conflict such as those governing 
treatment of prisoners of war go into effect under the geneva 
convention whatever label you put on it 
the state department said monday that about 500 americans have 
quietly slipped out of kuwait since the iraqi invasion 
circumventing iraqi efforts to detain them this leaves about 2500 
in kuwait and 500 to 600 in iraq 
the administration has refused to call them hostages 
hostages frequently are associated with some kind of a demand 
and the iraq government in spite of having made various demands 
hasnt linked any of them to us or other western personnel 
said mallison 
of course in view of what happened to jimmy carter and the 
great anguish over the embassy captives in iran there is fear also 
of political fallout domestically if you call them hostages he 
said 
former president carter was defeated for reelection in 1980 
after prolonged efforts which succeeded on ronald reagans 
inauguration day to free 52 americans held hostage in tehran 
bush responding to a question in kennebunkport refused to 
describe the detention of americans by the iraqis as a hostage 
situation 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler has described the 
americans as sequestered

american soldiers are used to training with 
foreign troops but fighting iraq with the multinational force 
taking shape in saudi arabia would pose staggering problems in 
command and control military experts say 
the first problem to solve is communication a combination of 
language and the technical means of passing messages said adm 
thomas h moorer a retired former chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff and nato naval commander 
a more sensitive question is how to assign control of forces 
moorer and others said monday 
for reasons of national pride the saudis will want at least 
nominal control over the us and other foreign forces on their 
soil but pentagon planners say actual combat operations if 
required would be mainly under us direction 
its probably the biggest problem we can see right now said 
an army strategist who discussed planning for operation desert 
shield the american deployment of warplanes and ground forces to 
saudi arabia on condition he not be identified 
at least 50000 us troops have been committed to the saudi 
operation including marines army air assault forces paratroopers 
and infantry they are part of a multinational effort to deter 
iraqi president saddam hussein from invading saudi arabia which is 
the united states largest supplier of imported oil 
the lead elements of an egyptian combat force expected to total 
at least 4000 men arrived over the weekend at a saudi air base 
near the iraqi border morocco is expected to send roughly an equal 
number of ground forces this week syria is committing troops and 
pakistan voted monday to send forces 
in the seas surrounding saudi arabia a large us naval armada 
is complemented by warships from britain france belgium the 
netherlands and other nations 
for the americans on saudi soil cultural barriers are a special 
concern 
the islamic kingdom strongly disapproves of unmarried women and 
men associating with each other in public and islamic law 
prohibits the possession or use of alcohol the kingdom also shares 
the arab worlds hostility toward jews 
the pentagon however is making no special arrangements for 
the women and jews who have arrived in saudi arabia as part of the 
american force said spokesman capt sam grizzle 
american forces have trained with foreign troops for decades 
most of the training has been with the west european and canadian 
allies in the north atlantic treaty organization over the past 10 
years the army also has held field exercises with various nations 
in the middle east including saudi arabia 
last winter about 5000 troops directed by the us central 
command participated in war games with the egyptian army in the 
desert near the nile river delta some of the americans were from 
units now being deployed to saudi arabia 
joshua m epstein a defense analyst at the brookings 
institution think tank in washington said coordinating us and 
saudi combat operations in the event of a war against iraq would be 
made easier by the fact that most saudi weaponry is usmade 
maj gen don l kaufman chief of a permanent us contingent 
in saudi arabia that trains saudis to use usbuilt weaponry said 
monday the kingdoms leadership has been very cooperative in 
accommodating the us troop arrivals 
kaufmans comments suggested that the pentagon was calling the 
shots in the desert campaign and that the saudis had not fully 
understood american intentions 
they are finding that we are not going to allow a handful of 
americans to be in harms way he told a group of american 
reporters at an air base in saudi arabia the numbers are larger 
i think than the saudis originally anticipated 
rear adm william m fogarty commander of a nineship us 
naval group in the persian gulf said monday that no decision had 
been made on who would be in charge in the event of war 
it is being worked on he said he declined to say whether 
us forces would be subordinate to nonamerican commanders 
the most obvious and seemingly simple problem for a 
multinational force the language barrier can be eased by the 
use of interpreters if necessary but it rarely is resolved 
entirely 
thats a problem even when were dealing with the english and 
the canadians said moorer

an american oil worker in saudi arabia says 
the persian gulf crisis makes you uneasy nervous but he and 
two other oil workers say they dont believe their lives are in 
danger 
the three aramco oil company employees said monday they have 
found strong support among saudi citizens for the massive 
deployment of us troops to protect saudi arabia from possible 
invasion by iraq 
the saudis ive talked to are very much supportive of the 
american troops and their presence here said mike mcmahon of 
phoenix who said he has been in saudi arabia working for aramco 
off and on for 10 years 
during the iraniraq war when the us ships were in the 
persian gulf there was a mixed feeling among the saudis mcmahon 
said but this time i feel like most everybody is glad to see 
them especially when they first came because of the reports about 
the iraqi troops massing at the border 
the three employees said they initially feared iraqi forces 
would continue south into the saudi kingdom after conquering kuwait 
but now feel reassured that such an attack would be repelled 
the men work at an aramco facility in abqaiq more than 200 
miles south of the kuwaitsaudi border near which iraqi troops 
have taken up positions 
they were interviewed at a hotel elsewhere in saudi arabia by a 
reporter allowed into the country with a pentagon media pool 
guests at the hotel included dozens of kuwaitis britons and others 
who fled kuwait after iraq attacked on aug 2 
ground rules for media coverage prohibit disclosure of the exact 
location 
one of the three aramco workers joe daniel of eastman ga was 
heading home on a flight monday night daniel is a student at the 
new orleans baptist seminary who was in saudi arabia for a summer 
job and had been scheduled to leave sometime this month 
i tried to get out earlier right after the invasion but 
there was a waiting list daniel said i wasnt really afraid 
but everybody at the aramco camp thought it would be best to go 
as soon as possible 
daniel said he called family members the day after the invasion 
to let them know he was safe we really dont feel any danger 
said daniel who arrived in saudi arabia two months ago 
aramco has about 5000 american workers in saudi arabia about 
80 percent of their dependents have left since the iraqi invasion 
of kuwait the men said 
mcmahon said most americans learned of the iraqi invasion from 
voice of america and british broadcasting corp broadcasts 
it makes you uneasy nervous but i never had personally any 
fear for my life said mcmahon ive thought from the beginning 
that the risk to us was pretty low 
he said another aramco worker whom he declined to name went to 
the saudikuwait border shortly after the invasion in an effort to 
inquire about family members in kuwait 
he wasnt able to get in mcmahon said iraqi soldiers 
stopped him at the border 
the third aramco worker asked to be identified only by his first 
name walt and said he was from mississippi 
he said the americans most worried about the prospect of an 
iraqi invasion of saudi territory have left with most of them 
leaving their cars out at the airport we still believe there is no 
real threat here but any time the military is involved some people 
get hysterical 
walt who said he has worked in saudi arabia for seven years 
said that based on his recent conversations with saudis he 
believes iraqi president saddam hussein has forfeited his 
credibility among the arabs here and they are now very much against 
him and very supportive of the us presence 
both walt and mcmahon said they would be leaving saudi arabia 
soon for scheduled vacations but planned to return 
in some ways im sorry to leave at this time mcmahon said 
its a stressful period for some of our people and i wish i could 
stay with them and ride it out

the hubble space telescope cant look to the 
edge of the universe until its vision is corrected but it is 
beginning to give scientists unprecedented views of celestial 
objects closer to home 
nasa released the first such photograph on monday a detailed 
look into a prolific starforming area clearly showing 60 stars in 
an area once thought to have only a single massive star 
the picture has exciting scientific content and demonstrates 
the hubble space telescope is very much alive said ed weiler 
the nasa scientist in charge of the project 
the picture was made aug 3 of a star cluster called 30 doradus 
located in the constellation dorado the swordfish an area in the 
southern hemisphere known as a star nursery the cluster is 
believed to be 160000 to 170000 years old a baby in a universe 
10 billion to 20 billion years old 
in the photograph each of the stars had a fuzzy halo caused by 
the flaw in making the telescopes mirrors a computer then took 
out the haloes producing a much crisper image of the stars 
the starforming region of 30 doradus is probably the most 
prolific area of star formation certainly within several million 
light years its almost like the 1950s baby boom in the united 
states weiler said 
in the early 1980s astronomers studying this object thought 
it was just a single star but a truly supermassive star he 
said later in the decade groundbased telescopes resolved the 
light into 27 stillmassive objects 
but said weiler the hubble image clearly shows at least 60 
stars so close together that they would fit into the area between 
the sun and alpha centauri which at four light years distance is 
the star closest to our solar system 
dr rick white associate astronomer with the space telescope 
science institute said the image is 10 times better than the 
average image that can be taken from the ground a photograph of 
the region taken from an observatory in chile showed the star 
cluster as a single bright image 
the haloes are the fault of the error in the mirror but the 
cores of the images are just the same size as the images we would 
have had from the space telescope if the mirrors had been 
perfect white said 
but he said he doesnt want to leave the impression that 
computer restoration can rectify the 15 billion telescopes 
shortcomings 
you cant go back to the original image you would have had 
without the error in the mirror white said but what you can 
do is get images that have the full fine resolution that the hubble 
telescope would have had and that the telescope still does have 
the telescopes widefield camera and other instruments are 
expected to be fitted with corrective lenses early in 1993 nasa 
says that should restore the hubble to its originally planned 
capabilities 
until then the telescope wont be able to fulfill its promise 
of looking back to the beginning of the universe nor will it be 
able to solve the question of how fast the universe is expanding 
said professor james westphal of the california institute of 
technology the principal scientist for the widefield camera

mayor marion barry says he dropped his 
democratic affiliation and declared himself an independent to 
keep my options open for a possible political comeback 
barry political advisers have said the mayor who was convicted 
friday of a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge and acquitted of 
another intends to run for a city council seat but on monday 
barry refused to rule out anything including another bid for 
mayor 
his trial jury was unable to reach a verdict on 12 charges 
including three felony perjury counts and the us attorney has 
said he will decide within the next month whether to retry barry 
barry at a news conference was asked how it would feel running 
against an old colleague who also is seeking an atlarge council 
seat 
youre assuming im not running for mayor barry retorted 
pressed on the issue barry said i have a lot of options 
and i believe i still have a significant contribution to make to 
the city i love 
barry announced that he would not run for mayor in june just 
before the start of his drug and perjury trial since the deadline 
for entering the citys sept 11 party primaries ended july 5 
barrys only chance to get on the ballot for novembers general 
election is to run as an independent 
to run for the citywide council seat the mayor also must 
gather signatures from 3000 registered voters before aug 29 he 
would need the same number of signatures to run for mayor 
top aides to the mayor suggested barry is not seriously 
considering making a fourth run for the job he has held since 1978 
he thinks he has a much better chance to win a council seat 
even though a mayoral race tempts him said one political aide 
who spoke on condition of anonymity every indication i am 
getting is that he will run for the council 
the mayor added monday that he will make his decision after 
taking a few days vacation this week 
barry said that switching his party affiliation was not an 
easy decision for me 
my roots go deep in the democratic party ive been a 
democrat all my adult life barry said i still believe very 
much in the progressive ideals of the democratic party but in 
terms of local politics i decided to change my registration to 
keep my options open 
some of barrys top advisers contend that if barry reenters 
politics he is more likely to receive jail time for his cocaine 
conviction sources in his political camp say some of the mayors 
followers also believe that us attorney jay b stephens would be 
more likely to retry the mayor on a dozen charges the jury in his 
drug and perjury trial was unable to resolve the sources added 
meanwhile the justice department said it will be up to stephens 
to decide whether to bring the case again 
stephens does not need our permission to retry a case said 
justice department spokesman dan eramian when asked if the 
department would participate in the decision stephens hasnt yet 
said whether he plans to retry the case 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson has not yet set a 
sentencing date for barrys misdemeanor cocaine possession 
conviction which could carry a maximum penalty of one year in 
prison and a 100000 fine 
the mayor rebuffed suggestions that he might run for office 
again just to complete 20 years of city government service and 
qualify for a pension 
those who have said that my staying in politics is just for 
the pension are insensitive insulting and just plain insane 
barry said money has never been my primary motivation 
community service was

a backlash against the homeless has 
hit progressive santa monica a city so tolerant it serves street 
people free meals on the city hall lawn 
grumbling over the citys benevolence toward the homeless 
erupted into a revolt after a vagrant with a pair of scissors 
mugged an 89yearold woman in a grocery store in march 
although the man was convicted and sentenced to 14 years in 
prison community activists in this city of 96500 launched a 
campaign to oust city attorney robert myers blaming his policy 
against prosecuting nonviolent homelessnessrelated crimes 
its an outrage said activist leslie dutton these 
policies have encouraged the criminal element to stay in our 
community people are prisoners in their apartments theyre even 
afraid to go shopping 
residents complain families and the old people cant go to the 
parks businesses worry about tourism some say the city should 
toughen up on the homeless 
we fund over 2 million in social service programs for the 
homeless said councilwoman christine reed a member of the 
councils conservative minority the bums and the aggressive 
vagrants are people who are coming here to live this lifestyle by 
choice we are making it too comfortable for them 
santa monica jokingly called soviet monica has been known over 
the years for rent control limousine liberals and compassion for 
everyone but landlords and developers 
when the homeless population grew in the 1980s the city 
responded with food referral programs and other services every 
afternoon as many as 300 homeless people eat free meals outside 
city hall 
meanwhile myers chose not to prosecute nonviolent crimes such 
as public drunkenness and camping in parks instead he referred 
such arrests to social workers jail does nothing to solve 
homelessness myers said when someone is released from jail 
theyre still homeless theyre still on the street 
the homeless population here as in other cities has risen 
some say because santa monica has made itself so inviting the 
parks have become havens for the homeless who sleep under the palm 
trees drink cheap booze from paper bags beg for change and 
defecate on the grass 
crime also is on the rise with a large percentage of rapes and 
robberies blamed on vagrants 
in 1985 6 percent of rapes were by transients compared with 42 
percent in 1989 and 46 percent for the first five months of this 
year authorities said nineteen percent of robberies were by 
transients five years ago compared with 35 percent last year and 
49 percent so far in 1990 
the breaking point for many came when james earl tillman 
attacked frances finnen with a pair of scissors and grabbed her 
purse tillman was convicted of robbery and assault but acquitted 
of attempted murder 
activists launched a successful campaign to put on the ballot a 
measure to make the appointed city attorneys post an elected 
position 
in blaming myers they overlooked misdemeanor charges he filed 
against tillman in an unrelated incident a month before the 
mugging after county prosecutors had declined to file charges 
supporters of the citys homeless policies say myers critics 
are looking for easy solutions to a complicated problem 
american citizens are not very good on chronic pain whether 
its longterm illness or longterm homelessness said john 
suggs coordinator of the westside shelter coalition our society 
goes for the quick fix but this isnt a quickfix problem

colombias leading newspaper says the 
verdict in the cocaine trial of washington mayor marion barry is a 
psychological blow to the countrys war on drug trafficking 
the verdict convicting barry on only one of the 14 charges 
against him was a virtual absolution of the mayors crimes 
the bogota daily el tiempo said in an editorial monday 
barry was convicted last week on one misdemeanor count of 
cocaine possession which carries a maximum sentence of one year in 
jail or a 100000 fine 
el tiempo said the barry verdict will in no way change 
colombias position in fighting drug traffickers the barry case 
was cited by many colombian leaders who have said cocaine 
consumption in the united states fuels violence in colombia 
during the past year colombia has been engaged in an war on 
drug traffickers in which some 500 people including three 
presidential candidates have been killed

in a medical first five tablespoons of 
umbilical cord blood saved after the birth of a baby were given to 
her 4yearold brother in hopes it will help him form new bone 
marrow and beat fastacting leukemia 
michael sancilio received the transfusion at johns hopkins 
oncology center on monday 
his 3monthold sister christina is too young to donate bone 
marrow the usual treatment for michaels form of leukemia and 
doctors were afraid he wouldnt survive the threemonth wait before 
his sister became old enough 
we didnt have any other choice said the youngsters 
mother denise sancilio we couldnt put our baby through a bone 
marrow aspiration its very dangerous for her we were in a 
situation where we had to do it 
it was the first time the rare operation was undertaken to treat 
leukemia an often fatal blood cancer it has been performed three 
other times once in cincinnati and twice in france to treat a 
different disease fanconis anemia 
umbilical cord blood is rich in stem cells used by the 
recipient to form marrow doctors said they will know in about 
three weeks whether the operation worked 
michael who has juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia is at 
extreme risk of infection in the meantime because his cancerous 
bone marrow had to be destroyed as part of the treatment marrow is 
critical to the immune system 
hes been on and off sleeping all day michaels father 
tony said monday night this afternoon he got up and walked down 
the hall and to the childrens playroom hes up and alert a 
little groggy but holding his own 
mrs sancilio said she was 7 months pregnant with christina 
when she learned michael had a form of leukemia that cannot be 
controlled with drugs and usually kills within a year of diagnosis 
the umbilical cord blood was frozen when christina was born may 
1 a total of 27 ounces were given to michael after chemotherapy 
to destroy his cancerous marrow 
the transplant carries the same risk as a bonemarrow 
transplant besides the risk of infection the body often rejects 
foreign cells 
michaels blood type does not match his sisters but doctors 
found that he was not overly likely to reject the umbilical cord 
blood 
tests on michaels parents and his 7yearold brother also 
named tony showed they were not compatible marrow donors the 
family lives in virginia beach va 
the odds were we thought he had the chance of surviving for a 
couple of months but it was unknown when the disease would 
accelerate and become lifethreatening said dr john wagner 
we decided to go ahead and take the chance on the cord blood 
rather than waiting until the donor was old enough 
if the transfusion works it could lead to creation of a bank of 
umbilical cord blood to aid similarly afflicted youngsters doctors 
said 
the transfusion can be performed only on young children because 
not enough blood is in the umbilical cord for use with adults said 
dr richard champlin chief of the bonemarrow transplant program 
at md anderson cancer center in houston 
in the long run it could provide the potential to protect and 
store umbilical blood from every baby and create a bank of cells 
for transplantation that could be used if a patient didnt have a 
donor within the family he said

the postal service criticized for refusing to 
automatically forward nursing home residents mail when they move 
says the policy is costeffective and practical 
but postmaster general anthony m frank said in a letter he was 
disturbed by reports that welltraveled nursing home residents 
mail was being left behind 
i understand you are aware of places where improper mail 
forwarding has caused a hardship for nursing home residents 
frank said in the letter to sen john heinz rpa i am very 
concerned with such reports and can assure you the postal service 
is committed to resolving any problems which may exist frank 
said 
the letter was released monday by heinz ranking republican on 
the senate special committee on aging 
the postal service and the aging committee have agreed to 
collaborate on a campaign to ensure that nursing homes are 
readdressing the mail of residents who have left the committee 
said also frank said the agency has formed an internal committee 
to study the matter further 
because all residents of a nursing home are at the same address 
the postal service says the home should be the agent for their 
mail the mail is delivered in bulk and distributed by the 
institution 
while other people may submit changeofaddress cards to local 
post offices nursing home residents must rely on the institution 
to write their new address on individual letters then the post 
office delivers it at no extra charge 
heinz questioned the policy in a march letter to frank 
frank defended the policy as the most costeffective and 
practical way for postal services to be provided to residents of 
nursing homes

president mikhail s gorbachev has acted to 
restore the rights of victims of josef stalin under whose rule 
millions of peasants died of starvation were shot or sent to labor 
camps as enemies of the people 
in his toughest condemnation yet of stalins forced 
collectivization of agriculture which began in the late 1920s 
gorbachev said monday that thousands of innocent people still bore 
a stain of injustice 
in a sweeping decree gorbachev said the repressions conducted 
during the period of collectivization were unlawful and 
contradictory to the main civilian and economic rights of human 
beings 
he condemned repressions against all citizens on political 
social ethnic religious and other motives in the 1920s through 
the 1950s and moved to completely reinstate the rights of 
these citizens 
gorbachev said the soviet union was taking this action now 
because our society has chosen the path of moral revival 
democracy and legality 
the decree orders the government of the soviet union and its 
republics to submit before oct 1 proposals to legislatures on 
restoring the rights of repressed citizens gorbachev also 
empowered his top advisory group the presidential council to 
supervise the actions 
the decree however excludes those lawfully sentenced for 
crimes against the motherland and against the soviet people 
during world war ii and in the prewar and postwar years 
it orders the soviet government to draft legislation defining 
the crimes that are not subject to rehabilitation 
the decree also does not consider what compensation if any 
victims should receive an informal political group called 
memorial has demanded compensation and restoration of rights for 
stalins victims 
a special commission to study the victims of stalinist 
repression has already rehabilitated thousands 
but even now thousands of cases havent been considered 
gorbachev said in his decree a stain of injustice hasnt been 
removed from the innocent soviet people who suffered during forced 
collectivization who were sentenced deported with their families 
to remote regions without means of existence without a right of 
appeal and without even being aware of the term of their 
sentence 
the decree urges specifically that clergymen and citizens 
persecuted for religious motives should be rehabilitated under 
stalin thousands of priests were shot and religious worship was 
sharply curtailed 
in a landmark speech in november 1987 gorbachev accused stalin 
who ruled the soviet union from 192453 of enormous and 
unforgivable crimes 
but in that speech he also called stalins collectivization a 
transformation of great importance 
in mondays decree there was no such equivocation 
thousands of people were subject to moral and physical 
torture it said many of them were annihilated the lives of 
their families and next of kin were turned into one of humiliation 
and suffering without any hope 
western historians say as many as 20 million people were shot 
starved to death in famines the kremlin did everything to 
encourage or simply vanished into the gulag during stalins reign 
of terror 
thousands of stalins victims were released from labor camps and 
rehabilitated after nikita s khrushchev denounced the dictator in 
a secret speech to the party in 1956 three years after stalin died

two mafia canaries raised the fbis 
hopes of bringing down buffalos mob bosses until one informant 
stopped singing and the other didnt know the song law enforcement 
agents wanted to hear 
john c sacco jr a reputed top mob enforcer allegedly 
returned to a life of crime after giving the fbi bad information 
and ronald m fino the son of a former buffalo crime boss 
produced less information than agents expected 
securing the cooperation of the two organized crime insiders had 
given the fbi confidence that indictments could be obtained against 
the local mafia elite 
saccos defection in particular had thrilled authorities 
because his adherence to the mobs code of silence had been legend 
nobody shot me he once told police while bleeding from three 
gunshot wounds 
but sacco now is in jail accused of dealing cocaine 
loansharking and trying to arrange at least one killing while on 
the fbis payroll 
this is what happens when the fbi takes people like sacco who 
make a lifetime of lying and try dipping them into the river 
jordan and then calling them clean government witnesses said 
paul j cambria jr a defense lawyer 
finos testimony helped convict three men on laborracketeering 
charges but prosecutors became disenchanted with him because he 
failed to produce information that could bring down the leaders of 
buffalos crime family 
us attorney dennis c vacco did not return telephone calls but 
has been quoted as saying i like it better when there is less 
publicity about ron fino 
g robert langford agent in charge of buffalos fbi office 
said the mob investigation is still going forward he predicted 
that buffalos organizedcrime leaders would be indicted within the 
next year 
he acknowledged that saccos backsliding slowed the 
investigation 
we had put a lot of the direction of the investigation based 
on the information he had been giving us langford said now 
weve got to go in different directions 
buffalos mob family does not play as large a role now as it did 
more than 30 years ago when its boss stefano maggadino sat on 
the mafias governing national commission 
its membership has been declining and it does not control the 
citys drug trade but it still runs plenty of gambling and 
loansharking operations langford said 
it is also intertwined with local 210 of the laborers union 
according to law enforcement agents fino became the locals 
business manager in 1973 and became an fbi informant a short time 
later 
in an interview recently in the wall street journal fino said 
his main role was to provide information on underworld influence in 
the union 
he said that he was not a member of the mafia but that figures 
such as anthony liberatore a former laborers official and alleged 
mob figure in cleveland trusted him because they knew his father 
the late joseph fino buffalos mob boss from 1968 to 1972 
but fino said there are limits to the information he can provide 
which is why sacco would have been such an important informant 
he was directly involved in crime that i wouldnt be fino 
said in march much of my involvement is in subtler areas labor 
corruption political corruption the intertwining of organized 
crime 
sacco who began cooperating with the fbi in june 1989 was 
expected to help solve several murders and provide uptodate 
information about mob leaders including reputed boss joseph e 
todaro jr but sometime last spring things began to go wrong 
he gave us a lot of good information and then for whatever 
reason youd have to ask him he changed his mind and started 
giving us bad information langford said he started lying to 
us and that was the end of the deal 
nurturing informants is a delicate task and it is not uncommon 
for them to slide back into the criminal life langford added 
they start cooperating and get scared or they just fall back 
into the old ways he said 
fino knows what the pressure can do to an informant his wife 
divorced him after he sought fbi protection the mob has reportedly 
put out a contract on him fear for his safety kept him from 
attending his mothers funeral last winter 
i try to live a halfway normal life he told the journal 
but its difficult i cant go and come like a normal person the 
toughest thing is my children i dont see them 
would i do it again he asked no the price is too 
expensive

most americans believe an international economic 
embargo will fail to dislodge iraq from kuwait but most also 
oppose us military strikes to achieve that goal an associated 
press poll has found 
at the same time half the respondents to the national survey 
said they fear the iraqi conflict will create an oil crisis in the 
united states in the next few months with rising prices and long 
lines at the gas pump 
despite that fear and despite widespread expectations of a 
usiraq war the poll found strong support for the use of us 
troops to defend saudi arabia against possible iraqi attack 
sixtyfour percent approved 
the survey of 1004 adults was conducted wednesday through 
sunday starting the day president bush said he was sending troops 
that same day iraq announced it was annexing kuwait which it 
invaded the week before 
several polls have found americans rallying behind bush support 
for the use of us troops ranged from 63 percent in a poll tuesday 
and wednesday last week to 81 percent in a oneday poll wednesday 
night 
support for bush personally is about as high seventyseven 
percent in a poll friday to sunday by icr survey research group 
generally approved of his handling of the situation and twothirds 
said his reaction has been about right rather than too tough 
or too weak 
but concerns underlie the support in the ap poll also 
conducted by icr 33 percent said the united states is very 
likely to become involved in a war with iraq and 39 percent 
called war somewhat likely 
republicans were more supportive of the us troop commitment 
than were democrats and independents 74 percent compared with 61 
and 63 percent respectively 
collegeeducated americans also were more supportive of the use 
of us troops women were far less supportive than were men 51 
percent to 79 percent 
bush has said iraqs invasion of kuwait will not stand but 
poll respondents were less clear on that outcome just onethird 
expected the economic embargo of iraq to succeed in forcing it out 
of kuwait 
many did not favor a military alternative thirtyfive percent 
backed the use of us troops to try to push iraq out of kuwait 
and even fewer 27 percent favored bombing iraqi military 
targets to force it from kuwait 
concerning oil an overwhelming 86 percent said oil companies 
were taking advantage of the situation when they raised gasoline 
prices after iraq attacked kuwait just 6 percent called the 
increases legitimate with the rest unsure 
but many expected a true oil crisis fiftytwo percent said they 
believe the situation in the middle east is likely to create oil 
shortages in the next few months with higher prices and 
gasstation lines

a beirut newspaper claimed today the 
radical palestinian faction of terrorist mastermind abu nidal would 
release four belgian hostages wednesday 
a belgian government source dismissed the report by the 
newspaper allima saying it is not the first time this paper has 
had a story like that the official spoke on condition of 
anonymity in brussels 
the frontpage report attributed to unidentified western 
diplomatic sources said the four would be released wednesday in a 
deal that includes the release of convicted palestinian terrorist 
saeed nasser by a special pardon signed by the king of belgium 
it said the deal was worked out between belgian officials and 
fatahrevolutionary council and a belgian press team is to arrive 
in lebanon in the next few hours to cover the release of the four 
hostages it did not disclose further details 
the newspaper does not have a record of accurate reporting on 
the issue of the belgian captives a similar report last month 
predicting the hostages july 21 release proved unfounded 
walid khaled fatahrc spokesman on the hostage issue also 
declined to discuss the reportwell inform you of any 
developments khaled said in an interview 
fatahrc said in 1987 it seized the four belgians aboard their 
boat silco off the israelioccupied gaza strip newspapers have 
reported the hostages were kept in libya and that they had been 
abducted by the libyan navy not by abu nidals group 
they are emmanuel houtekins 44 his wife godlieve kets 50 
their son laurent 20 and daughter valerie 18 
five other people were seized with them including three 
children two of the children were freed in 1988 and the rest last 
april 
saeed believed to be a fatahrc member is serving a life 
sentence in belgium for killing a jewish youth and injuring 20 
others in a 1980 grenade attack he became eligible for parole july 
27 
several unconfirmed news reports have said belgian authorities 
would pardon the palestinian terrorist in exchange for release of 
the four hostages 
because the belgian captives are not believed held in lebanon 
they are not classified among the 14 western hostages kidnapped 
mainly by proiranian shiite moslem factions six americans are 
among those western hostages the longest held is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

prime minister bob hawkes decision to 
send navy ships to the persian gulf is proving controversial in a 
country sensitive to any suggestions that it serves us interests 
the painful memory of involvement in vietnam korea and 
virtually every other major conflict this century also has made 
australians nervous about sending two guidedmissile frigates a 
supply ship and some 600 men to a conflict halfway around the globe 
while hawkes decision has been supported by the opposition it 
has been criticized by the arab community small political parties 
environmental and peace groups and even some members of his own 
labor party 
president bush called hawke on friday to ask for an australian 
contingent to participate in the attempt to stop iraqi shipping to 
punish baghdad for invading kuwait 
after the 20minute chat hawke reportedly consulted with 
several key ministers then without a formal cabinet meeting he 
announced he would send three ships citing the gravity of the 
situation 
the opposition liberal party backed the move but janet powell 
leader of the democratic party called hawkes decision 
illconsidered dangerous and undemocratic 
yet again we have taken military action in a kneejerk 
response to a request from the united states she said 
tough diplomacy and sanctions backed up by the un policing 
if needed is the only way out of this mess any military 
solution which would involve invading kuwait and probably iraq 
could well spark chemical and nuclear warfare 
the new left party in victoria state also backed a un 
settlement of the crisis 
el telegraph an arabiclanguage newspaper with a circulation of 
about 30000 said a survey it was conducting of australias arab 
community showed overwhelming condemnation of hawkes decision 
hawke on monday compared his critics to the politicians who 
tried to appease nazi germany 
the crimes of the appeasers were in a sense as great as the 
crimes of hitler and the nazis he told reporters while attending 
farewell ceremonies for the frigates 
we wouldnt have had the second world war if there hadnt been 
appeasers you cant stand idly by and allow those things to 
happen 
australias interests in the gulf are primarily exportrelated 
although about 127 australians have been unable to leave iraq and 
kuwait

as the faithful gather for the 13th 
anniversary of elvis presleys death the question this year is not 
whether the king is really gone but whether he was a victim of 
suicide accident or murder 
authors of a soontobepublished book say theyll give the 
first detailed report on his autopsy and show that presley a 
pillpopper of the first order miscalculated the combined effect 
of various uppers and downers and died of an overdose 
that notsurprising conclusion comes from charles thompson ii 
and james p cole authors of the death of elvis presley to be 
published in january by delacorte press 
the conclusion is inescapable that this was an accidental drug 
overdose said cole a former reporter and editor for two memphis 
newspapers 
thompson a 60 minutes producer said he and cole obtained 
from one of several doctors who worked on presleys autopsy the 
sealed autopsy records they had sought for 11 years the shelby 
county medical examiner said presley died of heart disease and the 
autopsy report was sealed at the familys request 
presley died aug 16 1977 at his memphis estate graceland now 
a tourist attraction drawing more than 600000 visitors a year 
graceland managers say up to 10000 elvis fans will take part this 
week in events tied to the anniversary of his death 
presleys abuse of prescription drugs has been discussed often 
in print and in court since 1977 but at the time of his death 
friends and family wanted to keep down such talk to make the 
hometown boy look as good as possible cole said 
now weve got the complete record and people will be able to 
see for themselves what the documentation is he said 
at the elvis anniversary two years ago the hot talk was about a 
new book titled is elvis alive a flurry of elvis sightings at 
fastfood restaurants and other sites around the country soon 
followed now there are new elvis reports 
albert goldman author of the 1981 biography elvis said in 
a recent article in life magazine that presley killed himself with 
an intentional overdose 
murray silver coauthor of a book on jerry lee lewis has been 
talking to publishers about an elvis book to be written with the 
singers former physician silvers book reportedly would say 
presley suffered a blow to the neck perhaps a karate chop shortly 
before his death 
todd morgan a spokesman for graceland said managers of the 
presley estate still believe the original conclusion heart disease 
were not going to go head to head with the people who write 
these books theres no benefit to it morgan said our getting 
into a big row with people like that just triples the publicity for 
their books 
and anyway he said the public is getting pretty tired of 
the stories

inches tall is fighting for her drivers license police say her 
girth makes her a driving hazard 
regina elizabeth guy was asked to explain at a meeting set for 
friday why the motor vehicle administration should not revoke her 
license 
the 25yearold nursing assistant hired a lawyer and said monday 
this is a fight against discrimination against fat people 
everywhere 
fat is not a fourletter word she said its a 
description thats all 
her troubles began in july when she was stopped while driving a 
friends car with expired registration tags last week she got a 
letter from the mva saying it was reexamining her driving 
privilege it asked her to attend the hearing 
the letter quoted the patrol officer who stopped her as saying 
her girth made it impossible for her to sit directly behind the 
steering wheel 
she had to operate her 1978 pontiac station wagon from the 
center of the front seat the officer wrote she was steering 
with her left hand and was using her left foot to control the 
pedals i feel that this driver should have special equipment on 
her car

a crime there is no issue of safety here they are treating a fat 
person differently

celebrities led by rock n roll singer don henley 
have halted a condominium project on woodlands next to walden pond 
where henry david thoreau contemplated nature in solitude more than 
a century ago 
henley former member of the eagles rock group announced monday 
that the celebrities walden woods project and the nonprofit trust 
for public land have made a 100000 down payment on the 25acre 
parcel valued at 355 million 
the land will remain unspoiled and a new site for the 139unit 
housing project will be provided in nearby concord 
the settlement with housing officials and developers included 
provisions to save another 25acre parcel from becoming an office 
and parking garage if a new site can be found 
i think the word balance describes what we hope to achieve in 
walden woods henley said 
he is cochairman of the walden woods project whose advisory 
board includes actors michael douglas and meryl streep and sen 
edward m kennedy dmass the trust for public land works to 
preserve land threatened by development 
henley joined by singers bonnie raitt and jimmy buffett 
performed two concerts in april that raised 250000 to preserve 
the woods 
its easy to say no to a project said clark l ziegler a 
spokesman for the state office of communities and development 
but people who were opposed to it have taken on the 
responsibility of finding an alternative solution thats unusual 
walden pond is a 62acre body of water on a state reservation 
bordering concord an affluent town of 12500 about 20 miles 
northwest of boston 
thoreau was a naturalist writer who lived in isolation by the 
pond during the mid1800s he produced essays and other writings 
from his solitude 
the pond is far less pastoral than when he lived there in a 
shack it lies less than 100 yards from a highway and is adjacent 
to a dump 
other celebrities who helped to save the woods include actors 
don johnson ed begley jr and dana delany also lending support 
were author el doctorow and singers arlo guthrie aimee mann 
john hall and the band boston

montreal 
the victory in mondays election makes gilles duceppe the first 
parliamentarian elected under the banner of the bloc quebecois a 
group of independent lawmakers committed to quebec sovereignty 
duceppe 43 immediately declared that his victory was a message 
to english canada that quebec is heading quickly toward a break 
with the rest of the country 
quebec has understood that english canada will never say yes 
to quebec demands the labor negotiator told cheering supporters 
at a victory party 
he was propelled to victory by a surge in separatist sentiment 
in quebec after the death of the meech lake accord in june the 
proposed consitutional amendement rejected by manitoba and new 
brunswick provinces would have given provinces special powers and 
recognized quebec as a distinct society within canada 
gilles picked up about twothirds of all votes cast in the 
sububan laurierstemarie district trouncing his nearest rival 
liberal denis coderre new democrat candidate louise oneill was a 
poor third and conservative christian fortin finished fourth

east german workers drove tractors combines 
and lumber trucks into west berlin today demanding help from east 
and west german governments for their struggling farms and forest 
industry 
farmers and lumber workers have been among the hardest hit by 
the massive changes sweeping east germany theyre seeking higher 
wages and job security 
imported products from the west have cut demand for east german 
items inefficiency is another bone of contention 
we have such old machines some of them made before the war 
said 20yearold alexander witt during the protest at the historic 
reichstag building 
were supposed to compete in a capitalist system but its 
hard with such old machines that often break down and need repairs 
and maintenance he continued 
reflecting on the complexities that still pervade the east 
german economy witt said he was not a farmer but rather an 
expert for plant production his job preparing the soil 
sowing and harvesting 
witt from schoenefeld outside berlin was one of about 70 
workers who had gathered by late morning in front of the reichstag 
the massive building to become the parliament of a united germany 
the protesters drove there in more than 35 farm and forestry 
vehicles with dozens more expected by the afternoon 
all wore rough work clothes often flecked with dirt 
some took the opportunity to sell their products which have 
been unable to compete with western goods flooding east germany 
if we dont sell we cant keep working shouted a burly 
farm worker as he sold potatoes and peppers 
the banner on the side of his truck read we cant go on like 
this 
east germanys agricultural sector driven by four decades by 
communist governments before the inauguration of a noncommunist 
freemarket administration this year is collapsing under the 
weight of competition about half of the farms are technically 
bankrupt economists say 
that means hard times for the 800000 farmers who till the 
countrys sovietstyle collectives they face an uncertain feature 
when the two germanys merge later this year 
most of the workers taking part in todays protest said they 
earned about 500 to 550 a month in base pay adding they needed 
overtime to survive 
forest workers are having similarly difficult times 
the sawmills wont take our wood any more said lumber truck 
driver edwin braun they take wood from bavaria and the soviet 
union but not ours 
and our wood is still cheaper it just doesnt make any 
sense said braun from the town of neustrelitz about 60 miles 
north of berlin 
banners on the huge vehicles demanded support from the west 
german and east german governments 
one predicted a hot autumn if east germanys agricultural 
business continues its dangerous plunge

for one american soldier deployment in 
saudi arabia is a honeymoon of sorts 
the specialist based at fort bragg nc was scheduled to be 
married on aug 11 but was called for duty in saudi arabia a few 
days before then 
my wife then my fiancee and i got to thinking that i might 
not come back so we decided to go ahead and do it said the 
specialist among a contingent from the 82nd airborne set up at a 
saudi air defense camp 
the saudi desert has the specialist from monroeville ala 
thinking about changing his honeymoon plans 
we were supposed to go to florida but now maybe well go 
someplace better he said with this heat maybe well go to 
alaska 
ground rules for the pentagon pool operation prohibit disclosure 
of the exact location and publication of the names of american 
troops deployed here to defend saudi arabia from a possible iraqi 
attack 
the 82nd airborne troops visited tuesday are living in tents on 
the saudi complex surrounded by m551sheridan airborne assault 
vehicles a light tank antitank vehicles equipped with tow 
missiles and other weapons 
when they arrived their worries were potential battles with 
iraqi troops and possible use of chemical weapons against them 
now with iraqi forces taking up defensive positions and the 
burgeoning american force digging in as well the troops here are 
more worried about family back home and beating the intense desert 
heat 
temperatures were approaching 100 degrees when the pool visited 
the troops at 10 am local time tuesday and were expected to reach 
115 degrees or higher by afternoon the reddish sand of the desert 
can be seen for miles shade is almost impossible to find 
the most popular spot here is the maintenance garage which 
offers a respite from the sun and by saudi standards a cooling 
breeze 
all of the american forces here are told to drink at least six 
gallons of water a day to avoid dehydration in the searing heat 
these rapiddeployment forces were called into action so quickly 
that many said they did not get to say goodbye to family and 
friends 
the last time i saw my wife was 5 am the day i left said 
one staff sergeant she wasnt home when i got the call to go so 
i got a quick note off before i left and wrote her from spain on 
the way over 
one of the few complaints from the soldiers is that they think 
the us government should provide them with a free mail system 
i didnt have time to get any money said the staff 
sergeant based at fort bragg and originally from new york 
all of a dozen soldiers interviewed asked that reporters let 
family and friends back home know they were safe 
i hope the american people realize the need for us to be 
here one lieutenant said as leaders of the free world we 
cannot allow this type of aggression to take place no one really 
likes being here but weve got a job to do and were eager to do 
it 
a lieutenant interviewed atop a sheridan tank said morale has 
been outstanding and that troops are beginning to adjust to the 
heat 
were settling in now he said we came in expecting 
anything from going into a peacetime mission to total war in 
panama we went in knowing it was a combat situation right off the 
bat 
the troops left the states so quickly they could not bring any 
gear for recreation activities so now they mostly sit and wait 
those assigned to day shifts say sleeping at night when 
temperatures drop into the 80s isnt so bad there are rows of 
tents for those who need to sleep during the day but they provide 
little escape from the dry heat 
wed rather sit and wait than go and fight but its 
frustrating said the lieutenant 
the staff sergeant had a different perspective 
if i have to come this far and go through all this trouble id 
rather get out there and fight take care of business he said 
saudi forces brought the american troops sandwiches and fries 
from a hardees fastfood restaurant and also have brought 
breakfasts of bread fruit and cheeses but several said they would 
prefer to eat their armyissued mres meals ready to eat 
no offense because the saudis have been great hosts but 
things just taste a little different said one sergeant 
all of the troops have chemical warfare suits with them and gas 
masks strapped to their hips 
you hear little rumors about it the possibility of chemical 
attacks from time to time but you just press on another 
sergeant from fort bragg said as he stood next to a huge satellite 
communications disk weve got a lot of duties to take care of 
here so you cant worry too much 
said a sergeant from mt airy nc you cant worry about the 
gas or chemicals you take in the equipment and if you need to use 
it you do were trained and ready 
gen ed scholes commander of the forward command forces here 
said our troops are prepared for that and ready for it if it 
comes youre always concerned about that prospect but our 
troops here are trained in that and they have the equipment 
scholes described the mission as deterrence assisting and 
training the saudis and if necessary assisting them in the defense 
of the kingdom of saudi arabia 
part of the 82nds current work he said was securing an area 
for the arrival of marines and equipment 
scholes and the troops reported few equipment problems 
associated with the heat 
there are obvious problems in operating in this environment 
but weve had nothing unusual the general said 
some radio failures have been blamed on the heat 
army officials said last week that units with tanks and other 
vehicles would need additional air filters and higher viscosity oil 
to keep running in the desert environment as much a problem as the 
heat is the talcumlike sand of the desert

a tentative settlement has been reached in a 
strike at a general motors corp parts plant but the walkout 
highlighted the giant automakers vulnerability to local labor 
problems 
the 2800 united auto workers union members at the ac rochester 
west parts plant in flint walked off their jobs wednesday in what 
was billed as a local dispute over health and safety and other 
matters 
by monday parts shortages created by the strike forced the 
shutdown of four assembly plants and partial closings of four 
component factories idling about 11500 employees 
a tentative agreement was reached monday afternoon and union 
members were to vote on it this afternoon spokesman john maciarz 
said gm hoped the strikers would return to work by wednesday making 
fuel tanks and grilles for a variety of gm cars and trucks 
but it will take longer for assembly plant workers to get back 
to their jobs since the parts pipelines to those plants have been 
dried up maciarz said 
the rippling effect of the parts plant strike is a symptom of a 
justintime delivery system embraced by automakers it calls 
for parts to be delivered to assembly plants sometimes just hours 
before they are needed on assembly lines 
the strike came as the uaw was negotiating threeyear contracts 
with gm ford motor co and chrysler corp covering more than 
450000 workers current uaw agreements with the big three expire 
sept 14 
labor experts said monday that the strike may indicate that uaw 
leaders want gm to be the company the union chooses to bargain with 
first to set the pattern for contracts at the other automakers 
dale brickner of michigan state universitys school of labor and 
industrial relations said it was significant that the international 
union didnt press the local at the parts plant not to strike in 
order to avoid friction at the national negotiations 
the important point is the fact that the international hasnt 
clamped down saying no you cant do this because of 
negotiations going on brickner said 
by monday afternoon gm shut down truck assembly plants in 
moraine ohio shreveport la and pontiac and a car plant in 
flint other car plants near pontiac and in wentzville mo 
outside st louis were in danger of closure 
about 1000 other workers were laid off when production was cut 
at component plants in flint kokomo ind and warren ohio

a second iraqi ship was blocked from loading supplies at a 
persian gulf port today as a usled economic quarantine on iraq 
intensified 
jordan however was reported keeping open a small iraqi oil 
pipeline 
meanwhile a mine alert was posted for a central persian gulf 
channel where an iraqi ship was seen monday shipping sources said 
president bush cuts into his maine vacation today to return to 
washington for talks on the gulf crisis and the budget deficit he 
will receive a pentagon briefing on the military confrontation with 
iraqs president saddam hussein 
authorities in the united arab emirates stopped the iraqi 
freighter alabid from entering the port of dubai today shipping 
sources said 
radio monitors in the persian gulf overheard the alabid calling 
out every 10 minutes for permission to enter the harbor and load 
supplies for transport to iraq 
diplomatic sources in the united arab emirates said the 
countrys ports have quietly stopped allowing iraqi tankers or 
freighters entry although the government has made no official 
statements to that effect 
another iraqi freighter albaya has been waiting off dubai for 
the last two days the shipping sources said they spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
in other developments a japanese foreign ministry official said 
bush asked japans prime minister toshiko kaifu for more japanese 
financial aid to middle east nations affected by the crisis 
us combat troops arriving in saudi arabia have been told to 
prepare for a long stay 
us navy ships maneuvered to block trade with iraq bush said 
the navy would halt iraqi tankers to stop the oil from coming 
out britain and australia also said they would help interdict 
iraqi ships 
the washington post today quoted unidentified un sources as 
saying that at an informal closeddoor meeting of the security 
council on monday the soviet union france canada and malaysia 
sharply criticized the us decision to proceed unilaterally 
with the naval quarantine of iraq and kuwait 
a world embargo was placed on iraq after it invaded kuwait on 
aug 2 and announced it was annexing its small oilrich neighbor 
iraq massed troops near saudi arabia sending alarm bells off 
throughout the middle east the saudis have the worlds largest oil 
reserves 
shipping executives said they were told by us navy officials 
that an iraqi vessel was spotted dropping mines in the shah olam 
shoals 80 miles northeast of the qatar peninsula the channel is 
used by tankers heading for saudi arabian oil terminals 
but another official said us forces might have spotted mines 
left over from the iraniraq war iran mined the waterway during 
the conflict which ended in 1988 
on sunday the iraqi oil tanker alqaddisiyah was kept from 
docking at the saudi terminal at yanbu on the red sea after tugs 
failed to show up saudi diplomatic sources said on condition of 
anonymity 
that in effect meant that iraqs last major oil export outlet 
a pipeline across the arabian peninsula was cut off turkey 
earlier closed two pipelines carrying iraqi oil 
however a small iraqi oil pipeline and road transport between 
jordan and iraq were reported operating normally monday 
jordans information minister ibrahim izzeddine said jordan 
intends to abide by the mandatory un security resolution imposing 
sanctions on iraq but it is still premature now to decide what 
sanctions will be imposed 
jordans foreign ministry undersecretary mutasem belbeisi said 
today amman intends to discuss the economic embargo against iraq 
with the united nations 
about 40 percent of jordanian exports go to neighboring iraq 
official sources at jordans ministry of commerce said the 
pipeline continued to operate as usual monday ap photographer 
yousef allan at jordans border post of ruweishid 210 miles 
northeast of amman said a truck or tanker crossed into jordan 
every three or four minutes 
the pipeline terminates at a desert outpost known as h4 where 
tanker trucks load the petroleum and drive it to the red sea port 
of aqaba for export with much of the oil kept for jordanian 
domestic use 
visiting rep stephen j solarz dny said monday in amman 
jordans capital that there was little chance of forcing saddam to 
pull his forces from kuwait without jordanian sanctions 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the naval 
barricade had forced two or three ships to turn back at sea and 
that the embargo is being maintained on shipping into and out 
of iraq he said the main target of the embargo is to squeeze the 
iraqis so they cannot maintain their war machine 
baghdad is heavily dependent on oil exports to buy food and 
other supplies for its 17 million people saddam has asked iraqis 
to cut meat consumption by half and not to hoard food warning that 
black marketeers will be executed 
the new york times in todays editions reported iraq transferred 
3 billion to 4 billion in confiscated gold bullion currency and 
goods from kuwaiti institutions to baghdad the paper quoted arab 
bankers in london and the gulf on monday pakistan voted to send 
troops to help defend saudi arabia joining ground forces from the 
united states egypt morocco and syria 
warplanes and navy ships from several nations have gathered in 
the region since the invasion 
todays washington post also quoted an unidentified bush 
administration official as saying egyptian authorities could send 
about 30000 more troops to supplement the 3000 men dispatched to 
saudi arabia over the weekend 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said cheney will fly to saudi 
arabia on friday to visit us troops and meet with the kingdoms 
leaders it will be cheneys second trip to the gulf since kuwait 
was invaded 
maj gen don l kaufman chief of the us military training 
mission to saudi arabia said monday that planes bearing us 
troops and equipment were landing every 10 minutes or so at a base 
in the desert 
i think our position grows stronger with each day that goes 
by he said 
saddam has called for a holy war against the saudi royalty 
and western military forces now assembled in the region 
today iraq remained defiant despite the naval buildup 
the state newspaper aljumhuriya said iraq knows how to answer 
the bush administration how to foil its measures penetrate its 
blockade makes its troops taste death if they attack us and move 
the battlefield to where it the united states does not want or 
expect it to be 
the paper was quoted by the iraq news agency monitored in 
nicosia cyprus 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler estimated that 
about 2500 americans still are in iraqiheld kuwait plus the 500

a surrogate mother carrying a couples 
testtube baby is suing for custody of the child in a case that 
could redefine parenthood 
theres nothing negotiable about it this is my baby 
declared anna johnson a 29yearold who filed suit in state court 
monday for custody of the child on grounds that the biological 
parents would not provide a good home 
mark and crispina calvert gave the sperm and egg to create the 
embryo that was transferred from a lab dish to johnsons womb under 
a 10000 agreement with the woman a single parent of a 
3yearold the baby is due in two months 
johnsons effort to pursue custody of a baby that has no 
biological relation to her is unprecedented said the calverts 
attorney christian van deusen 
the case differs from the landmark baby m custody case in new 
jersey in that case the child was conceived with a surrogate 
mothers egg and the sperm of a man hiring her the mans wife had 
no biological ties to the child 
van deusen and an attorney for ms johnson richard c gilbert 
said the johnson case will focus on what constitutes parenthood 
although california law presumes the birth mother is the legal 
parent a judge has leeway gilbert said 
johnson appearing today on abcs good morning america 
maintained she had biological and maternal bonds with the fetus 
she said that the baby while its growing inside me has my 
cells and my blood nurturing this child maintaining its life 
the calverts lawyer conceded johnson was nurturing the unborn 
child but i dont believe it puts her in a position of holding 
this child hostage van deusen said this morning 
johnson who is on disability because of pregnancy 
complications also seeks child support and damages for emotional 
distress 
she said she decided to seek custody because she believes the 
calverts showed disregard for her complications and gave the 
impression they might not want the baby 
the calverts denied johnsons allegations that they ignored her 
medical needs failed to make timely payments or lost interest in 
the pregnancy 
johnson and mrs calvert worked as nurses at the same santa ana 
hospital 
i was surprised that she did this to us a tearful mrs 
calvert said we thought that we had a good relationship after 
all ive done for her 
mrs calvert who is unable to carry a child because of a 
hysterectomy said i just cry i dont know what to do were 
really looking forward to this baby 
johnson also denied that she was seeking custody for monetary 
gain or because she craved publicity as the couple suggested she 
said she had seen the surrogate contract as a way to put herself 
through graduate nursing school 
the problem is not money the problem is fetal neglect and 
they will have to address that in court said gilbert

about 19000 muscovites quit the communist party 
in july following a watershed party congress politburo member yuri 
prokofiev said today 
the 19000 were in addition to the 27000 people who quit during 
the first six months of this year he said 
prokofiev the moscow communist party chief said half the 
people turning in their membership cards were workers and the rest 
were either intellectuals or pensioners 
he told the official tass news agency that 7000 people have 
joined the moscow wing of the party so far this year nearly half 
of them under 35 years old 
prokofiev said the majority of those leaving had joined the 
party to promote their careers but since taking office in 1985 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has moved to separate the 
government from party jobs and business the communist party has 
during that time lost much prestige and been stripped of its 
constitutionally guaranteed leading role in society 
prokofiev said communists now must find a new role for the party 
in dealing with social and economic problems he said they must 
find common ground with orthodox communists as well as democratic 
platform the reform group which had been working within the party 
but now plans to form a separate party 
the partys national personnel chief said earlier this month 
that 370000 people had followed russian federation president boris 
yeltsin and other prominent reformers in quitting the party so far 
this year 
yeltsin announced his resignation during the 28th communist 
party congress which ended in moscow on juy 13 
boris pugo chairman of the partys central control committee 
said another 125000 members were expelled 120000 died and 
150000 stopped paying their membership dues or participating in 
party activities

former nicaraguan president daniel ortega paid 
his first visit to the united states since his election defeat last 
february and admitted he made many mistakes while in power 
id say the expectations that we created that we could solve 
all our countrys problems was one of my biggest mistakes he 
said but we didnt have the resources to respond to all those 
problems 
about 2500 people gathered for ortegas speech monday at 
riverside church an interdenominational landmark church known for 
its support of liberal causes 
the crowd was at times exuberant often interrupting ortega with 
applause and shouts of viva nica 
ortega who spoke in spanish and had a translator at his side 
said the fact that democratic elections were held was more 
important than his loss to violeta barrios de chamorro and her 
prous united national opposition alliance feb 25 
she took office april 25 but her term has been beset by 
disputes within her alliance high inflation resulting from a 
lifting of price controls and sandinistaled strikes 
in his 90minute speech ortega repeatedly called for stability 
in his homeland something he said the sandinistas have been 
fighting for since 1979 when they came into power after 
overthrowing the 45year dictatorship of the somoza family 
this is the revolutionary project that didnt disappear with 
the elections he said 
ortega also criticized us foreign policy and urged autonomy 
for puerto rico 
in a questionandanswer period ortega said the united 
states must stop occupying puerto rico and stop occupying 
guantanamo bay a us military base on cuba 
ortega dressed in a dark pinstripe suit did not mention his 
political plans 
david wilson 23 a new yorker who is a member of the nicaragua 
solidarity network said the turnout for ortegas visit showed that 
support still existed for the former leader and his party 
i think its more important to support a party out of power 
with less access to all kinds of channels within the media and 
international forums than it is to support a party in power he 
said 
ortega arrived in new york on monday

an environmental group said it would not 
oppose plans to conduct the first field test of a genetically 
engineered vaccine on wildlife in the united states 
the virginia department of health announced monday that a 10day 
test of a rabies vaccine will begin aug 20 it will be tested on 
parramore island an uninhabited barrier island about 4 miles off 
the coast of virginia 
the national wildlife federation which had initially fought 
plans to conduct tests because of safety concerns will not object 
to the field test according to margaret mellon a molecular 
biologist and lawyer for the group 
the tests will be done by the wistar institute of philadelphia 
which began work on the vaccine in 1982 wistar is a nonprofit 
independent biomedical research center 
ms mellon said the group was appalled by the way us 
department of agriculture officials were so quick to support 
wistars plans but said refinements in the plans made the 
federation more comfortable with the project 
the usda the state of virginia and the nature conservancy a 
nonprofit organization that owns the sevenmile long island 
approved the field test the conservancy consented to the project 
monday after coming to an agreement with wistar over several 
concerns including legal responsibility 
we realized that this island was really one of the few if not 
only places the test could be done said a conservancy 
spokeswoman holley darden 
the vaccine was developed to combat the problem of rabid 
raccoons which have reached epidemic levels in the midatlantic 
states in recent years said dr warren cheston wistars associate 
director 
so far this year 127 rabies cases have been reported in 
virginia while pennsylvania has documented 376 cases according to 
state health authorities 
during the field test scientists will scatter bait laden with 
the vaccine over the island researchers will then spend the next 
year tracking the animals and testing their blood to see if they 
have developed antibodies to the rabies virus 
ms darden said the islands raccoon population which numbers 
about 400 has not been previously exposed to rabies she said the 
wistar institute would follow guidelines to prevent island animals 
from escaping to the mainland 
the island will be offlimits to the public and monitored by the 
virginia department of game and inland fisheries 
the vaccine could be commercially available in as few as five 
years if the trial goes well and further tests are also successful 
according to dr david espeseth of the usda 
scientists developed the vaccine by inserting a gene from the 
rabies virus into the live vaccinia virus an organism used to 
develop vaccines against smallpox and other diseases the vaccine 
cannot spread the disease because it does not use the parts of the 
virus that cause rabies according to cheston 
more than 40 species of laboratory animals injected with the 
altered virus have shown immunity to rabies he said

the voice of america is cautioning americans 
trapped in kuwait not to try to flee across the border into saudi 
arabia the state department said today 
about 500 americans already have been able to sneak into saudi 
arabia penetrating lax iraqi security but a caravan of others who 
tried to flee were forced to beat a sweltering retreat 
the clandestine departures reduce the number of civilian 
americans in kuwait to 2500 according to state department 
figures also stranded are 500 to 600 americans in iraq 
the voice of america a radio service operated by the us 
government is urging the americans still in kuwait not to try to 
cross the border due to the danger involved but advising them 
to get ready to leave on short notice 
when the orderly evacuation of americans wishing to leave 
kuwait becomes possible american citizens will be contacted by 
phone or by radio and information will be broadcast by the voice of 
america and the bbc voa broadcasts said 
the iraqi ambassador to the united states mohamed almashat 
said today that the americans will be freed in due time 
we have already let many people go almashat said on nbcs 
today it takes time and under current circumstances in due 
time they are going to be let free 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii was scheduled 
to meet today with officials of the deposed kuwaiti regime to 
discuss the persian gulf crisis 
assistant secretary of state john kelly had highlevel contacts 
on monday with syrian authorities the gulf crisis has brought 
syria closer to the united states because of syrias longstanding 
rivalry with iraq 
as the iraqi conquest of kuwait entered its 13th day today the 
fate of the americans continued to be a matter of utmost concern to 
the bush administration 
us diplomats have been in constant contact with iraqi 
authorities about the issue but the iraqis have given no 
indication that the americans will be allowed to leave exempted 
from this policy are americans attached to the us embassy in 
baghdad 10 of whom left for home on saturday more are scheduled 
to leave later this week 
the stranded americans have been caught up in the war of nerves 
between the united states and iraq although they still are not 
being called hostages us officials suspect that iraqi president 
saddam hussein may try to use the americans as blackmail if his 
confrontation with the united states worsens 
us officials said the americans who managed to flee kuwait 
took advantage of lax iraqi security at the final checkpoint on 
kuwaiti territory and entered the relative safety of saudi arabia 
but a briton david thomas croskery who apparently tried to 
flee by the same route was shot to death on saturday by iraqi 
troops in kuwait state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the administration was shocked and extremely concerned by 
the incident 
she said there were rumors sunday that all foreigners were being 
allowed to leave but the administration was told that only 
africans south asians and latins are being given such permission 
iraqi broadcasts indicate that arabs and east asians also have been 
allowed to depart 
false news reports about the opening of the kuwaitsaudi border 
to all foreigners prompted 40 to 50 carloads of americans to head 
for the frontier ms tutwiler said they were turned back at the 
border their disappointment aggravated by blistering heat she 
said 
the attempted exodus may have been the result of an iraqi 
broadcast on sunday saying the authorities have been instructed to 
facilitate the travel of the arabs and foreign residents in 
kuwait and other cities of southern iraq southern iraq is the 
term iraqis have used to describe what was once kuwait

several security council members have 
criticized the united states for moving too fast too forcefully 
and without council approval to cut off iraqi shipping 
the criticism of the united states was delivered monday in 
closed council consultations on the persian gulf crisis un and 
western diplomats said 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar did not criticize the 
us quarantine but said monday that only the security council 
could legally enforce an embargo 
i have nothing to say against it the us quarantine and 
military presence provided there is consent from other parties 
perez de cuellar told reporters 
he said all states were free to act under the un charter 
which supports the inherent right of individual or collective 
selfdefense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the 
united nations 
but he added that only the united nations through its 
security council resolutions can really decide about a blockade 
iraqi ambassador amir alanbari later told the secretarygeneral 
that his government has no intention of invading saudi arabia that 
the us military buildup is unjustified and that the united states 
and its allies are creating pretexts for aggression against iraq 
us and un officials said there was no contradiction between 
the un embargo resolution and the us cut off of iraqi shipping 
both bar import to iraq of all grain and foodstuffs except in 
cases of dire need and humanitarian concern 
in the 15member council monday cuba and other nations 
criticized the us decision to use force to police the trade 
embargo against iraq the embargo was ordered by the security 
council after iraq invaded kuwait 
cuba said the united states should not consider itself the world 
policeman and should have waited for the security council to decide 
that further action was necessary 
the washington post said today that france canada the soviet 
union and malaysia strongly criticized the us position in the 
council meeting 
cuban ambassador ricardo alarcon told reporters later that 
the united states does not have the right to interpret security 
council resolutions and act without council permission it is 
undermining the role of the council 
he said he did not remember any country who supported the us 
stand in the council monday 
the united states cannot arrogate to itself the policemans 
role which has not been first decided by the council he said 
a security council committee is to meet friday and evaluate 
compliance with the embargo based on reports from many of the 159 
member states it then will make recommendations on the enforcement 
of the embargo 
under the un charter article 42 of chapter 7 the security 
council can call for an international military blockade to enforce 
its resolutions 
the united states has said that kuwait requested the us action 
to enforce the quarantine against iraq

led by impeached gov evan mecham opponents of a 
paid state holiday commemorating assassinated civil rights leader 
martin luther king jr filed petitions to let the voters decide the 
issue 
if 43350 signatures submitted monday are validated by spot 
checks the holidays fate will be determined during the november 
general election 
mecham and his supporters say an unpaid king holiday already 
exists they say the real issue is whether voters want to give 
state employees another paid day off not whether they want to 
honor the slain civil rights activist 
mecham one of five republicans running for governor this year 
led a group that filed 71000 signatures 
former gov bruce babbitt speaking for a coalition of business 
and civic leaders said the holiday is needed to honor the 
remarkable progress america has made in race relations 
the cost of the holiday has been estimated at 500000 to 4 
million a year but some civic leaders say theyd rather pay for 
the holiday than suffer bad publicity over arizonas lack of a paid 
holiday 
mechams successor democratic gov rose mofford urged voters 
to approve the paid holiday 
the holiday has been a sore point in arizona since 1986 when 
babbitt bypassed the legislature and issued an executive 
proclamation establishing a paid king holiday for executivebranch 
employees 
republican attorney general bob corbin issued an opinion saying 
babbitts action was illegal mecham who took office in 1987 
rescinded the paid holiday before it could take effect 
he later established an unpaid martin luther kingcivil rights 
day on the third sunday in january that proclamation has never 
been repealed but supporters of the paid king day called it a 
secondclass honor and refused to recognize it 
the legislature decided last year to swap state workers paid 
columbus day holiday for a king day an action that already has 
been made subject to approval on this novembers ballot the mecham 
drive would put a second referendum on the ballot to approve or 
reject a 1990 law that restored columbus day in addition to king 
day 
if voters approved both laws the one with the most affirmative 
votes would prevail if they rejected both the state would revert 
to a paid day for columbus and no paid day for king

a federal judge has barred the government from 
enforcing a law sponsored by sen jesse helms to keep children from 
using dialaporn services 
the federal communications commission regulation said telephone 
companies could not bill for calls containing indecent speech 
unless a customer certified in writing that he or she was 18 or 
older and wanted the services 
us district judge robert p patterson ruled monday that the 
law would probably infringe on the rights of free speech and due 
process the ruling applies only to new york but may influence 
judges in other jurisdictions 
the regulations were to have gone into effect wednesday 
the ruling came in a lawsuit by five companies that operate 
telephone services in the new york area with sexually explicit 
content they sued to void the socalled helms amendment named 
after the north carolina republican 
joel r dichter an attorney for the plaintiffs said the 1986 
amendment would put these companies out of business 
he said that the requirement for a written request would have a 
chilling effect on the first amendment because most people 
would want to keep their anonymity when using the phonesex 
services 
in issuing the injunction the judge said the amendment probably 
violated the first amendment because it did not employ the least 
restrictive means to accomplish its goal preventing children from 
calling phonesex services 
the companies had argued voluntary blocking systems used by 
several states such as new york were effective and less restrictive 
than the fcc regulations 
in new york a household can have its access to sexually 
explicit telephone services blocked free of charge by contacting 
the telephone company most of the phonesex numbers have a 900 
area code and 976 or 970 prefixes locally 
assistant us attorney nancy kilson who represents the 
government said a decision had not been made on whether to appeal

a georgia okeeffe painting has been formally 
declared lost by the art institute of chicago 20 years after a 
search for the misplaced painting began 
officials of the prestigious museum had continued to hope over 
two decades that the work east river from the shelton would 
turn up art institute director james woods said tuesday 
but after a recent inventory of 1500 pieces in the museums 
department of 20th century paintings and sculpture wood said 
officials acknowledged the painting was nowhere to be found 
frankly the reclassification of the painting as lost from the 
museum is long overdue woods said the painting has been 
missing for 20 years we are acknowledging that unfortunate fact 
now 
museum officials stopped short of saying the work valued at 
between 250000 and 500000 was stolen but they have notified 
the fbi interpol and other officials that it is missing 
one has heard of objects being lost in museums or even going 
out with the trash wood said so it still might be found here 
or in the hands of an innocent person 
the 1926 painting on a 12by32inch canvas depicts the view 
from a manhattan hotel in which okeeffe and her husband 
photographer alfred stieglitz lived 
stieglitzs estate loaned the work to the art institute in 1949 
and it entered the museums permanent collection as a gift from the 
artist in 1955 
okeeffe acknowledged to be on of the foremost 20th century 
american artists died in 1986 she is best known for her paintings 
of largescale flowers and semiabstract paintings reflecting the 
influence of years she spent in the american southwest

stopped an iraqi freighter from entering the port of dubai today 
and shipping sources said a mine alert for a central persian gulf 
channel was canceled 
radio monitors in the gulf overheard the iraqi freighter alabid 
calling out every 10 minutes to authorities in the bustling 
southern port of dubai for permission to enter the harbor 
the vessel was anchored three miles northwest of the dubai 
breakwater they said 
but the port control officials were overheard replying weve 
no instructions weve no instructions to give the ship 
permission to enter 
the shipping sources said alabid also repeatedly requested 
contact with its agent to help bring provisions for the crew but 
there was no indication the port authority would cooperate 
diplomatic sources in the united arab emirates said the 
countrys ports have quietly stopped allowing iraqi tankers or 
freighters entry the government however has made no official 
statements to this effect 
another iraqi freighter albaya has been waiting off dubai for 
the last two days to enter dubai the shipping sources said on 
condition of anonymity 
on the other side of the arabian peninsula the iraqi tanker 
alqadissiyah was still anchored off the red sea terminal of yanbu 
today it was turned away by saudi authorities sunday when it tried 
to load oil from the transsaudi iraqi pipeline 
meanwhile a us military source said that a mine alert in the 
central gulf has been canceled

that an iraqi vessel was spotted dropping mines in the shah allum 
shoals 80 miles northeast of the qatar peninsula the channel is 
used by tankers heading for saudi arabian oil terminals

merchant ship saturday near shah allum but on closer investigation 
found it was not laying mines

mine in april 1988 the frigate escorting a usreflagged kuwaiti 
tanker struck iraniansowed mines and 10 american sailors were 
injured in a massive explosion 
kuwait was then the primary target of iranian attacks on 
shipping in the vital waterway because it was assisting the iraqi 
war effort against iran

against iraq to force that country to withdraw from kuwait appeared 
to widen today

warship york questioning a cypriotflagged tanker named glory that 
is known be shuttling oil from iraqi ports 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and subsequently annexed the 
country the un sanctions placed an embargo on oil from iraq and 
kuwait and blocked imports from iraq 
but iraq remained defiant today 
the state newspaper aljumhuriya said iraq knows how to answer 
the bush administration how to foil its measures penetrate its 
blockade makes its troops taste death if they attack us and move 
the battlefield to where it the united states does not want or 
expect it to be

operators of a wilderness program for 
rebellious teenagers have been charged with negligence in the 
death of a florida girl and criminal mistreatment of other 
youngsters 
challenger foundation founder stephen cartisano and field 
director lance jagger were charged with negligent homicide a 
misdemeanor in the june 27 death of 16yearold kristen chase of 
ponte vedra beach fla 
the complaint signed monday before 6th circuit judge david l 
mower also charged cartisano and challenger with five counts of 
child abuse 
mower set arraignment for sept 13 
chase collapsed while hiking atop the kaiparowits plateau in 
southern utah with three other youngsters an autopsy concluded 
that she died of exertional heat stroke likely complicated by 
altitude and near tripledigit temperatures 
she had been in the program just three days placed there by her 
mother and stepfather 
cartisano denied any negligence in the death and said the girl 
suffered from other ailments medical examiner dr todd grey said 
the girls prior ailments did not contribute to the death 
cartisano said the girl had not yet entered the impact 
portion of the 63day program which according to brochures strips 
rebellious teenagers of their belligerence through five days and 
nights of physical and mental stress with forced march night hikes 
and limited food and water 
however two counselors who were with the girl said they were on 
a forced hike and that she had collapsed from heat exhaustion 
several times the day before she died 
the tragedy is that when we were going strong we put over 2 
million a year into kane and garfield counties cartisano said 
monday night now if they are successful not only will they 
lose that it is going to cost them hundreds of thousands of 
dollars to fight this because we are going to fight this like 
nothing before 
cartisano repeatedly has claimed kane county sheriff maxwell 
jacksons investigation was politically motivated 
the challenger program began two years ago and initially refused 
to comply with state regulations governing residential youth 
treatment programs the operators claimed they were not providing 
treatment new laws were enacted during the 1990 legislature and 
went into effect four days after chases death 
last week challenger filed for protection under chapter 11 of 
the us bankruptcy code with cartisano citing legal fees and bad 
publicity challenger listed 63040 in assets and more than 11 
million in debts including some 200000 in back taxes

young arabs may by lining up to do battle for 
or against iraqs saddam hussein but americas youth so far have 
not responded to the call to arms military recruiters said today 
no more than usual said an army recruiting officer in 
durham north carolina when asked if the middle east crisis had 
inspired more enlistments about the same said a recruiter in 
atlanta 
theres been no unusual fluctuation in enlistment said mary 
auer of the recruiting battalion in the cincinnati area she said a 
very few people who had been in the military before had 
inquired about returning but there had been no surge in new 
recruits 
major doug hart public affairs officer at the pentagon said 
enlistment figures are compiled on a quarterly basis and it was too 
early to tell whether the threat of war in the middle east will 
increase the number of volunteers 
but if panama and grenada are guidelines there will be no 
significant difference in enlistments hart said referring to 
us military actions in those areas 
he also cautioned that increased interest in military service 
would not necessarily mean more enlistments we are still in a 
drawdown period mandated by congress to make the army smaller 
hart said 
the armed services recruited 128300 people in the first half of 
fiscal year 1990 beginning on oct 1 1989 he said in fiscal 
1989 the figure was 293900 
recruiters said volunteers might increase if fighting breaks out 
between the united states and iraq 
its kind of quiet here now said a navy recruiting officer 
in washington dc who declined to give his name maybe if the 
crisis goes further we might get some more patriotic responses but 
right now its business as usual

the us agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said tuesday that us efforts to force open thailands 
market to foreign cigarettes have nothing whatsoever to do with 
health 
yeutter said thailand discriminates because it allows its 
national tobacco monopoly to sell cigarettes but it forbids 
imports 
he was responding to questions after speaking to the federation 
of thai industries yeutter will end a fourday visit to thailand 
on wednesday 
antismoking groups in the united states and thailand have 
accused the united states and its tobacco industry of trying to 
export cancer they say the sale of us brands will lead to 
aggressive advertising and an increase in smoking especially among 
children and women 
however foreign brands are readily available on the thai black 
market which is rarely policed 
the united states this year asked the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade a global trade organization to judge the 
dispute 
as the former us trade representative yeutter opened 
japanese south korean and taiwanese markets to foreign cigarettes 
whether the country be thailand or korea or japan or any 
other including the united states the rules must be the same for 
imported products as they are for domestic products he said 
it shouldnt make any difference whether its tobacco or 
semiconductors or soybeans

the government newspaper izvestia on tuesday 
became the first soviet publication to register under a new press 
law guaranteeing freedom from decades of state censorship 
while the new law appears to open new opportunities for 
prospective publishers and free the media of tight state political 
control another move announced tuesday could decrease readership 
the state press committee announced a doubling in the price of many 
publications blaming increases in the cost of paper printing 
equipment and transportation 
the popular magazine ogonyok which now costs 40 kopecks at the 
newstand will rise to about 1 ruble more than double its price 
the price of books also is expected to more than double officials 
said 
some politicians have called the planned increases an attack on 
glasnost president mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for greater 
openness 
boris n yeltsin president of the largest soviet republic 
russia told speakers at a meeting in the northern russian city of 
vorkuta on monday that the soviet parliament had been too easy on 
the communications ministry 
we should have taken it under control well return to the 
issue and after that they will probably stop their attacks on 
glasnost yeltsin said in remarks reported by the interfax news 
agency an arm of radio moscow 
press committee officials in moscow said the communications 
ministry is billions of rubles in debt because of the increases in 
production costs 
they also said newstand prices could remain the same if the 
unions and other groups that publish periodicals were willing to 
sacrifice their profits to cover the increases 
dmitri mamleyev first deputy chairman of the state press 
committee told a news conference that none of the old or new 
national publications applying for registration has been turned 
away 
more than 120 newspapers and other soviet news organizations 
have applied the new press law approved unanimously by the 
supreme soviet in june after months of debate took effect aug 1 
goodbye censorship read an izvestia headline on the first 
day of the new law on tuesday it headlined an article about its 
latest move izvestia registers no 1 
the new law forbids censorship of the mass media in addition 
to establish a publication or news organization soviets need only 
provide their name address frequency of publication circulation 
figures and source of financing 
all will be permitted except those urging the violent overthrow 
of the government promoting racial or religious intolerance or 
publishing propaganda for war violence or cruelty according to 
the law

julio sastre says he often gets dirty looks from 
the neighbors when he waters his garden 
a ban on garden hoses is in force in droughthit kent county and 
other parts of southern england and sastre says suspicious minds 
do not believe that he is simply using water recycled from his bath 
and kitchen 
drought in rainy england yes indeed some areas have gone 36 
straight days without rain and 18 million people are under the 
socalled hosepipe ban temperatures of more than 85 degrees are 
turning parts of the green and pleasant land a depressing brown 
says sastre who lives in the kent village of borstal we 
never thought we would have to pray for rain 
some showers fell on kent on tuesday but hardly made a 
difference said chris lakeland of the london weather center 
unfortunately over the next couple of days the places that 
want the rain wont get it and those that dont want it will he 
said 
in kent and elsewhere water authority inspectors are on the 
prowl the fine for illegal hose use has just been raised fivefold 
to 2000 pounds about 3750 neighbor is expected to snitch upon 
neighbor 
one doesnt like to encourage the idea of sneaking said 
dennis field area manager of southern water kents water company 
were not trying to cause bad feeling among neigbors 
but if people are suffering under a ban and they see their 
neighbors abusing the system then theyre inclined to report 
them 
southern water says sastre is doing nothing illegal by rigging a 
pump to his drainage system and reusing dirty water 
but in a telephone interview field worried about less honest 
gardenlovers installing a pump and then running clean water 
through it from the faucet 
sastre said people often stop and glare at him as he waters the 
garden and one neighbor has reported him to the authorities 
traditional english reserve doesnt apply he said in a 
telephone interview these people dont come out and ask me what 
im doing i would willingly part with the information but instead 
they just stand there giving me dirty looks 
the water companies suffer from an image problem they have been 
broken up into privatesector companies under the conservative 
governments privatization drive to unload cumbersome 
stateowned industries the consumer sees them as monopolies more 
beholden to shareholders than to customers 
citizens are invited to ring in anonymously and squeal on 
neighbors protested columnist matthew parris in the times of 
london 
thus are we divided and ruled instead of joining hands as 
brothers in oppression and marching on our monopolist tormentors 
we are to take up arms against one another 
the industry blames the problem on a series of dry summers and 
winters which have cut rainfall by 54 percent in some districts 
plus on an antiquated leaky mains system that will cost billions 
to modernize 
prosecutions are rare and not always successful 
last year a woman was acquitted after proving that a photograph 
provided by a neighbor which showed her watering her garden was 
taken before the ban was imposed

troubled area

un resolutions

from morocco the oppositionsocialist arabiclanguage 
newspaper alittihad al ichtiraki 
the greatest danger and the greatest threat to peace comes 
from foreign interventionist policy which denies the arab world its 
capital role in the settling of differences the safeguarding of 
regional stability and the protection of its national security 
the great western powers behave as though they are the instructors 
of the world the guarantors of the functioning of the universe and 
the perfect masters of its machinery

from egypt the stateowned arabiclanguage newspaper alahram 
which reflects government thinking 
the foreign preparations and the supplies pouring into the gulf 
region reflect a previously thoughtout plan to stay for a long 
time the americans are talking about preparations to send up 
to 250000 troops to saudi arabia and this gives a wrong 
impression that it is an occupation force rather than a protective 
force therin lies the importance of the arab league decision to 
send arab troops to support the armed forces of saudi arabia and 
other gulf countries

king hussein left for washington today to 
meet with president bush a day after traveling to baghdad for 
talks with iraqi president saddam hussein 
a senior jordanian official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the king was carrying a letter to bush from saddam the 
official did not disclose the contents of the letter but said 
his majesty is carrying saddam husseins views to president 
bush 
hussein is scheduled to meet bush wednesday 
the jordanian official said hussein will also discuss with 
president bush the imposition of united nations sanctions against 
neighboring iraq and jordans stance on the issue 
the jordanian monarch has been trying to act as a mediator in 
the crisis created by saddams invasion and annexation of the 
oilrich sheikdom of kuwait two weeks ago 
the state news agency petra reported the kings visit to baghdad 
monday but gave no details it also said the king had telephone 
contacts with the leaders of yemen tunisia sudan and the plo in 
connection with the crisis 
king hussein recently spoke of my impossible job in trying 
to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis sparked by iraqs 
invasion and annexation of kuwait indicating pessimism that the 
crisis could be resolved without violence 
the king forged a close alliance with saddam during the 1980 
outbreak of the iraniraq war the iraqis used a crucial truck 
route to jordans red sea port of aqaba to bring in weapons and 
other supplies 
but hussein also has stressed he still recognizes the government 
of the exiled emir 
the king has taken a strong stand against the dispatch of us 
forces to saudi arabia to protect its against a possible iraqi 
attack as well as against the decision of an arab summit 
conference to send arab troops to join the americans 
king hussein maintains that the kuwait crisis must be solved 
within an arab context excluding any foreign intervention

trade sanctions of the type 
imposed on iraq by the united nations are difficult to enforce and 
often take a long time to work 
the united nations has only twice before imposed trade sanctions 
on nations south africa and rhodesia in both cases the 
sanctions failed to have any immediate impact and sometimes they 
helped rather than hurt the nations 
for example the south african and rhodesian governments both 
found that the international condemnation increased their internal 
support the idea of fighting back against an unsympathetic world 
united whites in both nations 
lets show them be south african buy south african said 
the slogan of an antisanctions campaign 
the un security council voted aug 6 to ban most trade with 
iraq to force it to pull out of kuwait the sanctions the toughest 
imposed by the united nations in its 45year history are designed 
to cripple the oildependent iraqi economy and force a quick 
capitulation 
the only comparable action was when the united nations imposed 
trade sanctions on rhodesia in 1967 to force the whiteminority 
government to share power with the black majority after it broke 
away from britain a far less harsh arms embargo was imposed on 
south africa in 1977 to protest apartheid and it is still in force 
the restrictions imposed on iraq such as cutting off pipelines 
that carry iraqi oil have been put in to place far more quickly 
and strictly than the measures imposed on rhodesia and south africa 
and while many un members secretly violated the sanctions 
against rhodesia and south africa the united states and other 
nations are using their power and extensive monitoring capabilities 
to ensure the sanctions against iraq are not broken 
ironically the un sanctions helped strengthen the rhodesian 
economy at first the country was forced to reduce dependence on 
imports and develop its own industries to provide vital goods this 
made it stronger 
rhodesias economy boomed during the first year of sanctions at 
least 250000 new jobs were created and economic growth averaged 
about 10 percent annually in the first 10 years after rhodesia 
declared independence 
south africa became a vital conduit for rhodesia oil and other 
commodities were shipped through south africa evading un 
sanctions foreign businesses helped evade sanctions for high 
profits and rhodesians set up dummy foreign firms to channel 
imports and exports 
at least 60 un nations ignored sanctions secretly purchasing 
rhodesian chrome copper tea and tobacco nations breaking 
sanctions included the soviet union china and czechoslovakia 
which were arming the black guerrilla movements fighting the 
rhodesian government 
but the wave of rhodesian prosperity also depended on the 
healthy world economy during the 1960s and early 1970s when the 
world economy dipped the rhodesian economy started to suffer and 
sanctions began to bite 
south africa facing problems of its own withdrew backing for 
rhodesia and ultimately sanctions began to take effect eventually 
the government was forced to capitulate in the face of growing 
guerrilla activity and accept elections that ended white rule in 
1980 
south africa responded to the un arms embargo by developing 
one of the worlds most sophisticated arms industries faced by a 
cutoff of arms imports state companies developed everything from 
aircraft to warships and tanks 
south africas arms exports include longrange artillery to iraq 
south african military commanders have said the un sanctions 
were a blessing in disguise for the countrys military 
selfsufficiency 
but other sanctions imposed by western nations on south africa 
have had more of an impact the economy has suffered from cutoffs 
of credit and loans from western banks disinvestment by foreign 
firms and limits on exports and imports 
sanctions did certainly undercut economic growth mostly 
because of capital constraints said nico czypionka chief 
economist of the standard bank

the bush administration today called in 
foreign ambassadors to consider ways to safeguard warships in the 
persian gulf from iraqi reprisals us officials said jordans 
king hussein would meet with president bush on thursday 
as the gulf crisis deepened the government urged americans 
stranded in kuwait not to flee due to the danger involved bush 
was flying back to washington for a late afternoon news conference 
and a briefing by pentagon military chiefs 
hussein was said to be carrying a letter to bush from iraqi 
leader saddam hussein the king has hoped to serve as a mediator 
between saddam and the united states by hesitating to support the 
embargo approved last week by the un security council he has 
maintained his position as a middleman 
hussein will arrive in washington wednesday and then fly 
thursday to the presidents vacation retreat in kennebunkport 
maine the white house said press secretary marlin fitzwater said 
hussein called bush monday night and requested the meeting 
the details of the saddam letter were not disclosed 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii met with 
kuwaits foreign minister alahmad aljabir al sabah the envoy 
for kuwaits exiled rulers declined comment on their hourlong 
discussion at the state department 
in atlanta defense secretary richard cheney warned saddam 
against using chemical weapons against american troops he said 
there was a wide range of measures available to bush if saddam 
uses chemical weapons but indicated strongly that the use of 
american chemical weapons stock was not in the cards 
i cannot conceive of a situation where the united states would 
want to use chemical weapons were trying to discourage all 
nations in the world on their reliance he said at a news 
conference at ft stewart ga 
cheney said iraq has 200000 troops in kuwait and the southern 
part of his own country which abuts saudi arabia the notion 
that we have overreacted is not a valid one at all he said at 
ft stewart ala he said the deployment of forces has 
discouraged further aggression 
in washington ambassadors from the soviet union britain 
france and china the four other permanent members of the un 
security council were called to the state department for the 
consultations two options will be discussed creating a joint 
military command under the united nations and having the ships 
carry a united nations flag a senior us official told the 
associated press 
we would need to know what the role of the us navy would 
be the official said we have to exchange ideas 
the first idea advanced initially by the soviet union is to 
set up a joint chiefs of staff under the security council to 
coordinate defense of the us british french and other warships 
in the gulf should they come under iraqi fire the official said 
the second option under consideration is to give the warships 
the protection of the un flag 
the united states was criticized monday in new york by cuba 
and questioned also by canada france and malaysia for sending an 
armada to the gulf 
the official called the closed un meeting held at cubas 
behest an informal session 
he said the ships were in the gulf area at the request of saudi 
arabia and the kuwaiti government toppled by iraq he said the 
united states would engage in combat individually or collectively 
only if fired upon and under article 51 of the un charter 
the soviet british french and chinese ambassadors were called 
to the office of robert kimmitt the undersecretary of state for 
political affairs to see if their governments would go along with 
the proposals 
the joint chiefs have never performed this role before the 
official said of the idea of forming a joint military command 
the very fact we are exploring this mechanism shows we have 
no intention of ignoring the united nations 
the un security council last monday called for worldwide 
economic sanctions against iraq for its invasion of neighboring 
oilrich kuwait it was only the third such step taken by the 
council in the 45year history of the united nations cuba and 
yemen abstained from the 130 vote 
then on thursday by unanimous vote the 15 members of the 
security council declared iraqs annexation of kuwait null and 
void 
in the meantime the united states britain australia and about 
a dozen other nations sent warships to the gulf but the security 
council has not moved to enforce the sanctions with a military 
blockade 
concern heightened over the fate of americans trapped in kuwait 
and saudi arabia 
the voice of america a radio service operated by the us 
government is urging the americans still in kuwait not to try to 
cross the border due to the danger involved but advising them 
to get ready to leave on short notice 
when the orderly evacuation of americans wishing to leave 
kuwait becomes possible american citizens will be contacted by 
phone or by radio and information will be broadcast by the voice of 
america and the bbc voa broadcasts said 
about 500 americans already have been able to sneak into saudi 
arabia penetrating lax iraqi security but a caravan of others who 
tried to flee were forced to beat a sweltering retreat 
the clandestine departures reduce the number of civilian 
americans in kuwait to 2500 according to state department 
figures also stranded are 500 to 600 americans in iraq

iraqi president saddam hussein has 
systematically and ruthlessly eliminated dissent since he took 
power 11 years ago the economic siege of iraq likely will bring 
new hardship to his people but its open to question whether this 
will trigger serious opposition to his rule 
a few weeks before he sent his troops into kuwait on aug 2 
saddam arrested more than 40 senior military commanders in the 
latest of his periodic purges of men he suspected could challenge 
him iraqi dissident sources say 
generals who became too popular during the 198088 war with iran 
have disappeared fate unknown others died in a series of 
helicopter and auto accidents they included saddams cousin adnan 
khairallah who was the defense minister 
whether the latest reported purge was linked to saddams 
invasion plans is not clear but dissidents from various factions 
were reporting for some time before the arrests that there was 
discontent in the upper echelons of the military 
saddam 54 is the absolute ruler of iraq and its 16 million 
people he operates through the nineman revolutionary command 
council and the baath party which has been in power since a 1968 
coup after years as vice president and the real power in the 
ruling baath arab socialist party saddam shunted aside president 
ahmad hasan albakr to take over the presidency 
saddam has packed key positions with his relatives by blood or 
marriage they answer to him alone 
he is chairman of the command council and is also prime 
minister he has a handful of longtime aides such as first deputy 
prime minister taha yassin ramadan who is considered his 
secondincommand 
another important figure is tariq aziz the only christian in 
his 24man cabinet he is a deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister and saddams main adviser on foreign policy both are 
members of the command council 
but saddam is believed to wield almost total power 
he is a member of the minority sunni moslem sect some 55 
percent of iraqis are shiite moslems like most of irans 55 
million people 
iraq is a wellorganized police state and its government is 
one of the most brutal and repressive regimes in power today 
with the exception of freedom of worship the iraqi government 
ruthlessly suppresses even the smallest gesture of dissent the 
usbased middle east watch human rights group said in a recent 
report 
saddam controls iraqs 1 millionstrong armed forces and the 
countrys security and intelligence apparatus his intelligence 
services have hunted down and killed leading dissidents living 
abroad 
iraqis are encouraged to inform on their neighbors during the 
iraniraq war saddam publicly decorated fathers who turned in 
deserter sons 
publicly insulting saddam is a capital offense and sources in 
baghdad said some iraqis who made jokes about saddam had their 
tongues ripped out 
after the war against iran saddam announced a package of 
reforms including a multiparty system press freedom and 
presidential elections 
diplomats however said the changes were little more than 
cosmetic to keep iraqis acquiescent that belief was underlined 
when the compliant parliament last month called for saddam to be 
named president for life without any elections 
diplomats now expect saddam to shelve the promised reforms 
citing the crisis that he triggered 
the un sanctions against iraq are the toughest ever imposed by 
the world body and are expected to be felt quickly saddam on 
sunday called on iraqis to tighten their belts for what are certain 
to be difficult days ahead 
how long it might take for discontent to emerge is hard to say 
iraqis withstood hardship and shortages during the war with iran 
but the ceasefire raised expectations of better days 
iraqs official media daily churn out slogans hailing saddam as 
the new saladin the 12th century moslem warrior who defeated the 
crusaders and recaptured jerusalem the reports make no mention of 
dissent 
the reference to saladin is ironic saladin was a kurd and his 
descendants are among the tough mountain people who have been 
waging a fierce war for independence against the baghdad regime 
in march 1988 iraqi warplanes dropped poison gas bombs on the 
kurdish town of halabja killing some 5000 civilians western 
reporters who reached the town reported seeing hundreds of men 
women and children dead 
after the fighting with iran stopped saddam launched a major 
campaign against the kurds again reportedly using chemical weapons 
saddams other oppponents include the iranbacked addawa 
islami or islamic call a shiite fundamentalist movement that has 
assassinated scores of iraqi diplomats and senior officials 
hundreds of members along with their entire families have been 
reported executed

saddam husseins government is now 
calling kuwait one of the cities of southern iraq after 
annexing the oilrich state 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 and installed a provisional 
government of free kuwait that government in turn declared a 
republic just 24 hours later iraq declared that it had 
annexed kuwait 
iraqi spokesmen are now referring to kuwait aljahra and 
other cities of southern iraq aljahra is one of the 
municipalities that made up the former state 
under the ousted emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah kuwait was 
known as the state of kuwait it bridled at being called an 
emirate because in arabic that term connotes a tiny sheikdom 
or fiefdom

president bush pressured japan on tuesday to do 
its utmost and increase its participation in international 
efforts to punish iraq for invading kuwait 
japanese officials said they were debating what tokyo should do 
because of a constitutional ban on overseas military activities 
the ban stems from japans defeat by the united states in world war 
ii and the postwar occupation of japan by us forces 
it was the third time bush and prime minister toshiki kaifu had 
conferred by telephone about the middle east crisis since the aug 
2 invasion 
a call from bush two days after the invasion helped speed 
japans decision to announce economic sanctions kaifu then called 
the us president to report japans action 
in the latest phone call bush told kaifu he hopes japan will 
do its utmost including providing support to middle east 
countries that have sacrificed a great deal following the 
invasion the foreign ministry said 
kaifu responded that japan is considering how it can cooperate 
effectively according to a ministry official we are 
evaluating what sort of cooperation is most suitable for japan 
he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
bush did not specify what contributions japan should make but 
his request for maximum efforts probably includes support for the 
usled multinational force that is blocking iraqi shipping in the 
persian gulf region said the ministry official 
japans postwar constitution forbids the use of force to resolve 
international disputes defense agency officials say the country 
cannot by law send military units to join the multinational force 
as a result japan does not have any idea what to do beyond 
joining in the economic sanctions that have already been decided 
upon the nationally circulated asahi shimbun said in an 
editorial tuesday 
tokyos sanctions include a trade embargo on iraq and kuwait 
which together supplied 112 percent of japans oil this year 
japans inability to decide on additional actions contributed to 
kaifus decision monday to postpone a planned visit this week to 
the middle east news reports said 
advisers worried that if kaifu made the trip without announcing 
new actions it would give the impression japan was not doing its 
share to help resolve the crisis political aides said 
japan found itself in a similar situation in 1987 when the west 
demanded it aid in the effort against iraqi and iranian attacks on 
oil tankers in the persian gulf japan eventually financed a 
navigation system to keep track of ships in the gulf it also gave 
jordan loans and grants worth about 550 million and a credit line 
of 300 million and increased the money it paid to support us 
troops based in japan 
the japanese government decided against sending a minesweeper to 
the gulf as other countries did at that time because of its ban 
on military action overseas 
a foreign ministry official said monday that japan was 
determined to decide on concrete measures to help in the 
crisis makoto watanabe director of the ministrys middle eastern 
affairs bureau said the government will examine all possible 
measures while observing the provisions of the constitution 
in this rapidly changing world japan will be forced to make 
decisions on its own more frequently the nationally circulated 
yomiuri shimbun said in an editorial tuesday it is now the time 
for the ruling liberal democratic party and the opposition parties 
to start discussions to decide what japan can and cannot do

point on friday and is to remain here until labor day with 
occasional quick trips back to washington bush says he is 
confident that americans do not begrudge him a vacation mixed with 
business

dramatized the need for congress and the administration to reach a 
deficitcutting agreement to slash spending and raise taxes 
the gulf crisis already has caused a spike in oil prices 
creating a further drag on a sluggish us economy tottering closer 
to a recession the administration has said that the conflict could 
bring the economys alreadyanemic growth rate closer to zero 
but that a recession is not inevitable

discussion of any changes in our budget proposals that might have 
to be made to reflect the war

palestinians chanting death to america 
burned american and israeli flags tuesday in one of several rallies 
in the occupied territories in support of iraqi president saddam 
hussein 
in a response to growing antiamerican sentiments among 
palestinians the us embassy in tel aviv urged americans working 
in the occupied gaza strip to exercise caution embassy officials 
said 
sources in gaza said americans were told not to enter trouble 
spots such as palestinian refugee camps where many prosaddam 
rallies have been held 
there is something building up against the americans we are 
certainly on the watch we are aware that the first target would be 
americans said alexandra senfft spokeswoman for the un relief 
and works agency in gaza the agency employs three americans and 
assists palestinian refugees mainly by providing education and 
medical care 
she said she did not know whether american staffers were pulled 
off their duties in the refugee camps 
us embassy spokesman richard langford said he was not aware of 
warnings issued to americans in the west bank he said he did not 
know how many americans were working in the occupied territories 
palestinians are celebrating saddam as a national savior who can 
win back the west bank and gaza strip and teach a lesson to the 
americans israel seized the territories from jordan and egypt 
during the 1967 middle east war 
the support reached a nearfrenzy earlier this week after saddam 
linked a possible iraqi pullout from kuwait to an israeli 
withdrawal from the occupied lands iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
the strongest expressions of antiamerican sentiment tuesday 
were reported in the west bank city of nablus 
about 100 palestinians chanted death to america as five

lands in the west bank town of bethlehem soldiers ordered 
residents to paint over the slogans 
defense minister moshe arens on tuesday urged palestinians not 
to support iraq 
they are throwing their support behind a bloodthirsty 
dictator if it should lead to any increase or any acts of violence 
in the area well know how to take care of them arens said on 
israel radio 
the israeli newspaper haaretz reported that troops were under 
orders to prevent any show of support for saddam and to disperse 
proiraqi demonstrations 
military officials denied it we disperse demonstrations when 
we believe they will lead to violence regardless of their theme

a fishing boat carrying 50 people who were 
being forced back to china rammed into a taiwanese navy patrol ship 
and sank and 21 people from the fishing boat were missing the 
navy said tuesday 
in a news release the navy said the accident occurred at 1005 
pm monday when the chinese vessel min ping yu no 5202 sailed 
irregularly and slammed into the patrol ship the navy ship was 
monitoring the forced repatriation of the illegal aliens from 
mainland china 
the collision was at sea 13 miles north of the port of keelung 
the statement said 29 people from the fishing boat were rescued 
and 21 were missing those saved were taken back to keelung 
the boat had left nan fang ao a fishing port in northeastern 
taiwan on monday to return to china under orders of the government 
of taiwan 
except for the crewmen those on board were put in a cabin 
nailed shut with wood planks over the door this was to prevent the 
illegal immigrants from jumping overboard and trying to return to 
taiwan officials said 
taiwan has repatriated more than 10000 mainland chinese since 
1987 by forcing fishing boats that sneak into taiwanese waters to 
return to china 
over the last decade tens of thousands of chinese have tried to 
illegally enter taiwan to seek a better life on the prosperous 
island 
last week chinas official xinhua news agency claimed taiwanese 
authorities sealed 26 chinese in the cabins of a fishing boat and 
sent them back to china causing 25 of them to suffocate to death 
taiwan denied the report and said authorities repatriated 
mainland chinese in humane way 
the nationalist government was driven from the mainland to 
taiwan by the communists in 1949

retail sales were virtually flat in july 
edging up just 01 percent the government said tuesday and 
analysts predicted consumers will cut back spending even further 
because of rising oil prices 
the commerce department said sales rose a seasonally adjusted 
1495 billion last month up just 132 million from june 
nevertheless some economists were encouraged by upward 
revisions showing stronger sales in may and june than previously 
had been reported 
when you combine july with a restatement of more momentum in 
the prior months youve got a consumer hinting at a firming of 
demand as the second half of the year got under way said steven 
s roach senior economist at morgan stanley amp co 
but that data has been rendered obsolete for now by the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait and the resulting surge in oil prices 
roach and other analysts added 
if the price of oil remains about 25 a barrel the average 
american household will pay 260 more per year roach said 
that obviously will put a crimp in consumer buying 
the impact will have to be negative agreed lea tyler 
senior economist with the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa the 
question is how big 
consumer spending accounts for twothirds of the nations 
economic activity and has fueled much of the economic growth since 
the last recession ended in 1982 retail sales themselves represent 
about half of overall consumer spending 
in its revisions the commerce department said june sales jumped 
a strong 11 percent rather than the 05 percent gain it reported 
last month at the same time it said may sales declined just 01

reviving traditions as old as arab 
history two renowned arab poets have brandished virulent words 
against iraqi president saddam husseins military stab into kuwait 
writers have unleashed a barrage of condemnations and 
lamentations that depict saddam as a knightturnedthief and an 
ungrateful perfidious brother 
ghazi algusaibi a respected thinker and former cabinet 
minister who now serves as saudi arabias ambassador to bahrain 
fired the first poetic salvo 
suad alsabah cousin of the exiled emir of kuwait and a 
confirmed poet wrote in london a vow that kuwaitis will fight on 
to liberate their homeland her poem was widely distributed in the 
persian gulf 
demoting saddam to a fallen disgraced knight algusaibi 
reminded him that he owes his might and stature to arab 
benefactors he was alluding to kuwait and saudi arabia which 
according to gulfbased arab and western diplomats poured more 
than 34 billion into iraqi coffers to help defray costs of the 
198088 war with iran 
we turned you into our sword but lookthe sword has cut a 
deep wound into our heart algusaibi decried in the poem 
published in the progovernment newspaper alsharq alawsat and 
once you were our shield but behold the shield has turned into 
a burning lance in our back 
the poet wondered how the gulf arabs once looked upon saddam as 
a trusted friend and how they took him for a faithful brother he 
reminded the iraqi leader of his war with iran when we shared 
with you our bread when we wrote with our blood a covenant for 
which we bled 
you were our army tell us if you mayhow you lost the way 
to jerusalem algusaibi asked a giant in our eyes you were 
how ugly a giant youve become in the dark youve killed a 
tender kuwait bird 
he dismissed saddam as a disfigured knight turning into a 
killerthief in the dead of nightan insolent liar outright 
saddam will not last he concluded because no perfidious 
comrade ever can survive 
the poet once a leading citizen of the oilrich kingdom in 
recent years lost his cabinet portfolio on account of a poem in 
which he bitterly criticized his king 
the kuwaiti emirs cousin writing in london said 
never will you steal from us daylight you came at dawn with 
a tank that well fightwell resist the tank and the rogue 
has a tank ever conducted a dialogue 
we young and old reject oppression wherever you go in 
kuwait with vile aggression sands will turn into rocks of 
gloom and the sea into a fire of doom she wrote what you 
saddam dub a great epic and stride i call it a tragic fall and 
suicide 
ms alsabah reviled saddam who ruthlessly ruined my 
homewhen we gave him in our hearts a home we gave him gods 
victory and exaltationand he repaid us with invasion and 
occupation 
she lamented a stab in my back with an arab sword tinges 
history with disgrace when my cousin slaughters me with no 
warning word the arab unity dream becomes sawdust flying in 
space 
poetic expression is an arab legacy dating back to preislamic 
times when the bards and orators assembled with their tribal 
groups once a year at a marketplace called okaz to compete for 
acclaim 
tribal wars peace treaties and vendettas were attributed to 
okaz poems concepts of unfounded pride exaggerated praise and 
slander that elevated common men to legendary heights and 
humiliated kings also were attributed to okaz poems 
kuwaiti poet abdulrahman alnajjar joined the current parade of 
antisaddam poets with nine lines in the londonbased kuwaiti 
newspaper alqabas international 
sons of homeland o son remain freedespite fires 
misfortune and the invasion spree he wrote folks of dignity 
are never deterred be them living or even interred 
the current poetic fury reminds persian gulf nationals of the 
egyptian poets ahmed fuad nejm and the blind sheik imam who 
composed prolific ballads against the late president gamal 
abdelnasser and his successor anwar sadat 
one of their last ones discussed the usbrokered camp david 
peace treaties between egypt and israel 
they have sold our guns and our galabiya native robe for a 
phony peace imam wailed in moving sands forlorn egypt is 
lonesome without its arab folks

affected 
capps said the layoffs involve 16 fulltime employees and 15 
probationary staff members in upi bureaus around the country 
the washington post said the wire service plans to eliminate 
oneperson bureaus in green bay wis scranton pa atlantic 
city nj springfield mass and fairfax county va

women may have longer depressions than men partly 
because they tend to dwell more on the low mood a researcher 
suggested tuesday 
that may be a way to figure out why the depression occurred but 
works in a way that gets you stuck in a downward cycle said 
susan nolenhoeksema 
some small preliminary studies lend support to the hypothesis 
the stanford university researcher said at the annual meeting of 
the american psychological association 
she called it one of several possible explanations for recent 
early evidence that women tend to have longer depressions and run a 
higher risk of multiple episodes 
the rumination reaction includes focusing on such things as how 
tired and unmotivated one feels and on possible causes and 
consequences of the depression 
it contrasts with a distractive response in which a person 
does things to get his or her mind off the depression 
in one study 43 men and 36 women all depressed filled out a 
form every day for a month they reported how they felt that day 
how severe the depression was and which of 32 coping responses 
they used that day 
on average women reported more ruminative responses such as 
seeking solitude to think about their depression than men did 
their average was about three out of the 16 listed versus two for 
the men nolenhoeksema said 
the difference was statistically significant she said no one 
person could report all 16 ruminative responses because some of 
them were mutually exclusive she said 
analysis also showed that the degree of rumination was related 
to the depressions impact on a person she said impact accounted 
for severity and duration of depression 
degree of rumination also was related to the number of days that 
a person felt moderate or severe depression she said gender 
played no role in that she said 
in a second study 25 men and 25 women were made to feel sad by 
reading a sad story then they could choose a cardsorting task 
that focused on their feelings or a distracting cardsorting task 
in which they ranked nations by level of industrialization 
seventynine percent of the women but only 52 percent of the men 
chose the emotion task nolenhoeksema said 
her hypothesis appears very plausible as a partial 
explanation for the sex differences in depression said psychology 
professor paul blaney of the university of miami 
studying such vulnerabilities in women may lead to identifying 
them in some men as well he said

a senior treasury official vigorously denied 
tuesday a congressmans charge that the bush administration spent 
192 million to subsidize mexicos debt reduction agreement with 
commercial banks 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said such a mexican transaction completed in january 
is just one of a number of backdoor financing schemes put 
together behind closed doors to fund treasurys international 
operations 
mexicos important i come from a mexican background but 
i never felt that we had to give the family jewels in order to 
prove that were good neighbors gonzalez told david c mulford 
under secretary of the treasury for international affairs at a 
hearing 
we do not believe in producing subsidies for foreign 
governments mulford replied the entire debt strategy is an 
indication that our efforts have been devoted to curing this 
problem without recourse to taxpayers money 
the mexican deal was the first and most important struck under 
the socalled brady plan named after treasury secretary nicholas 
f brady it seeks to force banks to forgive part of the crushing 
13 trillion debt burden on third world countries in exchange for 
economic reforms in the nations that will make it possible for them 
to pay their remaining debts 
at issue is whether the united states gave mexico a favorable 
price when it sold 299 billion in zerocoupon treasury bonds 
mexico used the bonds as collateral to guarantee repayment of its 
remaining debt after commercial banks agreed to accept some losses 
on the debt 
mulford maintained that mexican purchase of the bonds in effect 
saved us taxpayers more than 100 million compared with what the 
united states would have had to spend to raise the money in the 
standard way selling interestpaying bonds through financial 
markets 
however the general accounting office congress auditing arm 
disputed that it said the zerocoupon bonds sold to mexico are the 
equivalent of a derivative bond product known as strips which 
like a zerocoupon bond pays no interest 
both zerocoupon bonds and strips are sold at a deep discount 
from the face value the bondholder reaps a profit by receiving the 
full face value at maturity 30 years later 
the price of the bonds sold to mexico should have been set in 
relation to the price of strips which generally is somewhat lower 
than the price of similar interestbearing bonds the gao said 
however treasury set a price for the bonds that involved an 
effective subsidy of approximately 192 million said allan i 
mendelowitz the gaos director of international finance issues 
gonzalez said the larger issue was the law which gives the 
treasury secretary power to make such decisions without 
congressional authorization he said it amounts to a circumvention 
of the congressional appropriations process 
however mulford said treasury would continue to consider using 
zerocoupon bonds as it thought proper as part of third world debt 
reduction deals he said such bonds likely would be used as part of 
a deal in process between banks and venezuela 
gonzalez was the only member of his 51member panel to attend 
the hearing congress is in recess for its summer vacation

the networks coverage of the middle east crisis 
last week boosted ratings for their evening newscasts by 19 percent 
and gave them a larger average audience than primetime 
entertainment shows 
the increase was due to public interest in the news from the 
middle east and us military movements there said nbc research 
vice president preston beckman i have no doubt about that he 
said tuesday 
cbs nbc and abc evening newcasts collectively averaged a 288 
rating and a 60 percent share of the audience last week compared 
with a 281 rating and 53 share for prime time programs nielsen 
audience estimates showed 
abcs frontrunning world news tonight averaged a 106 
rating the cbs evening news whose anchor dan rather has 
been in the middle east since iraqs aug 2 in invasion of kuwait 
averaged a 93 nbc nightly news ran third with an 89 average 
each ratings point represents 921000 homes the audience share 
is the estimated percentage of homes tuned to a given program in 
its time period 
abc research vice president alan wurtzel said that its rare for 
news ratings to do better than entertainment ratings he attributed 
last weeks ratings both to viewer interest in the crisis and the 
summer doldrums in prime time viewing 
cnn officials said their networks ratings had generally 
doubled the newscasts were seen in 763000 homes friday night and 
659000 homes on sunday 
viewers of monday nights network newscasts saw the first tv 
footage from a press pool flown out to the carrier independence in 
the gulf of oman 
cbs anchorman rather among the correspondents on the big ship 
taped his anchor portion of the cbs evening news there 
although the tv correspondents had to share pool video footage 
shot by a network cameraman rathers report included a homevideo 
segment taped by an unidentified sailor it showed rather touring 
the ship and interviewing crewmen 
while in the ships boiler room rather using a microphone 
attached to the sailors videocamera alluding to the star of top 
gun told viewers tom cruise doesnt make movies about this 
place

prosecutors may ask for a new indictment in the 
drugtrafficking case against manuel noriega a spokeswoman for the 
us attorneys office confirmed tuesday 
the investigation is continuing said diane cossin 
additional charges have been contemplated 
in recent court hearings for noriega codefendant roberto 
steiner prosecutors told us magistrate william turnoff that the 
new indictment would broaden the charges against the 16 defendants 
a source close to the investigation told the associated press on 
condition of anonymity that the new case is not ready to present to 
the grand jury but ms cossin refused to comment 
newsweek magazine reported this week that a separate tampa 
indictment accusing noriega of marijuana smuggling may be folded 
into the miami case the report said many consider the original 
miami charges weak ms cossin would say only that the case will be 
tried in miami 
noriega attorney jon may said he had heard reports of a new 
indictment 
im mystified by the whole thing he said the government 
doesnt need to bring a new indictment to bring new evidence in 
and they certainly dont need to bring new charges to keep noriega 
in jail for the rest of his life 
the only effect of a new indictment he said would be to 
further delay the planned jan 28 start of the trial 
the miami indictment was issued in february 1988 it accuses 
noriega who is being held at a federal prison outside the city of 
turning panama into a way station for usbound cocaine in return 
for 46 million in bribes from colombias medellin drug cartel 
one codefendant william saldarriaga has pleaded guilty and 
agreed to testify for the government 
in addition the government has been discussing a plea bargain 
with noriega aide luis del cid who accompanied the panamanian 
leader on toplevel trips to cuba and allegedly collected funds for 
him those talks with del cid however have been held up by the 
panamanian governments refusal to drop charges in that country 
according to defense attorney samuel burstyn 
in addition codefendant amet paredes the son of former top 
panamanian official gen ruben dario paredes surrendered to us 
officials a month ago and was immediately released on bond despite 
charges that could put him in prison for 95 years noriega defense 
attorneys have claimed he also is bargaining with the government

ships going to or coming from iraq will be 
allowed to transit the suez canal despite international sanctions 
against baghdad because of a 102yearold treaty requiring free 
passage the government said tuesday 
under the 1888 constantinople convention governing navigation 
through the canal ships can be denied transit only if they fly the 
flag of a country at war with egypt cairo officials say 
president hosni mubarak cited the convention one week ago when 
he rejected iraqi demands that egypt bar canal passage to us and 
other naval units sent to the persian gulf after iraqs invasion of 
kuwait 
the constantinople convention forbids passage only to ships 
from countries at war with egypt just like you look after your 
interests i look after mine mubarak advised iraq at the time 
the constantinople convention provides in its first article that 
the canal will remain continuously free and open in time of peace 
and also in time of war before all vessels whether commercial or 
military without any discrimination 
article 10 however says provisions decreeing freedom of 
passage shall not conflict with cairos need to defend egypt and 
maintain public security therein 
egypt interprets this as meaning that it has the right to deny 
passage to ships from countries at war with egypt it invoked the 
article in denying transit to israeli ships before the countries 
signed a peace treaty in 1979 
although egypt was not officially a belligerent in world war ii 
british occupation forces in the canal zone closed the waterway to 
ships from nazi germany and italy article 10 apparently was their 
justification 
egypt also normally bans passage of ships propelled by nuclear 
power or carrying nuclear weapons it says the rule is necessary 
for the security of the waterway and the three major population 
centers along its 100mile stretch 
but in recent years cairo has bent the nonuclear rule on 
several occasions to help the united states in emergency situations 
only last week mubarak allowed transit for the nuclearpowered 
us aircraft carrier dwight d eisenhower 
the same exception was granted us warships at least twice 
during the eightyear war between iraq and iran and once in 1986 
in connection with a crisis between the united states and libya 
egypt has had a special relationship with the united states 
since washington brokered its peace treaty with israel cairo has 
received 21 billion annually in us military and economic aid in 
recent years 
the staterun middle east news agency quoted a spokesman for the 
suez canal authority on tuesday as saying that barring iraqi or 
iraqbound ships was neither possible legally nor practical 
those who ask egypt to close the canal to iraqbound ships 
should try to stop these ships at the points of origin not in the 
channel he said 
the spokesman added that even if the waterway were closed to 
iraqbound vessels these ships can simply change their 
destinations to aqaba in jordan instead of to iraq

the department of veterans affairs has paid 
benefits to more than 1200 deceased veterans including about 100 
dead a decade or more the general accounting office says the 
agency pegs the potential annual loss due from the erroneous 
payments at 57 million 
auditors for the congressional investigating agency said the 
department could have reduced the erroneous payments by matching va 
benefit payment files with death information maintained by the 
social security administration 
the department agreeing with the gaos findings said it now 
intends to follow that procedure 
we found that in april 1989 va paid compensation or benefit 
payments for 1212 veterans whom social security administration 
records reported had died at least four months earlier the gao 
said in a report to the senate veterans affairs committee 
about 100 had been dead 10 years or more 
the veterans affairs department pays out more than 147 billion 
a year in disability compensation and pension benefits to more than 
28 million veterans and nearly 1 million surviving spouses and 
other dependents 
the gao said that while benefits should be ended when a 
beneficiary dies if surviving relatives or other knowledgeable 
persons do not report death to va in a timely manner substantial 
erroneous payments can result 
the agency said the department has relied on voluntary reporting 
of deaths as a basis for ending benefits 
but investigators said the social security administration goes 
much further receiving reports of deaths from many sources and 
buying death certificate information from states 
federal agencies such as the va are authorized to obtain this 
information the gao said 
the congressional agency said that by matching vas benefit 
payment file with social security files containing information on 
39 million deaths we identified 1212 veterans who were reported 
dead as of december 1988 
the gao said it first found 1065 veterans that social security 
data showed were dead but who were still receiving va benefits 
erroneous payments to these veterans accounts could amount to 
51 million annually it said 
the gao said it then matched the va payment file with a social 
security file containing about 450000 death certificates purchased 
from the states 
that search added an additional 147 deceased veterans whose bank 
accounts were continuing to receive payments the gao said it 
estimated these erroneous payments at 638000 
the review was conducted between august 1989 and april 1990 
the veterans affairs department acting at the gaos request 
investigated several of the cases with these results 
a veteran identified by social security as having died in 
august 1984 continued to receive va benefits records showed that 
a total of 30369 in direct deposits had been made to the 
veterans bank accounts the va ended benefit payments concluded 
that overpayments of 30000 had been made and opened an 
investigation 
social security records showed another veteran had died in 
september 1983 but the department continued to make direct deposit 
payments totaling 13797 the payments were ended and the 
department is considering further action 
social security records showed another veteran had died on aug 
8 1986 va payments had been sent since then to the veterans last 
known address the va ended payments after determining that the 
veteran was indeed dead and that a sister had been cashing his 
checks erroneous payments were estimated at 2755 
in a letter to the gao edward j derwinski the secretary of 
veterans affairs said he concurred with the agencys findings and 
was moving to obtain death information from the social security 
administration 
upon verification of the death we will take prompt action to 
stop any erroneous payment and to resolve any overpayment that 
would develop derwinskis letter said

the proportion of women in medical schools 
continues to grow but the percentage of black and hispanic 
enrollments is largely stagnant according to a report by the 
american medical association 
one medical school dean says thats a symptom of the lip 
service that the nation has given to minority medical education 
in the past 10 years female enrollment at medical schools has 
jumped from 16315 or 254 percent to 23501 or 361 percent 
said a report in wednesdays journal of the american medical 
association 
minority medical enrollment has remained about level with the 
4076 black medical students last year amounting to 63 of all 
enrollees and the 3518 hispanics making up 55 percent of medical 
students the report said 
a decade ago total black enrollment was 3708 or 55 percent 
the ama said in 1979 the closest year for which comparable 
figures are available hispanic enrollment was 2289 or 37 
percent it said 
since the early 1970s there has been a national commitment to 
expand the opportunities for members of minority groups to enter 
medicine and other health professions said the first report 
headed by dr harry s jonas director of the amas divison of 
undergraduate medical education 
despite this commitment the percentage of black and hispanic 
applicants and matriculants has not shown a significant rise 
william wallace associate dean of the university of illinois 
school of medicine at chicago disagreed with that assessment 
i dont think there has been a national commitment to recruit 
minority medical students said wallace whose school has one of 
the largest minority enrollments in the country the commitment 
has been more lip service than a national commitment 
for example the federal government is giving the university of 
illinois medical school less money this year than last for 
minority recruitment or a total of 140000 he said 
the high cost of medical education may be one factor 
discouraging potential minority applicants another report in the 
journal said 
the average debt for medical students who borrowed money was 
42374 at graduation in 1989 up more than 4000 from only a year 
earlier four of five graduates were in debt 
for minorities the debt burden averaged about 6000 higher 
said researchers led by paul jolly of the association of american 
medical colleges in washington

president bush broke off his 
vacation today to return to the white house for budget and military 
briefings after agreeing to meet here thursday with jordans king 
hussein 
bush himself was sticking with plans to spend less than 24 hours 
in washington returning to his oceanfront compound here on maines 
rocky coast in midafternoon wednesday 
but the president kept up his frenetic diplomatic efforts by 
telephone calling japans prime minister toshiki kaifu monday 
night and taking a call from king hussein just back from 
conferring with iraqi strongman saddam hussein in baghdad 
king hussein asked for a meeting to discuss the matter 
directly with the president white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said today the president agreed and phoned the king 
back a short time later to confirm the arrangements 
fitzwater said there was no indication the king is carrying 
a message from saddam but senior jordanian officials in amman said 
the king was carrying a letter from the iraqi leader 
bush instructed defense secretary dick cheney to head back to 
saudi arabia on friday to visit american troops mustered in the 
desert and confer again with king fahd 
bush himself planned to spend the afternoon at the white house 
reviewing budgetary problems with aides facing reporters and then 
meeting with kuwaiti foreign minister sheikh saudalsabah 
while the white house initially said the budget session would 
include both treasury secretary nicholas f brady and budget 
director richard darman neither planned to attend they were 
sending deputies in their stead 
brady was on a speaking trip for republican candidates in the 
midwest darmans office refused to say where he was 
after spending the night in the white house bush will be driven 
to the pentagon wednesday morning for a fullscale military 
briefing on the situation in the gulf he also will speak to 
pentagon workers in the courtyard of the huge military complex 
before taking a helicopter to andrews air force base and the return 
flight to his summer home 
bush got in a morning of fishing with his wife barbara before 
returning to washington 
the white house said monday it was very optimistic that 
the embargo will hold cutting off not only iraqs exports of 
oil but also denying it food and other goods 
the nations of the world are abiding by their commitments 
said fitzwater the naval barricade forced two or three ships 
to turn back at sea without reaching iraqi ports he added 
the white house said the gulf crisis has added new urgency to 
the quest for a bipartisan agreement to reduce the gaping federal 
deficit 
we think its even more important that we reach an agreement 
now because there needs to be a unity of purpose in this country 
not only about the conflict in the gulf but also about our 
spending issues and about where the budget is going fitzwater 
said 
bush stayed out of the public eye monday calling venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez to discuss the crisis and world oil 
supplies and relaxing by taking his highspeed boat fidelity out 
on fishing runs in the atlantic 
in tokyo foreign ministry officials said bush asked kaifu that 
japan boost its aid to middle east countries hurt by the embargo on 
trade with iraq the ministry did not specify which nations might 
be involved but egypt jordan and turkey are among japanese aid 
recipients affected by the increased tensions 
fitzwater declined to reveal what the two leaders talked about 
bush plans to return to maine by midafternoon wednesday after 
his military briefing and a speech to pentagon employees but he 
may do more shuttling back to washington before his crisisclouded

daniel ortega says he doesnt miss being 
president of nicaragua and is enjoying his new role as a leader of 
the political opposition 
ortega who was defeated in elections feb 25 after ruling his 
central american nation for 10 years said in an interview tuesday 
that his sandinista national liberation front was revamping itself 
to appeal to a broader range of nicaraguan voters 
the sandinistas this month began holding public debates in 
nicaragua for people to tell sandinista leaders what they did wrong 
and what they did right during their rule ortega said 
the door is open for everyone to talk the former president 
said 
the criticism will lead to a reformation of the partys policies 
and objectives with an eye on the countrys next elections in 
1996 ortega said 
he said it was too early to tell if he will be the sandinistas 
presidential candidate 
ortega came to new york this week to maintain ties with 
supporters here he gave a speech in a church monday night to 
2500 people and to contact publishers for a book he plans to 
write 
the book might be a work of fiction based on fact he said 
drawing on his own experiences 
ortega acknowledges that the sandinistas committed several 
errors which sent many nicaraguans over to the side of 
ussupported contra rebels who fought for almost a decade to 
overthrow the leftist government at a cost of some 40000 lives 
in the days after the sandinistas toppled anastasio somoza in 
july 1979 the dictators supporters the somocistas were targeted 
to have their large land holdings redistributed to the poor 
some landowners were affected who werent precisely 
somocistas ortega acknowledged 
the urgent demand for land made us act in a hasty way giving 
a very negative impression to rural people he said this gave 
the contras the opportunity to say the sandinistas want to take 
land away from everyone 
ortega said the sandinistas also mistreated the miskito indians 
who opposed the government and were forcibly removed from their 
homelands in northeastern nicaragua in the early 1980s the miskito 
and other indian tribes joined the contras armed resistance to 
sandinista rule largely because of the relocation program 
ortega appeared relaxed during the 45minute interview 
conducted in spanish at the apartment of a friend of his former 
foreign minister miguel descoto who also came on the trip to the 
new york 
the apartment on new yorks exclusive upper east side decorated 
with a picasso and other priceless artworks seemed an incongruous 
setting for the former revolutionary 
ortega who robbed banks in his early teens to get money for the 
antisomoza insurrection wore a blue blazer and necktie 
its unprecedented for a revolutionary who fought a 
dictatorship with weapons to later win power and then become the 
opposition within a democratic context that he himself helped 
create he said so i think this is a rich experience 
the sandinistas have organized two strikes since president 
violeta chamorro was inaugurated april 25 imperiling her new 
government and raising fears that the sandinistas would try to 
wrest power away from her 
ortega said the sandinistas will not use forcible means if we 
are going to return to running the government of nicaragua it will 
be through elections

with no iraqis in sight the biggest problem 
for american troops deployed in the desert sands is the 115degree 
heat 
soldiers in full battle dress added a chic touch to their gear 
liter bottles of mineral water the us forces were told to drink 
at least six gallons of water a day 
one medic said tuesday he had treated numerous dehydration 
cases some requiring intravenous injections of nutrientrich 
fluids 
troops at a staging camp said the heat had fried some 
radios rendering them useless 
even reporters members of the pentagonorganized news pool 
had to wear long pants the saudis frown on shorts 
perhaps such hardships are just as well 
they could put us up in airconditioned buildings said a 
24yearold medic from hollywood fla but then if we have to 
fight people used to this were not going to last very long 
im like their mother the medic told peter copeland a 
reporter for scripps howard news service its my job to see that 
they eat and if you see a guy with two full canteens you know 
hes not drinking 
as the american buildup continued us forces took up positions 
sidebyside with saudi marines at a saudi naval base near vital 
oil terminals 
transport planes continued landing us troops and materiel at 
an air base elsewhere in the country a british airways jet was 
also seen arriving already lined up at the airport were dozens of 
saudi fighter jets and a smaller contingent of canadian fighters 
us bulldozers frontend loaders armored vehicles and jeeps 
lined the base roads pallet after pallet of munitions gear food 
and other supplies were stacked along the roads 
in all the american reporters visited with members of the 82nd 
airborne at three sites the naval base the air base and a nearby 
airdefense camp that the saudis have given over to the americans 
ground rules for the pool prohibit the release of exact numbers 
of weapons exact locations of us deployments and the names of 
most troops here only officers with command duties can be quoted 
by name 
tuesdays tour gave the pool reporters their first chance to see 
us troops in the field with saudi forces 
at the naval base the 82nd was working to secure the area for 
marines who began arriving in saudi arabia monday 
while at the base two lengthy convoys of doubledecker buses 
carrying us troops passed along a nearby highway to a barracks 
area of the sprawling base 
a small detachment from the 82nd took up positions on sand dunes 
overlooking the water nearby were saudi forces from the naval base 
the air defense camp bristled with vietnamera m551 sheridan 
airborneassault vehicles light tanks that can be airdropped 
also at the site was a multiple rocket launcher 
as the troop presence intensifies many foreign civilians are 
leaving the area 
cmdr christopher j elles who heads a 20member us navy 
training detachment in saudi arabia said 10000 foreign nationals 
including about 2000 americans had left the city where he is 
stationed since the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
many of those are relatives of oil workers who have stayed 
behind 
asked about the defenses in place at the oil facilities elles 
said one bomb in the right place obviously would create a lot of 
problems he added thats a personal opinion 
with the exception of the canadian jets the reporters have not 
seen forces from any other nations diplomatic sources in riyadh 
the capital said syrian units landed tuesday to join us 
british egyptian and other forces 
theres a great deal of working relationships that have to be 
worked out elles said of the growing multinational defense force 
one of those relationships involves respect for the saudis 
islamic faith 
at one spot on the naval base americans and saudis are housed 
in tents about 50 yards apart 
between the tents copelands report said is an area with two 
25footlong pieces of canvas the saudis asked the americans not 
to step there because that is where they face mecca and pray five 
times daily 
how do the two tents communicate 
a 26yearold saudi sergeant had this answer delivered through 
an interpreter 
some of us speak a little english or we use arabic but 
mostly its sign language 
and what do they talk about 
whatever comes to mind the sergeant said 
often the talk is about the heat 
the saudi sergeant sweat running down his face into a thick 
black beard said of his american counterparts god willing they 
will get used to the heat soon 
his advice to the yanks 
keep the flaps of your tent open

truckloads of goods rolled into iraq from 
jordan and iraqibound cargo was unloaded from ships at the 
southern port of aqaba on tuesday despite unordered sanctions 
against baghdad 
king hussein flew to washington on tuesday for talks with 
president bush still refusing to sever what could become iraqs 
economic lifeline the king departed carrying a message to bush 
from iraqi president saddam hussein with whom he met monday 
this indicated hussein is still hoping for a diplomatic solution 
to the crisis caused by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
husseins refusal to comply with the embargo against iraqi goods 
stems from the impact this would have on jordans fragile economy 
and the expected violent reaction from the largely proiraqi 
jordanians 
foreign ministry undersecretary mutasem belbeisi explained that 
though the un sanctions are mandatory every country whose 
economy can be severely affected can consult with the security 
council to see what measures could be adopted and what sanctions 
could be imposed if any 
western diplomats said the jordanian delegation to the united 
nations was discussing this point in new york 
the imposition of sanctions by jordan would block 40 percent of 
the countrys total exports and raise jordans 16 percent 
unemployment rate by 10 percent to 12 percent jordanian officials 
say 
in addition jordan imports 90 percent of its domestic oil needs 
from iraq 
in israel meanwhile parliamentarian binyamin beneliezer 
demanded tuesday that israel impose a blockade on the jordanian 
port of aqaba where iraqbound supplies were being unloaded 
the southern port is the last opening for goods to reach iraq if 
western vessels completely seal the persian gulf its closure could 
have a severe impact on iraq which is heavily dependent on 
imported foodstuffs and other goods 
associated press photographer martin cleaver said three ships 
docked in the port tuesday and were unloading norwegian newspapers 
reported that police in aqaba ordered a norwegian ship to unload 
corn bound for iraq after the captain stopped deliveries 
cleaver said one of the ships was the tanga from norway he 
could not confirm that police had ordered it to be unloaded 
photographers were unable to approach the tanga which was heavily 
guarded by jordanian troops 
numerous loaded trucks were driving north from aqaba toward 
amman and the iraqi border it was unclear which of the cargoes 
were destined for iraq 
ap photographer yousef allan reported from the ruweishid border 
post on the main highway linking jordan with iraq that the volume 
of heavy trucks and oil tankers traveling both ways had increased 
over the past few days 
officials at the ministry of commerce said oil also continued to 
flow out of iraq through a small pipeline to a point near amman it 
is iraqs last operating oil pipeline since saudi arabia and 
turkey have stopped shipments of iraqi oil transported through 
pipelines on their territory 
jordanian commerce ministry officials said apart from jordanian 
domestic needs the operating pipeline is only used to transport 
50 million worth of oil annually to brazil 
in the persian gulf us and british warships have reportedly 
started checking for shipping bound for iraqi ports western 
diplomats said 
the diplomats said if jordan continued to serve as a transit 
point for iraqi goods it could harm the multinational barricade 
but they said it was unlikely us warships would intervene in the 
gulf of aqaba to stop and check shipping 
king hussein is eager to act as an intermediary in what he has 
described as the impossible job of settling the kuwait crisis 
peacefully through arab mediation he flew to baghdad on monday for 
consultations with the iraqi leader 
the official jordanian news agency petra did not announce his 
trip until after the king returned home tuesday petra said the 
king also talked by telephone to the leaders of yemen tunisia 
sudan and the palestine liberation organization

israeli officials on tuesday urged neighboring 
jordan to join the international embargo against iraq but defense 
minister moshe arens said israel would not take action if jordan 
ignored the pleas 
there is no reason for us to interfere arens told israel 
radio israel is not part of the sea embargo declared by the 
united states this is being carried out with american ships and 
european ships we are not part of this 
his remarks were in line with israels stated policy not to 
become directly involved in the current crisis however israel has 
repeatedly said that if neighboring jordan allowed the iraqi army 
to use jordanian territory it would attack 
washington has been careful not to enlist israel its closest 
ally in the region for fear such a move would anger arab states 
now backing the west 
international attention is increasingly focusing on jordan and 
its red sea port of aqaba the last opening for goods to reach iraq 
if the persian gulf is sealed binyamin beneliezer deputy head of 
the parliaments foreign affairs and defense committee demanded 
tuesday that israel impose a blockade on aqaba 
us media reports said an iraqi freighter carrying weapons was 
en route to aqaba which is on the jordanianisraeli border and 
only five miles from the israeli resort of elat 
three ships docked in the port tuesday and were unloading 
according to associated press photographer martin cleaver in 
addition numerous loaded trucks were driving north from aqaba 
toward amman and the iraqi border it was unclear which of the 
cargoes were destined for iraq 
an israeli government official urged jordan to end its very 
hesitant policy toward iraq 
we hope that jordan will join the international consensus and 
join the embargo said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
he said aqaba would play a central role in the american showdown 
with iraq aqaba will be of major importance for iraqs ability 
to survive he said 
other government officials said they were watching traffic in 
the gulf of aqaba very closely and had not noticed any substantial 
increase shish dekel the captain of an israeli yacht moored in 
elat also said traffic in aqaba port appeared to be normal 
dekel speaking on israel radio said that at the height of the 
iraniraq war when iraq did not have access to persian gulf ports 
as many as 90 ships with cargo for iraq would pass through aqaba 
every day 
during those days jordan built an elaborate road system to 
truck goods from aqaba to iraq israeli military analysts said 
the analysts said jordan might seek to sidestep pressures from 
both iraq and the west by trying to get away with a partial embargo 
on the one hand they fear being portrayed as joining the 
great powers against iraq on the other hand they dont want to be 
seen as antiamerican said asher susser head of the dayan 
center a think tank at tel aviv university 
susser said if jordans king hussein goes along with a full 
embargo it would probably cause domestic upheaval jordan has 
witnessed mass proiraqi demonstrations by palestinians and moslem 
fundamentalists 
but another analyst dore gold said the united states probably 
would not allow goods to reach iraq via aqaba because it would 
damage the effectiveness of international sanctions 
if there is any sense that the blockade or lets use the word 
quarantine is porous to a certain extent then immediately nations 
with greater mercantile interests will start trading with iraq 
said gold an analyst at the jaffee center for strategic studies at 
tel aviv university

a searing debate on abortion got 
hotter tuesday when a leading lawmaker insisted west german women 
be barred from taking advantage of east germanys liberal abortion 
law after unification 
abortion tourism to east germany would be unleashed if there 
were no threat of punishment said wolfgang boetsch a 
highranking member of a conservative party that is part of west 
german chancellor helmut kohls coalition government 
sentiments on the issue are so divided that last month the two 
nations postponed deciding on a united germanys abortion statutes 
until an allgerman parliament can take up the matter 
when unity occurs by the end of the year two abortion laws will 
exist in one nation west germanys strict statute and the far 
more lenient one in what is now east germany 
in west germany abortions are allowed only if there is a 
lifethreatening risk to the mother if the pregnancy resulted from 
rape or incest or if birth would create extraordinary social and 
economic hardship 
east german women on the other hand have a fundamental legal 
right to an abortion as long as it occurs within the first 12 
weeks of pregnancy 
east germany with a population of about 16 million last year 
recorded 73000 abortions the figure was 75297 in west germany 
which has a population about four times greater than its eastern 
neighbor 
east germany has insisted that its abortion law be retained 
after unification 
the debate is not only between two nations but also between 
political partners 
the liberal free democrats junior coalition partners in kohls 
government have proposed not to prosecute west german women if 
they choose to travel to what is now east germany for abortions 
after unification 
that idea has enraged the conservative christian social union 
the csu will not abide by such a step boetsch said tuesday 
reversing the states protection for the unborn life is out of 
the question for west germans under any circumstances 
liberal politicians have said that if west germany retains its 
abortion laws a west german woman who had an abortion in an east 
german clinic could face prosecution on her return home 
east german doctors say west german women have already begun 
crossing the border to benefit from east germanys abortion laws 
but east german doctors are not permitted to perform abortions 
on foreigners so far there have been no reports of east german 
doctors violating the law 
parliament president rita suessmuth a top kohl ally has 
ruffled a few conservative feathers by lambasting the west german 
law 
if men were those people who were primarily affected they 
would have made a humane as well as lifeprotecting law long ago 
ms suessmuth said earlier this month 
kohl has stayed clear of the fight but his christian democrats 
have insisted that west germanys abortion law should serve as the 
model for that of a united germany 
ms suessmuth has tried to calm the waters by proposing a 
compromise law for a united germany 
her idea is to meld the intensive consultations required under 
west german law with a womans basic right to an abortion within 
the first trimester 
for many conservatives however that sounds too much like the 
current east german law

of regular communication between the two sides 
in north korea 1000 people including koreans from overseas

there was no rockets red glare no 
bombs bursting in air but our flag was still there tuesday at a 
surf shop where officials backed off ticketing the owner for flying 
old glory 
it only took hours for mayor fred lager perhaps thinking about 
what happened to roseanne barr to rescind the ticket citing a 
misinterpretation of a local law 
atlantic beach surf shop owner tom sena has been flying the flag 
outside his long island store since he opened it five years ago 
but on monday inspector frank levecchi gave him a 250 ticket for 
violating a 1976 ordinance barring hanging exhibiting and 
swinging of banners and flags without the written permission of 
atlantic beachs board of trustees 
lager said the law was meant to keep shop owners from flying 
several flags particularly in commercial displays the mayor said 
levecchi apologized and that the town might consider changing the 
flag laws language

syrian troops planted their flag beside the american in the 
defense of saudi arabia on tuesday and arab harbormasters in the 
persian gulf kept embargoed iraqi freighters at bay turning up the 
heat in the simmering showdown with baghdad 
in washington the us and soviet superpowers conferred on 
putting a united nations umbrella over any antiiraq naval blockade 
the new middleman of the middle east jordans king hussein 
headed for the united states and a meeting with president bush 
carrying with him a private message from iraqs saddam hussein 
as peace efforts and economic pressure stepped up us military 
forces continued to pour across a 7000mile air bridge into the 
arabian desert it was the seventh day of desert shield the 
operation designed to face down an iraqi army that seized kuwait 
and could threaten saudi arabia 
out in the sand wastes paratroopers of the us armys 82nd 
airborne division found friendly saudis and some tastes of home 
like a delivery of fastfood burgers according to reports from 
journalists in a us media pool 
but the young americans also had to deal with 115degree heat 
and the potential for chemical warfare with iraq 
said one gi were trained and ready 
north across the desert hundreds of other americans remained 
trapped in kuwait and iraq 
one iraqi spokesman the ambassador to greece told reporters in 
athens the americans and thousands of other foreigners stranded 
when iraq invaded kuwait could leave as soon as the threats from 
the united states and its allies are eliminated 
the voice of america radio in a message beamed toward the 
troubled upper gulf cautioned the trapped americans an estimated 
2500 in kuwait and 500 to 600 in iraq not to try to flee across 
the kuwait border into saudi arabia due to the danger involved 
under all the pressure iraq sounded unyielding 
in baghdad the staterun newspaper aljumhuriya said iraq knows 
how to foil us measures if iraq is attacked it said iraq 
can move the battlefield to where the united states does not 
want or expect it to be 
iraq said it launched its lightning strike against kuwait aug 2 
because of disputes over oil and money it said kuwait deliberately 
cut iraqi oil revenues by overproducing its own oil and driving 
down prices and unfairly pressed for repayment of an estimated 15 
billion in kuwaiti loans to iraq the iraqis also cited old claims 
on kuwaiti territory 
after its conquest iraq announced the annexation of kuwait 
to underline that declaration the baghdad government this week 
began referring to kuwait city as a southern iraqi city 
at us urging the un security council on aug 6 ordered a 
worldwide punitive embargo on trade with iraq bush then dispatched 
us troops and warplanes to saudi arabia saying the massing of 
iraqi troops just across the border in kuwait threatened 
usaligned saudi arabia us oil supplies and ultimately the 
us economy on aug 10 twelve of 20 arab league nations voted to 
also send their troops to stand beside the saudis 
the latest arab contingent from syria began arriving in saudi 
arabia in the early morning tuesday said diplomatic sources in the 
saudi capital of riyadh no details were available on the size or 
kind of unit involved 
most of an estimated 5000 egyptian troops promised for the 
saudi defense were already there and moroccan troops are expected 
soon 
a total of at least 50000 us troops are expected to be 
committed to desert shield within weeks including marines army 
air assault forces paratroopers and infantry at times in recent 
days us air transports were landing every 10 minutes in saudi 
arabia with american soldiers and supplies 
facing them were an estimated 200000 iraqi troops in kuwait 
out in the warm aquamarine waters of the gulf meanwhile there 
was new evidence tuesday of the effectivness of the maritime 
embargo 
authorities in the united arab emirates refused permission for 
an iraqi freighter despite repeated appeals from the captain to 
enter the port of dubai the freighter alabid stood anchored 
uselessly three miles outside the dubai breakwater shipping 
sources said another iraqi freighter albaya also waited 
futilely off dubai the sources said 
the international embargo could cripple iraq by cutting off its 
allimportant trade exports of oil and imports of food and 
military supplies 
the sanctions are beginning to bite in baghdad said a yugoslav 
businessman who reached belgrade on tuesday we noticed that 
availability of foodstuffs has been reduced and sugar and 
flour are in short supply he said 
the bush administration has made clear that dozens of us navy 
ships assembling in the gulf region would be used to blockade iraqi 
maritime traffic if necessary but us allies and other un 
members object that the security council embargo resolution did not 
specifically authorize such a naval operation 
in an effort to reach an understanding the state department on 
tuesday summoned the washington ambassadors of the four other 
security council powers the soviet union britain france and 
china to discuss the possibility of establishing a joint un 
military command in the region or of flying the un flag on the 
warships in the gulf 
the soviets who have a handful of warships in the area have 
said they will not take part in a naval blockade except under 
security council auspices 
at un headquarters in new york diplomats said the security 
council was unlikely to act until after it hears reports friday on 
how the 159 un members are observing the embargo 
the boycott against iraq was far from solid particularly in 
neighboring jordan 
iraqbound cargo was still being landed at the jordanian port of 
aqaba off the red sea and eyewitnesses reported truck traffic 
continued normally across the iraqjordan border 
iraqs major oil outlets pipelines through turkey and saudi 
arabia were effectively shut down but a smaller line into jordan 
remained operating jordanian officials said and iraqi oil was 
being loaded into tanker trucks and sped to ships at aqaba

rebel leader prince johnson met with 
reporters this afternoon and laughed off claims by rival rebels 
that he had been killed in an ambush 
charles taylor johnsons rival in the yearlong battle to oust 
president samuel doe claimed this morning his fighters had killed 
johnson when he was surprised at a rubber plantation outside the 
capital monrovia 
a man identifying himself as johnson earlier had called the 
british broadcasting corp in london on a radiotelephone to deny he 
was dead shouting into the phone taylors a liar i am alive 
in washington the state department said a very reliable 
source saw johnson alive today 
the rebels hours earlier failed to show journalists johnsons 
body as had been promised 
taylors spokesman and defense minister tom woewiyu who 
announced johnsons death said in an interview that if anyone 
talked with johnson this afternoon they were talking with a 
corpse 
told that the us state department said johnson was seen alive 
today hours after the reported ambush woewiyu said they must 
have a different johnson 
at todays state department briefing spokeswoman margaret 
tutweiler said we have a reliable source this morning that told 
us they have seen him today alive they said they had a 
very reliable source that said they had seen him today 
earlier a rebel commander identified as oliver varney led the 
ambush that supposedly cost johnson his life said rebel officers 
at their headquarters on the firestone rubber plantation about 37 
miles southeast of monrovia 
woewiyu spokesman for taylors national patriotic front 
earlier told reporters in abidjan in neighboring ivory coast that 
johnson had been killed on bushrod island while trying to leave 
monrovia 
johnson was trying to get out of monrovia when he ran into our 
forces woewiyu said in a telephone interview 
woewiyu had said johnsons body had been taken to npf rebel 
headquarters and would be shown to reporters 
the two guerrilla leaders split three months ago in their 
violent war to oust doe and since then each has threatened to kill 
the other 
johnsons men had been holding much of monrovia for several 
weeks after launching a surprise attack from a swamp north of the 
city they caught does troops by surprise and took control of the 
citys port area and also several residential districts 
the report of johnsons death came as an african peacekeeping 
force appeared to be meeting further delays 
troops from ghana nigeria guinea sierra leone and gambia have 
gathered in neighboring sierra leone but there was no sign of an 
early departure 
woewiyu said taylor would be flying to banjul gambia this week 
to talk with gambia president sir dawda jawara head of the african 
mediation committee trying to end the nearly eightmonth civil war 
in liberia 
this seemed likely to delay the arrival of the peacekeeping 
force 
johnson was one of the original rebels who invaded liberia from 
ivory coast last dec 24 according to rebel sources and his 
friends 
johnson 31 broke with taylor several months later perhaps 
over the issue of who would lead the movement 
johnson whose forces have been described by us officials as 
more disciplined than taylors and perhaps stronger is entirely of 
african descent taylor is of mixed americoliberian african 
ancestry americoliberians are the descendents of american slaves 
who founded liberia in 1847 
johnson who joined the army in 1981 and also received some us 
military training was arrested during the unsuccessful 1985 coup 
led by brig gen thomas quiwonkpa but escaped and rejoined other 
exiles in ivory coast

king hussein walking a tightrope between his powerful iraqi 
neighbor and world opinion met with iraqs president saddam on 
monday in baghdad and is to meet with bush thursday at the us 
chief executives vacation home in maine the jordanian monarch 
trying to mediate the crisis is carrying saddam husseins views 
to president bush a senior jordanian official said 
american leaders are also likely to press the king to close the 
embargo loophole in jordan 
aqaba is within reach of us navy units which have been 
keeping an eye on a tanker that sought unsuccessfully to take on 
iraqi oil at the nearby saudi port of yanbu 
the us naval commander in the gulf rear adm william m 
fogarty told reporters aboard the flagship uss lasalle that he now 
has at his command 24 ships 17000 men 200 aircraft and three 
aircraft carriers in the gulf the nearby arabian sea and the red 
sea warplanes from the carrier independence just outside the 
gulf fly nightly missions over that strategic sea 
the navy operated behind a cloud of diplomatic semantics 
bush said the us warships would stop oil shipments and other 
iraqi trade but navy commanders said they had no specific orders 
on how to waylay iraq shipping and us officials avoided calling 
it a blockade a term connoting wartime status 
a few british and french warships were also in the area and 
australian canadian and dutch ships were on their way or soon 
will be but debate grew in some of those countries over the role 
their forces would play even some members of australian prime 
minister bob hawkes own party questioned his decision 
on tuesday an alert went out in the gulf that iraq may have 
planted seaborne mines in an important shipping lane the warning 
was later rescinded but us navy commanders took no chances on 
the bow on the us cruiser antietam lookouts with binoculars 
stood duty watchful for mines

try moving a mediumsized city 7000 miles 
across an ocean within days to a desert where thousands of people 
need to eat sleep bathe and defend themselves against a 
millionman army 
thats what the pentagon is up against in operation desert 
shield its largest military operation and most taxing logistical 
problem since vietnam 
you have two things against you geography and time and as 
soon as it gets there you have to resupply right away said 
duane cassidy a retired fourstar general who until last year 
commanded the united states transportation command the logistical 
arm of the military 
this operation is something no one else in the world can do 
nobody else knows how to do it or practices it said cassidy now 
a vice president for csx corp a transportation company in 
richmond va 
the pentagon refused to give specific numbers on troop shipments 
and which air carriers are involved but cassidy estimated 90 
percent of the troops and 50 percent of the cargo arriving in the 
saudi arabian desert are being flown on commercial airliners the 
pentagon has used commercial carriers for over 30 years to ferry 
troops around the globe 
that frees up air force planes to carry cargo such as the 
c141 which can hold 200 troops and 34 tons of equipment at the 
same time and the c5 which can hold 340 troops and 130 tons of 
equipment 
every 10 minutes a plane lands in saudi arabia each nonstop 
flight takes about 15 hours and national guard and air force 
reserve crews are part of the operation 
among the us airlines taking part are eastern world airways 
tower international and federal express which gives a military 
slant to the slogan when it absolutely positively has to be there 
overnight 
an allout sealift is also underway although the navy has only 
eight fast ships capable of carrying tanks armored personnel 
carriers and helicopters on the twoweeklong voyage to the persian 
gulf it would take all eight ships just to transport the 24th 
mechanized infantry division from savannah ga 
the navy also has about 94 slower ships in a reserve fleet that 
could be pressed into service 
the whole united states transportation command air lift and 
sea lift is heavily taxed right now it puts a strain on the 
system its not a crisis but its certainly busy and hectic 
said capt george sillia an air force spokesman at the pentagon 
desert shield is much different from last years panama 
invasion which was a much smaller operation besides the united 
states already had forces on the ground in panama and had its own 
bases to land its jets 
desert shield is also lightninglike compared to the escalation 
in vietnam which by the nature of the conflict occurred much more 
gradually 
there were 300 us military advisers in vietnam in 1959 two 
helicopter companies were deployed at the end of 1961 raising the 
total of us personnel in vietnam to 1500 
by the end of 1963 the us commitment had grown to 16500 
troops but the first combat troops didnt arrive until 1965 when 
a major buildup boosted troop totals to 181000 peak involvement 
reached 550000 troops most of the equipment was sent by sea 
the air force which has the largest fleet of transport planes 
in the noncommunist world says the middle east crisis underscores 
the need to move troops quickly to flashpoints of conflict around 
the globe 
the air force wants to replace its 25yearold c141s with the 
new c17s one new transport could do the work of two older planes 
at less cost air force officers said 
the policy of moving troops and dependents by commercial charter 
began in president eisenhowers administration as a way to cut 
costs it lessened the need for the air force to invest in 
transport aircraft 
its an efficient way to move cargo and government 
equipment said staff sgt mark johnson of the military airlift 
command the longrange air lift arm of the military based at scott 
air force base in illinois 
a 1986 pentagon study said it would take 2 billion to buy 20 
airliners and train crews to fly them about 95 percent of all 
pentagon personnel flying overseas use commercial flights 
according to government records

from dinner theater to donahue a 
montanabased religious sect is working to mend an image tattered 
by a fuel spill at its underground fallout shelter near yellowstone 
national park 
it was four months ago that 31000 gallons of diesel and 
gasoline leaked from tanks buried near the church universal and 
triumphants giant shelter complex a barrage of criticism and news 
coverage ensued 
since then church members have started staging weekly 
dinnertheater productions at a churchowned restaurant and church 
leaders invited locals to a fourth of july hoedown with an outdoor 
barbecue and square dance 
church leader elizabeth clare prophet and several members also 
pleaded their case on the donahue talk show 
its been the best forum for us to talk to the nation about 
what we really think church spokesman murray steinman says 
people were just astonished when they saw us to see that we were 
happy competent normal people 
yet some local officials still view the church with a wary eye 
citing its sometimes secretive nature and preemptive style of 
development 
theyve kind of done a 360degree turnaround trying to be 
nice says park county commissioner carlo cieri a frequent 
critic at this point i dont think theyre sincere about 
anything theyll have to prove it to me i hope they do 
earlier this year state officials accused the church of 
concealing plans to build its fallout shelter and reopened an 
environmental review of church developments in southern park 
county church officials said they had no obligation to reveal the 
plans 
cieri says the churchs longrange impact on this county of 
rolling prairie and 11000foothigh mountain peaks is anyones 
guess he estimates that 3000 people associated with the church 
have moved into the remote area straining publicservice budgets 
and forcing residents to reexamine their frontier antipathy toward 
government regulation 
this county used to be just leave em alone let em do what 
they want cieri says but the church has built a whole town 
above ground and below ground without any permits with no public 
planning whatsoever 
the church a mixture of christianity new age philosophy and 
rightwing politics came here in 1981 when it bought a 
12500acre ranch owned by the late publishing magnate malcolm 
forbes 
it since has purchased an additional 18000 acres and moved its 
international headquarters from california to corwin springs a 
tiny community a few miles north of the northern boundary of 
yellowstone park 
over the years church members slowly moved into the area but a 
large influx occurred this year when prophet said a 12year cycle 
of bad karma was beginning april 23 presaging a possible 
global catastrophe 
members built private underground shelters or stocked completed 
ones at two churchsponsored housing developments near emigrant 
while church engineers worked to complete the large complex in a 
cloistered meadow 2 miles north of yellowstone park 
the fuel leaks discovered the second week of april halted most 
work prophet promised a thorough cleanup 
meanwhile the church universal and triumphant began to show a 
less insular aspect to its neighbors 
in june church members opened the paradise players revue 
three nights a week revue players sing broadway tunes at the ranch 
kitchen a churchowned restaurant at corwin springs tourists and 
locals can even buy a combination show ticketbuffet dinner 
its really topquality entertainment says steinman a 
lot of people have told us its the best show in montana 
the church also extended special invitations to a june 23 
performance by fred morsell a professional actor and church member 
who staged a dramatization of frederick douglass autobiographies 
steinman says the productions had been discussed for some time 
and arent a publicrelations ploy although he admits they havent 
hurt he points out that the church has held open houses in the 
past similar to this years fourth of july celebration 
we always would like to have better relationships with people 
in our local area he says 
regardless of its image the church faces an uncertain future 
state officials say cleanup of the fuel spill paid for by the 
church will continue for months and cost hundreds of thousands of 
dollars 
john arrigo of the state water quality bureau says that as of 
midjuly only 6000 gallons of the spilled fuel has been 
recovered additional fuel has evaporated and some was contained in 
6600 cubic yards of contaminated soil that is being treated in a 
nearby field 
a state lawsuit halted construction at the 750person fallout 
shelter and park county officials placed a moratorium on sewage 
permits for most underground shelters at the emigrant housing 
developments 
two billings lawyers hired by the state are pondering the next 
legal move to enforce the cleanup and prevent additional 
environmental problems at churchowned developments 
steinman says the church is willing to negotiate with the state 
over the cleanup and future environmental concessions 
as for their current life without bomb shelters steinman says 
church members arent overly concerned i think everyone here 
recognizes that our faith in god is first and foremost and i think 
everything will work out we believe he will see us through to 
the end

thousands of times each day a 
whitetailed deer comes nose to grille with a motor vehicle often 
with disastrous results 
and not just to the deer though as many as 350000 deer die 
each year on americas roads last year 131 people died in 
collisions with animals and damages and the costs of cleaning up 
total in the millions of dollars 
wildlife and highway officials say theres no simple way to keep 
the creatures and man from colliding on the nations roads 
a growing deer population there are now 16 million to 18 
million whitetailed deer in the united states and canada and 
human sprawl are forcing traffic engineers and wildlife 
officials to seek ways to keep the animals off the road 
its a fairly severe problem particularly if its your car 
thats been hit said richard mccabe of the wildlife management 
institute in washington dc 
the problem is that with concentrated deer populations 
particularly in states like pennsylvania and northern wisconsin 
that are semimountainous you have highways that intersect travel 
routes of deer he said 
in west virginia the death rate grew from 2660 deer in 1979 to 
6326 in 1989 the typical animal that was struck caused about 
1300 in damage said roger russell of the state division of 
highways 
pennsylvania which has a deer population of more than 15 
million spends about 8 million each year to collect dead deer off 
the roads said state game commission spokesman ted godshall 
game officers picked up more than 40000 deer carcasses from the 
highways last year they are given to needy families fed to fish 
or buried 
i know that it takes a minimum of two hours to pick up a deer 
and they usually have to drive 50 miles or more godshall said 
it can take two or three hours of an officers time its a 
tremendous bill 
the remedies for road kills are varied among them is more 
careful planning of where roads go reexamination of grasses and 
shrubs planted along roads dispensing with salt as a way of 
ridding roads of ice because deer like salt and more warning 
signs 
colorado and pennsylvania are considering rerouting deer over 
and under major thoroughfares mccabe said this seems to have 
some benefits but of course deer populations can change he 
said underpasses and overpasses are fairly expensive 
propositions if you dont know whether the deer are going to move 
fences by all accounts the most effective remedy also are 
expensive costing as much as 200000 a mile a more recent 
solution wildlife warning reflectors costs 7000 per mile 
the reflectors light up and set up an unnatural moving light 
pattern which scares the deer said john strieter president of 
strieter corp which sells the reflectors we dont know whats 
going on in the deers head but eyewitnesses say the deer react 
with them and change directions 
in minnesota the reflectors are being used at 30 sites with a 
dozen more to be added susan mulvihill accident surveillance 
safety engineer for the state department of transportation said 
they seem to be working 
when we figure out a benefit cost we use 60 percent reduction 
as an average so theyre pretty effective if you install them 
right mulvihill said weve had pretty good luck with them 
here its worked better than anything else we tried 
but the high cost and mixed results at a twomile teststrip 
along interstate 79 have made west virginia officials skeptical 
it is fairly expensive and it isnt 100 percent effective in 
reducing deer kill russell said the only thing that is 
100 percent effective is an 8foot tall fence 
whistles attached to vehicles to frighten deer by emitting 
highpitched sounds also have shown limited effectiveness mccabe 
said 
i dont hold much credence in it at all he said it may 
scare off deer that are standing in the roads but it doesnt do 
much for those out of the periphery of the sounds that are running 
along the highway those tend to be the deer that are hit anyway 
everything has been tried nothing works godshall said 
fencing is the best thing but theyre prohibitively expensive 
the problem wildlife officials say is not really with the deer 
at all its people 
people are inclined to spread out in attractive areas that are 
hilly and have forests areas that are traditionally and 
ecologically principal and critical habitats of deer and certainly 
other wildlife mccabe said 
theres more traffic more miles of travel being done each 
year and more roadways to accommodate that traffic he said 
what it all comes down to is when a deer bangs into a car people 
tend to get annoyed at the deer but its the people who are more 
or less invading the deers habitat and all of this is a 
consequence of human sprawl

a question for you charlie rose as you might 
put it 
youre host of nightwatch you leave the acclaimed cbs 
overnight show for fox broadcasting co youre going to front a 
halfhour daily magazine show called personalities 
why 
thats absolutely the right question to ask says rose who 
learned how to handle interviewers during nearly 10000 interviews 
in his 6year stint on nightwatch he settles back with a 
heineken and salted peanuts 
it was an opportunity for me he says 
hes just interviewed gov mario cuomo whos not saying whether 
hell run for president in 1992 and rose looks relaxed almost as 
if hes enjoying this theres no sign of the breathless fidgeting 
intensity that shredded his nightwatch questions into sentence 
fragments 
it was finding an opportunity to do something in a different 
form a daily magazine 30 minutes versus two hours he said 
the new broadcast brings together a different group of people 
four different subjects each day a different pace i was attracted 
to that the idea was good i liked the people that were involved 
and i thought fox was an interesting place to be 
the show designed to lead into or out of the evening news 
premieres sept 3 on 117 stations covering 82 percent of the 
country rose says hes looking forward to a substantially bigger 
audience than nightwatch which averaged 500000 to 1 million 
viewers in its heyday well its heynight actually 
personalities is a departure for him 
its not a long conversation he said i recorded today 
40 minutes i would say that well probably use five or six 
minutes on nightwatch if we taped 44 minutes wed have 43 
minutes on the air 
he leaves cbs with regret he said 
i loved cbs rose said i am happy i am at fox now 
leaving nightwatch was painful because it was the most satisfying 
professional experience i have ever had 
cbs told him his future was assured cbs was very clear about 
how much they wanted me to stay he said and they were also 
very aware that what fox was offering they didnt have 
they were not in the syndication business and did not have a 
show that would be on following the news every night they did not 
have the opportunities that fox would have in building a network 
he said 
and they said to me come back whenever you want to rose 
smiled then he chuckled it doesnt mean they meant it but they 
said it 
i may find out that i really miss the pyschic income that i 
got from nightwatch and ill go back to it he said i dont 
think so because i tend to move on in my life 
roses tv career has been a strange patchwork a henderson 
nc native and graduate of duke university and its law school he 
was practicing law and doing free lance tv work when he met tv 
journalist bill moyers in 1974 
moyers offered him what would be the job of managing editor of 
the pbs series bill moyers international report the next 
year rose became executive producer of bill moyers journal 
also on pbs 
rose declares his debt to moyers his friend and mentor for 
giving him values techniques insights and overall good common 
sense and a sense of excellence 
it took longer to find his niche in commercial tv in 1976 he 
joined nbc news as a washington political reporter a year later 
he was cohost of am chicago a daily morning talk show on 
the windy citys abcowned wlstv 
in 1979 he moved to dallas and the daily charlie rose show 
airing mornings on kxastv an nbc affiliate the show later 
syndicated nationally moved to wrctv in washington dc and 
folded in 1983 
in 1984 came nightwatch a smallscale interview show where 
roses adrenalinejagged intensity worked to his advantage he once 
interviewed a man who was keeping silent as an environmental 
protest 
id ask him a question and hed gesture it was wonderful 
rose said once i did that i was convinced i had a shot at 
making most things be interesting

if you ask albert sindlinger whether saddam 
hussein can provoke a recession in the united states he will 
respond how can he create a recession that is already nearly 
eight months old 
sindlingers staff measures economic strength or weakness by 
calling americans on the telephone every day every week in 
every state but alaska and hawaii to find out about their 
financial condition 
based on their detailed responses nearly 4300 of them for the 
month of july he determines if they have what he calls positive or 
negative household liquidity last month 687 percent of 
households reported negatively 
to sindlinger an octogenerian who has been making such calls 
for more than 30 years that evidence of recession is overwhelming 
conclusive beyond debate consumer activity he points out makes 
up most of gross national product 
government officials dont agree they say gnp is continuing to 
grow albeit by a tiny percentage and they have said so 
repeatedly they are likely to continue saying so until six 
straight months of shrinkage occur 
theyve manipulated the figures says sindlinger who vows 
later this month to demonstrate to corporate and financial clients 
how they did it all he will say for now is that it involved 
official revisions of gnp made july 27 
had they revised correctly he says gnp for the first and 
second quarters of 1990 would have shrunk by 02 percent and 03 
percent respectively instead of having risen according to the 
government by 17 percent and 12 percent 
to sindlinger nothing speaks more clearly about the economy 
than the pocketbooks of americas households they are the 
economys strength or weakness what happens to them happens 
collectively to the country 
calling from headquarters in wallingford pa sindlinger 
researchers ask heads of households these questions 
1 is your total combined household annual income now higher or 
the same as it was six months ago 
2 do you think your combined household annual income in the 
next six months will remain the same or be higher or lower than 
now 
3 do you believe that in the next six months there will be more 
or the same numbers of jobs where you work 
4 do you expect that business conditions in the next six months 
will be the same or better in your area 
if the respondent answers any of the four questions negatively 
the household is said to have negative household liquidity right 
now says sindlinger you can find negative liquidity in most of 
the country 
negative liquidity went beyond 50 percent of all households 
527 percent in january rose to nearly 80 percent in february and 
march dropped to 743 percent in april and has been just under 70 
percent since then 
based on interviewing through august 2 he lists 28 states as 
being clearly in recession with the most pronounced weakness being 
in new england the southeast southwest and the mideast or 
states of delaware maryland new jersey new york pennsylvania 
and the district of columbia 
the strongest states in the sindlinger accounting are illinois 
washington oregon ohio indiana minnesota utah and wisconsin a 
notch below them are iowa nevada colorado south dakota kansas 
montana and nebraska 
barely over the 50 percent line a critical demarcation in the 
sindlinger thesis are idaho missouri and michigan and sitting 
right on it are north dakota and wyoming the rest 28 of them 
have negative liquidity 
by sindlingers reckoning the recession began long before 
iraqs saddam hussein invaded kuwait even if it still isnt 
reflected in official government figures but it will be he says 
noting weakness in july retail sales 
he agrees that mideast troubles could worsen things but he will 
not he says make a projection without checking with his 
informants without listening to the voice of the people 
they tell us if theres a recession he said we dont 
tell them

a quarter of a million youngsters will 
experience the fun side of writing this school year penning 
letters to newfound friends about pets bratty siblings favorite 
foods and neighborhoods 
so often children use writing as a functional tool said 
elizabeth white the new principal at cunningham elementary school 
in fluvanna county va in this program teachers are helping 
students practice their writing skills while kids see it as just 
plain fun 
the pen pal discovery program completed a pilot project during 
the last school year when 130 third graders in the rural virginia 
county exchanged letters with the same number of students in tampa 
fla 
more than 250000 third and fourth graders at 5000 schools in 
10 states have signed up for the program this school year five 
times the number expected by the programs creator kelly 
communications a charlottesville va health publishing firm 
i thought it was a very effective program it was creative 
said sara van lier a new third grade teacher at forest hills 
elementary school in tampa fla 
the program involves writing in a sneaky kind of way she 
said you are telling the youngsters this isnt really work 
kids this is something else 
white was assistant principal at columbia district and fork 
union elementary schools during the experimental project last year 
she said i saw a lot of excitement in the children especially 
when they found something in common like liking the same groups or 
having cats as pets 
being exposed to children their age in another state or 
country broadens their horizons children their age usually are 
only familiar with their own environment its exciting to learn 
other ways of thinking and talking added white who has been 
writing a pen pal in australia for about 20 years since the sixth 
grade 
the youngsters under close teacher supervision exchanged five 
letters during the course of the school year with third graders at 
tampas forest hills 
the drawback acknowledged van lier was it was hard to get 
the children to bring in stamps to participate many of the 
youngsters are from povertystricken families and its hard for 
them to bring in anything 
the pen pal program the brainchild of kelly employee alan 
phillips could not have come at a better time 
a test of 18000 fourth sixth and eleventh graders in 1988 
found their ability to write informative persuasive and 
imaginative pieces was about the same as their counterparts in 
1974 the study was conducted by the natioonal assessment of 
educational progress popularly known as the nations report card 
eighthgrade english teachers reported that 45 percent of their 
students wrote papers of a paragraph or two weekly and only 14 
percent wrote a oneor twopage paper each week only 6 percent 
wrote papers or three or more pages each year 
fortytwo percent of the teachers said they spend about one hour 
each week on instructing and helping students with writing 302 
percent spend 30 minutes or less 
the american association of parents amp children said four out of 
10 eleventh graders cannot write an adequate description of their 
qualifications for a job 
the pen pal discovery program provides freeofcharge 
letterwriting kits that explain the various types of letters and 
the different parts of each like the heading greeting body 
closing 
the kits also include special writing paper for letters to 
foster ideas about subject matter data pages are provided for 
children to record information about themselves their state and 
neighborhood 
teachers oversee use of the kits and are encouraged to 
incorporate the project into the regular classroom lessons once 
the letters are written individually in class the teacher sends 
them in a packet to the pen pals of the prematched class 
the pilot program also tried individual mailings of the letters 
officials conceded that method failed 
this school year students will send letters each month 
beginning in january 
judy lewis executive vice president at kelly said an 
information survey of the teachers found they liked the program 
because it is selfcontained wellorganized easy to follow and 
supports their curriculum 
classrooms are matched by computer with the purpose of pairing 
urban and rural schools schools in new york with those in 
california and schools with unique cultural differences said lewis 
there is nothing like this that we found exist said lewis 
there is nothing that takes the concept of pen pals communicating 
beyond giving them a pen pal and saying write 
we suggest what to write about give them materials to use to 
write back and forth and provide the setting under which it can 
occur 
lewis said kelly communications is asking corporations to 
provide financial support for the program the cost is estimated at 
3 per child

a quiet revolution is under way in dozens 
of rural southern counties where people historically unrepresented 
are nurturing a shadow government to help them take the last step 
up from slavery 
this alternative power structure conceived by a descendant of 
slaves and based on thomas jeffersons ideas is called simply 
the assembly 
it has brought millions of dollars worth of new schools miles 
of paved roads and most important to the assembly members who are 
mostly black a voice that can no longer be ignored 
in appomattox county gospel songfests and candy sales helped 
the local assembly raise 65000 purchase six acres and clear the 
land for a community center 
we were always going from one place to another having our 
meetings said milton chambers the 36yearold assembly 
president a foundry worker who lives three miles from the spot 
where the civil war ended 125 years ago 
to have a building to call our own he said members gladly 
sacrificed some contributing hundreds of dollars 
the only way to control our destiny he said is to be 
able to turn on and cut off the lights when we want to 
in a phrase he was stating the goal and purpose of the 40odd 
assemblies in virginia and other southern states organization for 
selfhelp and representation 
ill say it til i die if you give people something youll 
build dependency said don anderson a black former congressional 
committee lawyer who created the assembly system but if you just 
organize the voluntarism theyll do it themselves 
and once its done its like magic 
for 22 years anderson has been trying to work that magic 
through his washington dcbased national association for the 
southern poor 
with a staff of 10 and an annual budget of nearly 500000 
mostly from individual donors and foundations its goal is to 
create assemblies in 258 southern counties with low incomes and 
black populations of about 30 percent to 80 percent 
anderson has written that his aim was to give these people a 
vehicle for solving their problems and for taking the last step up 
from slavery 
most assemblies are in virginia and north carolina but new ones 
are being formed in georgia and south carolina and plans are to 
expand to alabama mississippi louisiana arkansas and tennessee 
to spread his selfhelp concept across the region anderson 
touts assemblies accomplishments to date the paving of 20 miles 
of roads in black areas of washington county nc job training 
for the hardcore unemployed in portsmouth va 25 million in 
water line extensions and home renovations through federal grants 
in jones county nc and many other projects 
the assemblies operate within a very refined structure based 
on jeffersons idea of ward republics anderson explained 
we go into a county and divide it up into manageable groups of 
50 people each the equivalent of jeffersons wards anderson 
said and these are represented in a central decisionmaking body 
called the assembly 
to establish an assembly andersons organizers usually spend 
two months locating community leaders and bringing them together in 
preliminary meetings anderson who attends a final organizational 
gathering said it costs 18000 on average to organize a county 
procedurally the assembly is a very accurate copy of the 
british house of commons said anderson who holds a degree from 
the london school of economics 
at a recent meeting of the assembly of charlotte county va in 
a muggy school auditorium members who were dressed as if for 
church closely followed parliamentary rules calling questions 
printed on an agenda named the order paper rising whenever 
addressing the group and directing all comments to the speaker 
the difference is that at the house of commons they dont serve 
fried chicken and biscuits beforehand 
assembly members must be at least 18 and must be registered 
voters although the groups are nonpartisan voter registration 
often is a firstpriority project 
the relationship between the assembly and local elected 
officials varies 
i see it as a system to assist the government thats in 
place said andrew murray who heads the assembly in caswell 
county nc 
others see it as a watchdog organization the appomattox 
assembly and others have appointed members to monitor county 
supervisor and school board meetings 
in surry county va three assembly members sit on the 
fivemember county board of supervisors 
so all the issues that come up in the assembly are heard by 
members that can actually vote on them said surry assembly 
president thomas hardy who also chairs the county planning 
commission 
surrys assembly founded 21 years ago is the oldest and most 
successful hardy proudly showed off its projects to a reporter 
some came about through grants the group applied for some through 
its pressure on local officials 
a neat 50unit subsidized apartment complex built after the 
assembly decried the fallingdown tinroofed shacks that many 
lived in is to be expanded 
a 1 million medical clinic put up by the assembly with 
foundation grants has visiting specialists and is working to find 
fulltime doctors 
a handsome 540000 recreation center hums with activity a 
summer day camp program for schoolchildren meetings of senior 
citizens civic group gatherings even wedding receptions 
as everyone benefits from the improvements relations between 
the races have improved hardy said a white official sheriff wc 
andrews agreed 
its a lot of times that maybe we dont see eye to eye the 
sheriff said but we get together and try to work things out 
of all the changes the assembly has brought in surry a farming 
county where pork peanuts and pines are grown hardy is proudest 
of the schools 
before the assembly started its work with a housebyhouse voter 
registration drive that made clear the black majority the schools 
were in a desperate condition he said 
at the high school we didnt have a gymnasium we didnt have 
a cafeteria 
after integration was ordered all but nine white students left 
the 1300student district for private schools according to a 1971 
news story only two of the districts 60 teachers were white but 
whites held all but one seat on the school board 
now theres a brand new 1 million elementary school a 4 
million high school surrys per capita student spending is 5633 
nearly the highest in virginia 
and although the assembly sometimes criticizes the black 
superintendent he has been successful in working to bring at 
least 80 percent of the white children back hardy said 
the blackwhite ratio among students is now 73 percent to 27 
percent according to martha rollings assistant to the 
superintendent for instruction in the general population about 
six out of 10 people are black hardy said 
there are 58 black teachers 34 white three blacks and two 
whites sit on the school board 
improvement in standardized test scores has been dramatic for 
example surry eighth graders ranked in the eighth percentile 
nationally in reading in 1979 now theyre at the 49th within 
reach ms rollings said of the national average 50th 
percentile were working on it she added 
anderson knows the statistics and the faces they represent 
you dont have to think of symbolic changes he said you 
can transform a whole community

don anderson was a student in london 
attending sessions of the house of commons when he could but 
thomas jefferson was on his mind 
what country can preserve its liberties jefferson wrote 
if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their 
people preserve the spirit of resistance 
rejuvenate democracy return power to the grassroots divide 
the counties into wards jefferson wrote 
in andersons mind jeffersons ideas became a resolution he 
would look for a way to apply them in the american south where he 
came from to empower poor blacks 
everybody said its impossible to organize an entire county or 
city the 58yearold anderson says now years later well 
thats exactly what weve done about 40 times 
the assemblies that he launched flourish in some places 
struggle in others but anderson keeps fanning the ember he might 
travel to a country church hall to explain his system or to a 
manhattan penthouse to mingle and seek donations 
anderson who grew up in a middleclass black family is a 
graduate of the london school of economics and the university of 
michigan and its law school he writes acts in shakespeare 
productions and plays the bagpipes 
but politics and economics have been his focus in 1964 as 
counsel to a us house subcommittee he helped draft the 
antipoverty economic opportunity act 
he concluded that alleviating poverty and not just its symptoms 
would require a selfhelp structure for whole communities so in 
1968 he founded the national association for the southern poor 
i left the marbled halls of the rayburn building he wrote 
for the remotest rural areas of virginia and north carolina to 
put the ideas of jefferson to work 
earlier this year andersons group received a plaque from the 
white house recognizing it as one of president bushs thousand 
points of light

when lukasz malachowski edited an influential 
weekly back home in poland the bottom line was maintaining 
journalistic integrity while avoiding the ire of communist 
government censors 
came the revolution and all that changed the censors were gone 
but so were the government subsidies for essentials like paper and 
ink competing for survival became the new bottom line 
everything was subsidized or donated we never had to think 
whether it could be sold or not now we have to think over all 
these things or nobody will be able to survive says malachowski 
35 whose catholic weekly review essentially went broke with the 
change to a market economy 
this summer malachowski is one of 15 eastern european 
journalists spending 10 weeks at american magazine like elle 
rolling stone business week family circle and esquire in an 
internship program sponsored by the us government and the 
magazines 
the interns seasoned journalists in their mid30s from 
bulgaria czechoslovakia east germany hungary poland and 
romania have come to the united states to learn how a free and 
competitive press works 
they have to learn to operate a magazine as a business says 
anne sutherland fuchs senior vice president and publisher of elle 
who organized the magazine industrys role in the internship 
program 
they havent been faced with circulation decisions 
subscriptionpricing decisions advertising rates everything 
has been dictated whether its the kind of paper they print on or 
how many copies they print she says 
its a whole different ballgame when its a free press 
sitting in his cubicle at elle magazine peter janos sos 41 
leafed through a copy of kepes 7 illustrated week in english the 
hungarian family weekly of which he is deputy editor in chief the 
first advertisement in the 60page magazine appeared on page 30 it 
promoted paving stones 
then he pulled an issue of elle toward him and turned the glossy 
pages filled with ads enticing the reader to buy expensive 
cosmetics designer clothing glamorous perfumes and chic 
accessories 
at first i thought the quality of advertisements is not the 
job of the editor but the job of the advertiser says sos a 
burly man who chooses his english words carefully i talked about 
it with anne fuchs and she said i would never take the 
advertisement of x here on the first pages because its not 
beautiful enough 
the eastern european journalists admire the sleek look of their 
host publications their advertising knowhow and technical 
expertise above all they admire the huge sums of money that go 
into making the magazines they are also fiercely proud of their 
magazines at home but this pride goes hand in hand with a deep 
frustration about their financial and technical limitations 
gyorgyi kocsis 36 an intern at business week helped found a 
weekly economic magazine 12 years ago in budapest hungary that 
broke new ground in uptodate critical reporting at a time when 
most publications were mouthpieces for the government 
hvg the hungarian initials for world economy weekly became a 
very popular quality magazine in hungary says ms kocsis but in 
the last two years she adds as new newspapers and magazines hit 
the market it lost 15 percent of its readership and suffered an 
identity crisis 
she pointed on her cluttered desk at business week to a recent 
issue of her magazine the cover shows pieces of paper representing 
stock shares coming out of factory chimneys the illustration is in 
black and white and the paper on which it is printed is rough 
some of our ideas on the cover gags pictures can be on any 
world magazine but i have to look with a looking glass because the 
printing is so awful says ms kocsis hvgs look suffers badly 
in comparison to all the beautiful magazines on the newsstand 
here 
suddenly unable to contain her frustration she gestures toward 
her magazine and exclaims now i hate it 
but as the eastern european magazines get slicker and fatter 
with advertisements and censorship becomes a thing of the past 
even journalists who are ardent supporters of a freemarket economy 
feel a bittersweet twinge as their old world collapses 
the family business atmosphere at hvg probably will 
disappear ms kocsis says wistfully 
probably it will be more professional and big and sort of 
westernized we will lose this feeling we are going to be news 
factory which can be good and useful and profiting but probably 
we will lose this friendly atmosphere i think but we have to grow 
up 
malachowski an intern at family circle recently lost his job 
as a top editor at the catholic weekly review in warsaw poland as 
the only independent newspaper tolerated by the communist party 
its coverage of politics and social issues was very influential he 
says 
today the catholic church trying to cope in a freemarket 
economy and pay its bills has let the weekly become a slim 
pamphlet on religious affairs malachowski says 
we always treated our press as a sort of art piece and now we 
must start to think about this as a sort of product says 
malachowski whose wirerimmed glasses and tweed jacket reinforce 
his professorial air 
anyway he adds people arent as interested in art any more 
poetry he notes thrived in the 1960s and 1970s in poland when 
government censorship was extremely strict 
the problem is that today you have no censorship but much 
less people are interested in poetry he says a new generation 
thinks about commercial things about houses cars about normal 
things as they are in the whole western world 
the condition of the economy in poland gives us an absolutely 
new situation says malachowski the press is financially 
bankrupt it is difficult to survive with magazines and papers we 
need to see the average american paper or magazine to find out how 
it works 
american knowhow goes a long way but it doesnt translate 
directly into hard currency the survival of eastern european 
magazines and newspapers also depends on western companies 
investing capital in them hvg kepes 7 and mlady svet the largest 
weekly in czechoslovakia all have made deals with foreign 
companies or are close to doing so 
mlady svet the young word in english takes three weeks to 
produce complains marek hlavica 28 an editor at the weekly he 
also is a singer and harmonica player and is spending his 
internship at rolling stone magazine 
if his magazine founded by the youth group of the communist 
party is to stay ahead of its growing pack of competitors he 
says it needs an infusion of money from foreign investors to

polands noble families dispersed around 
the world or reduced to cramped walkups in their native land have 
have little but memories of their once elegant estates 
most of the landed gentrys homes have been destroyed since the 
communists nationalized their property in the late 1940s 
now with the communist regime gone a lastchance effort is 
afoot to preserve the remaining historic manors either by 
returning them to their former owners or finding new ones 
ludwika sobanskatyszkiewiczowa born to one of polands noblest 
families and married to another remembers the vast estate of her 
birth in the ukraine at age 2 she played with nuts on the floor 
as the bolshevik revolution of 1917 raged outside the sandbagged 
windows 
as a newlywed on the eve of world war ii she moved to her 
husbands manor in eastern poland within a year she was swimming 
the river outside with her baby strapped to her back and the red 
army in pursuit 
equally vivid are recollections of the carefree opulence of 
those years between the wars when the lawns and ballroom of the 
family palace at guzow outside warsaw was filled with polands 
dignitaries 
with a wistfulness echoed even by poles of common birth mrs 
sobanska lingers on the memory of her familys dwory manor 
houses of the selfsufficient estates on which rural polands 
social and economic system was based for four centuries 
dwory were administrative centers for the surrounding farmland 
warehouses and mills some were palaces others large farmhouses 
they were built in tune with the vacillating fortunes of polands 
passionately nationalist clannish and independent nobility which 
was 10 percent of the population in the 16th century and among 
europes largest through the 18th century 
of mrs sobanskas properties in poland guzow and a warsaw 
mansion still stand but they no longer belong to her what did not 
succumb to war or shifting borders was taken by the new communist 
state 
stately homes of polands muchromanticized gentry became the 
orphanages and factory headquarters of peoples poland farmland 
was divided among the peasants 
without money for proper upkeep dwory fell to ruin and were 
abandoned with tragic consequences to the nations cultural 
heritage 
fortyfive years later little remains of the estimated 20000 
historic homes that survived world war ii only about 2000 are 
salvageable 
nostalgia the desire to right wrongs and capitalist zeal for a 
good bargain propel the preservation effort 
former owners may apply to reclaim their properties the culture 
ministry and the postcommunist eras first private real estate 
companies also are hunting new buyers 
what is happening in poland now offers great hope for 
monuments said tadeusz zielinewicz the ministrys chief 
building conservator we conservators have always been saying the 
best way of protecting a monument is a good use a good owner the 
state was not such a good owner 
in many ways it is painful work 
it has all turned into ruin mrs sobanska said after a 
recent tour of the palace at guzow 25 miles east of warsaw now 
headquarters for an adjacent sugar beet factory it will be too 
late for me but maybe someone from my family can invest 
pravin shah a jeans merchant from wales stood somberly before 
the decaying facade and boardedup windows of a manor in zdunowo 
it makes me sad to see something so beautiful standing there 
waiting said shah who is looking over polish manors in search 
of an investment 
grass covered the sweeping drive and sewage choked the 
ornamental ponds sunlight filtering through a hole in the roof 
touched the few bits of ornamental plaster still in place 
the manor was used as an agricultural school then abandoned for 
a decade and a young polish architect bought it for a song two 
years ago 
he wants to make it into a 55room hotel and restaurant just 45 
minutes north of the capital but needs 25 million janusz 
lipinski cofounder of polands first real estate agency korona 
is looking for a western investor who sees the potential in a 
country so short of tourist accommodations 
lipinski has 100 or more applications from families seeking to 
buy back homes that were nationalized after the war parliament is 
working out favorable terms but most families dont have enough 
money 
this reprivatization of homes as opposed to farmland is 
encouraged by many people who harbor a deep respect for the 
stratified society of polands past glory despite four decades of 
communism the names of aristocratic polish families are easily 
recalled 
in july when princess klaudia sanguszko visited the family 
estate near tarnow in southeastern poland former servants lined up 
to meet her and the town council made her son called the young 
prince by newspapers an honorary citizen 
purchases by foreigners are more controversial and few have come 
to fruition members of parliament nervous about polands being 
bought out especially by a united germany next door voted 
last month to prohibit sales of stateowned property to foreigners 
longterm leases are allowed and privately owned tracts of land 
can be sold with interior ministry permission jointventure 
companies also can buy 
joanna onyskiewicz lipinskis partner in the korona agency is 
adamant about bringing commercial viability to polands historic 
properties 
we have no other chance in a country where the kitty is 
empty to save our heritage ourselves she said 
low prices are a large part of the lure a manor in rundown 
condition can sell for as little as 1000 
korona offers a 10room country house with surrounding gardens 
that could be remodeled as a small hotel for a modest total 
investment of 250000 
there is the stuff of dreams a gutted 36bedroom palace from 
the early 18th century on 30 acres of parks that once were 
landscaped the rubber industry institute will sell it for 200000 
falling in love with a polish dwor is just the beginning 
buyers face a fantastic amount of red tape lipinski said 
you have to be patient in poland 
both initial questions who is the owner and how much does it 
cost require detective work in the infamous bureaucratic maze 
some properties are governmentowned with a state industry as a 
longterm tenant 
buyers also face the daunting task of a complete renovation 
from water pipes to roof in a nation short of building materials 
strict rules for historical restoration must be followed 
an ugly polluting industry may have been built nearby lupinski 
said sighing over a paint factory beside a moated 15th century 
castle 
it is a pleasure to work with these buildings but so 
depressing to see their situation he said then pointed at the 
crumbling lifeless zdunowo mansion and added that from 45 years 
of communism

karl otto poehl president of the 
mighty bundesbank is supervising the painful transformation of 
east germany into part of a capitalist state 
he assumed the job with reluctance but appears to be the right 
man for it 
with a keen sense of politics the man in charge of west 
germanys central bank swept his doubts aside and accepted the role 
thrust on him by chancellor helmut kohls decision to unite the two 
germanys more quickly than anticipated 
only days before kohl announced his plans for monetary union of 
west and east germany poehl still spoke of it cautiously as 
something that would take at least a year 
insiders say poehl was furious over kohls failure to consult 
him but the banker saw quickly which way the political weathervane 
pointed he accepted kohls decision and the west german mark 
became east germanys currency july 1 
during the monetary union poehl the politician had no trouble 
silencing poehl the economist said der spiegel the west german 
news magazine 
when the government and public opinion wanted monetary union 
poehl could not play the role of a nagging accountant it said 
poehl opposed to a 11 exchange rate of east and west marks 
succeeded in persuading the government to limit the amount that 
could be exchanged at the generous rate 
the government went along with many of his suggestions and the 
bundesbank is now firmly in control of the monetary policy 
warren oliver an economist in london said in a telephone 
interview 
east germany surrendered its monetary sovereignty to the 
bundesbank 
as guardian of the stability of the west german mark one of the 
worlds most powerful currencies poehl was concerned about the 
possible inflationary effect of giving east germanys hungry 
consumers 25 billion marks 156 billion overnight 
keeping inflation in check has been one of poehls primary jobs 
since becoming president of the central bank in january 1980 
inflation is one of the worst economic ills to germans because 
the weimar republics worthless currency contributed to the rise of 
adolf hitler 
bundesbank autonomy is guaranteed by the constitution but the 
government chooses its president the chancellor gave poehl a 
second eightyear term in 1987 even though the banker belongs to 
the leftleaning social democratic party the opposition to kohls 
centerright government 
the central bank presidency is the bestpaying government 
position in germany 600000 marks a year or 375000 
some officials in the more conservative wing of kohls coalition 
wanted poehl replaced but could find no one with his experience and 
international reputation 
analysts agree the strength of the mark would have suffered if 
poehl had not been reappointed 
poehl 60 years old and slightly stocky is the longestserving 
central bank chief in the seven leading industrialized nations and 
oliver said the most successful central banker of the last 
decade a word from poehl is enough to move world financial 
markets 
from the sprawling bundesbank headquarters on the outskirts of 
frankfurt poehl travels regularly to washington and other world 
capitals he also is a ranking officer of the international 
monetary fund 
he was born dec 1 1929 in hanover and earned an economics 
degree in 1955 in seven years as an economics journalist for 
several publications and radio stations he built good personal 
relations with important officials 
after joining the economics ministry in 1970 poehl became an 
adviser to chancellor willy brandt the next year and in 1972 the 
ministrys no 2 man 
while at the ministry he played important roles in freeing 
exchange rates and creating the european monetary system he joined 
the bundesbank as a vice president in 1977 three years before 
becoming its chief 
insiders say poehl is easygoing and relaxed at his job and once 
prepared himself for the washington heat by removing his tie and 
socks in the plane he is fluent in english loves to play golf and 
has a wit often laced with sarcasm 
he is said to have told table companions at a washington dinner 
well probably have to feed soviet soldiers now but luckily 
their living standard is lower than that of the americanut 380000 soviet 
soldiers are stationed in east 
germany 
oliver the london economist said poehl was regarded as 
collegial quite open he is very co 
soldiers abosmopolitan and is able to 
tolerate differences of style 
perhaps that comes from his journalistic background and 
journalists tend to go to him at big meetings because they know he 
has something to say oliver added the bundesbank is very 
successful in the public relations area 
poehl endorses a common european currency and european central 
bank in principle but has expressed doubts whether governments are 
ready to allow such a bank the necessary autonomy 
analysts say poehl would be a perfect choice to head a european 
central bank

joyce cutshall is consumed by a battle she 
can never win she thinks her daughter is dead but cant prove it 
she suspects she is buried nearby but cant find her 
she wants to bring her home but cant do it 
she has made that her mission taking the law into her own hands 
to find out what happened to her child fearful that jills case 
would sink deeper in police files the determined mother whod 
never touched a legal book started a petition drive forced a grand 
jury probe and prompted an arrest 
three years after jills disappearance joyce cutshall believes 
shes closer than ever to the truth a truth that will bring even 
greater agony 
i feel that this last chapter is going to be my absolutely 
most difficult she says its a very very strange feeling to 
work so hard toward something to know that at the end of it its 
going to bring as much grief and pain as a mother can feel 
this fall when david phelps 26 goes on trial on charges of 
kidnapping jill ms cutshall will be there hoping his words will 
lead to her daughters body knowing that even if she wins she 
loses the prospect is frightening yet comforting 
once i can put jill to rest in my own mind and have a place 
that i can go and visit her whenever im having a difficult day or 
feel the need to see her she says that will help me deal with 
the fact that i wont have a chance to hold her again 
for now she lives with memories how jill loved butter so much 
she ate it off the stick and mementos pictures of horses and 
hearts a note to the greatest mom in the world crayon 
drawings of the sun flowers and rainbows her symbol for the 
future and poems 
the world is a great round ball thing that is made by god 
jill wrote it has good things on it and bad things on it the 
world is great to me 
on aug 13 1987 9yearold jillian dee cutshall vanished from 
that world she so cherished 
she disappeared in norfolk where she was spending the summer 
with her father roger the cutshalls divorced in 1985 jill and 
her brother jeff lived in kansas with their mother 
jill her mother says feared staying in her fathers apartment 
house alone it was seedy noisy filled with transients so when 
he and his new wife left for work at 6 am she did her chores 
then walked to the baby sitters six blocks away 
that day she was last seen at 630 am on her sitters stoop 
where she normally waited until someone inside awoke 
jill had been repeatedly warned about strangers but the blonde 
blueeyed youngster just loved people her mother says she 
trusted them she always found something good in everybody even if 
they werent good 
after jills disappearance the fbi state and local police 
blitzed the area there were roadblocks doortodoor searches 
hundreds of interviews tens of thousands of posters flooded the 
country 
at first ms cutshall thought shed return in a week then 
months after the third month she says i emotionally and 
mentally was telling myself that if we work hard enough well have 
her back in a year 
a year passed no jill 
hope turned to heartache 
then in the fall of 1988 when ms cutshall 36 was attending a 
local college a journalism student gail pedersen interviewed her 
for a story ms pedersen revealed police had questioned her 
brother david phelps about jill 
phelps sister she says told her im not saying that he is 
guilty or innocent but she felt that it was a possibility 
that he in some way was connected to her disappearance 
ms pedersen also claimed her brother sexually abused a little 
girl when he was a teen 
phelps and a man once imprisoned for sexual assault kermit 
baumgartner lived together in the same building as roger cutshall 
the summer of 1987 both reportedly met jill then police had 
interviewed both men 
roy stephens a private investigator on the case since the 
beginning pursued the lead too knowing his own secret a 1976 
prison stint for burglary could be revealed and he could be 
blackmailed 
ive put everything on the line for jill says stephens who 
last year made public his past returning the detectives license 
he falsely obtained 
the burly bearded investigtor believed his own history gave him 
an edge i know both sides of the law he says in january 
1989 stephens drove phelps to the wildlife refuge where a hunter 
discovered jills clothes in late 1987 
he handed him a shovel he asked him to help find jill 
all he keeps saying is i dont know anything stephens 
recalls i keep saying you do 
stephens accompanied by a partner says he then fired a gun in 
the air frustration he says not a threat he claims phelps led 
them to a nearby cemetery dug in one spot then told him he and 
baumgartner had taken jill to the refuge and even described her 
clothes and underwear 
stephens had phelps repeat his statement to an omaha tv crew he 
had waiting nearby the investigator says he didnt go to the 
police fearing theyd reject the information 
in that interview later broadcast on 60 minutes phelps 
described how kermit got a nervous jill out of the car kermit 
kept his hand on her mouth and started fondling her and stuff he 
said i got real nervous and said hey lets get the hell out 
of here and kermit says well then you take the car back into 
town and ill get back later and i left 
baumgartner who lives in california has repeatedly denied 
wrongdoing he claims phelps was trying to cover his tracks 
when police questioned phelps he recanted claiming his 
statements were made under duress no body no confession no 
charges 
david phelps was a free man he soon left town 
so did baumgartner whod also been questioned by authorities 
i was empty ms cutshall recalls in hushed tones 
whatever there is inside of me that says i need to fight i 
need to go on that was gone 
shed lost her faith too in the policethere were major 
screwups she says 
norfolk police chief bill mizner disagrees noting thousands of 
hours were spent interviewing hundreds of people and pursuing leads 
in several states 
there was some outstanding police work done in this 
investigation he says it is by far the longest most indepth 
case that the police division here has ever faced and by far the 
most frustrating case 
last summer when mizner placed jills case on semiactive 
status ms cutshall was outraged 
if you cannot rely on people that youre supposed to be able 
to rely on to do the job i guess the old adage is do it 
yourself

she began 
ms cutshall discovered that under nebraska law authorities had 
to convene a grand jury if presented with petitions from at least 
10 percent of county voters participating in the last gubernatorial 
election 
in december while others shopped for christmas gifts she 
collected signatures while the local mall was being decorated she 
was setting up a table and banner reading jill cutshall needs a 
grand jury 
a dozen volunteers gathered signatures at the mall and braved 
blizzards to collect more in doortodoor visits petitions were 
presented to authorities on feb 20 the day after jills birthday 
my gift to her her mother says 
authorities she says certified 1471 signatures hundreds more 
than needed 
ms cutshall downplays her doggedness saying i dont have 
anything extra the only thing i have is the love for my daughter 
in june a grand jury indicted phelps on charges of abduction 
with intent to commit sexual assault last month he returned to 
nebraska from iowa and pleaded innocent hes being held on 
100000 bond 
baumgartner wasnt charged special prosecutor james smith said 
one problem was getting him back to nebraska to testify before a 
grand jury hed already made consistent statements to authorities 
its not as if they didnt know what the guys story was 
anyhow smith says 
stephens who keeps a picture of jill on his desk says he wont 
rest until he finds her he heads investigations for the missing 
youth foundation a nonprofit group founded after jills 
disappearance that boasts of having brought home 17 children since 
january 1989 
ms cutshall meanwhile hopes the nov 5 trial will help her 
and jeff 14 start over 
jeff who saw himself as jills protector has endured his own 
hell with schoolmates taunts of we know where your sister is 
he even talked of suicide 
for a year after jills disappearance joyce cutshall wrote her 
letters part of the first one seems prophetic 
there is a part of me that is gone i hope you are doing ok 
sweet pea she wrote i know you feel inside how special you 
are to me i could never ask for a better daughter than the one im 
blessed with if i cant find you soon im afraid ill never see 
you again 
three year later joyce cutshalls heart still needs to convince 
her head 
i absolutely have to be able to have her in a place where i 
can make that contact with her she says until i can do this 
theres a chance shes still alive thats my mothers side shes 
out there lost waiting to be found i cant quit doing this until i 
can find her and bring her back

compensation for lung cancer and other respiratory ailiments caused 
by asbestos 
this litigation is too diffuse to expect that all parties and 
all state courts will consent to a mandatory class action said 
andrew berry a newark nj attorney representing several 
defendants 
in the first move toward a class action lawsuit us district 
judge jack b weinstein on monday ordered hearings to determine 
whether eaglepicher industries inc can settle 65000 pending 
claims in a single case 
weinstein also endorsed combining the manville trust the 
nations largest asbestos claims resolution system with money 
from other defendant companies into a national fund that would 
apportion compensation on the basis of need 
the action followed an unusual joint order friday by 10 federal 
judges from around the country who were frustrated by clogged court 
dockets mounting claims and resolution so slow that many asbestos 
victims die before they are paid 
we have got to pay these people who are entitled to be paid 
and we have to reduce the costs weinstein told a crowded hearing 
in us district court in brooklyn 
weinstein and the nine other federal judges approved a 
threetiered plan for resolving about 90000 lawsuits pending in 
state and federal courts nationwide 
thousands of new lawsuits are filed monthly and legal experts 
estimate hundreds of thousands more cases will be made judges have 
complained that legal costs are siphoning away twothirds of the 
money earmarked for victims 
under the plan weinstein would handle a class action involving 
eaglepicher and up to five more companies that dont have the 
money to fight cases in court or pay present and future claims 
before the case can proceed the court must determine the 
defendants lack resources 
weinsteins case is expected to include the manville trust 
which was formed in 1988 six years after manville corp was forced 
into bankruptcy court protection under the weight of asbestos 
claims 
in part two of the plan thomas d lambros chief judge of 
federal district for northern ohio would attempt to fashion a 
single outofcourt settlement of asbestos claims 
finally us district judge robert parker chief judge of the 
eastern federal district of texas would supervise a classaction 
trial for defendants unwilling or unable to reach settlements 
the movement to reform asbestos litigation gained momentum 
earlier this year when the manville trust announced it had run out 
of money for new claimants and said others wouldnt get money until 
well into the 21st century 
most claimants inhaled asbestos which was used widely for 
insulation while working in shipyards and factories as long ago as 
the 1930s 
judges complain that the same issues are argued over and over 
leading to millions in expenses that might otherwise be used to pay 
victims frivolous claims high fees charged by plaintiffs lawyers 
and a refusal by some defendants to settle also have been 
criticized 
but some attorneys oppose the judges plan saying the issue is 
too complex for a single national solution they predicted a 
breakdown in current settlement talks and timeconsuming court 
appeals that would further delay compensation payments 
if we dont have something available to the victims for the 
next three four five years it takes to establish a national class 
action that would be a disaster to the victim gene locks a 
philadelphia plaintiffs lawyer told weinstein 
in the eaglepicher case weinstein appointed former federal 
judge marvin e frankel to hold hearings on whether the company 
lacks resources so it can qualify for a class action all plaintiffs 
would be required to join 
weinstein who devised a national settlement for vietnam 
warrelated injuries from the defoliant agent orange said hearings 
would open wednesday and promised they would conclude within three 
weeks 
i do not intend that in this court victims wait eight years 
before they get compensation he said this will not be a 
manville reorganization 
eaglepicher based in cincinnati said in court papers it spent 
1197 million on litigation last year and is being named in 2000 
new lawsuits a month

united parcel service of america inc 
wasted no time letting customers know it was business as usual 
after the teamsters union announced its truck drivers and package 
handlers had ratified a new threeyear contract 
ups account executives started calling or visiting the companys 
11 million daily pickup customers monday to tell them the news 
said ups spokesman ken sternad delivery drivers will start handing 
out notices to delivery customers today 
a strike threat that had surfaced during the negotiations forced 
ups customers and competitors to come up with alternate delivery 
plans and sternad said it was too early to determine what effect 
that would have on business 
were going to offer the same service we always have and 
hopefully that will be enough to convince anybody that may have 
held off during this period that theyll stay with us he said 
some customers had begun shifting their business to the us 
postal service or roadway package system inc of pittsburgh 
upss two main grounddelivery competitors 
union members voted 65463 to 53091 in favor of the contract 
or 55 percent to 45 percent teamsters president william j 
mccarthy said monday in a statement from union headquarters in 
washington 
about 146000 ups workers nationwide are covered by the 
contract which is retroactive to aug 1 
the contract includes a onetime 1000 bonus to fulltime 
workers hourly wage increases totalling 150 an hour over three 
years and increased company contributions to health benefits 
mccarthy did not say what provisions the union leadership found 
inadequate repeated telephone calls to his office were not 
returned 
in his statement mccarthy charged that greenwichbased ups 
went to unprecedented lengths to win ratification 
in the final outcome i believe that many of the companys 
employees were frightened by managements ability to use permanent 
replacement workers or scabs in the possible event of a strike 
mccarthy said 
ups said last week that it did not plan to hire replacement 
workers company spokesman ken sternad said he wouldnt comment on 
mccarthys assertions 
the bottom line is we made what we felt was a good offer and 
it was accepted sternad said all the other words are 
unnecessary 
teamsters officials began counting ballots friday and ups 
officials spent the weekend awaiting results the union had asked 
for a 10day extension to gather the ballots just before the old 
contract expired july 31 
the teamsters had agreed friday to go back to the bargaining 
table if the contract was rejected despite a threat of a 
nationwide strike early in the negotiations sternad said 
ups the worlds largest package handler delivers more than 10 
million packages a day and made 28 billion deliveries in 1989 for 
124 billion in revenue its total work force is 230000 
the contract will increase the hourly wage for the highest paid 
workers from 1610 an hour to 1760 an hour by august 1992 the 
contract also calls for a costofliving allowance of up to 20 
cents an hour per year depending on inflation sternad said 
parttime workers who start at 8 or 9 an hour will also 
receive an additional 150 hour over three years sternad said 
company contributions for health benefits and employees 
pensions will increase from an average of 8300 a year for 
fulltime workers to an average of 10500 during the life of the 
contract sternad said 
the proposal also includes the bonus to be paid within the 
first month of ratification of 1000 to fulltimers and 500 to 
parttimers he said 
improvements to working conditions in the contract include 
replacement of wornout truck seats with more comfortable 
airsuspension seats and easiertohandle dollies 
the contract affects only us workers ups has 12000 to 13000 
employees outside the united states sternad said 
there has never been a national strike against ups which has 
had a national teamsters contract since 1979 but sporadic work 
stoppages and strikes have occurred regionally 
the latest and biggest was in 1976 when 18000 workers in 15 
northeast states walked out for 13 weeks

the united states should be prepared to draw on 
its emergency oil reserves even if oilproducing countries increase 
their output during the persian gulf crisis an industry official 
said 
the president of the american petroleum institute charles j 
dibona said monday there is no immediate pressure to release the 
stockpile but that could change and we should be prepared to do 
that 
the white house said late last week it had no plans to open the 
reserve which is in caverns in louisiana and texas but dibona 
said the turmoil in the world oil markets is clearly the kind of 
circumstance for which the oil reserve was designed 
meanwhile the saudi ambassador to the united states prince 
bandar bin sultan said members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries are planning a meeting to consider their 
response to oil shortages since the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
saudi arabia a key gulf producer has indicated a willingness 
to help dibona said so has venezuela and to the extent they 
do they will largely make up the 4 million barrel per day 
shortfall however no one can know at this point what the net 
effect on world oil supplies will be 
the price for west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude 
rose to 2677 per 42gallon barrel monday on the new york 
mercantile exchange trading was halted early because of a power 
failure in lower manhattan 
earlier bandar said the saudis would like to have a stable 
and predictable market for oil 
at the most recent opec meeting which concluded in geneva 
switzerland july 27 the 13 opec ministers raised the target price 
3 to 21 a barrel they also agreed not to puncture the production 
ceiling of 225 million barrels a day until the end of the year 
earlier this year the price declined to the low 16 range 
partly because crude output by opec and other producers was 
outpacing world demand prices began rising earlier this summer 
after the cartel reached an agreement to restrain production they 
shot sharply higher after the invasion of kuwait on speculation 
that iraq might attack other vital oil producers in the region 
such as saudi arabia 
the emergency stockpile of oil called the strategic petroleum 
reserve was established after the oil crises of the 1970s it 
contains some 590 million barrels of crude that could be 
distributed at a rate of up to 35 million barrels per day 
according to the energy department 
robert c porter a spokesman in washington for the strategic 
petroleum reserve program said it would take about two weeks for an 
oil sale to be made once a presidential order came in 
right now we are on a higher alert level porter said 
the reserve is always on a stage of readiness but when you get a 
situation like this you make sure you are ready and we are 
a trader with merrill lynch energy futures peter beutel said 
the opec nations could make up for the shortfall without too much 
difficulty so he did not believe it was time to get into the 
strategic reserve 
dibona also said the government could lessen the impact of 
mideast supply disruptions by opening up production at more 
offshore oil fields 
he called on the government to open the point arguello oilfield 
off the california coast which he said is sitting idle because 
state officials have not given oil companies permission to deliver 
their oil the field could immediately produce 90000 barrels per 
day but it has been kept on hold because of environmental 
concerns dibona said 
more crude also could be produced in alaska if environmental 
restrictions were lifted he said

the pentagon will be getting fewer hightech 
weapons of the sea the seawolf submarine and the arleigh burke 
destroyer in line with cuts ordered by defense secretary dick 
cheney 
in an attempt to save 7 billion over the next four fiscal 
years cheney ordered slowdowns in the production rates of the two 
hightech vessels on monday 
a slower production rate for the submarine will cut one ship and 
some advance purchased material from next years budget resulting 
in a savings of 18 billion 
plans had called for buying 10 of the submarines every three 
years instead the pentagon will reduce the purchase to three 
ships every two years according to a statement released at the 
pentagon 
cheney ordered that only four destroyers be purchased every year 
instead of five or six that means the pentagon will buy 16 ships 
from fiscal 1991 through fiscal 1994 instead of the 25 originally 
planned for a savings of 5 billion 
overall the changes in the two programs are designed to save 
22 billion in the budget that is now before congress and 7 
billion in the pentagons spending plan for the fiscal years 1991 
through 1994 the pentagons statement said 
the reductions can be made because of the lessened soviet 
threat but the crisis in the persian gulf reveals the need for an 
uptodate navy the secretary said in a statement 
there is little doubt that the recent events in the soviet 
union and eastern europe have altered the social and political 
makeup of the world and our ongoing planning assessments are based 
on the increased prospects for reduced world tensions cheney 
said however current events remind us of how fragile world 
peace can be therefore we continue to require a superior naval 
force to maintain free and open use of the seas 
the review was one of several cheney has ordered for most of the 
pentagons major weapons programs given the nations budget woes 
following a similar review of aircraft in april the secretary 
slashed his request for b2 stealth bombers from 132 to 75 
the statement said the pentagons original plan for the seawolf 
called for maintaining a force of 100 attack submarines but that 
the size of the navys overall submarine force is still being 
considered 
the submarines designed by the newport news shipbuilding co 
of virginia and electric boat division of general dynamics in 
connecticut are slated to take the place of the services los 
angelesclass attack boats 
the nuclearpowered sub had been devised to counter what the 
pentagon saw as the rapidly improving capabilities of the soviet 
navy 
the burkeclass destroyer is designed to operate in carrier 
battle groups it carries the aegis radar and weapons systems 
which allow it to track and guide weapons to destroy multiple 
targets at any one time 
cheney said purchasing fewer of the vessels will allow the 
destroyers fighting capabilities to be upgraded through improving 
its electronics and antisubmarine weaponry 
the changes will mean one less destroyer in fiscal 1991 
resulting in a net savings of 407 million the statement said 
rep john dingell dmich has been highly critical in recent 
months of the destroyer which is built by bath iron works of bath 
maine 
dingell the chairman of the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on oversight and investigations has questioned the 
survivability of the ship and the aegis system against missile 
attack 
dingell has alleged that the navys contract with bath is a 
procurement nightmare of fraud and abuse 
the destroyer is called the arleigh burke class after the world 
war ii naval hero and former chief of naval operations

gl mcleland figures he drove about a million 
miles during his 33year career as a traveling salesman but hes 
staying put this summer 
im pulling in my oars for a little while the retired 
oklahoma city man said i had some trips planned but now im 
just going to sit and wait a month or two see how things come 
out 
rising gas prices falling stocks and the middle east standoff 
have led many wouldbe travelers to reconsider their vacation 
plans industry experts said monday 
consumers are taking a waitandsee attitude said diane 
polomski a spokeswoman for american express travel related 
services inc in new york people still want to travel but 
they are being more cautious now 
travelers with reservations in middle eastern countries are 
anxious about whether iraqs saddam hussein will withdraw from 
kuwait or make a grab for more territory 
and domestic tourists afraid that the nations economy might be 
heading into a tailspin are reluctantly considering whether their 
leisure trips should take a back seat to necessities 
no ones sure if this is a recession said suzanne cook 
executive director of the us travel data center in washington 
but if consumers feel squeezed in terms of their financial 
situation they have to make some decisions 
at least in some us regions travel has been coming up short 
officials warned that the final results werent in but by the 
end of june tourism was off at many popular destinations such as 
the grand canyon californias san diego zoo washingtons 
monuments and cape cod 
if people are worried about their jobs or increasing costs 
they have to put that into their thinking when making travel 
plans said deborah first acting director of the massachusetts 
office of travel and tourism 
they also have to think about safety thats why ticket agents 
and tourism officials representing greece israel and turkey have 
been receiving scores of calls from anxious travelers 
they want to be reassured but i dont know of any massive or 
largescale cancellations said harvey cohen deputy director of 
the israel government tour office in new york 
similarly kamil muren of tusem tours international said he had 
received calls from clients leery of making trips to turkey but 
he said reassurances have been enough to avert cancellations in 
all but a few cases 
americans are loath to forgo their annual vacations its 
perhaps for that reason that business has remained constant or 
improved in some cases despite the softening economy and rising 
travel costs 
people are accustomed to traveling and they like it said 
jerry cheskie spokesman for the american automobile association in 
heathrow fla theyre more apt to postpone the purchase of 
bigticket items like tvs or refrigerators than travel plans 
people will cut their trips short stay closer to home and forgo 
luxury accommodations but even fears of recession arent likely to 
keep them from hitting the open road this summer tourism officials 
said 
robert and florice cohagen plan to drive from their home in 
columbus ohio to houston to visit relatives 
wed rather not spend the extra money but it isnt going to 
stop us said cohagen 72it might only be worse next year 
thats the kind of attitude recommended by richard rippe chief 
economist at dean witter reynolds inc in new york 
we will face for a time somewhat higher inflation as the oil 
prices are reflected in wholesale and consumer goods he said 
but a massive shift to saving rather than spending would 
only push the economy into a recession

people ate more apples last year than ever 
before despite bad publicity about chemicals used by growers and a 
slight decline in overall consumption of fresh fruit agriculture 
department figures show 
the departments economic research service said that a large 
crop and low prices combined to push per capita consumption of one 
of americas favorite fruits to 216 pounds in 1989 up from 1987 
pounds the previous year 
twenty years earlier the figures showed per capita apple 
consumption was just over 17 pounds the low mark in the 20year 
records was 1553 pounds in 1972 
apple growers feared the worst in march 1989 when the natural 
resources defense council said that apples treated with alar 
increased the risk of cancer in children several school districts 
banned apples apple growers responded with a media campaign 
bananas and apples continued to be the two most popular fresh 
fruits in the united states the agriculture department said 
banana consumption rose with heavier imports while fresh apple 
consumption reached a record 216 pounds due to the large crop and 
lower retail prices 
overall fresh fruit consumption dropped 2 percent last year to 
an average of 966 pounds per person that included citrus and 
noncitrus 
tighter domestic supplies of fresh market oranges caused an 18 
percent drop in per capita fresh orange consumption from 1988s 
154 pounds the report said 
similarly us consumption of fresh lemons tangelos and 
tangerines declined to tighter supplies it added lower 
consumption of these commodities combined with fresh orange 
consumption offset an increase in per capita consumption of fresh 
grapefruit and limes 
for fresh citrus as a group per capita use was a fouryear low 
of 244 pounds down from more than 271 pounds in 1988 
the per capita consumption of fresh noncitrus fruit rose to 
721 pounds in 1989 up only 1 percent from 1988 bananas at 2456 
pounds per capita edged apples in per capita use but apples 
showed a much sharper yeartoyear gain 
increased use of fresh apples bananas cherries kiwifruit 
mangoes pears pineapples and strawberries offset reduced 
consumption of fresh grapes nectarines papayas cranberries 
avocados apricots plums and prunes the report said 
although not in the big league of some of the more popular 
fruits a few other records were set last year for per capita 
consumption 
limes for example averaged 08 pound per capita up from 068 
in 1988 a record level the report showed also pineapples at 
195 pounds and strawberries 332 pounds showed record per 
capita consumption in 1989

provided by crew chiefs and labor contractors in april those 
totaled 203000 workers and in july 1989 they were estimated at 
351000

the nation the report said heavy rains and flooding were common 
in some areas 
winter wheat harvest was 77 percent complete two percentage 
points behind the fiveyear average the report said harvest 
was complete in kansas and oklahoma and nearly complete in texas

harvest continued ahead of normal in the mississippi delta and the 
southeast while the tobacco harvest progressed in georgia and 
north carolina 
melon harvest was active in the california san joaquin 
valley the report said in oregon broccoli lettuce and snap 
bean harvests were under way in the willamette valley raspberry 
blueberry cherry peach and vegetable harvests were active in

the agriculture department has issued another 
report about africanized bees to assure people that the killer 
bees of hollywood lore have a sting no worse than ordinary 
honeybees 
a usda scientist said that contrary to some peoples 
expectations the africanized bee has less venom than the ordinary 
us honeybee and the venom itself is no more potent 
but justin o schmidt of the departments agricultural research 
service said the africanized bees rally quickly and use more stings 
to repel an intruder 
people should steer clear of their nests he said these 
bees are extremely defensive when their nests are threatened 
department officials have been warning that the africanized 
honeybees which started migrating northward from brazil years ago 
are expected to enter the united states from mexico at any time 
schmidt works at the agencys bee research center in tucson 
ariz he said the chance of someone being severely injured by 
africanized honeybees is far less than the chance of being hit by 
lightning

the government has decreed a 9 
percent increase in fuel prices following a cutoff in oil purchases 
from iraq brazils main foreign supplier brazils leading tv 
network reported 
officials and observers have said in recent days that the rising 
price of oil on international markets caused by the iraqi invasion 
of kuwait had made a domestic increase inevitable 
the pump price of gasoline rose from 213 a gallon to 232 tv 
globo said 
the network said the price of pure alcohol fuel rose from 160 
a gallon to 174 it said 
alcohol fuel is subsidized by the government so it is cheaper 
for consumers than gasoline though production costs are actually 
twice as high about 45 million brazilian vehicles roughly 
onethird of the countrys total run on alcohol made from 
domestically grown sugar cane 
the retail price of diesel fuel kerosene and cooking gas also 
went up globo reported 
iraq was brazils top oil supplier before this south american 
giant adhered to unimposed sanctions including a ban on 
petroleum imports from iraq 
in 1989 brazil bought 146 billion in crude oil from iraq 
about 30 percent of total daily imports 
this country produces 665000 barrels of oil daily about 60 
percent of domestic needs 
mondays increase was the second this month fuel prices were 
sharply raised and then frozen march 15 when president fernando 
collor de mello decreed an economic austerity plan 
inflation has dropped sharply since march when prices soared 84 
percent but is still rising at a rate of about 10 percent a month 
economists say continued inflation combined with minimal price 
increases for fuel had resulted in gasoline and alcohol being 
underpriced by about 30 percent and 15 percent respectively

a drop in business will force usair group 
inc to furlough about 200 pilots by the end of the year and 
consider laying off other employees an airline spokeswoman said 
susan young on monday confirmed reports from the air line pilots 
association that the virginiabased carrier was planning the 
cutbacks 
i think its safe to say that the airlines traffic and the 
industrys traffic is flat she said we will not fly as much 
new service as originally planned in view of the state of the 
economy 
the pilots union told its members in a taperecorded telephone 
message that it learned of usairs plans last week in los angeles 
during a meeting with airline president seth schofield and other 
airline executives 
the message said schofield told the pilots master executive 
council that usair foresees a further decline in traffic and higher 
fuel prices 
the vice chairman of alpas master executive council chris 
beebe urged the pilots to adhere exactly to the wording in their 
contract and not to fly overtime 
ms young at the companys offices in arlington va 
acknowledged that business is slow usair group lost 1131 million 
in the first half of this year and has not posted a profit since 
the second quarter of 1989 
however ms young said the airline may have too many pilots for 
its fleet the excess could have resulted from older aircraft and 
rescheduling of aircraft deliveries she said 
twelve new jets had been scheduled for arrival this year but 
usair delayed taking delivery in an unusual costcutting move it 
also has tried to save money by paying less overtime to maintenance 
crews 
ms young said flight attendants and other unidentified employee 
groups also may be subject to furloughs she said she could not 
elaborate on the number of workers involved or when they might be 
laid off 
usair employs about 6300 pilots all of whom are members of the 
alpa ms young said the carrier has 55000 hourly and salaried 
employees about 12000 of whom work in the pittsburgh region

retail sales edged up a weak 01 percent in 
july their second straight monthly gain after three consecutive 
declines the government reported today 
the commerce department said sales rose a seasonally adjusted 
1495 billion last month up from 1494 billion in june 
the department also revised upward to 11 percent the june 
advance that originally was reported to have been just 05 percent 
it was the first gain since last january and followed declines of 
01 percent in may 10 percent in april and 04 percent in march 
sales were unchanged in february 
but the small july increase was certain to renew questions about 
whether the consumer would continue to help fuel the economy now 
approaching the end of its eighth year of expansion 
retail sales represent about half of consumer spending which

chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca 
confirmed today that the struggling automaker had talked with three 
major european companies but added he didnt expect the discussions 
to result in a full merger 
speculation in europe and the united states suggested that 
italys fiat group would buy a stake in chrysler the no 3 us 
automaker while iacocca said no such equity arrangement is 
imminent he added that it is possible in the next decade 
no i wouldnt want to predict that today maybe in the year 
2000 iacocca said given the way things have evolved in the 
last 20 years you might see some giant mergers but i doubt that 
i doubt any full merger talk 
iacocca said chrysler had talked with renault of france volvo 
of sweden and fiat but he refused to give specifics 
everybodys talking to everybody he said i think over 
time everybodys going to need some kind of affiliation or a 
partnership 
the chairman answered questions as production of the redesigned 
1991 minivans began at chryslers assembly plant here across the 
river from detroit minivans account for a large portion of 
chryslers profits 
the company earned 71 million in the second quarter this year 
but is expected to show a loss in the third quarter largely 
because minivan plants in windsor and st louis mo shut down for 
a month to retool for new models 
chrysler has struggled this year with lagging sales and the loss 
of four top executives which prompted icacocca to delay his own 
retirement plans during national contract talks chrysler 
negotiators have floated the ideas of partial employee ownership 
as well as establishing a multicompany health care plan

oilproducing countries could 
establish new pricing and production levels by the end of the week 
if agreements are reached at an emergency opec meeting president 
carlos andres perez said tuesday 
opec members saudi arabia and venezuela plan to propose that 
production be increased if necessary to avoid a world oil shortage 
perez said at a press conference 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries are 
planning an emergency session but the date and location have yet 
to be announced 
president bush in a phone conversation with perez on monday 
repeated a plea for venezuela to increase production by 500000 
barrels daily 
but venezuela while eager to provide the extra oil has been 
holding out for an opec accord on how to replace the 4 million 
barrels of oil production blocked by iraqs invasion of kuwait 
venezuela normally sells about half its daily twomillion barrel 
production to the united states representing about 11 percent of 
americas oil supply 
many assume that venezuela would also sell most of its 
additional oil to the united states but perez has denied making a 
specific agreement to do so our principal consumer is the united 
states we have an obligation to them but we cant be the only 
ones to give perez said 
he said regular production of an extra 500000 barrels could 
damage machinery venezuela is seeking american investment to 
expand its oil industry with an aim of producing 35 million 
barrels daily 
analysts here estimate that the current world supply should hold 
out another two to three months 
perez said that he and his foreign minister reinaldo figueredo 
have been in daily contact with opec as well with presidents of 
oilproducers mexico and ecuador 
saudi arabia venezuela and other oilproducing countries are 
against drastic price rises arguing that they would suffer the 
consequences later perez said

stocks and bonds fell while oil and gold climbed 
today as traders refocused attention on turmoil in the middle east 
and sought to escape the effects of a serious wall street power 
failure 
but remnants remained of the freak monday outage that waylaid 
the nations financial center and forced thousands of workers to 
evacuate powerless skyscrapers on a sultry august afternoon 
the consolidated edison utility said it could take days to 
restore power to portions of the area in southern manhattan blacked 
out by a substation fire 
the american stock exchange and new york commodities markets 
reopened this morning but hundreds of commercial customers 
including some major investment firms were forced to scramble to 
function with a semblance of normality some such as county natwest 
usa turned hotel rooms into makeshift trading desks 
the outage also impeded the ability of some financial 
information gathering services to transmit data on commodities 
futures and options 
but the financial worlds main focus returned to its 
preoccupation before the freak outage iraqs destabilizing 
influence over world oil supplies 
stock and bond prices drifted lower and the dow jones industrial 
average of 30 bluechip stocks was down about 5 points to the 2741 
level around noontime in oil trading west texas intermediate 
crude contracts for september jumped 77 cents to 27 a barrel on 
the new york mercantile exchange traders called the rise a 
reaction to signs that the effects of a cutoff of kuwaiti and iraqi 
oil are beginning to be felt in the united states which imports 
half its oil 
were seeing indications that marginal imports might go 
elsewhere or stay at home said john hill a broker with merrill 
lynch energy futures in new york 
oils rise continued to push up gold prices which surged over 
the 400 an ounce level monday to a fivemonth high a reflection 
of anxiety over higher inflation gold traded at 411 an ounce in 
london today up from 40460 late monday 
american stock exchange spokesman bob shabazian said power was 
restored by late afternoon monday and that trading resumed at the 
normal 930 am edt opening today 
he said two standby generators parked outside the amex building 
on flatbed tractortrailers were ready to be tapped in case the 
exchange suffered another outage 
shabazian also said the amex was treating monday as an official 
trading day and had calculated closing prices for all listed 
stocks many of which continued to trade on other exchanges after 
the amex closed prematurely 
based on the recalculations he said the amex index fell 132 
monday to 33800 vs 33814 when power failed shortly after 1 pm 
monday volume for the day totaled 975 million shares vs a 
normal full day of about 14 million 
closing prices are important in securities and commodities 
trading because investors place buy or sell orders based partly on 
what the previous days price is 
on the new york commodity exchange trading resumed 30 minutes 
late this morning for gold and silver on the new york mercantile 
exchange trading resumed about two hours later than normal 
unlike the amex the comex and mercantile exchange were treating 
todays trading as a continuation of the monday session and based 
opening prices on fridays close unfilled orders at the time power 
failed were deleted 
the disruptions in trading caused by the fire at a con edison 
power substation added to the pressure bearing on the markets since 
iraqs invasion of kuwait aug 2 oil prices were rising sharply 
when trading shut down on the new york merc a key market for 
petroleum 
the dow jones industrial average rose 3020 points monday to 
274678 but the broader market for stocks was mixed and trading 
was light because of the power outage

million or 74 cents per share in the same period in 1989 
revenue rose 4 percent to 383 billion from 367 billion a

retailer is temporarily giving up some volume in conservative 
womens sportswear without the economic slowdown howell said

the us government has agreed to investigate 
charges that imported chinese sparklers are being sold in the 
united states at less than fair value 
the international trade commission said it ruled 40 monday that 
there is reason to believe the chinese imports theaten material 
damage to the domestic sparkler industry that means the commerce 
department will open an antidumping investigation and hold 
hearings 
the departments preliminary findings due by dec 10 could 
lead to possible import duties on the chinese sparklers equal to 
the amount of underpricing deemed unfair the commission said 
two of the three us sparkler makers elkton sparkler co of 
north east md and diamond sparkler co of youngstown ohio 
petitioned for the investigation 
government figures show that starting in 1988 chinese imports 
captured more than half of the us market 
american companies made 148000 sparklers and had 535 percent 
of the market in 1987 compared to 94000 sparklers and 422 
percent in 1989 the commission said the chinese market share rose 
from 461 percent in 1987 to 573 last year while total usage

the end of the firms fiscal year nov 30 
the firm said its covice chairmen for the past three years 
robert e rubin and stephen friedman will share weinbergs titles 
after he retires 
naming a pair of executives to head a firm is becoming more 
common as the complexity of running businesses has escalated 
the accounting firm ernst amp young for instance named cochief 
executives william a grant and robert j kelly after the merger 
of the firms arthur young amp co and ernst amp whinney last year 
the media and entertainment giant time warner inc also is run 
by cochief executives steven j ross and nicholas j nicholas jr

whitehead retired and later became deputy secretary of state 
goldman sachs is one of the last major privately held investment 
firms on wall street and has about 6400 employees worldwide 
it ranked third among investment firms behind merrill lynch amp 
co and shearson lehman brothers in terms of capital at the start 
of the year according to the securities industry association 
the firm has established a solid reputation in mergers and 
acquisitions equity underwriting corporate advisory services 
trading and research 
weinberg cited both the pressures of the job and his desire to 
pursue private interests as reasons for his decision to step down 
from a post he called the greatest job in the world 
the senior partners position is a seven days a week 52 weeks 
a year responsibility and it requires a total commitment the 
pressures are often very intense he said in a statement 
weinberg said the firm is in excellent condition with a strong 
capital position and earnings running somewhat ahead of last years 
results he said its prospects for growth and development were 
bright 
during his tenure at the top of the firm weinberg said its 
annual profits rose about tenfold and its equity capital grew to 
23 billion from about 80 million at the end of 1976 
weinberg will continue as senior chairman of the firm 
responsible for client relationships and other unspecified 
activities 
in a joint statement rubin and friedman said they look 
forward to continuing on the course that we have set and followed 
together 
weinberg joined goldman sachs in 1950 and became a partner in 
1956 he was named senior partner and cochairman of the management 
committee in 1976

president bush temporarily turned his 
attention tuesday to work on a budget compromise white house aides 
say the disagreement with congress is becoming more urgent because 
of the mideast crisis 
the president interrupted his maine vacation for two days of 
washington work focused on the huge us effort to punish iraq for 
its invasion of kuwait his first order of business was a meeting 
with advisers on how the crisis could hurt the economy and the 
budget 
bush turned away reporters questions during a photo session at 
the start of his budget meeting the president was joined by his 
chief of staff john sununu and economic adviser michael boskin 
but treasury secretary nicholas brady and budget director richard 
darman did not attend 
the rapid increase in oil prices sparked by the iraqi aggression 
has the potential of tripping up an already weak economy and 
maintaining the huge us force in saudi arabia could add billions 
of dollars to the pentagons annual budget 
brady while not predicting a recession has said the slow 
growth rate of the american economy could fall closer to zero 
as the higher oil prices take full effect 
brady decided not to interrupt his own trip to take part in the 
talks brady a key member of the budget team was in the midwest 
on a twoday campaign swing for republican candidates 
meanwhile marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said 
we think its even more important that we reach an agreement now 
because there needs to be a unity of purpose in this country not 
only about the conflict in the gulf but also about our spending 
issues and about where the budget is going 
one of the many sticking points in the budget talks which are 
nearly four months old is the level of military spending bush 
requested 303 billion in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 but the 
senate has approved only 289 billion and the house armed services 
committee has endorsed a 283 billion budget 
the white house and congressional conservatives plan to use iraq 
as an argument for a larger military budget the budget talks will 
resume next month when congress returns from its summer recess 
bush has repeatedly expressed his frustration with the talks 
which he initiated in may the two sides are nowhere near an 
agreement despite bushs ending his no new taxes campaign 
pledge 
bush and the republicans have been criticized for suggesting 
higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and a proposal to limit the 
income tax deduction for state and local taxes the democrats 
meanwhile refrained from putting forward any substantive budget 
proposals until after the recess 
the president last week indicated he would step up his 
rhetorical attacks on the democrats but refrained at the time 
because it coincided with his ordering of us troops to the middle 
east 
the goal of the talks is to reduce the federal deficit at least 
50 billion in fiscal 1991 more than has been accomplished in any 
previous budget pact 
even if that were accomplished the spending plan would not meet 
the mandate of the grammrudman budget law that law calls for a 
fiscal 1991 deficit no higher than 64 billion 
according to the latest administration estimates the deficit 
next year will be about 169 billion not counting the 60 billion 
or more needed to continue the bailout of the savings and loan 
industry 
if a budget agreement is reached the legislation would stretch 
out grammrudmans timetable for a balanced budget instead of 
keeping that goal in sight for fiscal 1993 it would be postponed 
until fiscal 1995 or later

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher tuesday on the chicago board of trade largely erasing the 
previous days losses in a rally led by the soybean complex 
gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine corps tradingfloor 
operations at the exchange said the runup mostly reflected 
largescale buying that appeared to have originated with a single 
speculator in the soybean market 
zusel could account for no change in supplyanddemand factors 
that might have prompted the buying 
but other analysts said soybeans were supported by indications 
that spain bought brazilian soybeans overnight and by prospects for 
sales of us soybeans to taiwan and south korea 
a drop in supplies of soybeans certified deliverable against the 
august contract also boosted the soybean market analysts said 
at the close wheat futures were 3 cents to 4 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in september at 279 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 1 cents higher with september at 245 a bushel 
oats were unchanged to cent lower with september at 116 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents to 9 cents higher with august at 
610 a bushel

mideast 
jon groveman head of equity trading for the new york brokerage 
ladenburg thalmann amp co said the market rallied on the news that 
jordans king hussein was on his way to the united states to confer 
with president bush over the iraqi situation 
weve been inundated with negative headlines with the market 
oversold like this people are looking for an excuse to buy 
groveman said 
analysts also said the stock market was boosted by gains in the 
bond market and a drop in oil futures prices also due to husseins 
trip and the lack of any fresh bad news from the middle east 
the markets received mixed signals on the economy this morning

united auto workers union members in flint voted 
tuesday on a proposed contract with general motors corp which has 
been forced to idle several other plants because of labor unrest at 
flint 
the tentative contract was reached monday afternoon the fifth 
day of a strike called over local health and safety matters work 
speedups and the use of outside companies to perform work that 
unionized gm employees could do 
voting at uaw local 659 began tuesday afternoon details of the 
tentative agreement covering about 2800 people werent announced 
before the voting 
the strike at flint has affected other gm plants because of the 
companys reliance on justintime distribution a system that 
delivers parts and components to assembly plants frequently within 
hours of them being installed in new vehicles 
by tuesday the flint strike had shut down five assembly plants 
in michigan ohio and louisiana and portions of some component 
factories resulting in at least 17000 layoffs 
we could certainly see additional impact this week gm 
spokesman john maciarz said tuesday 
tuesdays vote comes as the uaw negotiates national contracts 
with gm ford motor co and chrysler corp to replace agreements 
that expire sept 14 the agreements cover more than 450000 
workers including about 300000 gm employees 
it is unusual for the uaw to begin a local strike during 
national contract talks harley shaiken a labor professor at the 
university of california at san diego said the selective strike 
may be a preview of the unions strategy later on 
analysts also say the flint strike sends a strong indication 
that the uaw will choose to concentrate its national negotiating 
efforts at gm under an arrangement known as pattern bargaining an 
agreement reached at the target company is then presented to the 
other two of the big three automakers for minor customizing before 
being put up for ratification 
if gm werent going to be the target it wouldnt make much 
sense to have this demonstration strike at gm shaiken said
