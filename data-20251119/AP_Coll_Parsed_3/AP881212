president carlos salinas de gortari said 
monday night he will extend a yearold inflationfighting program 
through the first half of 1989 institute a gradual peso devaluation 
and allow an 8 percent pay increase for workers 
the increase will be the workers first in nine months 
in a monday night ceremony with business and labor leaders 
salinas also gave the program a new name the economic growth and 
stability pact 
former president miguel de la madrid implemented the plan then 
known as the economic solidarity pact in december 1987 as inflation 
reached a record annual rate of 1592 percent 
inflation reached 486 percent for the first 11 months of 1988 
according to the central bank 
the central features of the plan included freezes enacted feb 29 
on the peso currency exchange rate and on prices for 
governmentregulated goods and services 
the government also froze the daily minimum wage which in the 
federal district of mexico city amounted to about 370 
on jan 1 the government will begin adjusting the pesodollar 
exchange rate by an average of one peso per day through july 31 
1989 the statement said 
it said the controlled devaluation will occur at a rhythm that 
continues to make possible for those making their investments in 
pesos a better yield than that obtained using other currencies 
the measure will be implemented without abandoning the 
objective of stabilizing the exchange rate during the year the 
statement added

the armed forces will receive pay 
raises of 20 percent in december with a 100 bonus an official 
report said monday 
soldiers who mounted a fourday uprising this month had demanded 
raises 
the governments news agency telam cited reliable sources 
for its report of the raises it gave no details in its 
twoparagraph story 
the military uprising broke out at a base on the outskirts of the 
capital on dec 1 and moved to another base nearby before the 
mutineers agreed to return to their units the revolt left three 
people dead 
civilian president raul alfonsin denied reports at the time that 
he was forced to make concessions in exchange for the surrender of 
the rebellious troops 
soldiers have complained that they like other public employees 
have lost significant purchasing power as raises failed to keep 
pace with increases in the cost of living 
the military received a 30 percent raise in july and 12 percent 
in october the cost of living rose by 26 percent in july and 9 
percent in october 
the latest raise would be well ahead of inflation which last 
month increased by 6 percent 
the government has tried to control military salaries partly in 
an effort to harness inflation in addition the opposition peronist 
party in congress has blocked the 1988 budget because it wants more 
federal funds for the provinces 
the military share of the total budget has shrunk to about 2 
percent of gross domestic product from about 4 percent during 
military dictatorships of 197683

pending before the supreme court involving texas death row inmate 
johnny penry that case challenges the legality of executing 
mentally retarded inmates 
this man isnt retarded assistant attorney general bob walt

president pw botha is 
campaigning doggedly to improve south africas image overseas but 
he faces constant reminders that success will be limited until he 
comes to terms with nelson mandela 
among those conveying that message in recent days were south 
africas bestknown novelist black and white corporate executives 
and two leading us senators who were rebuffed curtly when they 
asked botha if they could meet the jailed african national congress 
leader 
even the governments recent decision to transfer mandela to a 
prison farm staff house complete with swimming pool and patio 
seemed to underscore the special stature of the 70yearold black 
nationalist 
they are showing that he is the major kingpin in the 
constitutional future of south africa said dave dalling 
parliament member from the antiapartheid progressive federal party 
perhaps the most dramatic evidence of the influence wielded over 
south africa by mandela and his anc came in court testimony last 
week on behalf of 11 black activists about to be sentenced for 
treason and terrorism in the same courthouse where mandela received 
a life sentence for sabotage in 1964 
most of the 11 treason defendants were affiliated to the united 
democratic front a nationwide antiapartheid coalition which the 
trial judge said had collaborated with the anc 
the defense lawyers instead of repudiating the anc summoned 
several of south africas most respected opposition figures to speak 
about their support for and understanding of the outlawed guerrilla 
movement 
nadine gordimer the countrys foremost novelist said she 
considered mandela her leader and blamed her fellow whites for south 
africas political violence 
sam motsuenyane a black bank chairman said of mandela 
unquestionably he is my hero 
similar statements came from a university administrator and the 
leader of a black homeland in a subsequent magazine interview a 
prominent afrikaner business leader anton rupert said he wanted to 
meet mandela man to man to discuss a peaceful political 
settlement 
botha has declined to spell out his plans for mandela as he 
presses ahead with an unprecedented campaign to ease international 
pressure on south africa 
in the past few weeks he has commuted the widely denounced death 
sentences of a group of blacks known as the sharpeville six freed 
two elderly black political prisoners and endorsed a tentative peace 
plan that could end south african rule over namibia 
all these steps as well as mandelas transfer have been 
welcomed in western capitals but always the pressure to deal 
politically with mandela and the anc resumes 
botha also is under fire for continued repression of dissidents 
at home while he tries to impress power brokers abroad 
even a seemingly benevolent gesture the recent release of 
detained black newspaper editor zwelakhe sisulu had a harsh edge to 
it sisulu like several other freed detainees was prohibited from 
returning to his job restricted to the area around his home and 
barred from antigovernment political activity 
us senators sam nunn of georgia and david boren of oklahoma at 
the close of a oneweek factfinding trip acknowledged saturday 
that botha had taken some positive steps but said they came away 
with a feeling of pessimism 
if those who are working for real change are foreclosed from 
using nonviolent political methods it is our great fear that they 
will be forced to turn to methods that will undoubtedly lead to 
violence and tragedy the two democrats said 
botha said boren deeply disappointed us by wanting to talk 
only about the past not trying to engage and assess and share ideas 
about the future 
even if mandela were released opposition leaders say the gesture 
would mean little unless he and other prominent black militants 
young and old are allowed to engage freely in politics and to work 
for a oneperson onevote system 
botha says he is not willing to even discuss such a system and 
there is no sign that mandelas release would mean an easing of 
restrictions on opposition activity

an autistic man who served as a model 
for dustin hoffmans latest movie character watched the premiere of 
rain man with the actor three rows behind him 
joseph sullivan 28 was one of three autistic people hoffman 
studied to prepare for the role of raymond babbitt an idiot savant 
who inherits 3 million from his fathers estate but has no concept 
of money 
hoffman director barry levinson and producer mark johnson came 
to huntington to help raise funds for the autism services center 
which is run by sullivans mother ruth 
about 1500 people attended sundays benefit at the ornate 
keithalbee theater the center said it expected to get 30000 to 
35000 
its not something thats happened to us before coming to a 
town which has a family in it which was the inspiration for our 
film hoffman told the 600 people attending a dinner following the 
premiere its just a very moving experience for myself and my 
wife and barry and his wife and mark and his wife 
we just made a film thats going to play for you know a month 
or two or whatever in cities in america and around the world and 
be put out on video cassette and put on shelves and seen once 
you people have joe in your community for the rest of your 
lives and i would take that any day of the week and i think thats 
a really important thing because he is a very special person who 
shines through this magic he has 
autism is an affliction in which the brain doesnt process 
information correctly some autistics are selfabusive and lack 
social skills but excel in music math and art 
generally though autism is misunderstood said mrs sullivan 
i had people say isnt it nice your little boy knows how to 
draw mrs sullivan said 
mrs sullivan gave the movie credit for advancing knowledge of 
autism telling hoffman you have done with one film what we have 
been trying to do in our field for 25 years 
hoffman said however if we do onetenth of what mrs sullivan 
has done we will have made a little advance

leanne patton a 16yearold 
protestant had never met a roman catholic until she went to a 
memorial service for the victims of an ira bombing and ended up 
holding hands with two nuns 
that moment at st annes cathedral in belfast when the minister 
asked everyone in the overflowing congregation to join hands and 
pray marked a turning point in leannes life 
she had been crying for the 11 people killed in enniskillen on 
nov 8 1987 and was so wrapped up in the service she didnt realize 
she had picked up the hands of two nuns who were sitting beside her 
i went home and i thought im just really fed up that i have 
to hate this woman because shes wearing a nuns habit i have to 
hate this fellow because hes a catholic it just went over and 
over in my mind you know what am i going to do she said 
id never met any catholics never never my mom and dad 
are very good they really are they didnt keep me away from 
catholics its just where i lived there werent any she said 
in northern ireland with its history of sectarian animosities 
it is common for youngsters and even adults never to have met 
someone of another religion 
many of northern irelands 1 million protestants and 600000 
catholics live in neighborhoods segregated along religious lines 
and all but 1000 of the provinces 350000 children attend schools 
that are almost entirely protestant or catholic 
leanne is studying for college entrance exams at mainly 
protestant grosvenor high school in east belfast 
after the enniskillen memorial service she decided to try to 
arrange an exchange with a catholic high school 
i never thought it would be anything big just a small 
meeting leanne said i was a very quiet person but 
something inside of me said i think you should really advertise 
this and before i knew what i was saying i asked if i could 
address the school assembly 
well i went and did that assembly and they clapped and they 
clapped and i was just shocked i didnt think anybody felt the same 
way i did and there were hundreds of them they said this is 
the right thing were doing 
the first exchange late last year was with a group of catholic 
students from two schools our lady of mercy and st patricks 
as the grosvenor students waited for the catholics to arrive 
leanne said they were literally trying to think what these 
catholics were going to look like are they going to talk funny and 
what are their names going to be like 
because wed never met we just had these ideas about the other 
side and then when we came together we just realized they were 
just like us 
over the past year the students have exchanged further visits 
friendships have grown outside school with frequent visits to local 
discos restaurants and the movies and shared stays at a 
governmentsponsored camp 
the grosvenor girls have also participated in a play bridges 
of celebration with boys from corpus christi college a catholic 
secondary school in west belfast an irish republican army 
stronghold it filled the opera house in belfast and will be 
performed again in dublin in february 
recalling the first rehearsal on neutral ground at queens 
university in belfast leanne said 
when they first walked in they just sat down and stared at 
you i said oh dear whats this going to be like but then we 
got to know them and we realized they were great 
she has no illusions that her activities will change the country 
no way im never going to become a catholic and none of them are 
ever going to become a protestant just because theyve met she 
said 
but just the fact that we are meeting and becoming friends 
it is harder to hate someone if you know them

west germans are showing sharp 
impatience with foreign nato troops on their soil as their 
perception grows of mikhail s gorbachevs soviet union as a nation 
of peace 
the top us military commander in europe calls it wishful 
thinking 
on nov 22 a british armored unit scrapped plans to enter a 
northern town during maneuvers because the townspeople were fed up 
with the noise and property damage created by war games 
three months earlier a court blocked us army plans to station 
36 helicopters outside wiesbaden the ruling came amid intense local 
opposition to the noise caused by american aircraft and forces 
already in the area 
american troops and other forces of the north atlantic treaty 
organization have been guarding this frontline nation since the end 
of world war ii 
in maneuvers designed to keep the alliances forces at peak 
readiness nato tanks rumble across west german farms and as jet 
aircraft swoop in on low passes 
but west german politicians say they are facing what has become a 
widespread public perception that gorbachev the soviet president 
is a messenger of peace and an accompanying attitude that perhaps 
the hairtrigger military readiness and the resulting inconveniences 
can finally be lessened 
gorbachev announced wednesday before the united nations that he 
will reduce soviet forces by 500000 troops including removing 
50000 soldiers and six tank divisions from eastern europe by 1991 
west german unease about foreign troops within its borders has 
increased this year amid a rash of nato jet crashes on thursday a 
us fighter jet slammed into remscheid killing the pilot and five 
people on the ground seventy people were killed in a fiery air show 
disaster aug 28 at the us air force base in ramstein when 
italian stunt planes collided 
there is a deepseated longing for peace people find the idea 
of lowering the military posture very attractive peter petersen 
a federal lawmaker in chancellor helmut kohls christian democratic 
union told the associated press 
petersen says west germany is a committed nato partner and that 
kohls government sees the foreign troops in his country as still 
necessary for the security of western europe 
but petersen adds that domestic political pressure for a serious 
reduction in lowlevel nato jet flights fewer maneuvers that damage 
property and other demands cannot be ignored 
karsten voigt a lawmaker with the leftleaning opposition social 
democrats agreed 
it is increasingly difficult for politicians of all political 
colors to defend defensive needs against regional and national 
pressures voigt said at the nov 1318 hamburg congress of the 
north atlantic assembly an independent body of lawmakers from the 
16 nato nations 
the social democrats have taken a harder stance than the 
christian democrats maintaining that natos overall defense 
strategy is outdated and needs to be reworked 
us military officials and conservative american politicians in 
recent months have been aggressively trying to counteract west 
european perceptions of gorbachev as a peacemaker 
we must not get a distorted idea of what is really happening 
gen john galvin supreme allied commander in europe recently told 
reporters wishful thinking is causing the west to get deeper into 
a situation in which support for deterrence may be seriously 
threatened 
a new west german unease about foreign troops on their soil has 
become especially apparent during the debate in nato over 
burdensharing 
us officials charge that western europe is not shouldering its 
fair share of natos financial burden and are asking west germany 
and other countries to spend more for defense 
the accusation is a sensitive one in west germany where about 
400000 foreign nato troops including 250000 americans are based 
kohl himself has suggested that his countrymen already endure 
enough inconvenience because of nato troops on their soil 
kohl and other west german officials suggest the united states 
should not be looking just at dollars and cents when weighing each 
nato nations contribution to the alliance 
the west germans say other factors should be assessed as well 
such as foreign tanks tearing up farmland and fears among the 
population caused by lowlevel flights by military jets 
there are 5000 military exercises in this densely populated 
country each year said petersen the christian democrat lawmaker 
theres no piece of real estate where you have a greater 
concentration of soldiers and weapons including nuclear weapons 
the americans should understand these burdens we want them to 
stay here but they must realize this is a political burden 
thomas enders a political scientist at the german society for 
foreign politics said a recent survey indicated that about 80 
percent of west germans backs nato but he added that a resurgence 
of neutralism within west germany could grow with gorbachev in 
power in the soviet union 
an poll this past summer indicated that 71 percent of west 
germans had a favorable opinion of gorbachev compared with only 41 
percent for president reagan 
but kohls government assures its transatlantic allies that it is 
not convinced the threat from the east has vanished and that west 
germany is committed to keeping nato strong 
said petersen were right next door to east germany so we 
know full well why that is important

a new kind of state prison for pregnant inmates 
only opens today in an effort to keep new mothers and their babies 
together 
although a few other prison systems in the country make efforts 
to allow mothers to remain for a time with their infants the neil 
j houston house in bostons roxbury section will offer features 
unavailable elsewhere 
separating women and babies at birth causes a serious rupture 
in motherinfant bonding said lyla austin codirector of social 
justice for women a private nonprofit advocacy group for women 
prison inmates 
the group will run the 550000 program under a contract with the 
state department of correction 
its a historic step for the state and the country to show 
respect for the mother and infant bond ms austin said last week 
currently inmates in massachusetts are separated from their 
children and returned to their cells within days of giving birth 
inmates of the 15bed facility will be confined to the building 
but have access to counselors drug rehabilitation help in 
readjusting to society and medical care during pregnancy and after 
the first resident expected to be admitted in january will find 
an atmosphere more like a halfway house than a jail guards will 
wear civilian clothes 
only women eligible for early release will be considered for 
admission and it is expected that they will complete their 
sentences at the house 
three years ago social justice for women decided some 
immediate action was needed ms austin said we had been 
working with women at the state prison at framingham we saw the 
numbers of pregnant women growing 
about 50 pregnant women go through the state prison system every 
year there were 17 prison births in 1986 the last year for which 
figures were available 
the average sentence for women convicted in this state is four 
months usually for drugrelated crimes and prostitution correction 
officials said 
since 1980 the number of women imprisoned in massachusetts has 
risen 239 percent an increase ms austin attributed to the general 
trend nationwide toward incarcerating people and away from sexism 
early in this century women routinely kept their babies with them 
in prison until people began to worry about the stigma attached to 
anyone who claimed a prison as their birthplace 
more recently new york started allowing babies born in prison to 
stay with their mothers until their first birthday said kenneth 
perlman deputy superintendent for services at the new york state 
prison at bedford hills 
the bonding that results is very positive both for mother and 
child the way the babies develop and mature perlman said in a 
telephone interview 
in georgia qualified pregnant inmates receive a 60day furlough 
30 days before they are due to give birth so that delivery can occur 
outside prison 
but most women imprisoned in georgia like those in other states 
must return to their cells 40 to 72 hours after giving birth 
prison officials around the country said they knew of no such 
communitybased program and said the massachusetts program sounded 
like a good idea 
i see when the women come in here that one of the hardest 
things is being separated from their children said maureen 
atwood associate warden of prisons at the federal minimumsecurity 
prison for women in alderson wva

the bush administration will have its hands 
full trying to cap medicares spending spiral without cutting into 
the quality of health care the program provides to 32 million 
americans says outgoing health and human services secretary otis r 
bowen 
one the reasons its going to be tougher is because of the 
massive new numbers of old people that we have coming along bowen 
said 
with overall medicare costs growing at about twice the rate of 
inflation bowen said the 100 billion program is a natural place to 
look for savings 
at the same time we have to walk a very tight line and make 
sure we are not reducing the quality of care and access to care 
he said in an interview it is my judgment that were getting 
close to that level now and we have to be very cautious about going 
too deep 
bowen declined to discuss specifics of the final budget the 
reagan administration will submit next month but department sources 
have acknowledged agreeing to about 6 billion in net reductions in 
projected medicare outlays mostly by holding down payments to 
doctors and hospitals 
the physician portion of medicare part b is growing about 15 
percent a year and democrats and republicans alike in congress have 
said it will undergo close scrutiny in budget deliberations 
beyond the cuts he has agreed to for the next budget bowen said 
we are getting close to the time where further ratcheting down 
could cause some deterioration in the quality of care and perhaps 
even access to care 
bowen who will be 71 in february and plans to retire in indiana 
noted that projections call for the number of people over the age of 
100 to increase from 25000 to 100000 over the next decade 
not only will they tend to require more medical attention but 
many also will used up savings and might become a bigger burden 
on public assistance he said 
bowen a former twoterm governor of indiana who said running 
that state was easier than running the huge hhs department said his 
greatest accomplishment was getting president reagan to back a 
catastrophicillness insurance addition to medicare in the most 
sweeping expansion of the program since its birth two decades ago 
getting the presidents approval over the objections of so many 
in the cabinet that was the tough part said bowen once the 
president gave his approval then it became a lot easier to try to 
contain the number of additions congress wanted to add to it 
on the other hand bowen said he is disappointed he has been 
unable to get states to move more quickly to solve medical 
malpractice insurance problems which he said are threatening access 
to health care in some regions 
he said the bush administration should be ready to introduce 
federal legislation to override the states on the issue unless they 
move quickly bowen said he was not suggesting such a step during 
the coming year but certainly within four years unless the 
states act 
bowen said there is a remaining need for special emphasis on aids 
because of the emotional response of the people people are scared 
to death 
i hesitate to single it out as a disease to be treated 
differently from others but i think as yet it does need to have a 
little extra special treatment he said 
bowen said he has not been consulted by bush transition officials 
for a recommendation on who should succeed him but he said he hopes 
the incoming president will not view the appointment as minor 
when youre talking about a kinder and gentler america youre 
talking about hhs he said of the huge agency that has a larger 
budget than the pentagon and embraces such programs as social 
security medicare and welfare 
the department also includes the sprawling public health service 
umbrella that covers such wellknown agencies as the food and drug 
administration the national institutes of health and the centers 
for disease control 
bowen said he hopes bush will give the new hhs secretary 
authority to pick the heads of those major agencies 
i think loyalty is one of the most important attributes of 
somebody who is working for you and the appointing authority sort of 
draws that loyalty he said i think you can get a lot more 
accomplished and better serve the public if you have a team rather 
than somebody who you never knew and never worked with maybe you 
wouldnt develop the confidence in them you should

nearly 10 million americans lost their jobs due 
to plant closings or layoffs from 1983 to 1988 despite the longest 
peacetime economic expansion in the nations history the government 
reports 
of 97 million displaced workers during the period 47 million 
were socalled tenured workers who had held their jobs for three 
years or more the bureau of labor statistics says in the latest of 
its biennial reports on worker displacement 
that was a slight decline from earlier bls studies of overlapping 
fiveyear periods 197984 and 198186 which both had shown that 
51 million tenured workers lost their jobs during the respective 
periods but each of those periods also included the severe 
recession of 198182 
as a result government and private economists say the new 
figures show a persisting displacement problem 
larry mishel an economist for the economic policy institute a 
liberal washington think tank called the decline in job 
displacement after the recession years surprisingly small 
the bls began conducting the displacement surveys in 1984 at the 
request of the labor departments employment and training 
administration the latest report was released over the weekend 
while the 1984 and 1986 surveys showed 50 percent of the 
displaced workers coming out of factories only 40 percent of the 
tenured workers losing their jobs in 198388 had been employed in 
manufacturing 
in conjunction the distribution of the layoffs has shifted 
somewhat from bluecollar occupations such as machine operators 
laborers and repairmen during the recession periods to whitecollar 
management and sales occupations from 1983 to 1988 
this was the leanandmean era when companies went after 
middlelevel managers and other whitecollar workers said mishel 
but a lot of it especially in retail trade is also somewhat 
related to these leveraged buyouts its probably the betterpaid 
retail workers who lost their jobs 
one thing that hasnt changed is the percentage of workers who 
were given some kind of advance notice before losing their jobs in 
all three surveys roughly six of every 10 displaced workers had 
been told in advance to expect a layoff 
but only two of every 10 in the latest survey said they had 
received a written notice of their impending dismissals a trend 
bound to change in view of a new law requiring 60 days written 
notice of plant closings and large layoffs beginning in 1989 
of the 47 million tenured workers who lost their jobs from 1983 
to the end of 1987 71 percent or approximately 32 million of them 
had new jobs as of january last year and 14 percent of them said 
they were looking for work 
that compares favorably with reemployment rates of 67 percent 
and 60 percent and unemployment rates of 18 percent and 25 percent 
in the respective 1986 and 1984 surveys 
of those reemployed fulltime 56 percent reported making as 
much or more money in their new jobs while 44 percent reported 
making less in current dollars unadjusted for inflation 
about 28 percent reported that their earnings had increased by 20 
percent or more in their new jobs taking inflation into account 
analysts said that represents the workers who definitely are better 
off in their new jobs than they were in their old ones 
but a slightly larger group 30 percent reported suffering an 
income loss of at least 20 percent from their old jobs 
thats much deeper than in the previous surveys said mishel 
it confirms a continuing trend of highpaid workers having no 
alternative but to shift to the poorerpaying jobs being created by 
this recovery

setting up the george bush administration the 
task of some 300 people who toil in offices above a drugstore is 
being underwritten by the taxpayers to the tune of about 35 
million 
bushs paid transition staff has grown to 149 at last count with 
about the same number of volunteers officials say 
the highest paid are top advisers james baker iii and fred zeder 
both of whom are being paid at an annual rate of 71377 after the 
transition baker will become secretary of state 
to meet the payroll as well as pay for copying research 
telephones rent supplies and the like bush receives a total of 
35 million in public money 
the money is allocated under the presidential transition act of 
1964 the amount was increased this year from the 2 million that 
was allowed when president reagan took office eight years ago 
the bush operation housed in three floors of an office building 
across the street from the hotel where reagan was shot and wounded 
in 1981 is far more spare than the minibureaucracy of more than 
1000 people who worked for reagans transition in 1980 
and unlike reagan bush is not supplementing his transition 
allowance with private donations 
we just wanted to work within the money appropriated by the 
congress and not make this become a big fat bloated operation 
said transition spokesman david prosperi this is not going to be 
a fastgrowing bureaucracy at this point close to 800000 has not 
been allocated by us to our budget which does indicate that we 
could return a sizeable chunk of money to the federal treasury 
volunteers are being used in clerical positions and the work days 
for transition officials stretch into latenight hours that have 
provoked some grumbling about the need for more staff 
ray fontaine comptroller of the general services administration 
which is responsible for overseeing transition spending called it a 
very lean operation 
bushs transition staff can be smaller because as a member of 
the same party and administration already in power he will not be 
making the sweeping changes that reagan made when he took over from 
democratic president jimmy carter 
this is what we call a friendly takeover said prosperi 
the amount reagan finally spent on his transition was never 
known because he was not required to disclose the amount of private 
contributions his team collected said gsa public affairs specialist 
steve guiheen 
reagan ended up not actually spending all the public money and 
returned some 250000 of the 2 million to the treasury according 
to gsa records 
congress this year enacted a disclosure requirement for any 
private money raised by the transition operations 
prosperi said that just over a third of the transition budget is 
going into payroll 
salary schedules for the transition workers are set according to 
civil service scales with the average salary at 35137 according 
to bush transition officials 
a status report to the gsa detailing expenditures through the 
end of november showed bush had run up bills of more than 1 
million in payroll and benefits for employees many of whom went 
onto the transition payroll straight from the bush campaign 
rent and utilities came to almost 100000 while printing and 
reproduction had cost 27000 
the transition had bills of 11000 for supplies and had spent 
almost 149000 on other services

the first dance in this 100yearold ozark 
towns high school is just a memory but the students who thought it 
was a blast may not get an encore 
the school board is appealing a court ruling that its policy 
against school dances is unconstitional a federal appeals court 
allowed saturday nights dance while the matter is considered 
officials restricted the dance to purdy high schools 161 
students saying they wanted to avoid any chance of trouble among 
those barred were reporters and photographers and even an alumnus 
who was the lead plaintiff in the federal lawsuit that brought 
dancing to purdy high 
jonathan clayton a 1987 graduate got only as close as the 
basketball game that preceded the homecoming dance 
its ok though i won clayton said as he watched the game 
and greeted old friends its still worth it the idea was to 
allow purdy students to have a dance and we did that 
clayton a business school student and 20 other purdy students 
and parents sued in 1986 to overturn the school boards written 
policy banning dancing 
longtime residents in this town of 900 say purdy has never been 
without a ban on social dancing in the schools some have said they 
associate dancing with drinking drugs and illicit sex 
but us district judge russell clark ruled this summer that the 
school boards ban promoted the values of those who oppose dancing 
for religious reasons 
the board appealed clarks order that they stop enforcing the 
ban but the 8th us circuit court of appeals is not expected to 
rule in the case before next year 
the dance ban evoked comparisons to the hit movie footloose 
about a similar ban in a fictional town 
although barred from dancing at school purdy students have held 
dances at the community center or in neighboring towns but they 
said that was inconvenient and unfair 
sheldon buxton superintendent of the purdy school system said 
about 85 students attended saturday nights dance he said it went 
smoothly but he refused to comment on whether other dances could be 
expected 
student council president nancy fox said board members attended 
the dance but the board members who sat on the sidelines during 
the dance talking among themselves apparently did not cramp 
students style 
it was a blast we had a great time miss fox said 
it was really fun everybodys dancing said shannon 
francisco a senior who left the dance early 
but miss francisco 17 added that the dance had caused 
controversy and bitterness in the southwestern missouri town 
i dont think it was worth all that she said 
miss fox appearing tired but happy after a day that included a 
college entrance exam and the historymaking dance said early 
sunday that she wasnt ready to plan another dance 
im still thinking about cleanup for this one she said

the traditional eggnog season is in full swing 
and every cup thats raised should bring cheer to americas dairy 
farmers says an agriculture department economist 
most us dairy production is consumed as grade a milk cheese 
butter and nonfat dry milk but dairy economist jim miller of the 
usdas economic research service says several frequently overlooked 
products lie in the shadows of the bigvolume items 
these include eggnog fluid cream yogurt cottage cheese and 
canned milk miller said collectively they use the equivalent of 
about 11 billion pounds of milk each year and have a farm value of 
about 1 billion 
miller in a report and a telephone interview said us 
commercial use of milk in 1987 was a record of about 136 billion 
pounds and that this years consumption probably will edge still 
higher 
although miller said he had no breakdown showing how much eggnog 
counted in the group of lesser items sales figures indicate that 
eggnog has grown in popularity more than doubling between 1970 and 
1987 
some growth in eggnog sales has come from use outside the 
holiday season miller said 
at one time milk processors started selling eggnog just before 
thanksgiving and quit in late december today he said some eggnog 
processors begin selling for halloween and continue through the 
holidays sales are sometimes resumed for a brief easter season 
but it will take more than merriment around the holiday eggnog 
bowl to keep pace with american dairy farmers 
miller told the usdas recent outlook conference that milk 
production this year is expected to rise 2 percent to another record 
level of around 145 billion pounds production declined slightly in 
1987 to 1425 billion pounds from the record in 1986 of 1435 
billion pounds 
the new record was reached because of an increase of almost 3 
percent in milk per cow he said the number of cows in production 
this year was estimated at 102 million down 1 percent from 1987 
and the fewest on record 
miller said there are a lot of variables ahead for 1989 
including feed costs and other factors even so total milk output 
next year may be about the same as in 1988 while commercial use 
may be up 1 percent to 3 percent 
another factor in the dairy business has been the increase in use 
of fluid cream with sales rising by threefourths between 1970 and 
1987 he said whipping cream more than doubled while halfandhalf 
and light cream showed similar gains 
miller added that yogurt has received a great deal of 
attention because of its popularity among weight watchers and 
other consumers last year he said yogurt sales were up sixfold 
from 1970 but he added that the us yogurt market was tiny before 
the introduction of sweetened fruitflavored brands 
lost in the excitement about yogurts rapid growth is the 
realization that yogurt remains a minor use of milk miller said 
growth in yogurt sales since 1970 has contributed considerably 
less to farm milk demand than have increases in fluid cream use

britain and northern ireland rank well behind 
japan and some of the other giant importers of us agricultural 
products but the agriculture department says they show good 
potential for growth 
the market includes 57 million inhabitants about 77 percent of 
whom live in urban areas on a total land mass of 150000 square 
miles or about the size of oregon collectively britain and 
northern ireland make up the united kingdom 
admission to the european economic community in 1973 gave the 
uk increased exposure to eurocontinental food brands the 
departments foreign agricultural service said in a recent trade 
report 
nonetheless britain possesses a strong food production 
capability as well as a taste for traditional food items although 
the latter is changing along with consumer lifestyles the report 
said seafood meat dairy and grain products produced or 
processed in the united kingdom remain popular while north american 
and asian food items perform well within certain market segments 
the report noted a number of economic characteristics that make 
the united kingdom attractive to exporting countries between 1983 
and 1986 for example per capita disposable income grew by 195 
percent total national spending on food rose by 12 percent during 
the same period 
growth in foodrelated spending appears consistent with the 
general direction of the uk economy the report said 
last year it said agricultural imports totaled 185 billion 
with the us market share at 6 percent or about 11 billion 
meanwhile us imports of agricultural products from the united 
kingdom were valued at 367 million last year

vice presidentelect dan quayle is likely to 
push for more conservative armscontrol stances during backstage 
negotiations but he no doubt will toe the administration line in 
public national security analysts say 
quayles certainly been more conservative than bush but this 
is going to be a bush administration not a quayle administration 
said james hackett a national security analyst with the nonprofit 
conservative heritage foundation 
john isaacs director of the liberal council for a livable world 
agreed i think that to the extent theres any disagreement 
between the two it will be quayle making the accommodation not 
bush he said 
quayle a republican from indiana was one of the senates most 
conservative members on national security issues during his eight 
years in the chamber 
for example quayle voiced a series of questions and criticisms 
earlier this year about the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
negotiated by president reagan vice president george bush strongly 
supported the pact which was ratified by the senate 
quayle who eventually voted for the pact said in a 1987 
interview that i have a lot of questions about the inf treaty 
and i dont believe in the long run quite frankly contrary to the 
popular perception that this is going to be a big political plus 
for this administration 
quayle also has voiced skepticism about reagan administration 
efforts to negotiate a ussoviet strategic arms reduction talk 
treaty providing deep reductions in the longrange arsenals of each 
nation bush has supported those efforts and pledged to work toward 
a start pact after he replaces reagan on jan 20 
in a senate armed services committee hearing last feb 3 on the 
inf pact quayle said if in fact we do not get a start agreement 
it is not going to be the end of the world as a matter of fact it 
might give us some time to see how the inf agreement is going to be 
implemented 
bush in his first debate with democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis said weve achieved an arms control agreement 
inf that our critics thought was never possible and i want to 
build on it i want to see us finalize the start agreement 
both quayle and bush have said the united states should be 
negotiating to reduce conventional weapons in europe where the 
soviets have a large numerical advantage 
john steinbrunner director of foreign policy studies for the 
liberal brookings institution said quayles influence is likely to 
be limited when the bush administration begins drafting arms control 
positions 
quayle has been a classic hardliner on arms control but i 
dont think many people imagine that hes going to have a very great 
weight in deliberations steinbrunner said the speculation 
really focuses on how bushs own plans evolve 
quayle and other members of the right wing would have slowed up 
or strung out the inf treaty if they had the votes but they showed 
they didnt have the votes steinbrunner said the right wing 
has limited appeal its very vociferous its very intense but in 
fact its not in line with most people in the united states 
raymond garthoff who helped negotiate the salt i and 
antiballistic missile treaties agreed that quayle is likely to 
have only limited influence 
quayle wont differ publicly but he may be a voice for the 
conservatives within the inner councils of the administration i 
dont expect that hell have a large influence but his opinion may 
be sought by bush to understand what the conservatives are 
thinking garthoff said 
hackett concurred that quayle is likely to seek to influence 
administration positions certainly quayle will support the 
administration in public despite what it does but i presume he 
will have some influence in the inhouse meetings that lead up to 
the public positions he said

a presidential commission studying the nations 
more than 3800 military installations is closing in on its goal of 
determining which ones should be shut down 
former rep jack edwards the alabama republican who is 
cochairman of the 12member panel says it will meet its yearend 
deadline of recommending which bases should be closed 
but edwards said a final list has yet to be prepared by the 
commission which will report to defense secretary frank c carlucci 
people keep asking about a list and wanting to know how many 
bases but we dont have a goal in terms of numbers he said we 
havent made any final decisions yet 
the commission is an attempt to untie a congressional knot that 
has blocked the pentagon from closing any bases since 1977 
legislators loathe to lose the jobs that bases provide have 
erected a long and complicated series of barriers to individual 
closings 
closing bases is tough for any congressman said rep les 
aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
youre talking lost jobs and that means unhappy voters this is 
near and dear to all our hearts 
edwards said he doesnt know how many bases will be on the final 
list but aspin predicted the figure will likely be 20 to 25 
bases perhaps a few more 
aspin who said he has purposefully remained aloof from the 
panels work estimated that annual savings will be about 2 billion 
besides evaluating data from the pentagon the commission is also 
listening to petitions from congressmen and their constituents 
last week rep glenn english dokla delivered more than 
13000 letters from enid okla urging the panel not to close vance 
air force base 
earlier legislators from northeastern states ranging from maine 
to new jersey and pennsylvania had written the panel urging that 
sunbelt states suffer the most reductions because they said those 
states had the most bases 
after the edwards panel finishes its work carlucci will have 
until jan 15 five days before he leaves office to accept or 
reject the entire list he cant make any other changes 
if carlucci approves the list as expected congress could only 
block the closures if the house and senate each pass a disapproval 
resolution that resolution could be vetoed by george bush meaning 
it would effectively take a twothirds vote in each chamber to block 
the shutdowns 
edwards explained that his panel is using a complicated set of 
criteria to make its decisions 
first installations are being grouped by military mission for 
example all army depots all air force fighter bases all navy 
ports for surface ships 
then bases in a particular category will be evaluated for five 
factors mission suitability including geographical location and 
ease of deployment physical facilities in place the quality of 
those facilities quality of life for personnel such as housing 
and community support 
bases at the bottom of each mission list will be considered 
for closure partly by determining if other higherranking bases 
can become receiving facilities 
next cost evaluations will be done environmental factors such 
as hazardous waste problems will be considered and the impact of 
the lost jobs will be weighed 
its an extremely complicated process said edwards we 
have a huge amount of information to evaluate and judgments to 
make 
the pentagon and the services havent offered any lists what 
we have done is asked the services for information a tremendous 
amount of information he said 
were checking that information by sending staff members and 
commission members out to the bases in some instances talking to 
base commanders and local people 
edwards insists politics isnt an issue this the most 
nonpartisan committee ive ever been associated with believe me 
thats the truth 
we dont look at our charge as having anything to do with 
politics we havent looked at whose district a base is located 
in he said obviously everybody else in washington approaches 
it from the perspective of politics but we havent

more than half of the nations teachers say 
they see evidence of child abuse poor nutrition and parental 
neglect in their classrooms according to a national study 
teachers repeatedly made the point that in the push for better 
schools they cannot do the job alone and yet there is a growing 
trend to expect schools to do what families communities and 
churches have been unable to accomplish said ernest l boyer 
president of the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching 
the foundations survey of 22000 teachers found a sense of 
frustration among teachers both at the lack of support they 
receive from parents and from a feeling of powerlessness in 
teaching he said 
large majorities of teachers find poverty poor health 
undernourishment and neglect to be problems at their schools he 
said 
teachers from every state were canvassed in twin surveys 
conducted by mail in the spring and fall of 1987 the findings were 
released sunday 
among them 
90 percent said lack of parental support was a problem at their 
schools 
89 percent said there were abused or neglected children at their 
schools 
69 percent said poor health was a problem for their students 
68 percent said some children were undernourished 
teachers in the survey described their students as emotionally 
needy and starved for attention and affection boyer said 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association said the report underscores the need for parental 
involvement 
i wish i could sit down with every parent in america and 
emphasize how important they are to their childrens education 
ms futrell said parents are a childs first and potentially 
the most influential teachers 
the average public school teacher earned 28031 in 198788 
according to figures from the nea 
fortynine percent of the teachers in the carnegie survey said 
their pay was worse than they expected 41 percent said it was about 
what they expected and 10 percent said it was better the average 
teacher surveyed had 16 years experience 
the average teacher faced 79 students on a typical day with 
elementary teachers working with 60 different pupils and secondary 
teachers 114 
the typical class size was 23 sixtytwo percent of the teachers 
said their most typical class was about the right size 36 percent 
felt it was too large and 1 percent said it was too small the 
figures do not add up to 100 percent because of rounding 
only 7 percent of the teachers surveyed said they planned to quit

foreigners caught in a clash between chinese 
police and nationalists in tibets capital told of diving behind 
vendors tables and running down narrow alleys as troops open fire 
without warning 
people were falling and screaming i saw people carrying 
wounded tibetans on their backs running into their houses and 
trying to find some place to hide said ron schwartz a sociology 
professor at the university of newfoundland in st johns canada 
he said he dashed up a street to dodge police bullets and tear 
gas it seemed like an eternity i was running up that street he 
said in a telephone interview sunday with the associated press 
the clash broke out saturday in lhasa when 30 tibetans 
identified by the official xinhua news agency as buddhist monks and 
nuns marched into a market with the banned tibetan flag to 
commemorate the 40th anniversary of the un declaration on human 
rights the protesters dressed in street clothes and face masks 
demanded an end to 38 years of chinese communist rule over the 
himalayan mountain region 
china said sunday that a buddhist monk was killed and 13 people 
were wounded when police fired at demonstrators schwartz said the 
monk had been carrying tibets banned flag 
police appeared marching in a tight formation they fanned out 
in an arc some very close to the monks said schwartz he and the 
other foreign witnesses said the police then opened fire without 
warning 
the nationally televised evening news said police were forced 
to fire when some troublemakers refused to heed a warning and 
threw stones and bottles at police 
the soldiers were running after us they came so close said 
christa meindersma of amsterdam the netherlands who was shot in 
the left arm 
they started shooting and we started running i ran for my 
life said another witness an english woman who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
one traveler speaking on condition of anonymity said a tibetan 
who went to a hospital to give blood for the wounded saw four bodies 
the foreigners who spoke by telephone from their hotels said 
authorities imposed tight security in lhasa and searched foreigners 
hotel rooms on sunday 
ms meindersma said after she was wounded she tried to hide 
but they came after me so i ran again 
there was no looking back it was just running running i 
heard the bullets skimming past my head shoo shoo my only thought 
was i have to hide i ran into a tibetan courtyard there were 
many people there in panic i said im wounded and i fainted 
a british man who spoke on condition of anonymity said he ran in 
a different direction and found himself in a narrow alley with about 
50 tibetans 
the police fired tear gas at both ends of the alley he said 
i thought i was going to die of suffocation after 10 minutes 
he said the gas subsided and the group escaped 
some tibetans took me to a small temple where i saw the dead 
body of the monk who had been shot in the head he said there 
was a crowd of tibetans weeping 
at the scene of the shooting he said a teargas canister lay 
near a pool of blood within half an hour after the demonstration 
tibetans began laying white scarves near the pool of blood and the 
canister he said 
tibetan buddhists drape gauzy white scarves over the statues of 
deities in their temples as a gesture of greeting and respect 
saturdays was the third bloody confrontation in tibet between 
authorities and antichinese protesters since october 1987 at least 
38 people were killed in the earlier clashes and hundreds were 
arrested 
the beijing government which claims tibet has been part of china 
since the 13th century moved troops into the remote region in 1950 
tibet was then ruled by a buddhist theocracy headed by the dalai 
lama who fled to india when the chinese put down a 1959 uprising

george mitchell was four or five years 
old when he dropped to his hands and knees crawled unseen beneath 
the toll collectors window and then sprinted to the far end of the 
pedestrian bridge 
one of the rituals of growing up here was to skip across 
without paying the toll said mitchell 55 pointing to the narrow 
span where workers once paid two cents to cross the river to jobs in 
the mill 
mitchell was home in maine last week after being elected by his 
democratic colleagues to become majority leader of the us senate 
he will lead rituals of lawmaking far more embroidered than the 
childhood challenge of the bridge 
but back home mitchell showed himself as a homespun fellow who 
doesnt forget the lessons of his life and in a series of meetings 
around the state he demonstrated a political repertoire hes 
destined to employ in the thicket inside the capitol 
disagree but dont argue the fact is that issues come and go 
and on any public policy there are valid arguments on both sides 
he tells an audience in the lawrence high school gymnasium 
keep bragging in its place a place like your home state this 
is a constant in mitchells banter even when it approaches the 
ridiculous those are the best bagels in america right there he 
said passing a bakery in bangor he went on to explain to a 
skeptical reporter that the reason is theyre not really bagels 
theyre much lighter 
down the street was the best salad bar in america the town 
also had the best 4th of july parade and for this mitchell offered 
a plausible explanation its the best parade to march in because 
its all downhill he said 
remember the shortcuts turn left after dexter shoes he 
ordered an aide as they rushed to make an appointment in ellsworth 
the back road reduced the trip and if mitchell can find shortcuts 
through the senates legislative logjam his colleagues will make him 
a hero 
dont get too cocky he doesnt really have the opportunity to 
savor the senate majority leader election too long explains 
brother paul who was joyously trading insults with his younger 
brother across their sisters kitchen table 
you know what paul would say about the deficit lets spend 
it the senator says 
take some blame especially when its yours for the taking when 
a citizen at a town meeting refers to the federal deficit as 
reagan republican the eightyear senator concedes that in 
fairness i think were part of the problem too 
enjoy your job mitchell in presque isle receives three packages 
of imported vegetables from potato farmers who are considering using 
japanese or european vacuumprocessing methods of preservation 
i get paid for this exults mitchell fascinated by the 
products and the possibilities of using the new system to make more 
us food available to developing countries that lack refrigeration 
his task to find ways to counter canadian subsidies which might put 
the plant across the border 
take it to a point a constituent in talmadge the only 
precinct in the state mitchell lost in november when he won his 
second full senate term blasts him for opposing efforts to outlaw 
all abortions 
mitchell had enough however when the man likened him to 
pimps prostitutes and witches the constituent he said was 
trying to practice guilt by association and mitchell backed him 
down winning kudos from the crowd even though most disagree with 
him on the issue 
take it with humor a bangor constituent suggested a solution to 
the nations foreign debt of biblical proportions have all nations 
wipe the slate clean and start over again well it has the 
advantage of being a dramatic proposal mitchell said drawing a 
chuckle from the others at the town meeting but not at the expense 
of the woman making the proposal 
in the senate mitchell will have 99 constituents 54 other 
democrats and 45 republicans and they mostly have bigger egos and 
less selfsufficiency than the good people of maine 
hell need all the skills he uses at his town meetings and 
possibly a few he doesnt show his constituents 
such as sneaking past the toll booth if thats whats needed to 
get to the other side

there were cats with no hair cats with too 
much blowdried cats brushed cats cats from animal shelters and 
cats with pedigrees to meow about 
the 600 felines at the international cat show held in san 
francisco this weekend attracted more than 8000 humans 
most of us have multiple breeds said bill schumacher of 
albuquerque nm i own a persian several maine coons and 
chartreux 
he said cats undoubtedly reflect their owners personalities 
if a person is very flamboyant and outspoken theyll go for a 
flashy cat like a black or white persian said schumacher 
someone who is shy and reserved would go for a much more mellow 
cat a british blue or an american shorthair 
but a lot of people like bigger and better so they go for the 
big cats like maine coons or rag dolls which are 36 inches long 
a cat named elvis won the supercat contest the longhaired 
siamese and tabby mix is named for singer elvis costello 
his owner linn hom said she may enter her 25 cat from an 
animal shelter in future contests but she wont alter his strict 
training regimen all he does is sleep and eat all day

patriot patrick henry showed up in 
this southern illinois town ulysses s grant and robert e lee have 
visited too 
their appearances have been thanks to teacher phil alsman who 
began dressing up in historical costumes to perk up his boring 
history classes 
after christopher columbus i even had a couple of kids come 
after me wanting autographs said alsman laughing i had one 
woman call me up and say will you tell my boy christopher columbus 
is dead 
alsman 42 conceived his gimmick three years ago when he was 
tapped to teach history to seventh graders he had taught science 
for 16 years but his history background was limited 
to me it was very boring he said i felt that they needed 
something that they could relate to at that time 
so the next day he came dress up as patrick henry for a class on 
the revolutionary war 
alsman who has no formal acting training recalled the first 
time he wore the costume he felt silly 
you ought to see all the people give me second looks he 
said i dont know who was more dumbfounded the students or the 
staff because teachers dont dress weird 
alsman became principal of arlington grade school in september 
but that hasnt stopped his theatrics 
hes treated the school to christopher columbus and the unknown 
pilgrim he also performs before civic groups 
once i get into the costume i never respond to anything other 
than that person said alsman its serious to me because i 
think american history is not something to be laughed about

the state has 3 million in checks it 
cant seem to give away 
companies and residents across pennsylvania have not cashed 
thousands of checks worth almost 3 million issued by the state 
treasury department in 1984 1985 and 1986 
even governmental agencies have been lax in 1986 for example 
about 25 checks to townships boroughs cities and county 
governments totaling more than 30000 were uncashed according to 
department records 
the blame may simply lie in the foibles of human nature but for 
department officials its a serious problem theyre trying to solve 
why havent they been cashed who knows said greg penney 
executive assistant to state treasurer g davis greene jr you 
almost have to ask the question why havent auditors caught this 
 
the volume of unclaimed payments has led the treasury department 
to start a program to trace the recipients of wayward checks 
since nov 21 edward l short director of the treasurys bureau 
of investigation and his staff have returned 38640 to various 
municipalities 
human nature being what it is the recipients just put them in 
drawers or use them as book marks or kids find checks of their 
parents after theyve died were just trying to get money back to 
the people short said

peace is as rare today as the ceylon of 
antiquity when marco polo marveled at the fistsized gems and arab 
traders called the island serendib a place of pleasant 
surprises 
the surprises now are routinely nasty 
the indian ocean nation once likened to paradise by the poets 
has become the battleground of a sectarian conflict between two of 
the worlds most tolerant religions hinduism and buddhism 
tamil rebels seeking independence for their ethnic minority 
butcher civilians of the buddhist sinhalese majority and turn their 
guns and swords on the previously unthreatened moslem community 
sinhalese militants infuriated at the governments efforts to 
make peace with the tamils wage a campaign of terror and 
intimidation that some observers fear could force cancellation of 
dec 19 presidential elections 
hit squads in turn hunt and kill the sinhalese radicals they 
blame for the escalating violence 
a dark veil of anarchy and bloodshed has descended on our 
country said sirimavo bandaranaike former prime minister and the 
presidential candidate of the main opposition sri lanka freedom 
party 
opposition parties the powerful buddhist clergy and human rights 
and labor organizations have repeatedly urged a caretaker 
government saying it would help defuse the crisis on an island once 
considered a model of economic progress and stability in the third 
world 
with less than two weeks left in office president junius r 
jayewardene has resisted the calls saying he will dissolve 
parliament and then step aside once his successor is chosen 
the buddhist sinhalese and the hindu tamils both descendents of 
migrants from india have been battling each other for more than 
2500 years 
the contemporary problem ignited in 1983 when the tamils 
exploded their campaign for a separate homeland in the north and 
east into a guerrilla war contending the sinhalese rejected their 
language denied them jobs and gave them too little money for 
education and development 
nearly 10000 people have died in the fighting more than 500000 
have been routed from their homes and the economy once buoyed by a 
booming tourist industry is in ruins 
in july 1987 with the help of neighboring india the regional 
power in south asia and home of 60 million tamils the government 
signed a peace accord aimed at ending the tamil insurgency in sri 
lanka 
the pact guaranteed some automony to the tamils and for the first 
time publicly stated that the sinhalesedominated government was 
willing to share power it also invited india to send troops to sri 
lanka to end the war and supervise the accord 
jayewardene took political risks when he accepted the accord 
angering opposition politicians religious leaders and even some 
members of his cabinet 
the most militant tamils rejected the accord saying it didnt 
meet enough of their demands for selfrule the sinhalese who make 
up 75 percent of the islands 16 million people said the government 
had sold out to the tamils who comprise 18 percent of the 
population 
indian troops soon were fighting the very people they were sent 
to protect more than 625 soldiers have died in the fighting 
the peoples liberation front a shadowy group forced underground 
after a 1971 attempted coup emerged and vowed to kill anyone who 
supports the accord 
the front better known for its violent acts than its marxist 
ideology within 16 months had been blamed for more than 900 
political murders and nearly succeeding in assassinating jayewardene 
in a daring grenade attack in parliament 
only one of the three presidential candidates ossie 
abeygoonsekera of the united socialist alliance has dared to openly 
criticize the front and he nearly paid with his life twice in less 
than a month sinhalese militants hurled bombs into his campaign 
rallies killing eight people and injuring more than 150 
neither mrs bandaranaike nor prime minister ramasinghe 
premadasa the candidate of the governing united national party has 
indicated how they propose to tackle the front if elected in an 
apparent bid to buy peace both have steered clear of criticizing 
the front 
the front however has turned its guns on them 
both have canceled campaign rallies because of threats when the 
front demanded all freedom party officeholders in the south the 
sinhalese heartland either quit or be killed a number obeyed and 
prominently displayed their resignation letters 
the task of creating a new era to solve the countrys problems 
of providing a new leadership of building a new nation is in our 
hands rohana wijeweera leader of the front said in a rare 
interview recently with the sunday times newspaper 
the members of our party are willing to sacrifice their lives 
for their country and people when our members are willing to lead 
the people at the risk of torture and death the people will have to 
make at least a small sacrifice to liberate the country said 
wijeweera who has been compared privately by senior government 
officials to pol pot leader of the khmer rouge widely held 
responsible for the deaths of 1 million cambodians from 197579 
last month in its most daring effort yet to destabilize the 
government the front told government and other employees to stay 
away from work or be killed 
shops banks and post offices closed their doors and trains sat 
idle in the railyards troops drove public buses manned ports and 
operated gasoline stations 
jayewardene responded by arming the military with unprecedented 
powers including the right to shoot anyone participating in 
antigovernment demonstrations and decreeing death by hanging for 
anyone instigating protests or writing printing distributing or 
displaying threatening posters 
to counter threats to workers authorities declared employees who 
failed to report for work at essential services would be dismissed 
most refused despite the warning apparently believing it was safer 
to disobey the government than risk the militants wrath 
the threats however have spawned squads that authorities say 
killed at least 25 suspected sinhalese militants this month most 
have gathered beneath the mantle of the peoples revolutionary red 
army believed to be comprised of paramilitary forces and members of 
the united socialist alliance a union of four leftist parties 
posters showing grisly photographs of the fronts victims and 
commanding kill wijeweera have been plastered throughout the 
capital 
right now it seems the government only controls a few army and 
police posts and colombo said one military official who cannot 
be identified under briefing rules and on some days not even 
colombo

a leading international banker has a new plan 
to reduce the burden of debt owed by the third world without cost to 
taxpayers in the united states and other creditor countries 
the objective of lower debt service is sound and necessary for 
some debtor countries at least for a time says pedropablo 
kuczynski chairman of first boston international but the idea of 
using taxpayers dollars to achieve what the market is already 
doing albeit partially is not 
third world debt is expected to reach 12 trillion by the end of 
this year and debt service has become an increasing drain on 
nations that can least afford it the world bank estimates that in 
1987 third world transfers to richer countries were 29 billion 
traditionally the flow had been in the other direction in the same 
way that money flowed from europe to this country when it was 
developing in the 19th century 
in an article for the current issue of the magazine 
international economy kuczynski proposes dividing the debts of 
countries such as brazil and mexico into two parts interest 
payments and delayed payments of principal on the first part would 
continue but with the size of the debt discounted possibly by 40 
cents on the dollar 
how much of the debt that portion should contain would be 
established in a deal between the commercial banks and the world 
bank which is owned by 151 governments they include both debtor 
and creditor countries 
on the second part kuczynski would require payments by a debtor 
country only under two conditions if it earned more from world 
trade than an agreed amount and if its reserves of gold and hard 
currency were greater than the projected payments if those 
conditions were fulfilled in any given year the world bank would 
call on the debtor to pay at least part of the interest and 
principal owed total payments could be as little as 10 percent and 
as much as 125 percent of the debt 
this plan would go on for 10 years at the end of that time the 
debt in the second portion of the plan would be considered paid off 
payments on the first portion would continue 
kuczynski estimated in a telephone interview that his plan could 
save heavily indebted latin american countries as much as 13 
billion a year in the first few years later the savings would be 
less but the countries would be in a better position to pay 
a world bank spokesman said officials are now reading kuczynskis 
proposal and would have no immediate comment 
kuczynski said a way should be found for the billions of dollars 
in reserves already put aside by creditor banks like his own to be 
used for a temporary reduction in payments by debtors he suggested 
that this is already being done to some extent 
in order to get their interest back from the larger debtors 
the commercial banks are themselves putting up about 30 percent of 
it in refinancing he wrote 
lenders might be willing to give up some principal now if they 
have a chance of recouping it later with gains 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev proposed last week that many 
debts be forgiven payments on others by the poorest countries be 
delayed for as long as a century and a new international body set 
up to buy remaining debt at a discount 
the last proposal is similar to one in the trade act that 
president reagan signed last august but neither gorbachev nor the 
new law suggested who should bear the cost 
the soviets themselves could not expect to take advantage of 
anything like my plan kuczynski said they owe a pile of money 
themselves but they have to be very scrupulous about keeping up with 
all their payments

the republican cochairman of the national 
economic commission says the government should consider taking back 
some of the social security benefits paid to higherincome 
individuals 
drew lewis expressed optimism sunday that the 12member panel 
eventually will produce a consensus report on cutting the federal 
deficit with the emphasis on reduced federal spending 
the position all of us have taken is that were going to 
address this based on cutting the spending lewis a former 
transportation secretary in the reagan administration said on nbcs 
meet the press program 
however he added this does not mean if we are not able to 
address the issue on that basis that there are not a number of 
members on the commission who would prefer a tax increase 
lewis specifically mentioned as a last resort some sort of 
consumption tax that would be adjusted according to each 
individuals ability to pay 
he also offered the term rebates to describe other revenue 
sources which do not involve raising taxes among these rebates he 
said would be taking back some of the social security benefits paid 
to people with other incomes over 90000 a year and collecting 
repayment of some medicare benefits from the estates of wealthy 
elderly recipients who die 
lewis said he did not think much of the savings could be achieved 
in military spending over half the budget is now in entitlements 
and interest unfortunately thats where were going to have to go 
if were going to find reductions in spending he said 
lewis democratic counterpart on the panel robert strauss 
appeared on the same program and said he believes that simply 
cutting spending wont be enough 
i must tell you that in my judgment i have not found sufficient 
spending cuts to make up the shortfall in meeting a 
deficitreducing target said strauss 
such a finding by the panel would be directly at odds with 
presidentelect bushs campaign pledge not to raise taxes democrats 
are turning up the heat for bush to show how he would close the 35 
billion gap in meeting next years deficitreduction goal 
i havent seen a way to get there without some increased 
revenue hopefully well find it if we dont im going to be for 
some increased revenue said strauss a former democratic national 
chairman 
tax increases while viewed as political poison have been 
identified by many economists as the only realistic way to slash 
deficits and calm nervous financial markets though strauss has 
expressed similar opinions in the past he was unusually blunt in 
sundays public appraisal 
strauss said he would consider socalled sin taxes on alcohol 
and tobacco or a gasoline or other broadbased energy tax as 
likely sources for the needed revenue 
such ideas have received broad support from many members of 
congress strauss also agreed that social security payments to 
highincome americans such as himself should be taxed 
upperincome recipients of social security now pay taxes on half 
their benefits under a provision that was part of a 1983 change in 
the law some commission witnesses have suggested boosting that 
level to 85 percent

black students especially in the south are far 
more likely than whites to be targets of corporal punishment or 
school suspension according to a study 
teachers often overreact to blacks especially black males 
interestingly thats true even with black teachers said joan 
mccarty first executive director of the bostonbased national 
coalition of advocates for students which sunday released an 
analysis of federal school data 
the report found black youngsters are more than twice as likely 
to be hit or be labeled mentally retarded as whites and while 
blacks make up 16 percent of the school population they comprise 
only 8 percent of those in gifted student programs 
the findings were based on an analysis of biennial data published 
by the us department of educations office of civil rights in 
1986 the latest year available the coalition study projected the 
rates at which students of different races suffered various school 
penalties 
the coalition found that the 10 states with the biggest 
blackwhite disparities in the rate of corporal punishment were 
nearly all southern arkansas tennessee texas florida new 
mexico ohio georgia indiana arizona and oklahoma 
nationwide male students account for 80 percent of corporal 
punishment incidents and 70 percent of suspensions the study found 
it shed little light however on why blacks seem to bear the 
brunt of school penalties 
mary hatwood futrell president of the national education 
association called the analysis disheartening and said the 
study indicated that teachers and administrators sometimes respond 
in a racist manner to certain students 
we have our own builtin prejudices about the way certain kids 
can learn or how they talk or how they walk or dress she said 
i dont see a lot of efforts to counter that 
jane usdan a spokeswoman for the american federation of 
teachers said her union rejected racism as the explanation 
its clear that there are problems schools arent reaching the 
majority of the students we need to reach teachers need the 
flexibility to meet the needs of individual students she said 
first said the results dont mean blacks and other minority 
students are breaking school rules more often than whites 
instead she said teachers tend to react out of their 
frustration and irritation 
she said few school districts have systematic controls over 
discipline such as requiring teachers to document in writing why a 
student was referred for discipline it means students are often 
punished for trivial offenses she said 
among the reports findings 
nationwide 522 percent of black students received corporal 
punishment compared with only 228 percent of whites and 205 
percent of hispanics 
arkansas had the biggest statewide disparity in corporal 
punishment rates 2257 percent of blacks received such punishment 
compared with 1099 percent of whites and 564 percent of hispanics 
among the nations 100 largest school districts the largest 
blackwhite disparities were in lee county fla orange county 
fla nashvilledavidson county tenn polk county fla 
montgomery ala seminole county fla pinellas county fla 
brevard county fla hillsborough county fla and arlington

arab educators say they face 
a difficult task trying to motivate children deprived of classroom 
learning during israels long closure of west bank schools 
they say they fear the system may never fully recover 
after a nearly 10month shutdown elementary schools are again 
abuzz with childrens chatter junior high schools reopened sunday 
and high schools are to resume next week bringing all 300000 west 
bank students back to classes 
but arab educators warn the west banks 1194 schools may never 
achieve the same standard they maintained before being closed last 
feb 3 remaining shot for all but a few weeks since 
in the limited period we have to catch up for nearly a year of 
lost education im sure our standards will decline said khalil 
mahshi principal of the quakerrun friends boys school in 
ramallah the quality of education we could provide before the 
closure has definitely been lost 
army officials say schools were closed because they had turned 
into breeding grounds for protests during the yearold revolt 
against 21 years of israeli occupation 
authorities have indefinitely closed west bank universities and 
colleges and brig gen shaike erez head of the west bank military 
administration has warned that other schools will stay open only if 
they are used for learning and not for demonstrations 
according to palestinian educators the closures have brought 
myriad difficulties ranging from a decline in enrollment to 
unmotivated students who have lost the discipline of regular study 
our no 1 problem is getting the children into the habit of 
coming to school regularly again said abdullah rishmawi 
principal of ramallahs lutheran school 
for almost a full year these children have been in the habit 
of watching tv until late at night and getting up at 9 or 10 in the 
morning now we are asking them to get back into the swing of school 
discipline it is not going to be easy 
the task of catching up is further complicated by closure orders 
from the palestine liberation organization school officials will 
comply closing at noon instead of the usual 1 pm for public 
schools and 3 pm for private schools 
even though last years academic term was unfinished west bank 
students were automatically promoted often educators fear at the 
expense of basic skills 
they have moved on to the next grade but this really means 
nothing mahshi said in terms of learning these students have 
lost a year 
especially at risk he said are children in the primary grades 
there are critical periods in a childs life when he begins to 
learn skills like reading writing and numbers mahshi said if 
you miss that period although he may eventually learn to read a 
person will never reach the same level of competency 
palestinian attempts at alternative study during the school 
closures were quickly outlawed by the israeli army which claimed 
they were organized to incite civil unrest 
last month mahshi and rishmawi were called into ramallahs 
military headquarters after they distributed home study assignments 
they said the army ordered them to stop 
they said the school closures were to pressure parents into 
understanding what they were losing and home study counteracted 
this mahshi said 
the frequent clashes and mass arrests of the uprising in which 
at least 322 palestinians and 11 israelis have been killed have 
also taken a psychological toll on students 
our first job every day is to play the clown and try to get the 
children to smile they arrive frowning and sad traumatized by some 
family encounter with the army rishmawi said 
but we just dont have the resources to deal with the more 
severe effects of stress nightmares bed wetting depression he 
said 
enrollment in west bank schools has dropped considerably as 
arabamerican students left for schools in the united states and 
hundreds of others enrolled in jerusalem schools 
the student body at the friends school is expected to be 250 
compared with 470 students last year 
bir zeit university english professor nahala assali estimates 
about 25 percent of the territorys 18000 college students also 
left to study in the united states europe and the elsewhere in arab 
world 
anything that causes our young people to leave the west bank is 
consistent with israeli aims she said

most americans intend to spend at least 200 on 
christmas gifts this season and one in four will spend at least 
500 a media generalassociated press poll shows 
given those expenses its not surprising that a vast majority of 
americans 85 percent say they believe christmas is too 
commercialized 
still a plurality celebrate the holiday as a religious not just 
a social occasion 
the survey of 1084 adults in the continental united states was 
conducted by telephone nov 1020 
the poll suggested that americans remain strongly religious and 
have a deep fondness for the christmas season but it also showed 
significant differences in viewpoints among regions and age groups 
eightynine percent of those answering the poll identified 
themselves as catholic or protestant the rest were jewish 
other or had no religion 
ninetysix percent of respondents said they celebrate christmas 
and 87 percent said they look forward to the christmas holidays 
about a third thinks of christmas as mainly a social holiday and 
about onequarter regard it as primarily religious the largest 
number 38 percent consider it religious and social 
the poll also showed that nearly seven in 10 americans are 
churchgoers and four in 10 had been to church the week before the 
poll sixtyfour percent said they generally go to church on 
christmas 
the poll suggested that americans are in a somewhat more generous 
mood this holiday season than they were seven years ago when an 
apnbc news poll showed that 69 percent intended to cut back on gift 
spending 
in the new poll nearly half said theyll spend the same as they 
have for the last few years 27 percent will spend more only 23 
percent said they intend to spend less 
sixtynine percent said they intend to give gifts to at least 10 
other people and only 3 percent will be giving to none twenty 
percent will be giving to 20 or more people 
finally seven in 10 people say they usually receive the gifts 
they really want one in four dont 
the poll indicated that americans who live in the south and 
midwest have stronger religious traditions than those in the west 
and northeast and that black americans are more religiously 
observant than whites conservatives more than liberals catholics 
more than protestants 
for instance 75 percent of those in the south and 71 percent of 
those in the northcentral states said they attended church services 
during the year compared with 69 percent in the northeast and 57 
percent in the west 
eightythree percent of blacks are churchgoers compared with 69 
percent of whites 75 percent of conservatives compared with 56 
percent of liberals 76 percent of catholics compared with 71 
percent of protestants 
the poll also showed that younger adults are more likely to look 
forward to christmas than their elders and that they also are much 
more likely to view christmas as a primarily social not religious 
holiday 
overall the poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points but a somewhat higher error rate for answers 
involving subgroups

earthquake in soviet armenia spurred nations across the world to set 
aside political differences and rush to the aid of the stricken 
soviets

and a search dog wearing a star of david on his chest was flown into 
the region as part of an international mission of mercy

is trained to sniff people under rubble and wore a red star of david 
on a white chest cloth 
two other planes were scheduled to fly to the soviet union today 
with a 46member medical team equipment and 4 tons of medical

illegal fireworks exploded in a crowded street 
market sunday and started a chain reaction and fire that spread to 
five buildings killing at least 61 people and injuring 45 
well be searching all night theyre still finding bodies 
said salvador padillo the red cross commander at the scene 
floodlights lit the narrow street and an alley as rescuers dug 
into the night putting bodies on stretchers tagging them and 
putting them in ambulances a bulldozer began plowing away the 
rubble 
at least 61 people were killed commander enrique mejia 
guadarrama of the red cross said early monday 
they cant get inside the storerooms but they are full of 
bodies said roberto castanon romo city director of medical 
services you can no longer talk of survivors 
at least 11 of the dead were children officials said 
padillo said at least 45 people were injured but an official on 
duty at red cross headquarters put the number at 83 two 
firefighters were among the injured medical workers said 
the first explosion apparently was in a market stall set up in a 
narrow street leading to the popular merced market and jammed with 
christmas shoppers said red cross worker jorge torres san juan 
fire spread to a twostory building of candy and fireworks shops 
where fireworks also were stored and to a building of candy shops 
next door 
a city legal official jesus sandoval said the fireworks were 
being sold illegally 
the shops were all full of people buying luis contreras 
another rescue worker said 
after the explosions began an estimated 500 people streamed from 
the building screaming get out get out said fernando 
dominguez who was working in shoe store less than 100 feet away 
at first it sounded like bullets then there were more and more 
and then the explosion dominguez said 
the narrow street was crowded with people buying fireworks for 
the celebration of the day of the virgin of guadalupe on monday 
the explosion began with one crate of fireworks on the end of the 
street nearest the merced said mario roberto andrade who lives 
next to one of the buildings that caught fire and was in the street 
at the time he said boxes of fireworks kept exploding down the 
street 
windows shattered throughout the block spent chinese 
firecrackers charred wood and comic books twisted metal and 
tangles of high tension wires littered the street 
as smoke billowed from the second floor of the building more than 
two hours after the fire was reported at 240 pm six young men on 
the third floor refused to leave 
were staying here to hold onto our things one shouted to 
police if it were your house youd do the same 
police sent firemen and police officers into the building 
by about 5 pm fires had been extinguished in a sixstory 
building across the street and a fourstory building down the block 
some smoke also was coming from one floor of an apartment building 
for at least an hour the white smoke could be seen billowing 
from the site from more than two miles away as darkness fell a 
bulldozer began plowing away the rubble 
distraught relatives searched for missing relatives while vendors 
and residents vented anger at mayor manuel camacho solis who walked 
through the watersoaked debris of burned metal canvas street 
stalls and scattered merchandise 
many children died here mr mayor said one man 
earlier victor gutierrez cruz a leader of the areas commercial 
association said it had been protesting illegal sales of fireworks 
he complained that people who dont belong to the group come in and 
sell fireworks without permits during the holidays 
these present a great danger to the shops he said 
district attorney ignacio morales lechuga said that fireworks are 
illegal to sell without a permit 
this does not mean there is going to be an attack on mexican 
culture he said these things fireworks are part of mexican 
culture 
its a case of corruption said andrades wife angelica 
peredo we dont want street vendors selling fireworks here 
for years the merced was the main market in this city of 18 
million supplying dozens of other markets and individual customers 
a new main market was built on the edge of the city in 1982 but 
the merced remains important because of tradition and its location 
about half a mile from the main zocalo plaza in a densely populated 
area

four turtles wielding ninja weapons 
the brainchildren of a sandwich maker and a selfdescribed hack 
cartoonist are threatening to move into the top 10 of the christmas 
toy market 
they are just flying off the shelves said david valentine a 
toy industry analyst for standard amp poors 
teenage mutant ninja turtles have hit no 11 in the toy amp hobby 
world charts of best sellers just four years after they were 
conceived by peter laird and kevin eastman during a lateevening 
sketching duel 
stores report they cant keep up with demand for the goofy 
turtles with their sliceanddice arm action and their silly 
oneliners one good turtle deserves another 
its insane said eastman 26 pete and i really had no 
idea what we were unleashing we were just two wildeyed kids who 
just wanted to do comic books 
they keep shop in a rundown building on a back street of this 
college town 
eastman then an occasional student at the university of 
massachusetts said he tracked down laird who scraped out a living 
by drawing illustrations for local newspapers in 1982 because their 
cartoons looked alike they became fast friends joined by a love 
for marvel comics illustrator jack kirby 
the turtles were created after what eastman called a heavy dose 
of tj hooker and love boat at an apartment the two men 
shared while lairds fiancee finished her studies at the university 
of new hamsphire laird was still freelancing cartoons eastman got 
by making sandwiches at a restaurant 
we had been watching a bunch of horrible tv and we started 
drawing and throwing the stuff at each other eastman said last 
week we found we had this little beastie that we really fell in 
love with 
the beast soon had three brothers all named after renaissance 
painters and a weird history involving a pool of goo in a new york 
sewer and a rat with the powers of a ninja master 
as the story goes the turtles were covered by the muck through a 
random series of odd accidents they mutated and grew up under the 
rats tutelage evolving into superturtles with a taste for pizza 
and for doing battle with the shredder leader of the most feared 
assassins in japan 
valentine considers the turtles the natural descendants of the 
tin soldier with appealingly distasteful roots in radioactive gunk 
kids are into slime he said anything to gross out their 
little sisters 
their creators scraped together 1200 and printed 3000 copies 
of the first teenage mutant ninja turtles comic book the comics 
sold out in three weeks and leonardo donatello michaelangelo and 
raphael were propelled to fame on tshirts cereal boxes and 
saturday morning tv 
even avid fan tom selleck was filmed reading a turtles comic in 
the farewell episode of magnum pi 
it goes way beyond luck eastman said of their success we 
had one of the best blackandwhite comics around we worked hard to 
get it to the point where mark freedman picked up on it 
freedman a new york licensing agent managed to entice a 
california company playmates into investing 25 million in an 
animated television show and launching a line of 10 figurines 
the turtles were helped by the phenomenon of specialty comic book 
stores that have sprung up in the last five years which have opened 
a market for the offbeat 
everybody says you guys must be zillionaires now far from 
it said eastman he said however that the collaborators annual 
income is in the six figures and they now have eight artists working 
on the comic strips and other ventures 
the turtles have long since moved their comic book haunts from 
the new york city sewers to the town where their creators have 
settled 
they can still get into the city easily from here eastman 
said and we can use people we know for characters

by christmas four teams of reindeer from 
operation santa claus will have logged 50000 miles and 110 
appearances at shopping malls and resorts across the country 
we have to make hay while the snow flies said cindy 
gillaspie who manages the ranch for troutman investment co with 
her husband mike 
santas got one night and weve got six weeks said mike 
gillaspie 
other reindeer from the ranch are on exhibit at disneyland and 
the los angeles zoo 
the only part of the us we dont hit is the deep south 
said mrs gillaspie part of the reason is the heat part is 
because we just havent marketed the area and haven generated enough 
interest 
most of the reindeers bookings are through mall merchants 
associations for the holiday season she said each team is 
accompanied by two trained handlers 
mrs gillaspie said she knows of no serious competition in her 
reindeerforhire business the only herd she knows of thats larger 
is at the university of alaska and its for research 
troutman investment an offshoot of a west coast department store 
chain based in eugene has no salesmen to market the reindeer 
just me mrs gillaspie said 
what started out as a junethroughjanuary job has become 
yearround work she said but it really doesnt get fast and 
furious until the summer months 
people dont want to think about christmas in february and 
neither do i but we get started early 
when john zumstein started operation santa claus back in 1950 he 
knew little about reindeer 
i got the idea from watching a christmas show with papiermache 
reindeer said zumstein who lives a few miles away from this 
central oregon town now that he has sold the ranch i wondered why 
the dickens people didnt have real reindeer so i questioned 
around 
san francisco and seattle zookeepers told him that they had tried 
to keep reindeer but the arctic natives died 
zumstein who was in the fuel business had studied animal 
husbandry and decided to apply to the us bureau of indian affairs 
for permits to buy 10 reindeer from eskimos in alaska 
he flew his first batch into portland and trucked them to 
redmond where he figured the cool dry highdesert climate was 
more suitable than the rain in the willamette valley 
but they all died he flew to alaska and got more and by trial

he developed a feed formula that worked and learned to watch out 
for parasites that overcame the deer when they were transplanted to 
a warmer climate 
at his peak zumstein had 80 reindeer on tour to places such as 
tokyo honolulu and canada as well as the continental united 
states he also was selling reindeer

outside the ruins of 270 sverdlovsk 
st families picked at the heap of wreckage that used to be home 
and prayed that relatives still buried in the rubble might somehow 
survive 
several people were pulled from the 50apartment building alive 
immediately after wednesdays earthquake but by sunday relatives 
of the missing were losing hope 
stacks of red black or unfinished wood coffins were piled on 
street corners 
eduard manoyan knew that his wife motherinlaw and a 
brotherinlaw were dead the three were in a ground floor apartment 
when the quake struck 
tamara kazaryans husband had found his son but not his wife who 
had come home from work for her lunch break when the earth began to 
shake and the long fivestory concrete building collapsed 
we dont know whether anyone is alive or not said mrs 
kazaryans husband a laborer i went to the school where my son 
studies the building was ruined but he was alive then i came home 
and started searching for my wife 
people were trying to dig out their belongings from one end of 
the 15yearold building which was built on a slight rise above the 
street and had slid into a heap by the roadside some worked in a 
pile of rubble digging through the ruins others simply milled 
about 
a young man was accused of trying to steal something and 
shouting erupted soldiers arrested the man and led him away 
everywhere officials and rescuers pleaded for more cranes and 
heavy equipment to drag slabs of concrete and twisted pillars off 
trapped people 
at one site rescuers worked feverishly with saws torches 
hammers and crowbars to free a family of seven discovered near the 
top of what was a ninestory apartment building 
survivors who spoke about the tragedy described a series of three 
or four quakes separated by brief pauses 
mayor emil kirokofyan told a group of foreign correspondents that 
recently constructed apartment buildings were not built to withstand 
such a severe temblor even though leninakan is in an area of 
frequent earthquakes 
choking back tears the mayor told reporters he lost 15 relatives 
hundreds of bonfires fueled by cardboard trash or debris 
provided the only heat for people who had spent four nights on the 
streets they sent a pall of smoke over the city of 250000 people 
i dont have anywhere to live i am homeless cried an old 
woman walking out of rescue headquarters where officials had put 
her on a list for new housing 
manoyan a machinist who found his wife and relatives dead 
appealed to the foreign reporters who were touring the disaster 
area at the invitation of the foreign ministry 
as a member of the armenian nation i ask you to give us 
help he said we need equipment the city is in ruins 
some aid that was given proved useless after people had been 
digging through the rubble with their hands for three days a crane 
arrived saturday but the next day it was parked beside the ruins 
motionless workers said it was too small

to shouts of hallelujah ptl founder 
jim bakker preached for the first time since his fraud and 
conspiracy indictment and urged followers of his new church to 
forgive his accusers 
they ask us why dont you attack your enemies bakker 
said his voice rising the devil wants me to renounce my 
salvation and attack attack attack the bible says love your 
enemies 
im not going to lift a finger to attack my enemies im not 
going to lift a finger to vindicate me bakker said that will 
put cold chills down your enemys spine 
during the service for his new covenant church bakker never 
mentioned the 24count indictment issued last week by a federal 
grand jury investigating ptl 
i feel a miracle he told 400 worshipers sunday gathered at a 
roller skating rink and the harder the devil fights the bigger 
the miracle thats coming 
bakker resigned from ptl in march 1987 after admitting to a 1980 
extramarital sexual encounter with church secretary jessica hahn 
ptl filed for bankruptcy reorganization in june 1987 and a 
courtappointed trustee has been trying to sell its assets to pay 
creditors 
in fort mill sc an auction was scheduled for this afternoon 
of ptls 2200acre property which includes a 500room hotel a 
theme park television studio and a 2000seat church 
the only certain bidder toronto businessman stephen mernick has 
let it be known he intends to offer a total of less than 70 million 
cash a month ago he said he would pay 115 million 50 million of 
it cash 
during sundays service bakker talked about his reaction to 
being fingerprinted and having his mugshot taken at the federal 
courthouse in charlotte 
i looked up at all those wanted posters and i thought no one 
is smiling so i smiled bakker said if im going to be on 
the walls of post offices im going to smile 
bakker said he and his wife tammy plan to tape several 
television specials at their home south of charlotte 
the old adrenalin is flowing again he said were excited 
to be able to minister to the people again 
mrs bakker joined her husband on stage singing this too shall 
pass and telling stories of wellwishers who had greeted her in 
restaurants and shopping malls 
bakker won repeated cries of hallelujah and you got that 
right from worshipers seated under the fluorescent lights and 
mirrored balls of the rink at one point most of them left their 
metal chairs to gather around him and raise their hands in prayer 
as one elderly woman left the service she told reporters the 
worse they do jim the more were going to love him 
bakker did not allow reporters inside the building some of his 
remarks however could be heard through the door in the lobby 
bakker and three of his former associates were indicted a week 
ago today after a 16month federal grand jury investigation into the 
ptl television ministry bakker 48 and richard dortch 57 his 
former top deputy at ptl were accused of diverting more than 4 
million of ptl money to support their lavish and extravagant 
lifestyles

josh farnsworth stood on a mountainside with snow 
blowing around him and the wind cutting through his coat he 
reluctantly pulled off his mittens to write down the name of the 
40foot tree towering in front of him 
i think im going to call it three splits said the 
9yearold as he scrutinized the maple that split at its base into 
three separate trunks then he measured the base with his scarf and 
paced off the distance from the tree to a trail marker 15 feet away 
josh and other pupils at derby elementary school in neary derby 
will use the information to find sponsors for dozens of trees along 
the 265mile long trail a hiking trail that runs northsouth from 
massachusetts to canada 
the proceeds will be used by the green mountain club to buy some 
of the 67 miles of unprotected privately owned land along the trail 
the long trail is one of the treasures of vermont this is one 
of the few true wilderness experiences on the east coast said 
teacher doug westin 
the project also is introducing dozens of fourth fifth and sixth 
graders to a different way of learning science history and math 
and a way to apply their skills to benefit their community he said 
the long trail program which includes a pupilproduced history 
book about the trail began this fall at a school that has earned a 
reputation for developing unusual creative projects that extend 
beyond its red brick borders and into the 4200member community on 
the vermontquebec border 
the school just won an award from the american association for 
state and local history for last years project a set of 109 short 
stories the pupils prepared and read on a radio station 
the school also was honored recently as a finalist for the 
national education associations a award for its projects westin 
said 
the projects begin in westins challenge room a classroom 
where he was told five years ago to establish a program for gifted 
pupils 
but the program is really open to anybody in the school who has 
a serious interest its not just for kids with high iqs said ed 
hartman guidance counselor 
individual pupils participate for six weeks three days a week 
about 45 minutes each day or the projects can involve entire 
classes like joshs earlier this month he and his classmates 
boarded a bus for the halfhour drive to the long trail on jay peak 
up on the trail the youngsters fanned out to pick a tree 
tenyearold rebecca jenness sat in the snow in front of her tree a 
gray birch with roots raised to form a hole above the soil 
what does it look like westin asked 
a trolls house rebecca answered 
oh beautiful he said in praise 
rebecca said the project helps her learn in a way thats more 
enjoyable than sitting at a desk 
you learn about nature agreed classmate shannon castl 
hartman said the projects help develop an interest in the 
outdoors i dont think its going to turn them all into 
environmentalists and thats not our goal but i would like them to 
be at least as aware as they are of video games or whats going on 
in sports

deposed philippine president ferdinand marcos 
faces more medical tests after being hospitalized for what his aides 
have called congestive heart failure 
marcos 71 remained in guarded but stable condition late sunday 
at st francis medical center according to nursing supervisor 
mildred kim 
marcos who contends he is too ill to travel to new york for 
arraignment on federal racketeering charges was admitted to the 
hospital friday 
aides said marcos suffered congestive heart failure after 
learning his eldest daughter imee manotoc was experiencing 
complications during childbirth in morocco where she lives 
cardiologist dr calvin wong said marcos would remain in the 
hospital for a few days while additional tests are performed 
more tests were scheduled for today he said 
tests have established that marcos has weakened heart muscles 
or cardiomyopathy wong said adding that victims of the condition 
are prone to develop congestive heart failure 
wong however declined to say whether marcos had suffered 
congestive heart failure when the heart is not strong enough to 
pump a sufficient amount of blood he also would not elaborate on 
the nature of the tests scheduled for today 
its not just because this is the former president of the 
philippines wong said any of my patients i would answer in 
the same noncommittal way

a cuban exile tricked into thinking he had diverted 
a jet with 128 people to havana faces extradition from grand turk 
for only the second hijacking attempt of a domestic us airliner in 
2 years officials said 
weary but unharmed the 121 passengers and seven crew members 
aboard the twa boeing 727 flight from san juan arrived in miami on 
sunday evening they said the hijacker was not violent and was 
shocked when he was arrested on grand turk part of the british 
colony of turks and caicos islands southeast of the bahamas 
he was horrified to realize he had been tricked said 
passenger willie douglas of montgomery ala 
robert blattner a spokesman at twa headquarters in st louis 
identified the wouldbe hijacker as felix sanchez rodriguez 26 who 
left cuba during the 1980 mariel boatlift 
larry torrence of the fbis miami office said the suspect 
remained in grand turk and extradition proceedings were scheduled to 
begin today a device that rodriguez claimed to be a bomb proved to 
be harmless officials said 
blattner said rodriguez apparently wanted to return to cuba to 
see his ailing mother 
a couple of times he leaned over some people and told them 
everythings going to be all right said passenger tom patri 
the pilot of the flight 469 was able to get permission to land on 
grand turk island where police were able to convince rodriguez he 
was in havana miller said 
luis carlos motta of cali colombia who acted as an interpreter 
during the hijacking said rodriguez tapped him on the shoulder and 
gave him a letter that said in red ink this is a hijacking he 
told motta he had a bomb and said it would be activated by his watch 
he said i want to stay in cuba please tell the captain we go 
to cuba according to motta motta said the man was very nervous 
and that the plane banked to land on the first island it approached 
as they landed he saw a fire engine and several cars and said 
really we are not in cuba i know the cars in cuba motta said 
the pilot and the interpreter convinced him that a civilian would 
have to greet him and when he left the plane he was arrested motta 
said 
it was the first hijacking of a domestic us flight since may 3 
1986 when a man hijacked a horizon air commuter jet with 11 other 
passengers and two crewmembers en route to medford ore and 
demanded to go to phoenix the plane landed at hillsboro ore and 
the hijacker was arrested 
hijackings to cuba were common in the late 1960s and early 70s 
prompting the security measures now commonplace at airports the 
only previous hijacking involving a us commercial flight this year 
occurred in october when three soldiers in haiti stormed aboard an 
american airlines jetliner for new york during a period of political 
turmoil in their country 
on may 25 a flight mechanic without a pilots license stole a 
private jet in newport news va and took it on a 1600mile 
joyride to denver where he shot himself as authorities closed in

strewn throughout the charred watersoaked 
debris of what hours before had been a thriving street market were 
the fireworks that set the market and five buildings ablaze 
it happened sunday the eve of the day of virgin of guadalupe 
one of the ways mexicans honor their patron saint is by shooting 
skyrockets roman candles and other fireworks they keep firing them 
sporadically through new years 
though barred by a littleenforced law fireworks abound in 
markets like that on corona street especially during national and 
religious holidays 
a woman of about 60 said authorities have sometimes confiscated 
the fireworks 
this year there was nobody nobody came to take the fireworks 
away she said the street was completely full of fireworks it 
was full of people the day of guadalupe so many dead my god 
authorities early today didnt know what ignited the fireworks 
triggering the series of explosions and fire that killed at least 70 
people 
some witnesses said a spilled gas tank was to blame others a 
carelessly tossed cigarette but the fire scarred both sides of 
corona street whipping through the wellknown candy market an 
apartment building two other structures containing apartments and 
shops and yet another where fireworks were stored and sold 
all these people it took away part of their lives said 
marcel guera who has a market stall and ran to the scene after the 
first explosion they lost everything and they live from one day 
to the next 
red cross rescue worker antonio guayaberra said 22 of the victims 
died in one structure next to the apartment building 
most of those found dead there were huddled together burned 
he said 
many of them were on upper floors and apparently had shut 
themselves inside the building to escape the flames dense curtain 
of smoke and popping fireworks outside guayaberra said 
the smoke lifted to reveal the remnants of a bustling marketplace 
a childs pail lay on its side in the muck nearby a pair of 
womens shoes on a table sat blackened soot in the classic pyramid 
shape that fruit sellers use red yellow and blue berries and the 
candy corona street was known for were scattered about red and 
silver christmas rope draped across the remains of a food stand 
dozens of gasoline cans like those used to cook tacos and other 
typical mexican fare at openair stands littered the street 
and everywhere in the grime of corona street and an adjacent 
alleyway were chinese firecrackers skyrockets and roman candles

mayor eugene sawyer launched a bid to stay in 
office saying he had kept our city together in troubled times 
after the death of mayor harold washington 
sawyer announced his candidacy sunday for next years special 
election as a new poll showed him trailing cook county states 
attorney richard m daley in a oneonone race for the democratic 
nomination 
i look forward to the contest i know it wont be easy 
sawyer told about 700 supporters at a rally at a downtown hotel i 
need your help and your hard work and your prayers 
sawyer 54 enters a field of six other candidates who have 
announced they are vying for his job the election will be for a 
twoyear term the remainder of washingtons second fouryear term 
in the past 12 months i have been on the firing line day in an 
day out he told his supporters ive taken some shots fairly 
and unfairly but i have kept our city together and weve made great 
progress through some very difficult times 
sawyer was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen during a 
raucous city council meeting last december after washington the 
citys first black mayor died of a heart attack 
the new mayoral poll published in sundays chicago tribune 
showed daley beating sawyer by a margin of 59 percent to 30 percent 
daley is the son of legendary mayor richard j daley who ruled 
chicago for more than 20 years until his death in 1976 
the telephone survey of 1038 registered chicago voters showed 
daley beating alderman timothy evans sawyers chief rival for the 
support of black voters by a 5634 margin sawyer and evans are 
black 
jesse jackson would give daley the toughest opposition in the 
mayoral race garnering 40 percent to daleys 52 percent according 
to the poll which was conducted dec 25 and has a margin of error 
of plus or minus 3 percentage points 
jackson on saturday said he was not a candidate 
political analysts said the survey was very early and did not 
mean much 
i dont put much stock in december polls when the election is 
the last day of february said paul green a professor of political 
science at governors state university in suburban university park 
last month the illinois supreme court set april 4 as the date 
for a special election the democratic primary is scheduled for feb 
28 
green said sawyer has between 2 million and 3 million in a 
campaign war chest hes got a large kitty so obviously hes 
going to be able to get his message across the analyst said 
the democratic primary has generally been tantamount to winning 
the general election in chicagos recent history but that changed 
somewhat in 1983 when a white republican candidate made a strong 
showing in a losing effort against washington 
the other announced democratic candidates are aldermen lawrence 
bloom edward burke and danny davis and former state sen james 
taylor 
former chicago parks superintendent edmund kelly withdrew from 
the democratic field the day after daley announced his candidacy and 
the chicago suntimes on sunday said burke also quit the race 
edward howlett son of a former democratic secretary of state is 
the only announced gop candidate

in an unexpected move a court 
today granted bail to a prominent union leader and four other black 
activists held for up to 30 months while on trial for treason 
the johannesburg supreme court granted bail to moses mayekiso 
head of the countrys largest metalworkers union and four 
codefendants charged with attempting a political takeover of 
alexandra an inpoverished black township adjoining johannesburg 
mayekiso was released on bail of 10000 rand or 4200 the 
others each paid 2100 four of the men including mayekiso spent 
more than 900 days in custody while the fifth had been held almost 
700 days 
the case was adjourned last month and is to resume in february 
the trial has attracted international attention due to mayekisos 
position as general secretary of the national union of metalworkers 
of south africa and because many activists view the prosecution as 
an attempt to stifle peaceful antiapartheid activity 
conditions of bail bar the defendants from entering alexandra 
addressing meetings or granting press interviews 
the government alleges that the defendants organized rent and 
consumer boycotts and sought to undermine the security forces in 
1985 and 1986 the height of nationwide black unrest 
alexandra was one of the most militant townships at the time and 
dozens of people were killed in clashes with security forces 
in several recent court cases authorities have taken actions 
designed to give the appearance of leniency toward antiapartheid 
activists 
last week a judge in pretoria sentenced four prominent activists 
to prison terms of six to 12 years following their conviction on 
treason in a threeyear trial most observers expected the sentences 
to be much harsher 
in november president pw botha granted clemency to the 
sharpeville six a group of blacks convicted of murder in the mob 
killing of a black township councilor their deaths sentences 
provoked an international outcry and botha decided to give them 
lengthy prison sentences instead 
in the past two years the government has sought to restore 
control by detaining or restricting leaders of mayekisos alexandra 
action committee while undertaking a 38 million development program 
in the township 
alexandra wedged between affluent white suburbs is one of the 
countrys most squalid urban townships many of the 120000 
residents lack electricity and toilets and water comes from 
communal taps

sixth woman in woods near this old fishing port and authorities 
said they had developed a list of suspects in the slayings 
bristol county district attorney ronald pina says at least five 
murders were likely committed by the same killer or killers at 
least three victims were known to have ties to a seedy area known 
for prostitution and drug sales 
we have a list of potential suspects there are people who are 
known to do things like this and there are people who are giving us 
some information pina said sunday in a news conference at the 
site where the sixth body was found 
nearby police were still collecting parts of the badly 
decomposed female body from a gravel pit in the wooded area near

the labor party and the likud bloc renewed 
negotiations today on forming a joint government and officials said 
a major point of conflict involved rightwing plans to build 40 
jewish settlements in the occupied territories 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud and foreign 
minister shimon peres of the leftleaning labor ordered talks 
restarted sunday night after a 10day lull 
the party chiefs set up threemember negotiating teams to 
finalize a coalition agreement that would bring the countrys two 
largest political blocs back into a broadbased government 
israel radio said the two teams met in secret locations today and 
focused on guidelines for a new government the radio said there was 
growing pressure for peres to become finance minister a less 
prestigious post than his current position as foreign minister 
the radio said the negotiators agreed to continue the 10member 
inner cabinet with equal representation from both parties the body 
decides major security and foreign policy issues 
the liberal daily haaretz said today the two parties have agreed 
to set a timetable for dealing with electoral reform which appeared 
aimed at reducing the influence of small religious parties that 
currently hold the balance of power 
shamir has been trying to forge a government since likud won a 
slight edge over labor 40 seats to 39 in the nov 1 election for 
the 120member parliament 
in an apparent effort to avoid making concessions on religious 
and political issues some of which deeply angered american jews 
shamir turned back to labor after appearing close to an agreement 
with small religious and nationalist parties 
likuds talks with the small parties continue however and 
officials close to shamir did not rule out the small parties joining 
whatever government is formed 
yossi ahimeir a shamir adviser expressed the hope that talks 
with labor could be wrapped up in two or three days but a peres 
aide who demanded anonymity predicted negotiations would go down to 
the dec 26 deadline when shamir must present a new government 
ahimeir said the policy guidelines should be substantially the 
same as those laid down for the current coalition government which 
was formed after stalemated elections in 1984 
some adjustments and additions are needed for example we 
insist that more emphasis be given to building new jewish villages 
in the west bank and gaza as economic conditions allow he said 
however ahimeir said shamir did not favor unlimited settlement 
building he indicated that if labor joined the government likud 
would not be obligated to carry out an agreement with tehiya a 
prosettlement party to build 40 new settlements 
an official close to peres said likud would have to break its 
agreement with tehiya if likud doesnt break the promise there 
is no way labor can enter he said 
there are more than 130 jewish settlements with about 70000 jews 
living in the west bank and gaza strip occupied by israel in the 
1967 middle east war they are surrounded by 15 million 
palestinians 
ahimeir said likud wanted to preserve existing policy guidelines 
on the peace issue shamir demands direct talks between israel and 
the arabs whereas peres supports an international conference as an 
opening for those talks 
an official close to peres indicated one way to bridge the gap 
might be to propose talks under joint sovietamerican sponsorship 
the attitude towards the soviets is different today so maybe 
this will help he said 
shamir also will insist that any new policy initiatives be 
cleared in advance with the prime minister but israeli newspapers 
indicated labor wanted freedom of maneuver to explore peace options 
and other political policy issues 
labor officials indicated they would insist on the right to vote 
against religious legislation such as the socalled who is a jew 
bill which proposes giving israels orthodox rabbinate final say 
over the sensitive issue of conversions

solidarity leader lech walesa said today his 
outlawed trade union is ready for talks on reforming the polish 
system and strikes should be a last resort 
the nobel peace prize winner spoke before returning home from his 
first trip abroad since martial law was imposed in poland in 1981 
by allowing him to travel authorities gave implicit recognition of 
walesas importance as a public figure 
president francois mitterrand invited walesa to attend ceremonies 
saturday marking the 40th anniversary of the universal declaration 
of human rights 
there is a reform process that we want to speed up and the 
fact that we are here is evidence of a quickening said walesa 
on nov 30 walesa debated the chief of polands communistbacked 
official union in a live broadcast on national television the 
uncensored debate was the first time since 1983 that the solidarity 
leader has appeared on polish television 
walesa said the polish system is moving in a good direction 
but it is going by foot while the rest of the world is going by car 
it is necessary to accelerate the process 
poland needs peace and pluralism there is a place for both 
prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski and solidarity he said 
walesa said he continued to favor negotiations to include the 
government church and opposition 
the government offered to hold the talks following two waves of 
strikes this year but the talks reached an impasse after the 
government refused to legalize the banned union and solidarity 
demanded a signal the government would consider the legalization 
before it would enter talks 
he said the discussion was still necessary my union has wanted 
it for a long time but we should be considered free and 
independent under this condition we are ready right away he said 
poland doesnt need any more strikes now because strikes are a 
last resort walesa said 
he said the union should struggle to get the most we can for 
ourselves but we also should remember to behave like good 
microorganisms and not destroy the system that we live in 
during his visit the smiling and ebullient walesa met soviet 
dissident physicist andrei sakharov for the first time 
the men both nobel laureates and leading dissidents exchanged 
impressions of the fight for human rights in poland and the soviet 
union walesa said today he hoped to maintain contact with sakharov 
hes a great thinker and a great great man but i dont know 
what the possibilities will be for keeping in touch 
solidarity adviser bronsilaw gemerek said walesa earlier in the 
day was at the departure of a truck loaded with supplies for victims 
of the armenian earthquake he said walesa sent a letter on the 
truck to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to express his 
solidarity with the soviet people

the supreme court in a case capturing the 
attention of some leading universities agreed today to study a 
universitys attempt to withhold confidential information from a 
faculty member who says her denial of tenure was due to illegal 
discrimination 
the court said it will hear an appeal by university of 
pennsylvania officials accused of discriminating against a chinese 
woman denied promotion to full professor 
but the justices indicated that they will be studying a very 
narrow issue in the case one dealing with which trial court had 
the authority to hear it 
the universitys appeal was supported by princeton brown 
stanford harvard and yale lawyers for the other schools said that 
forcing universities to reveal confidential statements about those 
being considered for professorships will inhibit candor by those who 
evaluate tenure candidates 
the case began with a complaint by rosalie tung an associate 
professor of management at penn after she was denied tenure at the 
universitys wharton school 
tenure is a lifetime appointment to the faculty 
ms tung filed a complaint with the federal equal employment 
opportunity commission charging she was the victim of discrimination 
against women and people of asian race 
the commission subpoenaed the universitys confidential peer 
review records for ms tung and five other male candidates 
considered for tenure 
the university refused to provide the documents it said 
confidentiality is vital to the tenure review process which in turn 
is a critical component of the universitys academic freedom 
protected by the constitution 
university officials supported a balancing test approved by 
other federal appeals courts that would allow the school to keep 
the information secret unless it is shown to be essential to the 
claim being made by the teacher denied tenure 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled last june that the 
university must not be allowed to shield possible discrimination 
behind a wall of secrecy 
the appeals court said relevant information may not be concealed 
from the commission but the appeals court ordered further trial 
court hearings to determine whether the university may be allowed to 
delete from the peer review reports the names of professors who 
evaluate tenure candidates 
the reagan administration urged the supreme court to allow the 
appeals court ruling to stand 
justice department lawyers noted that the high court in 1986 
declined to review the issue in a similar case they said there is 
no more reason now for the court to enter the dispute 
the case is university of pennsylvania vs eeoc 88493

the last seven bodies were discovered shortly after 3 am 4 
am est in a storeroom of illegal fireworks many of the other 
dead were found in the rubble of candy vendors stalls 
it was a time bomb said elizabeth diaz a member of a union 
of market vendors theres hundreds of people who come here to 
sell them illegal fireworks they have for years why didnt the 
authorities come 
authorities said they had not determined the cause of the 
disaster and witnesses disagreed on where the first explosion 
occurred 
but all said that after the first blast explosions ripped like 
machinegun fire through stalls where vendors had been selling 
skyrockets roman candles and other fireworks 
at first it sounded like bullets then there were more and more 
and then the explosion said fernando dominguez who was working 
in a shoe store 
selling fireworks to the general public is barred in mexico city 
but the law is widely ignored 
the fire ripped through the congested market and five adjacent 
buildings which are half a mile from the zocalo plaza in the heart 
of mexico city 
the area was crowded with shoppers buying food looking for 
christmas presents and for fireworks to celebrate the day of the 
virgin of guadalupe mexicos patron saint which is today 
people were running out of the market and screaming said 
oscar cordero 25 standing by the pile of debris that had been his 
stand and stock of calculators and other electronic goods 
the block on corona street was one of scores in the old downtown 
where vendors set up tables in the street it is one of the busiest 
market areas in this city of 18 million and is most famous for the 
mercado de dulces or candy market one of the buildings that was 
partially burned 
many people died when they were trapped in buildings along the 
street that caught fire the fire spread to the fivestory candy 
market an apartment building and three other buildings 
after the fire was out firefighters and sanitation workers used 
dollies to remove dozens of crates of unexploded fireworks from the 
area and the work continued under floodlights through the night 
the street was strewn with spent firecrackers charred wood and 
comic books twisted metal tangles of high tension wires and glass 
from shattered windows 
although illegal fireworks are easily purchased and are a strong 
tradition on the day of guadalupe one of the countrys biggest 
religious holidays they are heard sporadically in the city from 
dec 12 through new years 
heres its all clandestine said rutilo ayala a policeman 
at the scene they sell rockets and hide them under pastas fruit 
and whatever else they sell 
its a case of corruption said angelica peredo who lives 
next to one of the buildings that burned 
residents and market vendors vented their anger at mayor manuel 
camacho solis as he plodded through the watersoaked debris a yard 
deep in places 
many children died here mr mayor said one man 
the mayor who took office dec 1 promised to look for a 
solution to the problem 
district attorney ignacio morales lechuga said fireworks are too 
much of a tradition to do away with 
this does not mean there is going to be an attack on mexican 
culture he said these things fireworks are part of mexican 
culture 
everado gamiz fernandez a municipal leader admitted that 
inspections in the market were not frequent and that there might be 
2000 fireworks vendors in his district 
there arent enough resources to inspect and watch here every 
day and night he said theyve always sold fireworks here

doctors and nurses worked double shifts over the 
weekend as hundreds of poor women had abortions before a new state 
ban on medicaid funding for the procedure took effect today 
it will be some time before the effect of the ban can be 
evaluated but some clinic operators say the measure approved by 
michigan voters in the nov 8 election wont decrease the number of 
poor women having abortions 
a lot of prolifers say this is going to hurt us but i dont 
think it will said dave williams a spokesman for womens health 
services of detroit ive had women tell me theyve sold crack 
cocaine to get the money if they know they want to terminate 
it theyll get the money 
at womancare clinics which perform most of the medicaidfunded 
abortions in the state doctors and nurses worked double shifts to 
perform the operation during the weekend owner dr abraham hodari 
said 
the clinics were prepared to perform 120 abortions friday and 
saturday about 50 percent more than the normal twoday total he 
said 
kim evans a woman answering calls at a womancare office today 
was unable to say how many abortions were actually performed 
hodari said with the ban in effect he would perform abortions 
for 50 for medicaid recipients 
during the years i did this on medicaid i saved a lot of 
money he said now i want to help people with it 
proponents of the ban said the state spent 6 million on medicaid 
abortions last year for about 18000 poor women 
some forecasts show the state now will have to pay between 10 
million and 50 million because of more medicaid births and children 
born into poverty state medicaid director kevin seitz said 
in states where medicaidfunded abortions have ended such as 
ohio and georgia studies show about 20 percent of medicaideligible 
women who carried pregnancies to term would probably have had 
abortions had they been free 
the cost to taxpayers for a medicaid abortion averages 318 in 
michigan state medicaid administrator esther reagan said the cost 
for a medicaid recipient who delivers a baby averages 3100 for 
health care and hospitalization 
a 19yearold who had an abortion friday at the womancare clinic 
in southfield said she would have terminated her pregnancy even 
without medicaid financing 
id have found the money somewhere said the woman who 
identified herself only as lisa i dont know where though

the supreme court already having ruled that 
privacy rights do not extend to garbage left at curbside for 
pickup today refused to treat differently garbage discarded closer 
to home 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that a 
convicted fremont neb man had no privacy right in garbage cans 
left outside for collection four feet from his homes back door 
unlike the courts decision last may in a case from california 
todays order sets no national precedent 
but it defeats randall trahans challenge to his conviction for 
possession of cocaine and gambling records and for promoting 
gambling 
fremont police and dodge county sheriffs deputies without 
obtaining a court warrant searched through the contents of garbage 
left outside trahans trailer home and outside the tavern he and his 
roommate owned 
they found bet sheets used by bookmakers 
police previously had been tipped that trahan was involved in 
bookmaking 
after obtaining a search warrant law enforcement officers raided 
trahans home they found gambling materials and some cocaine inside 
trahan was sentenced to three years probation 
the nebraska supreme court upheld trahans conviction and 
sentence last sept 2 rejecting arguments that the warrantless 
search of the garbage left for collection on his property violated 
his privacy rights 
the nations highest court voted 62 last may 16 in ruling that 
police do not need a warrant before sifting through garbage left in 
plastic bags at curbside 
it is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at 
the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals 
children scavengers snoops or other members of the public 
justice byron r white wrote for the court then 
the police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes 
from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by 
any member of the public he said 
the nebraska court said trahans challenge must fail in light of 
the may decision 
garbage left for collection at a designated location and 
accessible to the public shall not be accorded constitutional 
protection whether it is on or off someones private property the 
state court ruled 
the case is trahan vs nebraska 88697

a woman whose annual thanksgivingeve dinners 
for the elderly have attracted thousands of dollars in donations and 
praise from president reagan has been ordered by the state to halt 
fundraising 
and the philadelphia inquirer reported sunday that a detailed 
examination raises questions about most aspects of her operation 
including her claims to feeding thousands her recordkeeping and 
fundraising 
minnie bolds moore has claimed to feed up to 25000 people each 
year far fewer than that showed up this year and while she said 
her charity was deep in debt much of the food was donated 
moore gave inconsistent and sometimes contradictory answers while 
defending the charity she heads concerned parents inc its records 
and the scope of the operation the newspaper reported 
moore did not return phone messages left by the associated press 
moore was unable to say how much concerned parents inc has 
raised or spent in recent years she has kept no ledger she has no 
checking account she makes most of her purchases with cash she 
told the newspaper 
im just terrible with recordkeeping and stuff like that 
she explained adding that she runs essentially a onewoman 
operation 
concerned parents inc has failed to file annual reports required 
by state law and pay its 10 registration fee since 1986 according 
to the commission on charitable organizations which regulates 
charities fundraising 
in march the commission ordered concerned parents to halt 
fundraising until it filed updated reports and renewed its 
registration to operate as a charity 
moore told the inquirer she complied with the letter almost 
immediately but commission officials said they have no reply from 
moore on file 
moore 47 says her annual thanksgivingeve dinners began 
modestly in 1968 when she invited elderly neighbors to share 
thanksgiving dinner with her family 
it has gotten more publicity as it has grown publicity helped 
the charity raise thousands of dollars from hundreds of givers 
moore has two indexcard file boxes filled with their names and 
addresses president reagan has written a letter of praise 
in interviews moore always stresses the financial and logistical 
burden of feeding 25000 people a dinner that includes turkey ham 
roast beef macaroni salad sweet potatoes collard greens and baked 
beans 
this year as in the past she said her menu would include 500 
turkeys 200 hams and 400 steamship rounds of roast beef 
in fact no turkey was served at the dinner although there were 
450 chickens there were only nine canned hams and a dozen rounds of 
roast beef according to a check of the kitchen that day at the 
civic center site of the dinner and interviews with army cooks who 
volunteered to prepare the meal 
there was still more than enough food because far fewer than 
25000 showed up for the dinner 
in an interview the day of the dinner moore said she had raised 
about 23000 for this years meal but was 70000 in debt she 
used identical figures in interviews before the 1987 dinner 
much of the food served this year was donated according to local 
corporations and moore 
the money that we have raised has never covered the cost of the 
meal moore said when we were doing it on our own we were 
always in the hole doing it and weve been in the hole ever since 
moore has two criminal convictions one in 1968 for passing 
worthless checks another in 1979 for her part in a scheme to steal 
158000 in emergency checks from the state public welfare 
department 
she insisted that she got into trouble while trying to help 
others 
i have never done anything to benefit myself personally when 
they investigated it they found it was done to help others

yuri lyubimov the maverick sovietborn theater 
director has left the royal opera house after a dispute over his 
staging of richard wagners the ring of the nibelungs 
jeremy isaacs general director of the opera house in londons 
covent garden said sunday that the 70yearold russian had been 
released from his contract 
isaacs said lyubimov was leaving after intellectual differences 
in artistic interpretation with the royal operas dutchborn music 
director bernard haitink the collaboration could only have 
proceeded if there was absolute confidence between them isaacs 
said 
the ring is a german myth about power struggles among ancient 
gods over a hoard of gold and discord over how to present the work 
is nothing new in the operatic world 
haitink who doesnt like displays of temperament clashed with 
lyubimov over the directors emotive staging ideas and dislike of 
detailed advance planning 
lyubimov and haitink argued interminably during rehearsals 
earlier this year over the staging of the first part of the cycle 
the rhine gold 
the opera opened sept 29 to general acclaim from critics and 
public and every seat was sold for the six performances 
but the crunch came over how the valkyrie the second part of 
the fouropera ring cycle should be presented next year 
they had very different ideas and despite making every 
effort no consensus could be reached said an opera house 
official who asked not to be identified 
thats not uncommon with the ring which is the most 
demanding work in the whole of opera there have been many 
resignations over it in many opera houses in the past the 
official added 
isaacs told a reporter i regret this parting of the ways since 
i admire yuri lyubimovs work very much but i am sure this decision 
is for the best 
lybimov will be replaced by a german director goetz friedrich 
58 said isaacs friedrich staged the the ring at covent garden 
in 19741976 he works for the deutsche oper based in the west 
german cities of duesseldorf and duisburg 
haitink 59 had chosen lyubimov to produce the cycle over a 
fouryear period the valkyrie is scheduled for september 1989 
followed by siegfried and the twilight of the gods in the 
199091 season 
lyubimov scored a hit at the royal opera in 1986 with an 
innovative staging of the czechoslovak opera jenufa by leos 
janacek he is to stage william shakespeares hamlet in 1989 in 
leicester 
lyubimov made his name at moscows avantgarde taganka theater 
which he founded his productions often ran into trouble with 
communist party officials in 1983 lyubimov went to london to stage 
fyodor dostoyevskys crime and punishment and extended his stay 
demanding assurances he would be allowed artistic freedom in the 
soviet union but in 1984 he was fired from his job and expelled 
from the communist party four months later he was stripped of his 
citizenship 
lyubimov later became an israeli citizen in may he visited 
moscow and was given an ovation when he saw a performance at the 
taganka of his play about a rebel soviet poet and singer he is to 
return to moscow in january to direct two plays

the supreme court today refused to reinstate a 
45 million libel award won by a former prosecutor against the 
philadelphia inquirer 
the justices citing the lack of a properly presented federal 
question let stand a pennsylvania supreme court ruling that 
requires a new trial for richard spragues lawsuit against the 
newspaper 
sprague now a philadelphia lawyer in private practice formerly 
served as an assistant district attorney in that city 
he sued the inquirer and several of its reporters and editors 15 
years ago over two series of articles published in late march and 
early april of 1973 
the first series of articles indicated that sprague had 
participated in an illegal wiretapping scheme 
the second series reported that sprague at a time when he headed 
the district attorney offices homocide division had prevented the 
bringing of homicide charges against the son of a pennsylvania state 
police official the series implied that spragues treatment of the 
case was motivated by personal favoritism 
at trial reporter kent pollock testified that information for 
one of the articles about the homicide case came from a confidential 
source he refused to identify the source when spragues lawyers 
demanded he do so 
the trial judge noting that pollock was legally entitled to 
withhold the name under pennsylvanias shield law told jurors 
they should not consider any evidence derived from such sources 
the states shield law similar to those in many states says no 
one connected with a newsgathering organization can be forced to 
disclose confidential sources to any court or government 
investigation 
the jury ruled for sprague awarding him 15 million in 
compensatory damages and 3 million in punitive damages 
a state appeals court threw out the award and ordered a new 
trial and the pennsylvania supreme court upheld that ruling last 
may 31 
the reporters information is properly admitted and no adverse 
inference may be drawn from the invocation of the shield law the 
state court said 
it said jurors should be told that invocation of the shield law 
does not establish an affirmative inference either as to the 
reliability of the source or as to the validity of the information 
received 
plaintiffs and defendants are free to offer evidence or arguments 
about reliability and validity the state court said 
the state supreme court concluded if the shield law is invoked 
by the defendant to avoid disclosing a source no inference either 
favorable or adverse may be drawn as to the reliability of the 
unidentified source or as to the accuracy of the information 
supplied 
the case is sprague vs walter 88671

the supreme court today upheld a voting rights 
ruling that led to the election of a black arkansas house member 
from crittenden county 
the court by an 80 vote ruled against an appeal by gov bill 
clinton and other arkansas officials that had challenged the 
election of ben mcgee as a state legislator 
the case began when blacks in crittenden county filed a voting 
rights lawsuit attacking the countys atlarge system for electing 
two house members 
the suit contended that the system deprived black voters of a 
chance to elect a black to the house 
a special threejudge federal court agreed last april that the 
system violated the federal voting rights act 
the threejudge court threw out the results of a march 8 primary 
election in which mcgee who is black was defeated by james 
stockley who is white for the democratic nomination 
the lower court split the house voting district into two 
singlemember districts and on sept 20 mcgee won the nomination 
that was tantamount to election on nov 8 since no republican ran 
for the seat 
clinton and the other state officials said the federal court 
improperly threw out the results of the first primary and ordered a 
new election 
but the federal court said the voting rights law was violated 
although it did not find intentional discrimination against blacks 
the law does not require minority groups to prove intentional 
discrimination before getting courts to order election changes 
the threejudge court noted that there is ample evidence that 
black voters in crittenden county were deprived of a chance to elect 
one of their own it said its conclusion is supported by evidence of 
highly racially polarized voting 
one of the new singlemember districts created by the lower court 
has a population of more than 60 percent black 
todays decision not accompanied by any opinion upheld the 
threejudge court ruling justice william j brennan hospitalized 
last week for treatment of pneumonia did not participate in the 
vote 
the case is clinton vs smith 88554

the supreme court in a case it previously used 
to give military contractors sweeping immunity from being sued 
today rejected an appeal by a family seeking damages for the death 
of a marine helicopter copilot 
the court without comment refused to order a new trial in a 
lawsuit stemming from a 1983 helicopter crash in the atlantic ocean 
near virginia beach va 
a federal jury in 1985 ordered helicopter manufacturer sikorsky 
aircraft to pay 725000 to the family of david boyle who drowned 
april 27 1983 when his ch53 helicopter crashed 
boyle and the three other crew members survived the crash impact 
the three others escaped through emergency hatches but boyle was 
unable to open his hatch against the pressure of the water 
his family said the design was defective arguing the hatch 
should have opened inward to permit escape 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in may 1986 threw out the 
jury award against sikorsky and its parent company united 
technologies corp 
the supreme court in an important 54 ruling last june 
substantially upheld the appeals court decision the high court said 
a military contractor is protected from suit when it makes equipment 
conforming to reasonably precise pentagon specifications and the 
company warns the government about any potential dangers of which 
the company is aware 
but the justices sent the case back to the 4th circuit court to 
determine whether the appeals court improperly acted as a trial 
court and decided factual issues 
the 4th circuit court said in august it did not usurp the jurys 
function 
no reasonable jury could have found for the boyle family on 
the facts presented the appeals court said it is clear in this 
case that the military contractor defense was established as a 
matter of law 
in its latest appeal to the supreme court the boyle family 
argued there are factual issues that should be submitted to a jury 
the family said for example there is a question whether the 
government actually approved sikorskys design and whether the 
governments specifications for the escape hatch were reasonably 
precise 
the case is boyle vs united technologies 88677

official estimates put the death toll 
from the armenian earthquake at up to 60000 today and hopes waned 
that any more survivors would be found a second relief plane 
crashed near the armenian capital killing seven people 
renewed political trouble broke out with armenian activists 
reporting clashes with troops over the arrest of several nationalist 
leaders 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev after touring the disaster 
area accused provocateurs of using the consequences of last 
weeks earthquake to create instability and insisted they must be 
stopped 
one armenian activist who avoided arrest raphael popoyan said 
by telephone today that three demonstrations were staged sunday in 
the armenian capital of yerevan 
he said all were protesting the arrest of leaders of a committee 
that has spearheaded a drive to annex nagornokarabakh a 
predominantly armenian enclave in azerbaijan in one demonstration 
troops and demonstrators began fighting and several were wounded on 
both sides popoyan said 
an editor at armenpress the armenian news agency confirmed 
there was violence at one demonstration but said the incident did 
not appear serious the editor who spoke on condition of anonymity 
acknowledged soldiers fired several warning shots to break up the 
protest he confirmed that police detained several leaders of the 
nagornokarabakh committee on saturday 
a dozen tanks were parked in yerevans central square sunday 
night 
before dawn today a yugoslav military plane crashed while trying 
to land at yerevan airport with medical supplies the second crash 
of a relief plane in as many days on sunday a soviet military 
transport plane crashed as it approached the airport at leninakan a 
city hard hit by wednesdays quake seventyeight people died 
all seven crew members aboard the an12 cargo plane died in 
todays crash first deputy aviation minister boris banyukov said 
local reporters said the plane crashed at 4 am because the 
pilot mistook a welllit highway for a runway 
the yugoslav plane was part of an international relief effort 
council of ministers spokesman lev voznesensky told a news 
conference in moscow that 38 relief planes have arrived from abroad 
with the most six from france he and other officials said 923 
specialists from abroad with 216 search dogs were working in the 
disaster area 
meanwhile a spokesman for the genevabased league of red cross 
and red crescent societies said in yerevan there was little hope 
more survivors would be found in the rubble piled high in several 
armenian cities including leninakan near the quakes epicenter 
and spitak which was virtually wiped out 
the spokesman george reid said only people trapped who managed 
to find water and had an air supply would survive 
reid quoted reports that only 150 people survived in spitak 
where some 25000 people lived before the quake other reports said 
only 10 percent of the population remained 
an associated press reporter visiting spitak found a nearly 
deserted wasteland she said only a few hundred residents remained 
bitter cold weather was forecast for armenia overnight worsening 
conditions for the 500000 people left homeless by the quake the 
soviet meteorological center said the temperature in yerevan would 
drop to 14 to 23 degrees fahrenheit the center did not have weather 
information for the disaster area itself but temperatures there 
have generally been even lower 
hundreds of bonfires provided the only heat for some people who 
have lived on the streets since the quake 
the earthquake rescue effort drawing workers and supplies from 
about 40 nations has been hampered by shortages of equipment and 
haphazard organization some officials said 
some aid that proved useless a crane sat idle besides the ruins 
in leninakan workers said it was too small 
without electricity or water red cross rescuers worked around 
the clock by the eerie light of campfires on sunday with the aid 
of search dogs they pulled out of the rubble a man in his 30s who 
had broken bones in his legs but did not appear seriously injured 
gorbachev and international rescue workers warned of the danger 
of epidemics breaking out but one relief official from the united 
nations sverre kilde said the danger was substantially reduced by 
subfreezing temperatures in most of the region which would inhibit 
the growth of diseasecarrying organisms 
gorbachev wound up a twoday visit to the disaster area sunday 
and called the earthquake which measured 69 on the richter scale 
a grave disaster simply a tragedy 
doctors without borders an international relief organization 
said in amsterdam that health minister yevgeny i chazov told 
workers the quake had claimed 50000 to 60000 lives the previous 
government estimate was 40000 to 45000 
the soviet embassy in washington said about 500000 were left 
homeless and 6000 people were hospitalized it said 1500 people 
had been rescued 
mayor emil kirokofyan of leninakan told a group of foreign 
correspondents that recently constructed apartment buildings were 
not built to withstand such a severe temblor even though leninakan 
is in an area of frequent earthquakes 
gorbachev promised residents of the disaster zone that the 
government would begin an investigation of why new apartment 
buildings crumbled so easily while older buildings remained standing 
after the quake 
officials and rescuers pleaded for more cranes and heavy 
equipment to drag slabs of concrete and twisted pillars off trapped 
people 
at one site rescuers worked feverishly with saws torches 
hammers and crowbars to free a family of seven discovered near the 
top of what was a ninestory apartment building 
the earthquake aggravated an already severe refugee problem in 
armenia where thousands of ethnic armenians fled because of 
antiarmenian rioting in the neighboring republic of azerbaijan

the supreme court today asked the reagan 
administration for its view of a fine of nearly 1 million against a 
maryland paper mill operator for failing to comply with a federal 
clean water laws reporting requirements 
the court said it wants to hear from justice department lawyers 
before acting on a challenge to a key provision of the act 
authorizing citizens and environmental groups to sue alleged 
polluters 
the court is not expected to say whether it will grant full 
review to the case before hearing from the administration which 
could take months 
simkins industries inc runs a paper mill in catonsville md on 
the banks of the patapsco river 
the sierra club sued the company for failing to monitor and file 
quarterly reports on discharges into the river from aug 1 1981 to 
march 31 1984 
under the federal clean water act the companys permit to 
operate the mill required it to monitor discharges and report them 
simkins faced fines of up to 10000 a day or a total of 977 
million a federal judge assessed penalties of onetenth that 
amount 977000 payable to the us treasury 
there was testimony that the companys plant supervisor did not 
regard sampling of its discharges as a priority 
the sierra club based in california with members nationwide 
charged that simkins had discharged copper into the patapso at 
10000 times the safe levels for fresh water and that oil and 
grease in the river from the mill were twice the allowable limit 
the company said the sierra club did not have the legal authority 
to sue it because the club suffered no direct injury and also that 
the suit should be dismissed because it was filed after simkins 
stopped violating the laws reporting requirements 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last may upheld the fine 
the appeals court said the sierra club established that at least 
one of its members who uses the patapsco river for recreation was 
injured by simkins violations 
fines for failure to monitor and report possible pollution can 
be an important deterrence against future violations the appeals 
court added 
the appeals court citing a 1987 supreme court decision said 
such private citizen suits under the clean water law may not be 
based upon wholly past violations 
the appeals court added that simkins was violating the law at the 
time the suit was filed in late 1984 the company did not file a 
complete quarterly report until january 1985 nearly three months 
after the sierra club filed suit 
it is true that simkins failure to sample occurred solely 
before sierra club filed suit the appeals court said but 
simkins monitoring obgligations were not designed to be a mere 
academic exercise 
unless a permit holder monitors as required it will be 
difficult if not impossible for state and federal officialsto 
know whether or not the permit holder is discharging effluents in 
excess of the permits maximum levels 
the appeals court also noted that simkins began monitoring its 
discharges after it was alerted by the sierra club that it was about 
to be sued 
the case is simkins vs sierra club 88660

justice minister elisabeth kopp 
announced today she is resigning because of controversy over a 
telephone call in which she advised her husband to break with a 
company accused in a drug money laundering scandal 
the 52yearold kopp first woman to join the federal executive 
only last wednesday was elected vice president a post that rotates 
annually and would have made her eligible to become president in 
1990 
she announced she will step down as head of the justice and 
police ministry by the end of february because she has come under 
unbearable pressure 
i am not morally and legally guilty of any wrongdoing she 
said in a statement adding that a brief oct 27 telephone 
conversation with her husband had gained disproportionate 
importance 
in the telephone call she disclosed friday she warned her 
husband hans w kopp to give up his seat on the board of the 
lebanesecontrolled zurichbased shakarchi trading ag 
a few days later prosecutors announced they had opened an 
inquiry into a 1billion money laundering operation and accused 
shakarchi of involvement the company denies the charge 
kopp who resigned from the board a week before news of the 
inquiry broke said he did so for personal reasons and that he had 
no knowledge of any illegal activities by the company 
mrs kopp said she warned her husband after her personal 
assistant told her privately of the suspicions about shakarchi she 
maintained she had no official information and did not violate the 
trust of her office 
a public opinion poll three months ago named her the most popular 
cabinet member but her revelation caused an uproar believed without 
precedent in switzerland even members of her own conservative 
radical democratic party urged mrs kopp to step down 
a government spokesman said president otto stich thanked mrs 
kopp for her work and said she continued to command the confidence 
of her cabinet colleagues 
government spokesman achille casanova quoted interior minister 
flavio cotti as saying mrs kopp did not resign because of the 
case but because of the climate

the supreme court avoiding a decision on an 
important issue for all lawsuits alleging age bias in employment 
today dismissed the case of a laidoff pennsylvania man 
by an 81 vote the justices said in effect that they had made a 
mistake when agreeing to decide whether eugene f briecks lawsuit 
against his former employer harbisonwalker refractories should 
proceed to trial 
the courts action was carried in a onesentence unsigned 
decision dismissing the case as improvidently granted justice 
byron r white dissented 
the effect is to leave intact an appeals court victory for brieck 
that clears the way for further trial court proceedings in his case 
harbisonwalker a division of dresser industries sells 
specialized ceramic brick products primarily to steel producers 
brieck worked as an installation specialist for harbisonwalker from 
1965 to 1982 
in july 1982 several employees of harbisonwalkers iron and 
steel marketing support group were laid off including brieck he 
then was 55 
brieck sued in pittsburgh in 1984 contending that he was laid 
off and not recalled to work because of his age his lawsuit pointed 
to a 39yearold installation specialist with less seniority who was 
not laid off until november 1982 and then recalled eight months 
later 
lawyers for harbisonwalker contended that the other employee 
hugh faust was retained because of his more diverse work experience 
a federal judge threw out briecks suit ruling that 
harbisonwalker had articulated legitimate nondiscriminatory 
business reasons for laying off brieck while retaining a younger man 
with less seniority 
but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals reinstated the suit 
last year 
the appeals court ruled that an employer charged with violating 
the federal age discrimination in employment act cannot avoid trial 
by articulating legitimate business reasons if the suing employee 
presents a reasonable inference that the employers proffered 
explanation is unworthy of credence 
the appeals court added the question is not whether the 
employers asserted reason is plausible but whether there is also 
evidence of record which if credited could render the reason 
implausible 
lawyers for harbisonwalker had argued in a session before the 
justices oct 31 that the appeals court ruling would virtually 
eliminate pretrial dismissals in employment discrimination cases 
the case is harbisonwalker vs brieck 87271

incumbent ghulam ishaq khan easily won 
a fiveyear term as pakistans president today and prime minister 
benazir bhutto scored a victory in her first parliamentary vote of 
confidence 
federal election commissioner sa nusrat said on television that 
ishaq khan swept 78 percent of the presidential vote 
of 446 valid votes ishaq khan polled 348 compared with 91 to his 
nearest rival veteran politican nawabzada nasrullah khan nusrat 
said 
ms bhutto won her first test of strength in the national 
assembly the countrys lower house of parliament 
of 203 members voting on the confidence motion 148 said yes 
and 55 said no 
her pakistan peoples party party emerged as the largest single 
party nov 16 in the countrys first free elections in more than a 
decade but with 105 seats it fell short of an outright majority in 
the 237seat legislature the party since gained support from 
several independents and minor parties 
the constitution dictates that the governing party pass a 
parliamentary test of confidence within 60 days of forming a 
government 
the senate national assembly and four provincial assemblies 
functioned as an electoral college for the president 
provincial assemblies were restricted to 45 votes each to put 
them on equal footing the populous eastern punjab assembly has 260 
members for example compared to western baluchistans 45 
legislators 
of the four presidential candidates only ishaq khan 73 of the 
conservative pakistan muslim league had the support both of ms 
bhuttos party and the rightwing opposition alliance headed by the 
muslim league 
ishaq khan has been credited with guiding pakistan back to 
democracy after 11 years of autocratic rule eight of them under 
martial law by president mohammed zia ulhaq 
zia died in an aug 17 plane crash investigators said was 
probably caused by sabotage 
because he was senate chairman the presidency was passed to 
ishaq khan a venerable technocrat and constitutional scholar with 
nearly 40 years experience in senior administrative posts six of 
them as finance and commerce minister 
pakistans president holds a largely ceremonial post but the 
roles of both president and prime minister are under debate here 
a 1985 constitutional amendment authored by zia gave the 
president broad but vague discretionary powers 
ms bhutto has called for a repeal of that amendment which would 
restore supreme political powers to the prime minister as they 
existed during her fathers government of the 1970s 
zia ousted ms bhuttos father zulfikar ali bhutto in 1977 he 
had bhutto executed two years later allegedly for plotting to 
overthrow a political foe

a man facing execution after midnight 
for a 1982 robberymurder sought a stay from the us supreme court 
today while a second execution that had been scheduled for the same 
time already was postponed 
raymond landry 39 faces lethal injection for the shooting death 
of houston restaurant owner kosmas prittis prittis 33 a greek 
immigrant was robbed of more than 2300 and fatally shot in the 
head

texas attorney general jim mattox has labeled landry the most 
likely of the nine texas death row inmates with execution dates to 
be put to death 
landrys attorney michael charlton bypassed lower federal 
courts and appealed directly to the high court 
if his execution scheduled for early tuesday goes ahead landry 
would be the third inmate to be put to death in texas this year and 
the 29th more than any other state since the supreme court ruled 
in 1976 that capital punishment in the united states could be 
resumed 
another convicted killer samuel hawkins known as the

the supreme court in a ruling likely to mean 
millions of additonal dollars for some hospitals today barred the 
government from retroactively applying rules limiting reimbursement 
paid to hospitals treating medicare patients 
by a 90 vote the court rejected reagan administration arguments 
that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive 
application of the governments reimbursement formula 
the justices upheld a ruling that awarded more than 2 million to 
seven hospitals the administration said more money could be at 
stake 
the government in 1981 adopted a rule that excluded from the 
medicare reimbursement formula for private hospitals the wages paid 
by hospitals owned by the federal government 
the idea was to save money by not applying national pay scales to 
private hospitals in areas with lower wage levels 
but the department of health and human services adopted the new 
rule without allowing a time for the public to comment on the 
proposal the formula was challenged by private hospitals and thrown 
out by a federal judge as a violation of proper rulemaking 
procedures 
the federal agency adopted the rule again in 1984 using the 
correct procedure but this time the department applied the rule 
retroactively to reimbursement sought by the hospitals beginning 
july 1 1981 
the supreme court today upheld a ruling by the us circuit court 
of appeals here that the formula may not be applied retroactively 
our interpretation of the medicare act compels the conclusion 
that the secretary of hhs has no authority to promulgate 
retroactive costlimit rules said justice anthony m kennedy for 
the court 
the hospitals involved in the case are georgetown university 
hospital and howard university hospital here tucson ariz 
general greater southeast community tucson medical center st 
cloud minn hospital and community hospital of battle creek mich 
the case is bowen vs georgetown university hospital 871097

medical teams left for a city in earthquakestricken armenia today 
but returned after an israeli general there said their help would be 
more useful elsewhere officials said 
officials said maj gen aharon vardi head of israels civil 
defense radioed the pilots that no additional medical assistance 
was needed in leninakan the soviet republics secondlargest city 
which has been devastated by the quake 
the usmade hercules transports had been sent to reinforce 
israeli experts who went to leninakan on sunday 
a military spokesman said vardi ordered the planes to return 
because he decided they could not be used effectively at the 
scene and would be more useful elsewhere the spokesman said he 
said the planes were not turned back by the soviet government 
the israeli participation in the rescue effort was seen as part 
of a warming trend between israel and the soviet union which have 
not had diplomatic relations since the soviets cut ties after the 
1967 middle east war 
on board the aircraft that left today were 46 doctors medics 
vehicles an electric generator field hospital blood and medicine 
the military said 
israel began sending aid to the armenians on sunday with a 
planeload of supplies including cranes medicines and a specially 
trained rescue dog 
as the planes took off today moscows top diplomat in tel aviv 
said this assistance would bring israelis and soviets closer 
we are greatly moved by this georgy martirosov who heads 
the soviet consular delegation in tel aviv said on israel army 
radio this help by the israeli people will bring us closer 
emotionally

humanitarian aid to the soviets this month and some officials have

bengurion international airport near tel aviv and subsequently 
granted a soviet request by deporting the four hijackers

the late teamsters leader jimmy hoffa 
once warned his protege roy williams to go along with mob associates 
who had infiltrated the union according to a court deposition 
obtained by a newspaper 
theyve infiltrated every big local every conference every 
pension fund and theyre even into the aflcio hoffa told 
williams in 1958 theyre bad and i certainly think you should go 
along with them im tied as tight as i can be 
williams recollection of that conversation with hoffa was part 
of a federal court deposition according to a story in sundays 
editions of the kansas city star 
during two days last week williams described his rise and fall 
in the union his relationship with the late kansas city crime boss 
nick civella hoffa and several of their teamster and mob associates 
the deposition will be used at the trial of a civil lawsuit 
brought by the justice department in new york aimed at removing 
teamsters officials and mobsters who allegedly have corrupted the 
union 
williams also said he had agreed to cooperate with the government 
after he was sentenced to 10 years on the attempted bribery charge 
he said his release from prison in september after serving about 
three years was contingent upon his continued cooperation with the 
authorities he gave the deposition on the advice of his attorneys 
most of the questions asked by randy mastro an assistant us 
attorney from the southern district of new york and other attorneys 
participating in the deposition focused on williams association 
with civella and other organized crime leaders 
williams joined the teamsters in 1938 and later as a protege of 
hoffa rose through the ranks as president of local 41 in kansas 
city and finally became international president in 1981 hoffa 
disappeared in 1975 and has been presumed slain 
civella once told williams that kansas city was his territory 
and that he had a working relation with other areas including 
milwaukee chicago cleveland and new orleans 
he said he agreed with civellas request to find work for some of 
civellas associates he appointed george chiavola civellas 
nephew as a teamsters health and safety director and sam ancona as 
a general organizer both have been subjects of investigations by 
police and federal agents 
williams said he met with civella about once a month 
williams told the star on saturday through one of his attorneys 
that he has not been threatened because of his testimony and that he 
does not fear for his safety because of his disclosures

one moment chris reeves was heading toward londons 
waterloo station aboard a commuter train and the next he was 
scrambling through a rail car roof that had split open like a ripe 
tomato 
we were sitting next to the aisle in the buffet and when the 
crash happened we were thrown down the train reeves said today as 
he awaited treatment for a head injury at st georges hospital 
all i can remember is dust and debris as youve never experienced 
it in your life 
reeves 38 of southampton was among more than 100 people 
injured when a british rail commuter train slammed into a stopped 
train at clapham junction during this mornings rush hour and then a 
freight train on an adjoining track rammed into the wreckage dozens 
were killed 
there was furniture and enormous lumps of metal flying 
everywhere reeves said you see pictures of things like this 
but when youre in the middle of it your life goes in front of your 
eyes 
the whole of the buffet car disintegrated reeves said the 
roof split open like a ripe tomato and thats how we got out we 
tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much 
debris there was nothing we could do 
i think the woman who was in there was dead and there was a 
man lying dead on the tracks we we got out reeves said 
ian underhill 41 of farnborough said there was a hell of a 
bang as his train approached clapham 
the train seemed to shoot backwards and the guy opposite me 
flew into my face said underhill who also was taken to st 
georges amazingly enough there was not a lot of panic it was 
fairly calm and people were helping one another to get out i saw 
one man helped out who had lost his foot and there were many others 
with terrible injuries 
bob mintram 37 of bournemouth received 20 stitches at the 
scene for a head wound it seemed to me the coach i was on half 
the people were ok and half were bad news he said he said the 
woman sitting next to him was killed 
there was no panic none whatsoever no screaming mintram 
said we were out in 30 seconds we climbed out through the roof 
there were no seats left it was a rubbish heap 
david crump 40 from kings somborne was in the back car of the 
train that hit the stopped commuter train 
surprisingly there was no panic whatsoever i suppose we were 
in the most fortunate part of the train we had heard the bang and a 
terrible screeching sound crump said at the crash scene 
alun hughes an ambulance worker was in the same train 
there was a school on the other side of the track and the 
people there started taking in the injured they reacted remarkably 
quickly and efficiently hughes said there was a doctor on the 
train and we both rendered first aid where we could 
keith larner 36 from southampton said he saw people with metal 
in their bodies 
a woman was trapped with metal which was in her chest and we 
just started to get people out immediately he said it was the 
most horrible sight i have ever seen

president reagan sees no need to immediately 
reciprocate for soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs announcement 
of a military force cutback in europe and asia a white house 
spokesman said today 
the presidents view of this was that it was a unilateral 
decision on the part of the soviet union said spokesman marlin 
fitzwater we certainly point out the unilateral nature of it as a 
way of saying there is no response required 
fitzwaters remarks came amid assertions by other government 
officials and private analysts that gorbachevs vow to cut the size 
of the soviet army could put new pressure on the united states to 
withdraw troops from europe but these same officials and analysts 
said such a move would do nothing to reduce the us federal deficit 
at his daily white house news briefing reagans spokesman was 
asked whether it was fair to say that there would be no us 
response to gorbachevs announcement last week of a 500000troop 
reduction in soviet ground forces along with cuts in military 
armaments 
it would be appropriate to say it was a unilateral decision 
that did not require a unilateral reciprocal action and that no 
reciprocal action is expected fitzwater replied 
several officials interviewed about the impact of gorbachevs 
initiative said that unless presidentelect bush is prepared to 
reduce the overall size of the american military simply bringing 
home us soldiers to match a soviet withdrawal of troops from 
european front lines wouldnt save money and might even cost more 
its debatable whether you get any cost savings and if you do 
theyre minimal says sen john warner of virginia the senior 
republican on the senate armed services committee we dont even 
have the facilities here to accommodate them 
if bush decides not only to withdraw troops from europe but also 
to dismiss them from the military the budget savings could be 
substantial pentagon officials and top brass however will resist 
such a move 
the service was forced to cut its strength by 8600 soldiers in 
budget cuts last year and is now fielding its smallest activeduty 
force since before the korean war in 1950 about 772000 
further reductions would increase the risk to the nations 
security a new army briefing paper warns 
outgoing defense secretary frank c carlucci in several recent 
speeches has made it clear he will not include any further force 
structure cuts in the reagan administrations final budget 
proposal which goes to congress in january 
he has publicly urged bush to endorse that budget proposal and 
fight congress for a 2 percent real increase in pentagon spending 
carlucci further has sought to remind the american public there 
are important concerns besides money that guide the stationing of 
troops overseas to be simplistic he says it is far better for us 
forces to engage the enemy on foreign soil than on american 
territory 
it is a strategy that requires a us military presence beyond 
our shores not from habit not as a gift but rather for the 
defense of us interests and us prosperity he said in a speech 
last may 
bringing us troops home from abroad would not save money 
unless we deactivate them 
there are some expenses you incur by posting troops overseas 
that you dont face here including swings in the valuation of the 
dollar higher travel costs etc said one top pentagon financial 
officer who asked not to be identified 
but thats small potatoes compared to the fact that we dont 
have the housing or facilities at our bases to accommodate these 
guys the refurbishing and construction would be a huge expense 
the united states has about 318000 servicemen assigned to 
western europe of whom about 212000 are army troops another 
200000 are deployed to other countries around the world or at sea 
on navy ships meaning roughly 25 percent of the american 
activeduty force of 21 million is deployed outside the united 
states 
gorbachev told a united nations audience last week that the 
soviet union will unilaterally reduce its own military of more than 
51 million by 500000 troops and pull back 50000 assigned to the 
front lines facing nato 
retired rear adm gene r larocque the director of the center 
for defense information and a frequent critic of reagan 
administration policies argues that the united states could easily 
remove 50000 troops from europe without jeopardizing nato security 
im concerned that if we dont respond in some way the 
soviets initiative will be of no avail to reducing forces in the 
long run he says 
theres nothing magic about the number of troops we have there 
now pulling troops back to the us doesnt do anything for your 
budget this year but if conditions improve then we can gradually 
shrink our forces 
adm william j crowe the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
counters that the cuts announced by gorbachev would still leave the 
warsaw pact with a strong numerical advantage in conventional 
forces alliance leaders should be first watchful and second 
wary of gorbachevs moves crowe said last week 
barry blechman a former government arms control executive and 
now a defense consultant maintains that the united states could 
save 15 billion if half of its troops and 10 bomber squadrons were 
deactivated 
the united states should use the gorbachev initiative as a 
starting point for negotiating mutual 50 percent troop reductions 
he says adding this military competition is out of sync with 
todays politics and economics

rebels say they shot down a us 
locustspraying plane in the belief it was a moroccan military 
transport and apologized for the attack which killed the planes 
five american crewmen 
the polisario rebel movement said sunday it would retrieve the 
five bodies from the desert and return them to their families in the 
united states it made no mention of compensation and it wasnt 
known how long the recovery would take 
the dc7 was shot down thursday in one of the most desolate parts 
of the sahara desert there is no regular human settlement for more 
than 50 miles in any direction and nothing grows in the wilderness 
of rock and sand 
a second dc7 was also hit but managed to make it to an airfield 
400 miles away and made an emergency landing with its five crew 
members safe 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
downing of the plane once again underscores the need to seek a 
peaceful end to this longrunning conflict 
asked if the us government accepted the explanation offered by 
the polisario fitzwater said we dont have any reason to believe 
otherwise 
the statement issued by the marxistled polisario group said the 
attack in the no mans land between moroccos defensive wall and 
the mauritanian border was neither premeditated nor 
intentional it expressed deep sorrow 
the statement telexed from polisario headquarters in algiers to 
the associated press in new york and distributed locally said the 
planes were mistaken for moroccan military c130s 
it said polisario would return the five bodies to their families 
without delay 
it ascribed the incident to the spirit of polisarios desert 
patrols who it said were daily attacked by moroccan aircraft 
there was no immediate reaction to the statement from moroccan 
authorities 
morocco has insisted that the incident happened over mauritanian 
territory following vigorous mauritanian denials however a 
moroccan government statement late saturday acknowledged the planes 
were attacked over the 40milewide no mans land between the 
defense wall and the border 
the planes were chartered by the us agency for international 
development and were flying from dakar senegal to agadir to take 
part in the campaign against the growing plague of locusts along the 
fringes of the sahara 
polisario has been fighting moroccan forces for control of the 
western sahara since the spanish army withdrew from the former 
spanish colony in 1975 the united nations is trying to organize a 
referendum among 80000 inhabitants but polisario insists on a 
prior withdrawal of moroccan troops and administrators 
the two sides also disagree about who should be allowed to vote

the nations oldest synagogue celebrated its 
225th anniversary by expressing gratitude for the religious freedom 
it has enjoyed 
we have been a symbol of religious tolerance for both the 
jewish world and the gentile community rabbi chaim shapiro said 
sunday 
almost 300 people of differing faiths crammed into the touro 
synagogue for a traditional friday night sabbath service that was 
seasoned with references to the holiday of hanukkah 
hanukkah which means dedication commemorates the cleansing and 
resanctification of the temple in jerusalem by the maccabees 
following their victory over the pagan grecosyrians in 165 bc 
the maccabees struggle said temple president bernard kusinitz 
is the first recorded battle for religious freedom in history 
this year he also noted the dedication celebrated by the 
holiday parallels the rededication of the landmark synagogue 
participants in the sabbath service and various parties this 
weekend felt a combination of pride and at the same time a certain 
gratitude to the jewish and gentile communities that welcomed us 
shapiro said 
in 1759 100 years after the first jewish families sailed into 
newport the community decided to build a synagogue 
the congregants who by this time numbered 35 families hired 
architect peter harrison 
it is assumed that harrison a quaker who had never seen a 
synagogue based his design on isaac abraham touros description of 
his childhood synagogue in amsterdam touro was the temples cantor 
there are enough similarities between the two that we feel they 
have to be related kusinitz said 
the brick building which stands 95 percent intact is a 
mixture of colonial architecture with traditional jewish motifs 
shapiro said 
as simple as it is on the outside it is as beautiful on the 
inside kusinitz said 
in 1790 two years before the enactment of the bill of rights 
george washington issued a letter from the synagogue promising the 
new government of the united states would give to bigotry no 
sanction to persecution no assistance

work of a modern arsonist people from six states proclaimed that 
the burned new bethel ame church of rocky fork would once again 
serve its tiny congregation 
frequently vandalized through the years the church was rebuilt 
after it was destroyed by arson in april only to be torched again

200 people who attended the gathering saturday in this southern 
illinois town about 25 miles north of st louis people come and 
you didnt even know they cared 
bennett who lives in nearby alton and is not a member of the 
congregation said he attended out of respect for those who lost 
their church 
morris m ewing of los angeles heard about the rally while 
attending a stamp collecting convention in chicago he stopped by on 
his way home and wrote a check for 300 
ewing urged others in the audience not to become bitter about the 
fires it takes only one or two individuals to upset the 
progress he said 
last year racial epithets were carved into the walls of the 
church which serves a predominantly black congregation and 
swastikas were spraypainted on the building 
people feel that after the civil rights movement of the 60s 
that racism died it didnt but if we work together we can kill 
it said dennis l roach of the rainbow coalition of st louis 
the rev steven a jackson pastor of the 25member congregation 
estimated that saturdays donations would amount to 10000 to 
12000 rebuilding the church is expected to cost about 65000 
the church in this town of 2600 residents was founded in 1863 
its yard is adorned with headstones both recent and decades old in 
some cases only jagged hunks of rock mark the graves 
jackson said many of the former slaves who founded the church are 
buried there 
authorities said james russell calvin 19 of alton confessed to 
setting the october fire and is awaiting trial on one count of 
arson he has not been linked to the earlier blaze 
calvin who is white said he was not motivated by racism but by 
rumors from friends that the building was used by devil worshipers

vice presidentelect dan quayle will be 
replaced in the senate by conservative republican rep dan coats a 
former aide recently elected to a fifth term as an indiana 
congressman a party source said today 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said indiana gov 
robert orr would make a formal announcement of the appointment later 
in the day 
quayle and indianas other senator republican richard lugar 
also were scheduled to make a statement on the subject this 
afternoon according to a quayle spokesman who declined to divulge 
any other information 
coats 45 was elected in 1980 to fill the 4th congressional 
district seat quayle vacated to run for the senate he worked in 
quayles congressional office in fort wayne ind from 1976 to 
1980 and was known to have quayles backing in the jockeying to 
pick a new senator for indiana 
in the house coats has compiled a staunchly conservative record 
his rating for 1986 from the american conservative union was 82 
percent his rating the same year from the liberal americans for 
democratic action was 10 percent 
he is a supporter of aid to the nicaraguan contras and to the 
angolan rebels in 1984 he attempted to attach an amendment to an 
omnibus education bill that would have cut off federal aid to 
schools and states banning voluntary school prayer the amendment 
was defeated 
calls to coats office were unreturned today orr brushed aside 
questions as he attended a christmastree trimming ceremony in the 
statehouse in indianapolis instead telling reporters to talk to 
santa claus 
coats will serve as an appointed senator until a special election 
is held in 1990 for the remaining two years of quayles term an 
election for a full sixyear senate term will be held in 1992 
coats selection also means a special election will be held to 
fill his house seat probably in march 
his selection will leave the total of senate republicans in the 
incoming 101st congress at 45 the democrats will be in the 
majority with 55 seats 
quayle has announced his intention to resign from his senate seat 
by jan 2 that would permit coats to be sworn in a day ahead of the 
senators elected in november thus gaining an advantage over the 
rest of the class in seniority 
party sources said that in selecting coats orr was hoping to 
find a politician capable of building a strong political and 
financial base to withstand a democratic challenge for his seat in 
either 1990 or 1992 
several other names had been mentioned as potential candidates 
for quayles seat including former white house political director 
mitchell daniels who is a political protege of lugar daniels took 
himself out of contention several weeks ago as did marilyn quayle 
wife of the vice presidentelect 
others who had meen mentioned as contenders included rep dan 
burton indianapolis mayor william hudnut marion county prosecutor 
stephen goldsmith and lt gov john mutz who was defeated last 
month in a bid for the governors office 
orr was moving to fill the senate vacancy before his own term 
ends early next month to prevent indianas incoming democratic 
governor evan bayh from naming a democrat to the post

dan coats has made a career of following dan 
quayle first as his aide later as a congressman and now as the 
vice presidentelects apparent successor in the us senate 
we call them the two dans because dan coats worked for him and 
followed him to congress said robert e gates the 4th district 
republican chairman 
coats 45 was expected to be formally named by gov robert d 
orr this afternoon to fill quayles senate seat for the next two 
years according to a source in the republican party 
coats rise to the senate marks the second time in his career he 
has filled a vacancy left by quayle in 1980 coats then quayles 
district representative won his first term in the us house in the 
same year his boss won the senate seat 
although their careers have followed similar paths the two men 
are different in background and style friends say 
coats was born in jackson mich graduated from wheaton college 
and then served in the army he received his law degree by attending 
night classes at indiana university in indianapolis 
quayle a native hoosier also attended the indianapolis law 
school while serving in the national guard during the vietnam war 
four years older than quayle coats joined quayles staff in 1976 
after working as an assistant vice president and legal counsel for 
mutual security life insurance co 
in contrast to quayle an exuberant campaigner coats is very 
lowkey said former secretary of state edwin j simcox who went 
to law school with coats 
simcox who had been in the running for quayles seat said of 
coats i think a great deal of him hes an outstanding person 
gates called coats a fort wayne resident especially attentive 
to his constituents wishes 
hes not ultraconservative he really studies what the people 
want and votes that way he takes a lot of surveys said gates 
he really cares for his people 
that attentiveness has translated into significant votegetting 
appeal the party official noted 
in fact coats has never received less than 61 percent of the 
vote in the northeastern indiana district 
on nov 8 he won 62 percent of the vote in defeating jill l 
long a democrat who lost to quayle in the 1986 senate race

of this mornings rush hour killing dozens of people and injuring 
more than 100 in a vast tangle of crushed metal 
john norris the london fire brigade divisional officer said 
nine hours after the crash that all the bodies were thought to have 
been recovered and the death count stood at 35 police detective 
inspector barry webb said another person died in a hospital 
bringing the toll to 36 
norris told reporters the death toll had fluctuated during the 
day because some bodies were dismembered 
a london ambulance service spokeswoman who requested anonymity 
said 115 passengers were hospitalized 30 with serious injuries 
others were treated where they lay on the ground or in the wreckage 
and some people had to have limbs amputated to extricate them

survivors had been removed about five hours after the crash near 
busy clapham junction just before 8 am but he said he feared that 
when the mangled wreckage was finally cleared there may be further 
bodies underneath

like matchwood across the tracks scores of people suffered minor 
injuries and were treated on the scene

enforcement unit controlled by stateowned british rail said at the 
scene that about 1500 people were aboard the 20 passenger carriages

cabinet room and told reporters she was griefstricken

charges of overcrowding trains and cutting safety expenditures 
promised the house of commons an independent public inquiry would be 
set up

slammed into the back of a stationary commuter train about a 
quartermile south of clapham junction 
an empty freight train traveling on an adjoining track in the 
opposite direction then crashed into the spillover wreckage he said 
we were going pretty fast about 70 miles an hour said greg 
ford 28 who was on the passenger train it went bang and that 
was it we were all over the place 
roy daniel 37 was in the buffet car when the train started 
stopping and we started falling on top of each other we came to a 
stop and the buffet counter was sort of lodged on top of us that 
saved us 
chris reeves 38 of southampton also was in the buffet car he 
said he saw furniture and enormous lumps of metal flying 
everywhere 
the whole of the buffet car disintegrated reeves said the 
roof split open like a ripe tomato and thats how we got out we 
tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much 
debris there was nothing we could do

the massachusetts supreme court ruled today that a 
treasure hunter has the right to recover cargo and artifacts from 
the submerged 18th century pirate ship whydah 
in a unanimous opinion massachusetts highest court rejected the 
states claim of sovereignty over the wrecked wooden sailing vessel 
lying beneath the sand in the waters off wellfleet on cape cod where 
the it foundered in april 1717 
the illfated whydah nearly three centuries later has sailed 
into this courts jurisdiction as the subject of a dispute between 
contemporary treasure seekers and the wouldbe modern sovereign of 
the coastal waters justice neil lynch wrote for the high court 
he described the case as a conflict mired in competing claims 
of title to the shipwreck and its cargo involving issues of federal 
maritime and admiralty law and disputed dominion over submerged 
lands in the marginal sea 
in november 1982 barry clifford and his salvage company 
maritime underwater surveys inc found an unidentified wrecked 
and abandoned vessel one mile off wellfleet under about 14 feet of 
water and 5 feet of sand 
since 1983 maritime surveys using sophisticated sensing and 
recovery technology has recovered numerous artifacts from the site 
while waging legal battles with the state the federal government 
and rival treasure hunters over who owns the wreck of the 
commandeered english merchant ship 
gold silver cannons and pistols recovered from the ship have 
been valued at 14 million to 25 million and the total bounty is 
estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars 
after winning his claim of ownership to the whydah in us 
district court clifford was sued by the state which asked a state 
superior court to confirm its claim of title to the vessel and its 
cargo 
the superior court appointed clifford temporary custodian of the 
wreck and on that basis he won a permit from the state board of 
underwater archaeological resources to salvage the ship 
later faced with claims from clifford the state and other 
searchers the state court granted cliffords company title to the 
vessel

a new 17 million federal prison was 
dedicated today in this western louisiana town replacing the 
detention center that rioting cubans burned in a night of terror 13 
months ago 
the new beginning gives townspeople the chance to look to the 
future but they should not forget the rioting us district judge 
earl veron warned in his dedication speech 
veron recalled watching the television coverage of the prison 
going up in flames as cuban detainees rampaged through the oakdale 
federal detention center 
i cannot understand how these defendants wanted to burn down 
these excellent facilities they had and think by burning them down 
and taking hostages they would gain their freedom said veron 
it is not up to me and i express no opinion on the conduct the 
united states should take against those that destroyed 15 million 
in taxpayers property 
more than 1000 cuban inmates awaiting decisions on whether they 
would be freed or sent back to cuba rioted and took 28 employees 
hostage on nov 21 1987 at the oakdale center the siege lasted 
eight days and the hostages were released unharmed 
although bureau of prison officials do not want to answer 
specific questions about security the new facility has some obvious 
differences from the old one within the 40acre prison two of the 
four dormitories are isolated by a high chainlink fence and a guard 
post 
also added is a maximum security building which has over 50 
individual cells each cell door has a small hole and each inmate 
must put his hands through that hole to be handcuffed before the 
door is opened 
the showers also have bars 
the new oakdale facility will handle prisoners who have been 
sentenced by federal judges to prison terms under construction at 
the site is a 14 million federal deportation center which will 
open in november 1989 to handle detainees 
the rebuilt prison has 265 inmates at this time and can 
accommodate 1300 prison officials said there are 400 guards 
the deportation center will have 1000 beds and perhaps as many 
as another 400 guards said a spokesman for warden oc jenkins 
about 200 people shivered through the rededication ceremonies in 
the openair basketball court on the prison grounds none of the 
inmates was in sight and the prison looked empty 
despite last years riot mayor george mowad said he looked 
forward to reopening the prison the community worked so hard to 
secure and was so proud of when it opened in 1986 
if someone had been killed there probably would have been more 
bad feelings he said recently were ready to get on with the 
program 
the towns economy has fluctuated since the riot and 
unemployment in allen parish is about 11 percent mowad said 
it was 31 percent back in january 1982 when we first started 
this thing it was the highest in the country mowad said it 
wasnt all the prison but it certainly has been a major reason why 
unemployment went down 
rioting at the federal prisons in oakdale and in atlanta two days 
later erupted shortly after the state department announced that cuba 
had agreed to take back more than 2500 of the 3800 mariel refugees 
who were locked up nationwide at the time more than half were in 
the federal detention center in oakdale 
the takeovers ended after the government agreed to a moratorium 
on deportations and a onetimeonly justice department review of 
each us immigration and naturalization service decision

here at a glance are highlights of actions 
taken monday by the supreme court 
 
ncaadiscipline 
 
the court in a setback for college basketball coach jerry 
tarkanian bolstered the power of the ncaa to discipline its member 
schools 
the 54 ruling also could help the national collegiate athletic 
association in its effort to police drug use by athletes at 
staterun member schools 
the court said the ncaa in disciplining tarkanian did not 
violate the constitutional rights of the university of nevadalas 
vegas coach because the athletic body acted as a private 
organization not one operating with governmental authority 
the case is ncaa vs tarkanian 871061 
 
medicare 
 
the court barred the government from retroactively applying rules 
limiting reimbursement paid to hospitals treating medicare patients 
the court in a 90 ruling likely to mean millions of additional 
dollars for some hospitals rejected reagan administration arguments 
that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive 
application of the governments reimbursement formula 
the case is bowen vs georgetown university hospital 871097 
 
evidence 
 
the court ruled that a government investigators conclusions and 
opinions are not hearsay and may be used as evidence in federal 
trials 
the justices reversed a federal appeals court ruling that had 
ordered a new trial in a wrongfuldeath lawsuit against the makers 
of a navy airplane in which two people crashed six years ago 
but todays 72 vote appeared to make a new trial necessary 
because the justices also ruled that the plaintiffs lawyers wrongly 
were limited in presenting their case

the alleged victims testimony that she did not consent to have sex 
with olden

who is black and a halfbrother of olden

polluters 
feet away even under mounds of concrete 
orangeclad german red cross volunteers follow their search dogs 
telling the exhausted soviets where they should dig first they work 
around the clock aided by the campfires after dark 
the volunteers had a moment of joy sunday when a 33yearold man 
was found alive after more than four days under a collapsed 
threestory building 
hundreds of onlookers stood on the rubble as rescuer peter 
schaefer of hamburg slowly extracted the survivor he said his name 
was ruben as he was carried away on a stretcher with jubilant 
armenians feeding him water and pressing a cigarette into his 
trembling hand 
reflecting the chaos in spitak there was no ambulance to take 
him to a makeshift hospital outside the city center after a few 
frantic minutes the rescuers commandeered the van used to transport 
the german search dogs 
the scene kindled little hope in despairing relatives like gegush 
aganyan a 50yearold woman who stood a tearful vigil by her sons 
wrecked apartment she came from a mountain village in hopes her 
son tateus and his pregnant wife had somehow survived 
it was to be my first grandchild she said but i think 
there is no chance for them to be found alive 
others searchers reported miraculous tales of survival amid the 
more common discoveries of entombed families 
we still have hope although not much said artur tovmasyan 
a volunteer directing the cranes lifting concrete slabs and 
corrugated metal roofing he said he had helped dig out 12 survivors 
in the past three days 
a list of fewer than 2000 survivors has been written on green 
sheets of paper at a shack marked with a handlettered sign 
regional communist party hundreds clamor around it shouting 
the names of those they seek 
we already know who is missing from here said zori zayakan 
of martuni a village about 100 miles from spitak the 
reunification effort is disorderly but people know they can find 
out if they ask at enough places 
another survivor mayor arzumanyan said outside his obliterated 
apartment that he ran home from the factory as soon as the main 
earthquake stopped at first he was shocked that the seven stories 
above his secondfloor home were spread like gray boxes in front of 
the foundation then noticed his rear apartment had been exposed by 
the collapse 
i pulled my two granddaughters and my younger daughter out 
myself said arzumanyan 54 my wife and my older daughter were 
in the city to buy groceries i didnt know what happened to them 
until yesterday saturday 
his wife survived but his 27yearold daughter was flown to 
moscow in critical condition and he did not know her fate 
like others remaining in spitak arzumanyan has been camping in 
the nearfreezing weather with bedding salvaged from the wreckage 
waiting for debris to be cleared away he says he must find 
documents and a stash of money to help his family resettle 
most of the homeless have been taken to undamaged areas of the 
mountainous republic or bused to yerevan where they wait for 
flights or other transport to stay with relatives elsewhere 
the discomfort of waiting without lodging food or access to 
toilets is mostly taken in stride by armenians who see the 
earthquake as another chapter in their tragic history 
we lost 15 million people in 1915 said varchik azaryan 
resurrecting the bloody turkish invasion of 73 years ago we have 
survived that as a nation and we will survive whatever fate we 
meet

paul nitze president reagans principal arms 
control adviser said monday that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs plan to turn a controversial radar installation in 
siberia over to civilian and eventually international control does 
not satisfy us concerns 
the united states has long maintained that the radar at 
krasnoyarsk should be torn down because it violates the 1972 
antiballistc missile treaty 
the treaty permits radars on national borders pointed outward to 
detect incoming missiles the united states says the krasnoyarsk 
radar is a violation because it is in the middle of soviet territory 
facing inward where it might be used in an earlywarning battle 
management system 
turning it over to soviet and international scientists isnt 
satisfactory to us nitze said 
there is no way we can be certain these civilian scientsts will 
remain in charge he said they could convert it to an 
earlywarning radar in no time at all 
nitze commented in an interview by international journalists and 
others on worldnet a television production of the us information 
agency beamed overseas 
in his address beferson ended with more 
than 17000 messages of support for the journalist organizers say 
we have encouraged prayers we have encouraged letters 
were getting letters from all over the united states jack 
lavriha of the free terry anderson committee said dec 8 
lavriha said that although some people think anderson will not 
see the letters he believes they will be given to him 
the world will be watching lavriha said i think theres

sonja henies icy heart wont be left out in 
the cold when the warehouse where it has been stored for nearly 48 
years is demolished to make room for a frozen foods plant 
the bluegreen ice sculpture was presented to the famous 
norweigian skater and movie star during a valentines day 1941 
performance at the aksarben coliseum the stars one and only 
appearance in omaha 
miss henie said she would return for it some day but she died in 
1969 without ever claiming what cbs newsman charles kuralt once 
called the longestrunning openended most enduring publicity 
stunt of all time 
barney oldfield who was an army publicist when he carved the 
heart said miss henie found her appearance in omaha less than 
heartwarming among other things he said she was upset that high 
costs cut into her profits 
all she was really interested in that night was to get it 
out of the dressing room because it had greenblue dye and it was 
dripping on her dressing room floor oldfield now an executive 
for litton industries said in a telephone interview from his 
beverly hills calif office 
so the heart was taken to the omaha cold storage co warehouse 
near the mississippi river and there it has remained over the 
years gaining in notoriety as it shrunk from its original 100 
pounds to about 60 pounds 
it is highly flattering that something made 45 years ago out of 
the most perishable substance on earth frozen water would still 
be in existence in a cold storage warehouse in omaha oldfield 
said 
when plans were announced to tear down the warehouse to make way 
for a new conagra frozen foods complex there was some concern about 
the fate of the heart but roy mattson owner of omaha cold storage 
said he has moved the sculpture to his companys new warehouse in a 
converted meatpacking plant 
its in a box in a room with a lot of raw materials for making 
pet food liver salisbury glands items like that mattson said 
id hate to throw it away id probably get in trouble 
i suppose some goodhearted guy will continue to take care of 
it oldfield said it has been kind of like a relay race there 
have been 10 or 12 people who had custody of it from one time to 
another 
oldfield born in elk creek neb said he hoped to visit the 
heart during a trip to omaha later this month he recalled how the 
ice shows promoter approached him in 1941 about a publicity stunt 
but warned oldfield that miss henie wasnt always friendly 
oldfield carved the heart out of a keg of ice and presented it to 
miss henie at the valentine show as the promoter had warned 
however she gave oldfield the cold shoulder 
as kind of an exit line i said we would keep it until she came 
back to omaha again oldfield said 
we put it in the back of a pickup it was 10 degrees below 
zero that night after the show we took it to omaha cold storage and 
stored it there it was forgotton until i came back after world war 
ii and was in omaha for christmas before the victory march in new 
york 
oldfield said no one has tried to buy the heart but that the 
guinness book of world records has called about it 
they found somebody with a 36yearold cake in storage and they 
were toying with the idea of a strange category that would include 
such things but nothing came of it he said

the supreme court in a setback for college 
basketball coach jerry tarkanian today bolstered the power of the 
ncaa to discipline its member schools 
the 54 ruling also could help the national collegiate athletic 
association in its effort to police drug use by athletes at 
staterun member schools 
the court said the ncaa in disciplining tarkanian did not 
violate the constitutional rights of the university of nevadalas 
vegas coach because the athletic body acted as a private 
organization not one operating with governmental authority 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said the 
university does have governmental power because it is a staterun 
school 
but stevens said the ncaa in seeking to discipline tarkanian 
was acting independently from unlv 
the ncaa and unlv acted much more like adversaries than like 
partners engaged in a dispassionate search for the truth in 
investigating tarkanian stevens said 
the ncaa is more correctly characterized as an agent of its 
remaining members which as competitors of unlv had an interest in 
the effective and evenhanded enforcement of ncaas recruitment 
standards he said 
the rulings impact on tarkanians career at unlv or the 
schools bigtime basketball program was not immediately apparent 
i cant say at this point what will happen to mr tarkanian 
said jack kitchen one of the ncaas lawyers in the case thats a 
matter the committee on infractions will have to take a look at 
he said 
as far as the impact on the ncaa itself this is a good 
decision kitchen added 
tarkanian when told about the decision said naturally im 
disappointed 
he refused to discuss what action unlv might take in his case 
saying i dont want to get into that right now im going to let 
my lawyer talk for me 
but sam lionel tarkanians lawyer said he did not want to 
discuss the decision until he had a chance to read the courts 
opinions 
tarkanian a highly successful coach who has been at unlv since 
1973 was accused in 1976 of numerous rule violations by the ncaa 
ncaa officials said he arranged for a student to bet a b 
grade without attending class provided free air fare to a 
studentathlete encouraged individuals to give the ncaa false 
information to impede its probe falsely certified unlvs program as 
being in compliance with ncaa rules and failed to comply with high 
ethical standards 
the ncaa placed the unlv basketball program on two years 
probation in 1977 for recruiting violations and ordered the 
university to suspend tarkanian from coaching for two years 
but tarkanian obtained a court order blocking the suspension and 
continued coaching 
the nevada supreme court said the ncaa had violated tarkanians 
constitutional rights by failing to afford him due process during 
its lengthy investigation 
today however the us supreme court overturned the lower court 
order in ruling that the athltic organization lacking governmental 
authority was not required to adhere to constitutional standards in 
its probe 
tarkanians lawyers had warned that lifting the court order 
against the ncaa could mean the ncaa may throw unlv out as a member 
if the university refuses to suspend tarkanian 
individuals and private organizations generally cannot violate 
someones constitutional rights only a government and its agents 
can do that because the constitution protects against governmental 
but not private wrongdoing 
the ncaa is a private organization representing nearly 1000 
colleges and universities more than half of them staterun 
todays ruling could enhance the organizations power to 
investigate drug abuse by athletes by not requiring it to observe 
constitutional restrictions in probing for abuses 
in other action the court 
barred the government from retroactively applying rules 
limiting reimbursement paid to hospitals treating medicare patients 
the court in a 90 ruling likely to mean millions of additional 
dollars for some hospitals rejected reagan administration arguments 
that some hospitals could reap a windfall from a ban on retroactive 
application of the governments reimbursement formula 
ruled that a governfment investigators conclusions and 
opinions are not hearsay and may be used as evidence in federal 
trials 
the justices reversed a federal appeals court ruling that had 
ordered a new trial in a wrongfuldeath lawsuit against the makers 
of a navy airplane in which two people crashed six years ago 
having already ruled that privacy rights do not extend to 
garbage left at curbside for pickup refused to treat differently 
garbage discarded closer to home 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that a 
convicted fremont neb man had no privacy right in garbage cans 
left outside for collection four feet from his homes back door 
unlike the courts decision last may in a case from california 
todays order sets no national precedent 
agreed to study a universitys attempt to withhold confidential 
information from a faculty member who says her denial of tenure was 
due to illegal discrimination 
the court said it will hear an appeal by university of 
pennsylvania officials accused of discriminating against a chinese 
woman denied promotion to full professor 
but the justices indicated that they will be studying a very 
narrow issue in the case one dealing with which trial court had 
the authority to hear it 
refused to reinstate a 45 million libel award won by a former 
prosecutor against the philadelphia inquirer 
the justices citing the lack of a properly presented federal 
question let stand a pennsylvania supreme court ruling that 
requires a new trial for richard spragues lawsuit against the 
newspaper 
rejected an appeal by a family seeking damages for the death of 
a marine helicopter copilot 
the court without comment refused to order a new trial in a 
lawsuit stemming from a 1983 helicopter crash in the atlantic ocean 
near virginia beach va the court previously used the case to give 
military contractors sweeping immunity from being sued 
in todays high court opinion in the tarkanian case stevens 
said the ncaa is properly viewed as a private actor at odds with 
the state when it represents the interests of its entire membership 
in an investigation of one public university 
stevens said the fact that unlv could forfeit its standing as a 
basketball powerhouse if it is kicked out of the ncaa does not 
mean the university was forced to fire tarkanian 
that unlvs options were unpalatable does not mean that they 
were nonexistent he said 
stevens was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices harry a blackmun antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
dissenting were justices byron r white william j brennan 
thurgood marshall and sandra day oconnor 
white in an opinion joined by the others said unlvs agreement 
to abide by ncaa rules governing conduct of its athletic program 
made the ncaa a partner with the university in disciplining 
tarkanian i would find that the ncaa acted jointly with unlv and 
therefore is a state actor white said 
the case is ncaa vs tarkanian 871061

the space shuttle atlantis continued its 
crosscountry trip from california to florida today taking off from 
an air force base near tucson atop a modified jumbo jet 
the orbiter which landed at edwards air force base in california 
last week after completing a classified military mission left the 
mojave desert base at 327 pm sunday said charlie baker shuttle 
area manager for the national aeronautics and space administration 
at edwards 
carried piggyback atop a boeing reached 
arizonas davismonthan air force base 90 minutes later where it 
stayed overnight the plane took off from the base shortly before 
noon on the next leg of its trip headed to kelly air force base 
outside san antonio texas 
747 the shuttle the final leg should take the shuttle from kelly to 
the kennedy 
space center at cape canaveral fla said nasa spokesman joseph 
dagostino 
rain could delay completion of the flight he said sunday flying 
through rain can damage the thousands of ceramic tiles affixed to 
the shuttles belly to ward off the heat of reentry into the 
earths atmosphere he said 
atlantis landed tuesday after a fourday secret mission that 
reportedly included deployment of a med to a mechanical air pump so the 
bear mimics the 
deep gentle inhaling and exhaling of a healthy sleeping person 
a research project under way at the university and st francis 
hospital and medical center in hartford has shown that the bears can 
help regulate breathing by inducing deep quiet sleep in preemies 
who frequently suffer respiratory disorders said evelyn thoman the 
behaviorist who designed the project 
this is a stimulation that i call biologically relevant 
thoman said in a recent interview its sort of like having a 
companion to sleep with its breathing just like mummy and daddy 
thoman came up with the idea about 15 years ago and experimented 
on rat pups deprived of their mothers those given a surrogate 
mother a warm moist pulsating tube survived those without a 
surrogate died 
premature infants were a natural subject for the study since 
they too are separated from their mothers when they are isolated in 
an incubator 
it took thoman years to come up with the design for the bear 
commercially made ones have protruding snouts and limbs that keep 
infants at a distance and a pump that could duplicate the gentle 
rhythm of human breathing 
harvard apparatus inc of south natick mass developed the pump 
after some preliminary work she got a 500000 grant from the 
national institute of child health ahd human develpment for a 
threeyear study that runs until may thoman and her research 
assistants monitor how the babies respond to the bears through 
timelapse photography 
the experiment is based partly on the physics principle of 
entrainment which holds that all pulsating or beating objects 
animate and inanimate tend to match the rhythms of nearby objects 
the phenomenon explains why a halfdozen grandfather clocks on 
the same wall all beating at different tempos eventually will 
synchronize in people it means the various body rhythms sleep 
patterns temperature breathing heartbeat influence each other 
thoman said 
thoman theorizes that the bears may calm colicky babies and that 
aside from helping infants learn to breathe the bears stimulate 
brain development by letting the babies choose when to snuggle up to 
the toys 
doctors have known for years that underdeveloped premature 
infants isolated in an incubator away from their mothers and the 
outside world need stimulation to thrive but the stimulation used 
for years has been passive and inescapable the incessant sound of 
an electrical heart implanted in a stuffed animal the rising and 
falling of a breathing air mattress 
the babies in the experiment snuggle with their bears about half 
the time and move away by themselves the rest of the time 
thomans bears have been mentioned in writings on sudden infant 
death syndrome but she cautions that its far too early to theorize 
that a device that helps regulate breathing will help prevent the 
mysterious killer of apparently healthy babies 
we have demonstrated the bear facilitates maturation and that 
it helps the babies breathe more regularly she said there is a 
logical jump to say shouldnt that help prevent sids and in my 
wildest dreams i would hope so but thats too far away there is 
too much research to be done

americans are in a giving mood this christmas 
although a vast majority believe the holiday has become too 
commercialized according to a media generalassociated press poll 
threequarters of those answering the poll said they intend to 
spend the same amount of money or more on gifts than in past years 
and fewer than one in four intend to spend less 
seven years ago when joblessness and inflation were considerably 
higher an apnbc news poll found that 69 percent of the public 
intended to cut back on giftgiving 
the new poll found that 85 percent of the public believes that 
christmas is too commercialized but 87 percent still said they 
looked forward to it 
the survey of 1084 adults in the continental united states was 
conducted by telephone between nov 10 and nov 20 
ninetysix percent of those answering the survey said they 
celebrate christmas eightynine percent identified themselves as 
either catholic or protestant the rest were jewish other or 
had no religion 
the poll indicated that most americans are religious although 
religious observance varied considerably among regions and among 
different ethnic and social groups 
about a third of the public thinks of christmas as mainly a 
social holiday while about onequarter regard it as primarily 
religious but the largest number 38 percent consider it both 
religious and social 
the poll also showed that nearly seven in 10 americans are 
churchgoers and four in 10 said they had been to church the week

the only hard feelings following pop star elton 
johns libel suit against a london newspaper came from a judge who 
castigated both sides for milking the case for publicity 
sorry elton said the headline over a frontpage story in the 
suns late edition monday announcing a 184 million outofcourt 
settlement and the paper quoted john as saying this is the best 
christmas present i could wish for and i dont bear the sun any 
malice 
but high court judge michael davies who had been scheduled to 
begin hearing johns action later monday voiced his disapproval 
and distaste at the way the settlement was announced in the sun 
before it could be approved by the court 
one would think that elton john and the newspaper had formed a 
mutual admiration society he said the parties were determined 
to milk the situation in order to obtain the maximum publicity to 
both sides 
john told reporters i dont think it is any of the judges 
business 
the sun said it apologized for the allegations it published in 
february 1987 which quoted a young mans account of johns private 
life and acknowledged that they were false

the agriculture department will bar timber 
harvesting in certain parts of national forests in oregon and 
washington in order to broaden habitat protection for the spotted 
owl the chief of the forest service said monday 
f dale robertson said most of the new habitat areas will range 
from 1000 to 2000 acres in size and will serve as protection for 
nesting owls as well as providing stepping stones between larger 
areas totaling more than 16 million acres already protected as 
owl habitats 
in the olympic national forest the new habitat areas may be as 
large as 3000 acres each he said 
in all the special habitat areas are expected to reduce the 
annual timber harvest on national forests in oregon and washington 
by about 180 million board feet 
each of the 13 national forests that have owls will share in the 
linkage system the exact number will not be determined until the 
forests submit final management plans to ensure that spotted owl 
populations will be maintained 
this has been an extremely difficult decision to make but i 
believe it strikes a reasonable balance between the two conflicting 
goals of sustaining spotted owl populations and providing timber 
supplies that are vital to the economies of oregon and washington 
robertson said 
the forest service a usda agency has been embroiled in 
controversy concerning its management plans for spotted owl 
habitats notably in the pacific northwest where there are concerns 
that protection of the birds could adversely affect the timber 
industry 
however robertson said the controversy has not been confined to 
his agency noting that a lawsuit against interiors bureau of land 
management has resulted in an injunction prohibiting blm from 
harvesting mature timber on some lands the agency administers in 
oregon 
also the fish and wildlife service is being challenged in court 
over its 1987 refusal to designate the owl a threatened or 
endangered species 
meantime authorities in oregon voted last week to deny a place 
on the state list of endangered or threatened species to a 
robinsized seabird called the marbled murrelet after biologists 
were unable to determine the birds population 
we simply dont have good baseline data on the murrelets 
population size nor any trends indicating changes in that 
population said rod ingram chief of the wildlife division for 
the oregon fish and wildlife commission 
the oregon chapter of the audubon society and the oregon natural 
resources council had petitioned to place the bird on the list under 
the new oregon endangered species act last january

sentenced him to death as a spy for israel

american team of observers are guilty of providing the zionist enemy 
with accurate and detailed military and security information about 
our resistance fighters their positions movements supply routes 
and the quantity and quality of their weaponry the statement said 
it said the decision to kill higgins was a retaliation for 
israeli attacks against our people in occupied palestine and

a potentially dangerous shortage of nurses in 
the united states is best solved by boosting pay scales for career 
caregivers and making sure they have time to be nurses instead of 
clerks a federal commission said monday 
it is the sincere belief of the commission that the health of 
this nation will be at risk if the changes suggested in these 
recommendations do not occur the report said 
the institutions themselves have to change the very way they 
allow nursing to be practiced carolyne k davis of cleveland 
head of the special advisory panel said at a news conference 
the report said higher pay will help particularly for career 
nurses but that better financial compensation alone is not the 
answer 
the commission was convened a year ago by the department of 
health and human services an underlying theme of its report which 
to be presented to hhs secretary otis r bowen is that nurses yearn 
for time to nurse 
nurses also want recognition for their nurturing instincts and 
acquired knowledge and they want to be respected and consulted by 
the physicians who write up the orders telling them how to care for 
their patients the report said 
with increasing frequency nurses provide services that should 
be carried out by other health care workers the commission said 
the report said hospitals should preserve the time of the nurse 
for the direct care of patients and families by providing adequate 
staffing levels for clinical and nonclinical support services 
without using the word doctor another recommendation said 
close cooperation and mutual respect between nursing and medicine 
is essential 
on the pay issue the panel said starting salaries are not so 
much a problem as the lack of opportunity to see compensation grow 
with experience 
it cited statistics showing that while the average 22000 
starting salary for a nurse two years ago was only 2000 below that 
for an engineer the engineer was making 41000 five years later 
compared with 27000 for the nurse 
davis said the current average salary for all working registered 
nurses is 25000 a year 
calculating that there are at least 137000 budgeted vacancies 
in just the hospital and nursing home sectors alone the panel 
said hospitals have laid off 100000 nonnursing employees over the 
past five years 
although nursing school enrollments are down the commission said 
a growing demand for nurses is more a factor in the shortage than 
lack of people in training partly because the patients now being 
hospitalized tend to be sicker as a group than a few years ago 
outpatient treatment is now more likely for the less seriously 
ill leaving hospitals with the most difficult cases and the 
accompanying need for a higher nursetopatient ratio 
unless this shortage is addressed i can anticipate there might 
be some impact on the quality of care said lillian k gibbons 
the federal official designated to coordinate the panels work 
the document was welcomed by the federation of nurses and health 
professionals the commissions recommendations are very similar 
to what we have been advocating for a long time said candice 
owley the unions vice president we are encouraged that the 
federal government has finally given proper recognition to the 
problems of the nursing profession and has offered some concrete 
solutions to the crisis 
the american association of colleges of nursing also said it 
welcomed the substantive actions recommended by the commission 
nursing is a critical national resource said geraldene 
felton aacn president dean of the university of iowa college of 
nursing and a member of the hhs commission the nations enormous 
concern and efforts to relieve the shortage are clear evidence of 
the crucial value of that resource we must move forward and not 
ignore the important plan of action proposed by the commission 
today

unconfirmed reports of tibetans throwing stones at police patrols 
after dark sunday and of police firing tear gas

tibetan buddhist monk was killed and 13 people were injured when 
police fired warning shots saturday at 30 tibetans who marched into 
the central square waving their banned nationalist flag 
an englishspeaking tourist who asked not to be identified said 
some tibetans told her their friends and relatives had disappeared 
and were believed arrested 
robert dean 24 of auckland new zealand said he saw police 
drive up to tibetan homes talk to residents and lead some away 
one particular official i saw four times at four different 
homes taking four different people away he said 
authorities allow few foreign reporters to travel to tibet and 
then only when conditions are calm 
police on monday confiscated the passport of a dutch woman who 
was shot in the arm and the ticket office for the state airline 
said she was not allowed to leave town a canadian friend said 
ron schwartz a professor at the university of newfoundland in

meindersma of amsterdam but was refused ms meindersma was treated 
at a lhasa hospital and released 
we wanted to take her to hong kong and put her in a hospital 
said schwartz 
ms meindersma and schwartz witnessed saturdays protest but 
both said they had no connections to antichinese tibetan activists 
dutch consular attache willem de bruin said in beijing he would 
ask chinese authorities to allow ms meindersma to leave i hope 
this is just a formality he said adding he was disappointed 
authorities had given him little information on her condition 
tibetan nationalists including buddhist monks and nuns dispute 
chinas claim to seven centuries of sovereignty over tibet they 
want an independent country led by the dalai lama the leader of 
tibetan buddhism who has been in exile in india since an abortive 
antichinese uprising in 1959 
tibetans have staged many small protests in the past 14 months 
but saturdays was the third to turn bloody at least 38 people were 
killed in violent clashes with police oct 1 and march 5 
china has maintained that foreign travelers took part in some 
previous protests but has not made such charges about saturdays 
violence 
police searched guest rooms at the yak backpacker hotel sunday 
and monday said todd johnson 24 of santa cruz calif 
they seem to be looking for particular individuals who they

likud and labor negotiators met for six hours 
monday about a possible coalition government of the two main 
parties and labor demanded electoral reforms to curb the power of 
religious parties 
small religious parties won 18 of the 120 parliament seats in the 
nov 1 election and hold the balance of power between the 
conservative likud bloc which got 40 seats and the centerleft 
labor party with 39 
they have demanded important cabinet posts and stricter 
government policies on religion as terms for joining a rightwing 
coalition with likud led by prime minster yitzhak shamir 
negotiators from both major parties reported progress in mondays 
talks and some predicted a coalition deal would be made this week 
likud and labor whose leader is foreign minister shimon peres 
have been equal partners in a national unity coalition since the 
indecisive election of july 1984 the leaders traded jobs two years 
ago 
many issues appeared unresolved after the meeting of the 
threemember teams monday in jerusalem but moshe katzav a likud 
cabinet minister told army radio as he emerged 
there was progress there are still a few open questions but 
we have established intensive discussions and we want to finish 
as soon as possible i hope that we conclude the discussions in a 
day or two 
israel radio said the negotiators focused on guidelines for a 
joint government and agreed to an evenly divided inner cabinet 
which makes the major security and foreign policy decisions 
a labor official close to peres said privately the party demanded 
electoral reforms including direct election of the prime minister 
and requiring more votes to qualify for a seat in the knesset 
israels parliament 
each party assigns knesset seats from its own candidate list on 
the basis of how many votes it receives 
requiring more votes per seat would make it difficult for smaller 
parties to get into parliament thus limiting the power of religious 
parties among others 
after negotiating with rightwing and religious parties shamir 
turned back to labor in an apparent effort to avoid major 
concessions on religious and political issues demanded by the small 
factions 
his talks with those parties continue however and officials 
close to the prime minister said the factions may join whatever 
government is formed 
the peres aide said labor opposes likuds agreement with the 
farright tehiya and national religious parties to build 40 new 
jewish settlements in the occupied west bank and gaza strip in the 
next four years 
six new settlements were authorized in the four years of 
laborlikud coalition that began in 1984 
yossi ahimeir an adviser to shamir said likud wants more 
emphasis on new settlements but is prepared to reconsider if 
labor joins the government 
about 70000 jews live in more than 130 settlements in the west 
bank and gaza where a rebellion began a year ago among the 15 
million palestinian residents 
according to the peres aide labor will insist on the right to 
oppose such religious legislation as the proposed who is a jew 
law which would accept only conversions to judaism performed by 
orthodox rabbis 
jews in the united states where the conservative and reform 
movements are strong oppose the legislation

the supreme court today threw out a kentucky 
mans sodomy conviction because he was barred at his trial from 
questioning the alleged victim a white woman about her living with 
a black man 
by an 81 vote the justices overturned the conviction and 
10year prison sentence of james olden the court expressed 
skepticism about the alleged victims testimony that she did not 
consent to have sex with olden 
olden and a friend charlie ray harris were indicted on 
kidnapping rape and forcible sodomy charges 
both men who are black were accused of forcing a young white 
woman to have sex with them after they met her at a bar in 
princeton ky 
the woman initally told police she was raped by four men later 
said she was raped by olden and harris and at trial said olden was 
the sole rapist 
she also testified at trial that olden threatened her with a 
knife although in earlier statements to police she did not allege 
that he was armed 
olden and harris said the woman consented to having sex with them 
at the trial the defendants lawyers sought to introduce 
evidence that the woman was living with another man bill russell 
who is black and a halfbrother of olden 
the defense lawyers said the woman concocted the story of being 
raped to prevent russell from learning the truth that she consented 
to sex with the defendants 
the trial judge refused to let the defense lawyers question the 
woman about whether she was living with russell 
the judge said allowing evidence of an interracial living 
arragnment would have created extreme prejudice against the 
woman 
harris was acquitted olden was acquitted of kidnapping and rape 
but convicted of forcing the woman to commit sodomy 
but today the supreme court said oldens right to confront his 
accuser was violated by excluding the evidence of the alleged 
victims living arrangement 
in an unsigned opinion the court said speculation as to the 
effect of jurors racial biases cannot justify exclusion of 
crossexamination with such strong potential to demonstrate the 
falsity of the alleged victims testimony 
justice thurgood marshall dissented on grounds that the court 
should have held formal arguments in the case rather than summarily 
reversimg oldens conviction 
the case is olden vs kentucky 885223

policymakers at the federal reserve concerned 
about renewed signs of inflationary pressures are poised to drive 
interest rates higher in a move that will put the central bank on a 
collision course with the incoming bush administration private 
economists said monday 
many analysts said the fed has already begun to tighten credit 
conditions and they predicted that its federal open market committee 
will vote for more restrictive policies at closeddoor strategy 
sessions tuesday and wednesday 
analysts said they based this belief on the fact that recent 
economic statistics have pointed to an economy still barreling 
ahead with inflationary pressures rising 
unemployment at 54 percent in november is close to 14year 
lows leading many economists to worry that tight labor markets and 
high factory operating rates will trigger price increases as 
production constraints bump up against high demand 
the data on growth and inflation clearly suggest the need for 
further tightening said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co in new york 
major banks boosted their prime lending rate two weeks ago to 
105 percent the fourth increase this year and the highest level 
for this benchmark business and consumer rate since mid1985 
many economists said they were looking for the prime rate to move 
up to 11 percent by late january with similar increases in other 
interest rates 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a 
government securities dealer said he expects mortgage rates that 
averaged 1046 percent for 30year fixedrate mortgages last week 
to climb 
by early next year i would look for mortgage rates to be 
around 11 percent to 1125 percent and rising he said mortgage 
borrowers should borrow now instead of waiting 
many economists said they were looking for another rise in banks 
prime lending rate but some said they did not think it would occur 
until the fed hikes its discount rate a move they predicted would 
occur by late january 
an increase in the discount rate the interest the central bank 
charges on loans to member commercial banks is the most dramatic 
signal the fed can send of its intention to push interest rates 
higher as a way of slowing an overheated economy 
the fed last hiked the discount rate on aug 9 pushing it to 65 
percent that move capped a series of lessnoticeable credit 
tightening steps the central bank had begun in late march 
the fed can also influence interest rates by selling us 
treasury securities to banks reducing the amount of money the banks 
have to support their loan activities this drives up the cost of 
those loans interest rates 
many analysts say they have detected signs that the fed is once 
again tightening credit behind the scenes they note that the 
federal funds rate the interest banks charge each other for 
overnight loans has been rising it averaged 859 percent last 
week the highest weekly average in two years and up from 844 
percent the week before 
some analysts however argued that the rise in the federal funds 
rate had occurred because of increased borrowing demand and not from 
any overt tightening by the fed but regardless of the reason 
analysts said they expected the central bank would go along with the 
trend toward higher interest rates in coming weeks 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan is a gradualist and i 
think we will see lots of small steps toward higher rates said 
david wyss chief financial economist for data resources inc in 
lexington mass 
an effort to fight inflation by boosting interest rates is not 
likely to sit well with presidentelect bush who is counting on 
robust economic growth to generate the higher government revenues he 
needs to balance the budget without raising taxes 
higher interest rates worsen the deficit in two ways they hold 
down economic growth and drive up the federal governments own 
borrowing costs interest on the 26 trillion national debt is now 
the thirdhighest government spending category behind defense and 
the programs in the department of health and human services 
the fed is projecting economic growth as measured by the gross 
national product of around 2 percent to 25 percent far below the 
reagan administrations forecast of 35 percent gnp growth next year 
the bush administration is likely to adopt the reagan economic 
forecast when it presents its own budget blueprint to congress 
because the higher growth forecast lowers the need for painful 
budget cuts to erase the deficit 
i think the fed believes we are at full employment and we cant 
tolerate strong growth any longer and it is time to hit the 
brakes wyss said that means the administrations job in terms 
of balancing the budget will be much harder 
the federal open market committee is composed of members of the 
federal reserve board and presidents of its regional banks and meets 
every six to eight weeks its decisions at those private sessions 
are not disclosed until after the next meeting is held

congested skies and damaged ground facilities 
contributed to the fatal crashes of two relief planes to armenia 
but night flights to the disaster scene will continue a senior 
aviation official said monday 
since wednesdays devastating earthquake more than 200 soviet 
relief flights and 38 foreign flights have descended on airports at 
leninakan and yerevan they still are streaming to armenia with 
more to come 
early monday all seven crew members aboard a yugoslav military 
transport were killed when their sovietbuilt an12 plane crashed 
and burned 7 miles from yerevans zvarnots airport 
an il76 carrying soviet soldiers to help rescue quake victims 
crashed near leninakans airport before dawn sunday killing all 78 
people on board said boris panyukov deputy director of civil 
aviation 
snow rain and fog have forced air traffic controllers to divert 
planes to airports in the neighboring republic of georgia and 
azerbaijan 
panyukov said that weather conditions were normal when the two 
planes made their approach he said both disappeared from the radar 
just before they crashed he provided no details on the reasons for 
either crash 
we were obliged to interrupt flights after the yugoslav crash 
for two hours but we do not see any reason to interrupt night 
flights he said 
the situation is difficult taking into account that the density 
of flights has increased dramatically he said 
the quake which leveled buildings also affected airport ground 
facilities 
there was certain destruction in terms of the airports in 
leninakan and yerevan electricity and energy supplies were cut and 
there were difficulties with the airfields he said but he added 
that the airfields in yerevan and leninakan now meet all standards 
for international air traffic 
colin wheeler an engineer with the airline air europe said an 
aeroflot aircraft clipped a parked boeing 707 on sunday he said the 
accident occurred when the soviet aircraft taxied behind the air 
europe plane which was bringing medical supplies to the stricken 
republic the air europe flight later was able to return to london 
the situation at the yerevan airport was unavoidably chaotic 
wheeler said 
soviet newspapers contained graphic descriptions of the air 
congestion at the mountainous leninakan airport 
airplanes were coming into leninakan literally one after 
another the daily newspaper izvestia said monday 
referring to the two crashes izvestia said how were these 
losses possible because in the air above yerevan there was such 
confusion just like on the ground 
the military newspaper red star made similar remarks sunday 
before the crashes 
the sky above yerevan is overloaded it said there are 
always several planes in the air waiting to land in these 
conditions precision is needed and strict coordination of 
operations

inspector general in 1986 and 1987 checked water enforcement 
programs in virginia maryland pennsylvania and west virginia where 
an estimated 3 million people were using those systems 
epa officials said in the report they believed those four states 
were representative of the nation which has 150000 noncommunity 
water sources serving 36 million people 
state personnel in west virginia estimated that 40 percent of 
their noncommunity systems were out of compliance the report 
said the numbers were similar for pennsylvania 40 percent in 
fiscal year 1986 and 29 percent in fiscal year 1987 the federal 
reporting data system indicated only 7 percent of the noncommunity 
systems in virginia had monitoring violations in fiscal year 1987 
however our review revealed that these numbers were substantuially 
understated 
for coliform bacteria to be checked every three months unless 
otherwise specified by the state the report said the state of 
maryland estimated that 90 percent of the noncommunity systems 
did not comply with federal testing requirements 
in the document epa officials said the shortcomings were a 
direct function of epas longstanding policy to place priority on 
assuring compliance by community water systems 
noncommunity systems have looser testing requirements than 
community systems but even those were being ignored the report 
said 
in 19711985 the centers for disease control was able to trace 
to noncommunity water systems 45 percent of 484 outbreaks of 
diseases carried by drinking water 
an epa spokesman did not immediately return a telephone call 
seeking comment on the report monday 
the epa comments in the document said the agency planned priority 
attention in the fiscal year beginning next oct 1 for the 20000 
noncommunity systems serving groups other than travelers and 
will also consider requiring state and regional epa offices to 
meet quotas for enforcement actions 
a noncommunity system might be a single well serving a school 
factory restaurant motel or campground more generally it is any 
system serving transients or nonresidents including supplies on 
buses trains and planes even though those might get their water 
from public systems 
suppliers are supposed to post public notices when testing 
discloses a violation of standards but we found only 11 of 826 
monitoring violations had evidence of public notification in the 
file the auditors wrote state personnel admit that followup 
on public notification requirements is inadequate 
in some violations repeat testing is required to ensure that a 
standard is being met out of 145 violations of concentration 
standards that were checked repeat sampling was required in 98 but 
only in two instances did the supplier initiate check sampling 
within the required 24 hours we found no evidence of any check 
sampling at all for 28 of the 98 violations in the remaining 68 
instances the supplier delayed the initiation of the check sampling 
process for periods ranging from two to 37 days the report said 
pennyslvania and virginia issued notices of violations to 
suppliers in only 173 cases out of 371 cases in which notices should 
have been issued and 56 percent of the notices were issued two 
months or more after the end of the quarter in which the violation 
occurred the report said 
maryland and west virginia were not reporting what enforcement 
actions they took but the auditors found only seven notices to 
suppliers out of 600 violations 
the states have primary responsiblity for enforcing the federal 
law except indiana and wyoming where epa is directly responsible 
in addition the agency is directly responsible for enforcement on 
indian reservations and in the district of columbia

president ghulam ishaq khan easily won 
his first full fiveyear term on monday and prime minister benazir 
bhutto won her first parliamentary vote of confidence 
ms bhutto told legislators after her peoples party won 14855 
that pakistans destiny does not belong to any one party 
it is the destiny of the entire people of pakistan each one of 
us has to shoulder the responsibility she said 
earlier rightwing lawmaker mohammad zaheer khan tried to block 
the confidence vote by saying the prophet mohammed taught that a 
woman could not rule moslems 
a few minutes later nearly 73 percent of his colleagues approved 
ms bhuttos leadership 
her party emerged as the largest single party nov 16 in the 
countrys first free elections in more than a decade but with 105 
seats it fell short of an outright majority in the 237seat 
legislature 
ms bhutto 35 since has gained support from several 
independents and minor parties which entitled her to become the 
first female prime minister in the moslem world 
under the constitution the governing party has to pass a vote of 
confidence in parliament within 60 days of forming a government 
federal election commissioner sa nusrat announced on television 
that ishaq khan of the muslim league swept 78 percent of 
presidential votes cast by an electoral college of the senate 
national assembly and four provincial assemblies 
ms bhuttos party and the rightwing opposition alliance headed 
by the muslim league both supported ishaq khan among the four 
presidential candidates guaranteeing his victory 
of 446 valid votes ishaq khan polled 348 compared with 91 to his 
nearest rival veteran politician nawabzada nasrullah khan nusrat 
said 
ishaq khan 78 credited with guiding pakistan back to democracy 
after 11 years of autocratic rule is to take the oath of office 
tuesday 
for the last eight years pakistan was ruled under martial law by 
president mohammed zia ulhaq who died in an aug 17 plane crash 
that investigators said was probably caused by sabotage 
because he was senate chairman the presidency passed to ishaq 
khan who has nearly 40 years of experience in senior administrative 
posts six of them as finance and commerce minister 
pakistans president holds a largely ceremonial post but the 
roles of both president and prime minister are under debate 
a 1985 constitutional amendment authored by zia gives the 
president broad but vague discretionary powers 
ms bhutto has called for a repeal of that amendment which would 
restore supreme political powers to the prime minister as they 
existed during her fathers 1970s government 
zia ousted zulfikar ali bhutto in 1977 and had him executed two 
years later for allegedly plotting to overthrow a political foe

united mine workers president richard 
trumka said monday the pittston group has until jan 31 to reach a 
new contract with 2000 union members in three states or face a 
strike 
we want to go the last step the last mile to see if an 
agreement can be reached trumka said at a news conference called 
to announce the start of a media campaign to pressure pittston to 
negotiate but this is one union that has never run from a fight 
and were prepared to fight this one 
but pittston president gene matthis who has said the company 
will continue to operate if the union strikes said monday he does 
not expect talks to resume soon 
we think it would be most unfortunate if the union would carry 
through with this matthis said it would create a lot of 
hardship in some of these communities 
pittston miners in west virginia virginia and kentucky have been 
working without a contract for 11 months since the 1984 national 
coal contract expired last jan 31 trumka said there have been no 
negotiations since nov 9 when pittston gave the union a 
takeitorleaveit offer 
trumka said the companys offer would weaken safety rights 
eliminate the eighthour day increase health care costs and give 
the company control of the pension plan 
pittston dropped out of the national coal industry bargaining 
organization before negotiations began for the 1988 agreement 
saying the companys needs were different than those of the rest of 
the industry the union contends pittston has demonstrated no 
interest in reaching an agreement 
matthis said his companys latest offer is better than the 
contract the umw recently signed with at massey coal co ending a 
bitter conflict that began in 1984 
the campaign announced by the union on monday will increase 
pressure against the company on all fronts trumka said he said 
the umw is urging other unions and their supporters to withdraw 
funds from banks lending money to pittston

edward burke the alderman once considered the 
strongest white mayoral candidate quit the contest monday and threw 
his support behind fellow democrat richard m daley 
daleys entry into the race a week ago doomed burkes chances 
particularly among white ethnic voters the source of both mens 
strongest support 
i can read the cards as well as anyone else burke said i 
said i would not continue in this race if all indications did not 
point to a successful result for me they do not at this time 
burke made the announcement after recent polls showed daley the 
cook county states attorney and son of legendary chicago mayor 
richard j daley leading the field 
he said he was joining daleys campaign because of the 
remaining candidates hes the one who has the best chance of 
winning 
burke 44 former chairman for the city councils finance 
committee was a leader of council opposition to mayor harold 
washington the citys first black mayor who died in office a year 
ago a special mayoral election will be held april 4 the primary is 
scheduled for feb 28 
burkes withdrawal means a clear field for daley in corraling 
the white ethnic vote said paul kleppner director of the social 
science research institute at northern illinois university in dekalb 
and a longtime observer of chicago politics 
kleppner predicted a daley victory unless one of the two leading 
black candidates mayor eugene sawyer and alderman timothy evans 
decides to drop out 
if both stay in the race they likely will split the vote in the 
black community and pave the way for a daley triumph kleppner said 
burkes announcement came a day after sawyer said he will seek to 
stay in office sawyer was elected acting mayor by fellow aldermen 
last december after washingtons death 
the other announced democratic candidates are aldermen timothy 
evans lawrence bloom and danny davis and former state sen james 
taylor 
former chicago parks superintendent edmund kelly withdrew from 
the democratic field dec 6 the day after daley announced his 
candidacy 
edward howlett son of a former democratic secretary of state is

most family doctors are inadequately trained to 
recognize and treat illness that stems from unhealthy environments 
at home or work a national academy of sciences panel said monday 
but rather than criticizing individual physicians the report 
from the institute of medicine committee said the fault lies with 
our highly sophisticated health care system in general because 
it is not geared toward preventive medicine 
lacking a solid foundation in occupational and environmental 
medicine as well as in the related disciplines of epidemiology and 
toxicology most primary care physicians are hardpressed to keep up 
with developments in the field the report said indeed the 
general medical literature contains relatively little about 
occupational and environmental medicine 
to counter that the panels most urgent recommendation was for 
establishment of a clearinghouse for doctors to call when 
confronted with a patient suspected of having an occupational or 
environmental disease 
it should be designed so that a single telephone call satisfies 
the practitioners informational needs the report said it 
could be based on an extension of the techniques used by the 
nations poison control centers 
the institute of medicine a branch of the national academy of 
sciences is forming a new advisory committee specifically to draw 
up more detailed suggestions for such a clearinghouse 
on a longer range the panel that turned in its report monday 
said physician fee schedules should be changed because the current 
procedureoriented reimbursement system and the emphasis on 
efficiency of practice is antithetical to the desired emphasis on 
prevention 
eventually the committee said the focus must shift to medical 
schools only half of which have a single faculty member primarily 
concerned with occupational health 
occupational and environmental medicine should be a vital part 
of the traditional student clinical assignments the report said 
because preventative medicine is usually not taught in the 
clinical years it is necessary that departments of clinical 
medicine include occupational and environmental medicine as part of 
their third and fourthyear teaching programs 
the report also called for more research into occupational and 
environmental medicine

according to the fbi reconstruction of the hoffa murder tony

seemed to go out of his way to seal an airtight alibi the 
encyclopedia said 
one of provenzanos teamster rivals local 560 dissident anthony 
casellito was garroted with piano wire 23 years ago the three 
provenzano brothers anthony salvatore and nunzio all have been

two israeli air force planes with supplies for 
armenias earthquake victims turned around and flew back home monday 
because an israeli already at their destination told them they were 
not needed officials said 
the civil defense commander maj gen aharon vardi radioed the 
pilots to return a few hours after takeoff so they could reorganize 
for a relief mission elsewhere in the area devastated by wednesdays 
earthquake israeli officials said 
vardi came to armenia on an earlier israeli relief flight a 
military spokesman said on condition of anonymity that vardi decided 
the planes could not be used effectively at the scene because 
their medical assistance was not needed in leninaken one of the 
hardesthit cities in the southern soviet republic 
the planes were carrying relief supplies medical teams and a 
field hospital 
the military spokesman stressed that the israeli official not 
the soviet government made the decision to order the usmade 
hercules airplanes back to israel 
he said the aircraft were waiting at ben gurion international 
airport in tel aviv for orders to return to the soviet union israel 
was waiting for further instructions from soviet authorities before 
sending the planes back he said 
when the planes took off monday moscows top diplomat in tel 
aviv said the assistance would bring the israeli and soviet peoples 
closer 
we are greatly moved by this said georgy martirosov head of 
the soviet consular delegation in tel aviv on israel army radio 
this help by the israeli people will bring us closer emotionally 
the soviet union broke diplomatic ties with israel during the

though the towns name evokes images of 
palm trees and sunny beaches the 650 residents of florida shivered 
in air that hit 18 degrees below zero monday the coldest 
temperature in massachusetts 
but townspeople say subzero temperatures are common in the 
mountainside community that sits 2800 feet above sea level just 
500 feet below the states highest peak mount greylock 
were just used to coping with stuff like that said wayne 
boyce a member of the board of selectmen its not unusual for us 
to have snow banks taller than cars 
when boston gets three or four inches of snow everybody 
panics nobody can move we get a couple of inches daily boyce 
boasted thats nothing for us 
he said the town in massachusetts northwest corner probably was 
named after the southern state because florida had a magical sound 
to it 
probably because of ponce de leon and the fountain of youth 
he said adding there also are floridas in neighboring new york and 
vermont 
einar oleson a former town clerk and member of the local 
historical society also believes the town was been named in honor 
of the state which the nation was considering buying from spain at 
the time of the towns incorporation in 1805 
another theory has it that the town was named for the wild 
azaleas called floribunda that once covered the mountain on which 
the community sits she said 
boyce said he rarely hears jokes about the towns moniker but a 
photograph several years ago of a resident holding a snow shovel and 
standing next to the frozen highway sign bearing the towns name was 
published in several newspapers in the southern state

usbacked moslem rebels on monday 
claimed they shot down an afghan military aircraft but 
afghanistans official radio gave a different account and said a 
passenger plane was shot down with all 25 people aboard killed 
official radio kabul charged that a pakistan air force plane on 
saturday shot down a sovietmade antonov26 airliner as it was 
heading toward kabul the capital from the eastern city of khost 
18 miles from the pakistan border 
pakistani officials denied the allegation 
abdul kabir a spokesman for the hezbeislami rebel group said 
guerrillas brought down a military transport plane on saturday with 
a sophisticated ussupplied antiaircraft missile 
radio kabul and the rebels known as mujahedeen or holy 
warriors presumably were referring to the same incident 
we only know that some government officials and other military 
officers were on the plane kabir said dismissing radio kabul 
claimskhost is under siege by mujahedeen and only military planes 
go there 
he said his guerrilla organization probably was the one involved 
because it is the strongest in the area and has most of the stinger 
missiles 
afghanistan and pakistan which signed a unbrokered accord in 
april providing for the withdrawal of more than 100000 soviet 
troops from afghanistan often accuse each other of air and missile 
attacks 
afghan guerrillas based in pakistan have been fighting kabuls 
communist government for 10 years 
on nov 21 radio kabul accused pakistan of shooting down a 
commercial plane that strayed into pakistani airspace killing all 
27 people aboard 
pakistan acknowledged the incident but identified the plane as a 
military transport 
pakistans air force has standing orders to shoot down intruding 
afghan military planes 
also on monday radio kabul said authorities responded to turkish 
appeals and freed two turks jailed for entering afghanistan 
illegally with rebels 
it said turgut osul and ottoman dimirial were released on sunday 
osul was arrested four years ago and sentenced to 16 years 
dimirial was arrested this year and sentenced to 20 years the radio

is practiced systemically in more than onethird of the worlds 
nations deputy director curt goering of amnesty international

government that are at fault dictatorships as well as democracies 
countries with military rule as well as civilian rule countries 
with free elections and countries with no elections 
he spoke to the washington chapter of the united nations 
association at a meeting to mark the 40th anniversary of the un 
declaration of human rights on dec 10 1948 goering said the past 
week had seen the discovery of graves of political prisoners in iran 
and in paraguay dozens of people were arrested demonstrating for 
human rights

israel thousands upon thousands of political prisoners languish 
uncharged and untried in filthy and overcrowded prison cells in

organization has any ideological interest saying it had been 
called communist by the government of guatemala and accused by the 
communist government of afghanistan of being in league with the 
voice of america

rep fernand j st germain the house banking 
chairman who lost his reelection bid in the wake of investigations 
into his relationships with industry lobbyists is contemplating a 
washington lobbying position an aide said monday 
hes talking with some people about setting up a washington 
office said rick maurano a top aide to the rhode island democrat 
maurano said he knew only that the talks were with a rhode island 
law firm that wants to create a washington office for lobbying 
activities 
st germain could not be reached for comment there was no answer 
monday afternoon at his rhode island home 
a bill passed by congress late in the legislative session would 
have prohibited st germain and other members of congress from 
lobbying their excolleagues for one year after leaving office but 
president reagan killed the measure late last month 
st germain 60 who has represented eastern rhode islands 
largely democratic 1st congressional district since 1961 lost his 
bid for a 15th term in november to republican newcomer ronald k 
machtley st germains loss was attributed largely to a series of

kellogg co said monday it has stopped 
using tropical oil in its cracklin oat bran cereal eliminating an 
unwanted dose of saturated fat for consumers who buy the cereal for 
cholesterollowering bran 
im elated said phil sokolof founder of national heart 
savers a nebraska organization that has campaigned against products 
which use tropical oils such as palm and coconut 
thousands of ounces of coconut oil will no longer be clogging 
the arteries of america as a result of kelloggs action he said 
oat bran helps keep down cholesterol while saturated fat can 
boost it people who have high levels of cholesterol run a higher 
risk of a clogging of the arteries that can lead to heart attacks 
joseph stewart senior vice president for kelloggs corporate 
affairs told sokolof in a letter that the company was taking 
coconut oil out of the cereal he said the new product will be on 
grocery shelves within three months 
stewart said monday that kellogg had been working on a new 
formula for cracklin oat bran because the cereal maker sensed 
growing public sentiment against use of tropical oils 
we dont want to lose it consumer confidence over confusion 
about one product out of 40 he said adding other kellogg 
products dont contain the tropical oils 
kellogg replaced the coconut oil in cracklin oat bran with a 
combination of cottonseed and soybean oils that eliminates the 
saturated fat content 
in addition to kellogg pepperidge farm earlier said it was 
taking tropical oil out of its breads with plans for removing it 
from cookies and sunshine biscuits inc said it was taking tropical 
oils out of its cookie products sokolof said 
sokolof said coconut oil contains 100 percent more saturated fat 
than lard 
coconut and palm oil are popular because they contribute to the 
shelf life of food products sokolof said many products advertised 
as being free of cholesterol contain tropical oils that can help 
cholesterol form after consumption he said 
when they say no cholesterol on a product it may be fine 
but it may contain highly saturated palm and coconut oils sokolof 
said 
national heart savers plans 140000 worth of ads tuesday in the 
wall street journal and usa today citing other products it says are 
high in palm and coconut oils 
the products to be cited tuesday are nabisco triscuit crackers 
and striped chips ahoy cookies post fruit amp fibre cereal 
pepperidge farm goldfish crackers keebler club crackers quaker 
chewy granola bars borden cremora creamer carnation coffeemate 
birdseye cool whip topping and procter amp gamble crisco all but the 
granola bars and chips ahoy cookies were cited previously sokolof

these are the ones that people eat and dont realize what

charges should be filed against the 
scrapbuilders of shoddily constructed buildings deatroyed by 
the earthquake that killed more than 50000 people in soviet 
armenia pravda said monday 
the communist party newspaper recommended the action in a 
scathing artlcle about apartment buildings in the devastated region 
that crumbled into concrete and metal graves over victims who were 
buried alive 
in fragments of concrete panels it is impossible to know 
whether there is more sand or more cement it said of the wreckage 
in leninakan a city of 250000 where more than threequarters of 
the buildings fell 
it is time to answer the question how many criminal cases were 
filed against the scrapbuilders and what was the outcome pravda 
asked who closed their eyes to the warnings of the seismologists 
here and in other regions 
all construction in the soviet union is handled by government 
agencies 
american earthquake experts have said a quake of the same 
strength would have killed only 1000 people in heavily populated 
southern california because of the difference in building techniques 
concreteslab apartment buildings were hastily built throughout 
the soviet union in the past 20 years to ease a chronic housing 
shortage 
the kremlin has sent a commission to leninakan to determine why 
so many buildings disintegrated in an area where where builders 
supposedly used construction techniques designed to survive quakes 
authorities have said the temblor last wednesday was stronger than 
expected in northwestern armenia 
photos of the ruins show entire sections of highrise residential 
buildings sheared off with no evidence of steel reinforcing bars at 
stress points as required in western countries 
if the construction of the buildings was better maybe less 
would have been destroyed leonid bibin deputy chief of soviet 
construction told a news briefing monday 
a broken slab on which was writtren this piece of concrete is 
not to be used lay in the rubble monday in leninakan short 
supply is common in soviet industry and workers often use the 
defective or makeshift to finish projects 
bibin said the earth shook vertically during the quake causing 
buildings constructed of concrete slabs to collapse he also said 
the earth was soft in some areas 
why did buildings from three years ago collapse while those of 
three or five stories built under former leader nikita khrushchev 
are still standing president mikhail s gorbachev demanded on 
television sunday night 
in leninakan older lowrise apartment blocks stood unscathed 
while everything built in the years of stagnation collapsed 
pravda said using the soviet term for the regime of the late leonid 
i brezhnev 
geophysicists more than once warned builders of the high 
seismic activity in northwest armenia but stubbornly they continued 
to raise five to ninestory buildings the paper said 
acccording to bibin every building more than five stories high 
collapsed 
kagik avakyan a resident of leninakan told the associated press 
the city had no buildings taller than two stories until 20 years ago 
because of the threat of earthquakes

israels highest ranking counterterrorism 
official alleged on monday that plo chairman yasser arafat had 
direct involvement in 10 terror attacks in israel and abroad 
yigal carmon special adviser on terrorism to prime minister 
yitzhak shamir told a news conference arafat was involved through 
approval of plans issuing orders and allocating the funds 
necessary for the special operations 
there are other types of involvement but i cannot specify 
he added 
the 10 acts carmon listed ranged from the july 1987 assassination 
in london of palestinian cartoonist naji alali known for his 
antiarafat drawings to the april 1986 bombing of a twa jetliner 
over greece which killed four people 
carmon gave no specifics and would not say how israeli officials 
concluded arafat was personally linked to the incidents 
his remarks came at a governmentsponsored briefing held to 
counter claims by arafat that the palestine liberation organization 
has accepted israel and renounced the use of terrorism 
a group of nine dovish labor party legislators published a 
statement monday saying they would endorse peace talks with the plo 
if the plo followed up its acceptance of israel with a renunciation 
of terrorism 
the statement appeared in leading newspapers and was seen as a 
significant shift in the thinking of mainstream politicians 
supporters included yossi beilin a former senior aide to foreign 
minister shimon peres 
it said that prospects of opening negotiations with this 
palestinian leadership have been brought closer but that 
without an unequivocal decision to renounce terror and stopping 
it there will be no negotiations 
the plo condemned terror but said the organization will continue 
armed operations in israeliheld territory

the united states britain and canada on monday 
agreed to suspend all lowlevel military jet training over west 
germany for the next three weeks out of respect for the victims 
of a fiery crash last week 
the suspension requested by the west german government after the 
dec 8 accident at remscheid will block military flight training 
below altitudes of roughly 10700 feet 
the suspension will remain in effect until jan 2 1989 at 
which point fighter training will resume the pentagon added in 
releasing a joint communique from the four nato allies 
in a related matter the us air force on monday denied 
newspaper reports that american soldiers used force to keep local 
residents and a news reporter away from the scene of last weeks 
crash 
the accident involved an air force a10 thunderbolt ii jet that 
slammed into a residential neighborhood in remscheid killing the 
pilot and five others on the ground and igniting a huge blaze that 
destroyed two dozen homes 
some west german officials have charged that american authorities 
mishandled the rescue efforts and delayed releasing information 
the suspension of lowlevel training through the holiday 
season was agreed to out of respect for the victims and the 
families of the victims of the remscheid accident and for capt 
michael foster usaf and his family the communique stated 
foster 34 of seal beach calif was the pilot of the a10 the 
accident immediately generated fresh demands in west germany for 
curbs on training flights by north atlantic treaty organization air 
forces 
the flight suspension was announced shortly after defense 
secretary frank c carlucci met behind closed doors at the pentagon 
with his west german counterpart defense minister rupert scholz 
neither scholz nor carlucci were available after the meeting to 
discuss the matter scholz previously had said that france belgium 
and the netherlands had agreed to his governments request 
on any given day in west germany the sky is filled with hundreds 
of jets and helicopters leading to public opposition that has been 
fueled by recent tragedies 
even before last weeks fatal crash 12 major accidents of 
military aircraft had killed 95 people this year alone they 
included 70 who died from an air show crash in ramstein in august 
allied military authorities ordered a temporary suspension of 
lowlevel training missions immediately after the remscheid crash 
only to see opposition west german political parties call for an 
outright ban on lowlevel flights and sharp cuts in air excercises 
a pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be named said 
there was a serious concern about honoring germanys request 
because we dont want to set any big precedent and we dont want 
to reduce our pilot proficiency standards 
in the end however us officials concluded they could not 
ignore a request from the west german government that was limited 
to a reasonable period of time the source added 
the pentagon following scholzs departure declined to elaborate 
publicly on the brief twosentence communique

sodium ascorbate and sodium citrate which are used in fresh cuts of 
pork to maintain the meats color 
the use of these substances in the product does not pose a

a key congressman said monday he wants an 
investigation into navy computer contracts in the wake of a ruling 
by a federal appeals board that specifications for a series of 
contracts had favored international business machines corp 
in the next two years congress will play an important role in 
the defense procurement question and with shrinking budgets it is 
important that we get the most for our defense dollars said rep 
james florio dnj 
florio is chairman of the energy and commerce consumer protection 
subcommittee 
speaking by telephone from his new jersey office florio said he 
has asked the general accounting office to investigate in the wake 
of last weeks decision by the general services administrations 
board of contract appeals 
the board ruled in a case involving a 150 million computer 
contract ibm competitors had complained charging that the navys 
specifications for the contract unfairly favored the giant company 
in the ruling judge robert w parker concluded that the navy 
contract solicitation provides for less than full and open 
competition and that the navy has not properly justified such a 
restriction on competition 
telephone calls seeking comment were not returned monday by navy 
officials 
the case involves a navy contract to purchase about 20 computer 
systems for 14 different data centers and facilities the 10year 
contract also includes training and technical support the 
specifications were issued more than a year ago 
the navy argued that using a single contractor would have 
technical and administrative advantages and suggested that using 
more than one source would mean noncompatible computers 
the protest to the gsa board was filed by pacificorp inc of 
mclean va one of the companies seeking to bid 
florio said he wanted the gao the congressional watchdog agency 
to investigate the process under which the navy has apparently 
violated federal procurement rules

the four turtles wielding ninja weapons have hit no 11 in the

lateevening diet of horrible television 
its insane said eastman 26 pete and i really had no 
idea what we were unleashing we were just two wildeyed kids who 
just wanted to do comic books 
eastman then an occasional student at the university of 
massachusetts said he tracked down laird who scraped out a living 
by drawing illustrations for local newspapers in 1982 because their 
cartoons looked alike 
the turtles were created after what eastman called a heavy dose 
of tj hooker and love boat at an apartment the two men 
shared while laird was still freelancing cartoons and eastman got 
by making sandwiches at a restaurant 
we had been watching a bunch of horrible tv and we started 
drawing and throwing the stuff at each other eastman said last 
week we found we had this little beastie that we really fell in 
love with 
the beast soon had three brothers all named after renaissance 
artists and a weird history involving a pool of goo in a new york 
sewer and a rat with the powers of a ninja master 
their creators scraped together 1200 and printed 3000 copies

rep dan coats who got his start in politics 
as an aide to dan quayle was named monday to take the vice 
presidentelects seat in the senate 
i believe in providence said coats the indiana republican 
who had succeeded his boss in the house eight years earlier when 
quayle moved up to the senate 
coats 45 had won reelection to a fifth house term on nov 8 
the same day quayle won the vice presidency as george bushs running 
mate 
indiana gov robert orr announced coats name at a news 
conference in indianapolis saying he represents values near and 
dear to the people of indiana 
quayle appearing with coats on capitol hill praised the 
republican congressman as a dedicated family man and trusted friend 
but he turned aside suggestions that coats was his handpicked 
successor 
this was a oneman vote the governor made the decision i 
did not make any specific recommendation quayle said 
coats thanked quayle orr and indianas senior senator 
republican richard lugar for their support and promised great 
efforts on behalf of his indiana constituents 
i realize im not their elected senator im their appointed 
senator i hope over the next two years to work my very hardest to 
earn their respect and support he said 
he will serve until a special election in 1990 when voters will 
decide whether he or someone else should fill the last two years of 
quayles term an election for a full sixyear senate term will be 
in 1992 
in response to a reporters question about the coincidence of 
twice following quayle into elected posts coats replied i 
believe in providence rather than fate however that house seat was 
a hotly contested seat in 1980 i hope that i earned that seat in 
1980 and in the subsequent eight years demonstrated my ability to do 
the job 
he had worked in quayles congressional office in fort wayne 
ind from 1976 to 1980 
orr said coats had the ability the intellect the character 
and the temperament to be an outstanding united states senator a 
thought echoed by lugar 
he is a remarkable legislator a remarkable campaigner but 
even more importantly a decent human being lugar said 
senate republican leader bob dole issued a statement welcoming 
coats to the senate and saying he was confident coats would 
continue to represent the people of indiana with vigor and 
commmitment to their heartland values 
in the house the lowkey coats has compiled a conservative 
record that drew an 82 percent approval rating in 1986 from the 
american conservative union 
he is a supporter of aid to the nicaraguan contras and to the 
angolan rebels in 1984 he attempted to attach to an education bill 
an amendment to cut off federal aid to schools and states banning 
voluntary school prayer the amendment was defeated 
in selecting coats orr cited his very fine electoral record 
in five house elections and an ability to build a strong base to 
withstand a democratic challenge coats has never received less than 
61 percent of the vote in his northeastern indiana district last 
month he won reelection with 62 percent 
his selection makes no change in the democraticrepublican split 
in the senate where democrats hold a 5545 majority in the new 
congress 
quayle has announced he will resign probably effective jan 2 
to allow his successor to gain seniority by being sworn in before 
the rest of the senate on jan 3 however coats said he expected to 
be sworn in with the rest of the senate 
several other names had been mentioned as potential candidates 
for quayles seat including former white house political director 
mitchell daniels and quayles wife marilyn both took themselves 
out of contention several weeks ago

president carlos salinas de gortari chose his 
predecessors treasury secretary as ambassador to washington on 
monday another sign of his desire to alter the terms of mexicos 
huge foreign debt 
an announcement from the foreign ministry said gustavo 
petriccioli who has a masters degree in economics from yale will 
replace jorge espinosa de los reyes 
salinas who began his sixyear term dec 1 has said 
renegotiating terms of the 102 billion foreign debt leads his 
priority list and he discussed it with presidentelect george bush 
at their meeting in houston last month 
as treasury secretary for the last two years of de la madrids 
term petriccioli sought a postponement of debt payments because of 
the financial squeeze caused by the collapse of world oil prices in 
the early 1980s 
he negotiated an an agreement with creditor banks signed march 
21 1987 that included 77 billion in new loans restructured 
437 billion of the debt and decreased interest rates on 86 
billion loaned in 198384 
petriccioli 60 also worked out mexicos purchase of several 
billion dollars worth of its foreign debt certificates at discount 
rates this year and helped enforce a solidarity pact of 
government business and labor that helped lower annual inflation 
from 1509 percent in 1987 to about 48 percent in 1988 
by keeping interest rates high and the pesos value virtually 
steady against the dollar petriccioli also managed to accumulate an 
alltime record of 16 billion in foreign currency reserves last 
year 
salinas has promised to lighten the burden of austerity economics 
on average mexicans whose real wages have been cut in half during 
the past six years 
salinas has noted mexicos economic growth remained near zero 
during that period and said renegotiating debt payments is vital to 
provide money for industrial development 
foreign creditors have balked at mexicos proposals to reduce the 
13 billion it is paying in debt service this year debt service 
payments for next year are estimated at 16 billion

the reagan administration renewed its offer 
monday of a substantive dialogue if yasser arafat the chairman 
of the palestine liberation organization explictly recognized 
israel and renounced terrorism 
the offer was made by the state department on the eve of arafats 
arrival in geneva for a un general assembly debate on the conflict 
between israel and palestinian arabs the session was shifted to the 
swiss city after secretary of state george p shultz blocked a visa 
for arafat to speak in new york 
shultz cited the plos terrorism record and called arafat an 
accessory he invoked a us law denying entry to terrorists as 
superseding a us agreement with the united nations to facilitate 
travel for foreigners to attend un sessions 
at the same time though shultz called palestinian participation 
in any mideast peace talks essential he also invited arafat to 
agree to three us requirements that must be met before the 
administration will hold diplomatic talks 
these are acceptance of un resolutions 242 and 338 adopted by 
the security council in 1967 and 1973 recognition of israels right 
to exist and renunciation of terrorism 
the two resolutions implicitly recognized israels right to exist 
within secure boundaries the palestine national council the 
legislative arm of the plo last month approved holding mideast 
negotiations within the framework of the resolutions but did not 
accept the resolutions directly 
in another move the council edged away from advocating 
terrorism but l paul bremer who directs the state departments 
office of counterterrorism said it did not amount to renouncing 
terrorism bremer referred to a reaffirmation of palestinians right 
to resist the israeli occupation of their land in any way 
possible 
and the plo group did not directly recognize israel 
weve put forward some very clearcut requirements which are 
necessary to satisfy to enter into a substantive dialogue with the 
plo charles e redman the state department spokesman said we 
look forward to the day when theyll do that step up to bat 
the us official called the three requirements a set of 
criteria and said when those criteria are satisfied when 
those conditions are met we are prepared to engage in a substantive 
dialogue 
still redman left unclear whether the united states would 
immediately deal with the plo if arafat met the three us 
conditions in geneva 
i dont want to predict what will happen he said we have 
to make a judgment when and if those three things are addressed 
that judgment i cant make in the abstract 
us policy on the mideast has not changed redman said 
the main aim is direct negotiations between israel and the arabs 
including palestinians on an overall peace settlement holding an 
international peace conference as a backdrop for such talks would be 
considered the us official said 
redman said vernon a walters the us ambassador to the united 
nations would represent the united states in the geneva debate

the last surviving witness to the alleged 
jailhouse confession of a farmworker in the poisoning of his seven 
children more than 20 years ago has recanted his testimony a 
newspaper reported monday 
james richardson was convicted for one of the 1967 killings and 
sentenced to life accused of putting the deadly insecticide 
parathion in a lunch a baby sitter served his children age 2 to 8 
now a cellmate who testified to a jailhouse confession says it 
never happened the miami herald reported monday 
i didnt hear richardson say anything while i was in there 
james weaver 67 told the florida department of law enforcement a 
statement he later repeated to the herald the newspaper said 
i aint never heard the boy say anything about it i hope 
richardson will get out i want him to get out 
weaver did not explain to state investigators or the newspaper 
why he may have lied at the trial saying he could not recall the 
details of his testimony 
the admission may lend additional impetus to a movement to spring 
richardson from prison 
the department of law enforcement already investigating the case 
at the request of gov bob martinez is expected to submit its final 
report to the governor this week 
we are examining it now and have been for the past number of 
weeks and the governor is actively considering reviewing it on a 
more formal basis brian ballard martinezs director of 
operations said monday 
he noted that the governor can call for a clemency hearing he 
hasnt made that decision yet he will be briefed on it probably 
this week 
richardsons lawyers had said earlier they plan to file a 
petition for a new trial thursday 
i think this weaver thing is going to put the icing on the 
cake john spencer robinson of arcadia who defended richardson at 
trial and initially appealed the case said monday 
some of the most damaging testimony against richardson at his 
1968 trial came from weaver and another felon james dean cuningham 
both of whom alleged that the 32yearold fruit picker had 
remorsefully and repeatedly confessed in his cell while awaiting 
trial 
a third convict died before trial but his similar account was 
read into the record cunningham was shot to death in 1979 no one 
has been arrested in that case 
weavers recantation is the latest in a series of developments to 
cast doubt on richardsons conviction his lawyers say 
the first came earlier this year when it was reported that the 
former baby sitter betsy reese now 67 told nurses in a nursing 
home in 1985 that she had poisoned the children 
and last week arcadias former chief of police richard barnard 
swore he believes richardson was framed by thendesoto county 
sheriff frank cline 
barnard said that weaver and cunningham were handpicked 
informants testifying in return for lenient sentences 
they would have done or said anything that frank cline asked 
them to do including making false statements under oath 
cline denied barnards allegation and prosecutors say the baby 
sitter who is immobile and has lapsed into utter silence became 
confused over the years because she had innocently served a poisoned 
meal 
richardsons new attorneys ellis rubin of miami and mark lane of 
washington said they will file an appeal to the state supreme court 
and to the trial court charging that the state knowingly used 
perjured testimony 
i want a jury to hear that he was framed and to bring out the 
perjury on the record rubin told the herald 
richardson now 52 is at the tomoka correctional institution in 
daytona beach where he will be eligible for parole in 1993

a group of congressmen asked education 
secretary lauro cavazos on monday to approve 70000 to disseminate 
a holocaust education program for which the reagan administration 
previously blocked funding 
the letter written by rep ted weiss dny and signed by 65 
colleagues said the course facing ourselves and history has 
been taught by 1000 teachers has rated at or near the top of its 
application category and received strong recommendations for 
approval from education department staff aides 
despite these factors the letter said money for the program was 
denied in 1986 1987 and 1988 at least partially on the basis of 
biased peer reviews one concluded that the nazi point of view 
however unpopular is still a point of view and is not presented 
nor is that of the ku klux klan 
the official who denied the funding shirley curry was removed 
from her job two days before weiss government operations 
subcommittee on human resources held a hearing on the matter in 
october 
the bipartisan group of house members said all evidence indicates 
facing history is an excellent program and should be distributed 
to all schools that want to use it they asked cavazos to review the 
departments past actions and use his discretionary authority to 
release money for it

doctors reported emperor hirohitos condition was 
unstable monday as he continued to bleed internally and his blood 
pressure fluctuated palace officials said 
the 87yearold monarch received a transfusion of nearly a pint 
which helped raise his systolic blood pressure to 104 up from 71 in 
the morning imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda said 
the average reading is about 120 
his condition cannot be described as stablemaeda quoted 
doctors as saying 
hirohito who has been bedridden since he started to bleed from 
his intestine sept 19 lost considerable amounts of blood last 
week doctors have said an intestinal blockage has forced some of 
the blood into the abdomen 
a palace official said on condition of anonymity that doctors 
were draining the blood from hirohitos abdomen because there is 
the fear that his breathing could be affected by the buildup of 
blood 
the functioning of each internal organ has more or less 
declined in the wake of the bleeding last week maeda told 
reporters 
the emperor slept most of the day monday but he at times has 
shown signs of consciousness maeda said media reports said 
hirohito was in a semicoma 
his overall condition is gradually weakening but there has 
been no sudden change said the palace official 
the emperor has no political power but serves as a symbol of the 
unity of japan

the united states is denying refugee status to large 
numbers of soviet jews at the main american processing point for 
soviet emigres jewish officials say 
the rome center has refused 201 refugees in the past three 
months said ernest berger european director for the hebrew 
immigrant aid society 
us immigration officials blame a sharp jump in the number of 
soviet jews permitted to leave their country more than the soviet 
refugee slots set by the united states 
their rejections have stunned soviet jews who are being 
temporarily housed in the seaside town of ladispoli near rome 
its awful we are all in shock said eugene shpaeyr 31 a 
biologist who came from riga this fall with his wife and two 
children 
the overwhelming number of soviet jews still are granted us 
refugee status us and jewish officials say and those rejected 
may appeal or apply for public interest parole the latter program 
differs from the refugee program in that emigrants must pay their 
own transport to the united states cannot claim welfare and must be 
sponsored by a relative or friend 
most soviet jews do not want the parole since it does not allow 
them to become us citizens or permanent residents said berger 
the jews also can move to israel he said in a telephone 
interview from geneva 
a spokesman for the us immigration and naturalization service 
in washington said soviet jews used to get refugee status almost 
automatically 
now there are more people than funded positions he said on 
condition of anonymity youre going to take those who present 
the best cases of persecution youre going to take those in a more 
precarious position 
serge liberman 29 an engineer from leningrad who came to italy 
in september with his mother argues jews still are attacked 
we were afraid for our lives he said 
like most rejected jews liberman is appealing his case 
it seems strange for all the refuseniks he said we dont 
understand what is the difference between us and those who got 
refugee status all of us suffered persecution because we were 
jews 
berger also said the rejections seemed arbitrary 
thats possible the immigration spokesman said but 
previously we were not faced with having more applicants than slots 
available 
berger said the number of soviet emigrants arriving in rome grew 
from 2700 in november to 1500 in the first two weeks of december 
alone 
the united states has agreed to accept 24500 refugees from 
eastern europe and the soviet union in fiscal 1989 which began on 
oct 1 
although the number is higher than last years 18000 slots it 
apparently will not meet demand the 3000 slots designated for 
soviet refugees in the first quarter of the year were filled by oct 
31 the immigration spokesman said

the state department on monday denounced the 
kidnappers of us marine lt col william r higgins for a 
grotesque assertion that he had been tried and sentenced to 
death 
spokeswoman nancy beck also dismissed their accusation that 
higgins had spied for israel as nonsense she said the 
kidnappers would be held fully responsible for the american 
officers safety and welfare 
the proiranian group holding higgins said in a statement in 
beirut that he would be executed the spy has been turned over to 
those responsible for executing this just and revolutionary 
verdict said the statement delivered to the beirut newspaper 
annahar 
a photocopy of a photograph purporting to show higgins in a dark 
sweater was pasted to the bottom of the 15line statement captors 
of foreigners in lebanon usually provide a photograph to 
authenticate their statements 
higgins 43 of danville ky was head of a 76man observer 
group attached to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon when 
he was kidnapped near the southern port city of tyre on feb 17 
spokeswoman beck in behalf of the state department called upon 
the hostagetakers and those with influence over them to release 
immediately and unconditionally col higgins and all other hostages 
in accordance with universal humanitarian obligations 
according to state department records nine americans three 
britons an irishman an italian and a belgian are held hostage in 
lebanon 
ms beck said the notion that kidnappers have the right to try 
their victims is grotesque the rendering a judgment of those who 
have committed a criminal act is a perversion of civilized concepts 
of justice the socalled trial and outcome represent a cyncial 
attempt to exploit toe holding of hostages particularly during the 
christmas seasnon 
the us statement added the charge that col higgins is a spy 
is nonsense 
it also noted that higgins was in lebanon as a member of the 
united nations treaty supervision organization which had just won 
the nobel peace prize when he was abducted

a forthcoming report on renovation of the 
nations nuclear weapons plants envisions concentrating most 
facilities in three theme parks sources familiar with the 
document said monday 
the classified report estimates that the production facilities 
owned by the energy department need 50 billion worth of renovations 
and modernization according to administration and congressional 
sources who spoke on condition they not be identified 
the report has been sent to the white house and accounts of some 
provisions of it appeared over the weekend and on monday in the 
washington post and the los angeles times 
the white house had been scheduled to send it to the house and 
senate armed services committees later this week but an 
administration source said the schedule might slip 
the theme park plan would organize many weapons activities 
around the principal nuclear material involved eventually 
concentrating all plutonium processing at the idaho national 
engineering laboratory near idaho falls uranium activities at oak 
ridge tenn and tritium activities at the savannah river plant 
near aiken sc congressional sources said 
this would mean closure of the rocky flats plant near denver 
which makes plutonium triggers for thermonuclear weapons powered by 
tritium and the feed materials production center near fernald 
ohio a uranium foundry according to the report 
there are other activities that could be moved into the theme 
parks and the sources said they were not sure just which might be 
moved 
doug elmets press secretary for the department declined to 
comment on the report 
rep david e skaggs dcolo whose district includes the rocky 
flats plant said he was unaware of the plan for theme parks and 
would not comment without seeing the report 
the rocky flats plant is closed for cleanup inside one of its 
buildings because of accidental contamination of three employees in 
october 
an administration source said the energy department had not 
changed its estimate that 110 billion would be needed over the next 
40 years to repair environmental damage at the 17 factories and 
laboratories in 12 states involved in manufacturing nuclear weapons 
and components 
the report called the 2010 report for the time horizon it is 
to look toward calls for the operation of four new gascooled 
reactors to manufacture tritium at the idaho facility and a new 
watercooled reactor at the savannah river plant in a design similar 
to the three existing tritium reactors there 
the savannah river tritium reactors are closed to upgrade safety 
equipment and procedures energy secretary john herrington has said 
he expected them to reopen in the spring or summer but some 
published accounts have said it might be later than that 
tritium decays fairly rapidly 55 percent of any starting 
amount turns into inert helium in a year and must be replenished 
in the nations nuclear weapons from time to time supply figures 
are secret no such replenishment is needed of uranium and plutonium 
components which frequently are recycled into new weapons when old 
ones are retired 
the departments 68 billion plan to replace its tritium 
reactors released last summer called for a new savannah river 
reactor and only one idaho reactor though the idaho reactor was of 
a modular design that could be reproduced easily 
both new designs could produce either tritium or plutonium 
according to the design of the uranium fuel they are loaded with to 
produce tritium lithium is added to fuel assemblies 
one congressional source said the department was faced with a 
choice of where to put the plutonium site idaho falls or the 
hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash and it chose idaho 
because of growing opposition in the richland area and the severity 
of contamination there 
the idaho reactors would sell either electricity or steam to 
make electricity to a local utility according to the departments 
summer plan a nowmothballed hanford reactor sold steam to the 
washington public power supply system for 25 years to make 
electricity

michigan women with unwanted pregnancies 
and little money began to search for alternatives to statepaid 
abortions monday as a voterapproved ban on medicaid funding for the 
procedure took effect 
health clinics offered discounts and nointerest loans to women 
unable to pay the usual abortion charge of about 250 but officials 
said they wont be able to cover all of the 6 million the state had 
been spending on about 18500 medicaid abortions a year 
well be turning away some people and we think thats really 
unfortunate said margy long public affairs specialist at the ann 
arborbased planned parenthood of midmichigan 
proponents of the law said that those who believe abortion is 
murder shouldnt be forced to subsidize abortions through their tax 
payments and expressed hope that it would forestall some abortions 
the planned parenthood affiliate is one of several offering 
financial aid to women seeking abortions long said planned 
parenthood will charge lowincome women 195 the same amount 
medicaid paid and about 70 less than what women with insurance are 
charged 
nointerest loans will be available for those who cant come up 
with that much she said 
the reproductive health care centerplanned parenthood of 
kalamazoo has raised nearly 50000 for its emergency loan program 
said louise safron executive director 
we figure it needs to be 100000 or more she said 
but safron said even at that level not all women will be able to 
obtain abortions 
i can only go back to my experience in ohio when it defunded 
women covered by medicaid about 90 percent sought and received 
abortions and 10 percent gave up trying to find the money and 
continued their pregnancies well have to wait and see what happens 
in this state she said 
the end to medicaid abortions came 10 days after the board of 
state canvassers officially certified the nov 8 vote by which 
michigan citizens decided 57 percent to 43 percent to stop the 
state funding 
more than 450000 medicaid recipients were notified by mail that 
abortions would no longer be paid for beginning monday said bob 
harris spokesman for the department of social services 
carmen franco administrator of the 15 womancare clinics in 
michigan which perform a large share of the states abortions said 
not all women may have realized the cutoff was taking effect 
some of those who did rushed to have the procedure done last 
week resulting in a patient load on saturday nearly double the 
usual she said 
its quiet today because of all the rush through last week 
well see by the end of the week how many people really heard what 
was going on she said 
by midday monday no one had sought to take advantage of the 
clinics cutrate of 50 for medicaid women she said women with 
private insurance or who pay cash are charged 225 
franco said the 50 fee probably will still be too much for some 
women 
its those you worry about they may get desperate and try 
something foolish and then you have a hospital case in the worst 
case they die she said

government offered negotiations to include the government church 
and opposition 
the talks reached an impasse after the government refused to 
legalize solidarity which was founded in 1980 crushed during 
martial law in 1981 and outlawed in 1982 solidarity is demanding 
the government at least signal it will consider legalization before 
the union will join talks 
the talks were necessary but on the condition we are 
considered free and independent said walesa who won the 1983 
nobel peace prize for creating the first independent trade 
federation in a communist state 
he said the union should continue struggling to improve the lives 
of its members but must do so without destroying the country 
poland doesnt need any more strikes right now strikes are a 
last resort an ultimate weapon which can ricochet and hurt 
society walesa said 
he said he had high hopes for soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs attempts to reform the soviet system 
the change in soviet society is a process that does not bring 
immediate results it takes time to change the way people think 
walesa said adding he did not wish to jeopardize gorbachevs 
reforms

their career paths and political philosophy 
are similar but people who know both men say daniel r coats will 
bring a different background and style to the us senate than the 
man he replaces vice presidentelect dan quayle 
in contrast to quayle an exuberant campaigner coats is very 
lowkey said former secretary of state edwin j simcox 
jill l long a democrat who has run against both quayle and 
coats said coats is not a passionate speaker but contended he is 
stronger than quayle in other ways 
his style was more substantive than dan quayles said long 
who lost to quayle in the 1986 senate race and to coats in the 
november election for the us house he is more of an 
intellectual than is dan quayle

distinguish them by calling them danny and dan nobody ever called 
him danny coats 
beers called coats a kind of allamerican boy a successful 
athlete and accomplished student who became a good family man and

vice president and legal counsel for mutual security life insurance 
co in fort wayne 
married for 23 years coats and his wife marcia have three

right to serve the final two years of quayles term 
coats has never received less than 61 percent of the vote in the 
northeastern indiana district he defeated long in november with 62 
percent of the vote

a federal judge monday refused to stop random 
drug testing of uniformed secret service agents but did not rule on 
the constitutionality of the program 
us district judge thomas flannery denied a motion by a public 
employees union for a preliminary injunction noting that other 
courts have refused to halt ongoing drugtesting programs while the 
question of their legality is still pending 
flannery did not rule on the merits of the challenge saying he 
would issue an opinion within a week but the judge indicated during 
a hearing that he might treat testing of police officers differently 
than regular civilian federal employees 
the random drug testing was challenged by 1013 uniformed secret 
service officers who guard the white house and foreign embassies in 
the nations capital the uniformed division officers association 
contends that the urine testing is an unconstitutional invasion of 
privacy 
just last week flannery barred the agriculture department from 
randomly testing 750 plant pest and animal disease inspectors 
saying there was no justification for invading their privacy 
flannery noted the inspectors did not carry weapons and were not 
considered law enforcement officials 
in that decision however flannery upheld testing of individual 
employees suspected of being impaired by drug use while on the job 
at mondays hearing flannery said the officers were part of a 
paramilitary force and had a reduced expectation of privacy stemming 
from their enlistment in the secret service 
they know what kind of work they are getting into flannery 
said they go into this job with their eyes open 
flannerys decision was hailed by assistant attorney general john 
bolton as recognition of the importance of ongoing drug testing in 
law enforcement

kidnappers holding lt col william r 
higgins said monday they have decided to execute the us marine 
as a spy for israel 
we have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this 
american spy said a typewritten arabic statement signed by the 
organization of the oppressed on earth and delivered to the 
independent beirut newspaper annahar 
a photocopy of a picture purporting to show higgins the most 
recent kidnap victim of nine americans held hostage in lebanon was 
plastered at the bottom of the 15line statement hostage holders in 
lebanon usually insert a picture with a statement to prove its 
authenticity 
in its statement the group said the decision to kill higgins was 
a retaliation for israeli attacks against our people in occupied 
palestine the west bank and gaza strip and predominantly 
shiite south lebanon 
it also said higgins would die in revenge for the blood of the 
martyrs of the latest israeli raid on a palestinian guerrilla base 
nine miles south of beirut nine guerrillas were killed friday in 
the israeli attack an israeli officer also died 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
he had no details of the threat beyond press reports 
these hostages are all innocent victims redman said they 
should all be released immediately col higgins was there on a 
mission of peace as a member of an international peacekeeping 
operation he like the others is an innocent victim 
nancy beck a department spokeswoman said later the notion 
that kidnappers have the right to try their victims is grotesque 
the socalled trial and outcome represent a cyncial attempt to 
exploit the holding of hostages particularly during the christmas 
season 
her statement added the charge that col higgins is a spy is 
nonsense 
higgins 43 of danville ky was head of a 76man observer 
group attached to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon when 
he was kidnapped near tyre on feb 17 
the organization of the oppressed on earth believed made up of 
shiite moslems loyal to iran previously charged that higgins used 
his un uniform as a cover for espionage united nations and us 
officials denied the charge 
the new picture resembled a photograph released by the kidnappers 
april 21 that photo showed the balding higgins stoopshouldered 
with his eyes cast down he had gray stubble on his cheeks and was 
wearing a dark field jacket 
the statement accompanying the earlier picture said the group had 
put higgins on trial before a tribunal of the oppressed on 
spying charges 
in mondays statement the group said it has been proven by 
clearcut evidence that higgins and his american team of observers 
are guilty of providing the zionist enemy with accurate and detailed 
military and security information about our resistance fighters 
their positions movements supply routes and the quantity and 
quality of their weaponry 
the spy has been turned over to those responsible for executing 
this just and revolutionary verdict the statement said no 
specific execution date was mentioned 
there have been three other communications from the group since 
higgins abduction two statements listing demands for his release 
and a videotape in which higgins repeated the demands 
the demands focused on the release of palestinian and lebanese 
prisoners held by israel and its proxy militia the south lebanon 
army israel rejected the demands 
fifteen foreigners are missing and presumed kidnapped in lebanon 
they are nine americans three britons one irishman one italian 
and a swiss the longest held is american terry anderson 40 chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press who was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
higgins sister mary fisher of louisville ky said she heard 
of the kidnappers statement only from news reports 
higgins a decorated vietnam veteran is married to marine maj 
robin higgins and has a 17yearold daughter 
he graduated from high school in louisville and from miami 
university of ohio on rotc scholarship in 1967 he earned masters 
degrees in human resources management at pepperdine univiversity in 
california and in political science at auburn in alabama

solidarity condemned antigovernment 
violence and the government defended the past use of martial law 
monday the eve of the seventh anniversary of a crackdown on the 
independent labor movement 
also monday about 200 steel workers at the nowa huta steel mill 
near krakow went on strike said solidarity activist stanislaw 
handzlik 
he said by telephone from the area that the workers are demanding 
a 50 percent pay increase the plant has been a center of strikes 
directed by the banned solidarity movement 
solidarity which the government repressed when it imposed 
martial law seven years ago and banned in 1982 denounced the 
stoning of a gdansk police station by about 300 young people 
in connection with this incident we want to recall the 
fundamental principle of solidarity which is struggle without 
violence union spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said in a statement 
from warsaw 
a group of people mostly teenagers marched to a police station 
sunday threw stones at it breaking most of its windows riot police 
chased away the attackers without reported arrests 
the solidarity statement did not say how closely the marchers 
were connected with the group but a solidarity spokeswoman in 
gdansk joanna wojciechowicz said older activists had tried to 
dissuade the younger marchers without success 
the solidarity official in warsaw said riot police often use 
shockingly brutal means against demonstrators and that many 
young people have grown up in the violate climate 
but he added polish society as a whole does not give in to 
such a climate and that is what determines our strength solidarity 
cannot answer violence with violence 
solidaritys leader lech walesa won the nobel peace prize in 
1983 he returned to warsaw on monday after a visit to france his 
first trip outside the country since 1981

it helped to prevent national catastrophe

on dec 13 1981 suppressed solidarity and detained thousands of 
its faithful including walesa nine coal miners were killed by 
security forces during the crackdown called the state of war in 
polish 
dictated by a supreme necessity the events did not stop 
the process of democratization and broad reforms the statement 
said 
under conditions of order not anarchy businesslike 
discussion not sterile disputes the sense of socialist renewal was 
restored 
government officials have argued that solidarity in the early 80s 
spearheaded activities that threatened the authority of the 
communist party and might have prompted a soviet invasion

gov james r thompson signed into law monday a 
bill calling for a sweeping overhaul of chicagos school system 
which former federal education secretary william bennett once 
labeled the worst in the nation 
thompson signed the bill after a symbolic walk from a 
105yearold school that is closing to the gymnasium of a new 46 
million school on chicagos west side the legislation he said was 
an important first step 
parents and other community members have been given 
unprecedented opportunities with this bill to control their local 
school systems the governor said in a statement 
the muchdebated measure which takes effect in july calls for a 
shift of authority from the school systems central bureaucracy to 
parents and principals in each of its 592 schools 
it removes incumbent members of the chicago board of education 
and calls for the mayor to appoint a new board whose nominees are 
suggested by a grassroots screening committee 
the legislation also establishes local councils made up of 
parents teachers and community residents the councils one for 
each school will have power to hire and fire principals draft 
plans for improvements and exercise some control over spending 
school principals will lose tenure and work under fouryear 
contracts to be renewed on the basis of performance they also will 
have increased authority to fill teaching vacancies 
while no law can ensure that our students will do better in the 
classroom this legislation will provide a more direct and 
meaningful system that will be accountable for the education of our 
children thompson said 
the old school where the march to the signing ceremoney began 
monday was built in 1883 it is to be razed to make more room for a 
hightech research development 
thompson and chicago mayor eugene sawyer led a procession of 
students carrying blue and gold balloons from the old school to the 
new they joined school board officials in cutting a ribbon at the 
new school before the students entered the building they let their 
balloons float skyward 
the reform movement that provided impetus to pass the bill grew 
in part out of a bitter teacher strike in the fall of 1987 the 
year thensecretary bennett called chicago schools the worst in 
the nation 
his comments helped fan a heated citywide discussion of schools 
and spur legislators to action 
a bill similar to the one signed into law monday was passed by 
the general assembly last summer but that measure was caught in 
political bickering between thompson and democratic lawmakers from 
chicago over control of an oversight board 
the dispute was settled with passage of a new bill that gives 
oversight powers to the existing chicago school finance authority 
created nearly a decade ago after an earlier financial crisis

caused by illegal fireworks 
from a balcony residents flung soggy pieces of burnt paper and 
wood at mayor manuel camacho solis who took office dec 1 one 
person waved a sign that asked to whom do we owe this tragedy 
hundreds of people milled around camacho solis as he and his 
aides tramped over muddy ashes and past burned candy stores melted 
rolls of plastic soaked cigarette packages mounds of scorched 
peanuts and twisted steel beams 
we share the pain of the families who lost relatives in this 
tragedy the mayor said during his visit to merced market in the 
heart of mexico city

unexploded fireworks were still stored after sundays disaster

pope john paul ii gave his blessing monday to 
a group of traditionalist priests and seminarians who broke with 
rebel archbishop marcel lefebvre to remain loyal to the papacy 
vatican officials said 
the pope greeted the 40 members of the fraternity of st peter 
offering his blessing to each one and posing for photographs with 
them said the officials who asked not to be identified 
the group was accompanied by cardinal augustin mayer who heads a 
vatican commission that seeks to convince lefebvres followers to 
stay with the mainstream roman catholic church 
lefebvre a frenchman heads an ultratraditionalist movement 
that rejects many of the modernizing reforms of the second vatican 
council 196265 
he was excommunicated after he consecrated four bishops without 
papal approval in switzerland in june causing the first schism in 
the church in more than a century the vatican has warned lefebvres 
followers that they also face excommunication if they adhere to the 
schism 
but the pope has promised to meet their traditionalist needs 
including wider use of the 16th century latin mass if they remain 
loyal to rome

a canadian businessman offered 3625 
million monday for the ptl television ministry but a bankruptcy 
official said the bid probably will be rejected by a judge 
ptls courtappointed trustee mc red benton said i 
would have to conclude that us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds 
would not approve the offer when it is reported to him at a hearing 
tuesday in columbia 
benton predicted reynolds would order the ministrys assets 
liquidated but he said its possible the judge would open bidding 
again at tuesdays hearing reynolds has declined to comment on the 
proceedings 
the judge had wanted the bidding to start at 50 million benton 
and the bidders declined to say why the bids were far short and far 
below offers made earlier but the prospective buyers said more bids 
were expected tuesday 
this is more or less a card game where each side is testing the 
other side and i think they the bidders are looking forward to 
meeting in court with a proposal all of their own benton said 
reynolds has said if no appropriate bid was made he would order 
a liquidation of the ministry if a bidder meets his guidelines 
during the auction run by benton the judge said he planned to 
approve a sale tuesday 
the ministry filed for bankruptcy reorganization in june 1987 
three months after founder jim bakker left amid revelations of 
luxurious living and hush money paid to jessica hahn a church 
secretary with whom bakker had a sexual liaison 
mondays high bid was put in by stephen mernick a toronto 
realestate developer and orthodox jew the opening bid was 20 
million by cy bahakel a former north carolina state senator who now 
owns 15 television stations 
the offers were far below the appraised value of ptls assets 
between 92 million and 110 million and half of that offered in 
the initial auction in november 
the auction which was closed to the public began about 2 pm 
and ended about 345 pm 
the four apparent contenders for the assets mernick bahakel 
heritage ministries president sam johnson and a new bidder michael 
karas president of first canadian development co of toronto all 
said they may bid tuesday 
heritage ministries did not bid monday karas said he dropped out 
of the bidding shortly after it began because he said it was obvious 
none of them was going to meet the terms set down by reynolds which 
included starting bids at 50 million 
johnson said he held off bidding because he was unwilling to meet 
a condition of the sale that called for the down payment to be 
forfeited if the wouldbe buyer is unable to secure financing 
mernick had said he intended to offer less than 70 million for 
the 2200 acres of property which includes a 500room hotel a 
water park a television studio and a 2000seat church 
a month ago mernick said he would pay 115 million 50 million 
of it cash but reynolds rejected the bid saying there were 
inadequate assurances that mernick would pay the remaining 65 
million 
asked monday why he bid only 3625 million he said thats 
the bid i made 
johnsons group held a telethon on ptls tv show last weekend to 
try to bring contributions up to 5 million for a deposit on the 
property 
johnson said the last of the money was raised shortly before noon 
on monday 
this 5 million represents a statement on the part of the body 
of christ that cannot be ignored he said on mondays television 
show 
the only appraisal so far of ptls property is based on its value 
as an active ministry that appraisal conducted for benton by 
arthur little amp co of atlanta says that with a charismatic 
leader the property would be worth 110 million 
under a stabilized ministry with no wellknown figure to 
solicit donations the estimate dropped to 92 million 
the appraisal estimated that sold piecemeal ptl would bring 
from 76 million to 85 million 
some say the lack of interest in the property puts those figures 
in serious doubt and that the scandals involving bakker make the 
ptl property even harder to sell bakker and his top ptl deputy 
richard dortch were indicted last week on fraud charges

mcdade rpa accepted gifts in violation of house rules 
in his written request to the panel common cause president fred 
wertheimer did not accuse mcdade of breaking the law or violating 
ethics standards but he said serious questions raised about the 
scranton lawmakers activities warranted an inquiry

journal report that the fbi was probing whether mcdade illegally 
accepted more than 45000 in campaign gifts and speaking fees from 
officials associated with united chemcon corp a pennsylvania firm 
that mcdade was helping 
timothy tomastik mcdades press secretary said the pending 
investigation prevents the congressman from answering any of the 
allegations yet nor did mcdade have any comment on common causes 
letter tomastik said 
house members must identify gifts of 250 or more and are asked 
to avoid situations in which even an inference might be drawn 
suggesting improper action

three trains crashed into each other near a busy 
south london junction during rush hour monday morning hurling 
bodies onto the tracks as the cars split open like a ripe 
tomato officials said they counted 36 dead 
more than 110 of the estimated 1500 passengers on the trains 
were hospitalized 32 with serious injuries such as multiple 
fractures crushed abdomens and amputations hospital and ambulance

the british railways board said a preliminary investigation cast 
blame on a technical fault that arose after work on signaling 
equipment

mcmillan london fire brigades assistant chief officer surveying 
the scene at the clapham junction one of europes busiest train 
crossways 
police and fire brigade officials said 34 people died in the

36 
some bodies were so badly dismembered that limbs were placed in 
separate body bags adding to confusion about the toll said john 
norris a fire brigade divisional officer police inspector barry 
webb said some limbs were unaccounted for and therefore the toll

trains were packed with 1500 people many of whom were standing

the kingston house is holding lotteries these days 
for beds trying to be fair as it goes about meeting long lines at 
the shelter each day even in new england theres just no getting 
used to the kinds of demands that record cold can put on people 
the first blast of the 198889 winter season monday brought a 
record low for the date of 2 degrees with most of the impact seen 
at shelters 
at the kingston house seven homeless people were in line as the 
doors to the shelter opened at 630 am phil gonzalez in charge of 
admitting people to the shelter said a lottery has been held before 
noon in recent days for the beds those who lose out are referred to 
other shelters or offered a blanket and the floor 
he said that typically about 60 people take part in the lottery 
seeking one of the 40 beds at the shelter available for transients 
the other 20 beds at the shelter are used by residents who stay for 
months while they take part in a rehabilitation program 
throughout the city sunday night about 75 people were 
transported to shelters and more were expected as the cold weather 
continues mayor raymond l flynn said 
electricity demand set a wintertime record in the region monday 
and came close to surpassing the alltime record a spokesman said 
i dont have a final number set for today yet but we can 
definitely say we surpassed the previous winter record of 19277 
megawatts said bill sheperdson of the new england power pool 
mondays average peak load was between 19400 and 19500 megawatts 
he said the system record of 19500 megawatts was set during a heat 
wave in august 
elsewhere life went on albeit at a slower pace

a week at sea

line of work southmayd said 
gerry cudyer who runs the citys 24hour hotline for citizen 
complaints said her office received about 100 calls since the 
temperature took a dive sunday most were about a lack of heat from 
tenants whose landlords seemed unprepared for the cold she said 
in winter its inevitable but when it was 50 degrees last 
week they let the oil run out she said they were caught by 
the dramatic swing in temperature from 50 to 0 in a matter of days

commission and a mayor who heads a national conference on the issue

flynn said the federal commitment to providing housing dropped 
off sharply during the reagan administration the mayor also touted 
bostons pledge to provide a warm bed and hot meal for anyone on the

three paintings by vincent van gogh 
including his early masterpiece the potato eaters were stolen 
from a national museum on monday night police said 
the art theft appeared to be the biggest in dutch history 
the van goghs were taken from the kroellermueller national 
museum near the west german border by thieves who apparently gained 
entry through a broken window after closing hours said police 
spokeswoman bep lijftogt 
the two other paintings by the 19thcentury dutch impressionist 
were dried sunflowers and weavers interior she reported 
two guards were in the sprawling singlestory museum at the 
time but they noticed nothing amiss said police spokesman dirk 
talsma 
police immediately sealed off the 25acre park in which the 
museum sits a helicopter equipped with floodlights and police with 
dogs hunted for suspects on the heavily forested grounds 
they suspended the search at 1 am tuesday and planned to resume 
at daybreak 
no official valuation of the paintings was available from the 
museum but the director of christies auction gallery in amsterdam 
said that if sold on the open market not possible for a stolen 
work the potato eaters could bring as much as van goghs 
sunflowers 
that painting brought 399 million when auctioned off in london 
in march 1987 
the skys the limit christies director harts nijstad told 
the associated press in a telephone interview the potato eaters 
is an enormously important painting 
the potato eaters in the kroellermueller museum was the most 
complete of several versions of the same subject according to 
nijstad who said a less important version sits in the van gogh 
national museum in amsterdam 
no estimate on the value of the other two paintings was 
immediately available but nijstad said all three were frightfully 
important 
he speculated that the paintings were stolen for ransom adding 
whether the ransom will be moneywise or political is something 
the future will tell us 
the museums silent alarm triggered a warning in the local police 
station at about 845 pm 245 pm est and police rushed to the 
museum 
completed in 1885 the potato eaters is one of van goghs 
most poignant depictions of poverty and hunger in the netherlands 
it shows a farm family seated around a table eating potatoes by 
lamplight the hunger evident on their angular faces 
five van gogh works were included in a list published two weeks 
ago of the top 10 prices paid for paintings at the worlds two major 
auction houses christies and sothebys van goghs irises was 
sold last month for 539 million the highest price paid for any 
painting in the world 
the kroellermueller has dozens of van goghs exhibited in a 
special wing the museum and surrounding estate were bequeathed to 
the nation in 1938 by art collector mrs helg kroellermueller 
the theft was the latest in a series of recent burglaries at 
dutch museums 
in may thieves broke a window and stole impressionist paintings 
by van gogh french painter paul cezanne and dutch painter johan 
jongkind from amsterdams municipal museum 
those paintings were initially valued at up to 50 million but 
art authorities later scaled down the estimated value 
the paintings were later recovered in a raid on an amsterdam 
hotel spearheaded by an undercover policeman posing as a buyer of 
stolen art 
that theft mounted through a broken groundfloor window at a 
time when no guards were in the amsterdam museum prompted calls for 
stronger security in the nations museums 
the kroellermueller museum never before had a major theft 
police spokesman talsma said 
the potato eaters was painted when van gogh was living in a 
village in southern holland 
it is considered his most ambitious work from his dutch period 
before he moved to france in 1886 and came under the influence of 
impressionism the painting is done in dark colors in a rough style 
which van gogh said in a letter to his brother was meant to 
illustrate the rough life that the peasants lived 
van goghs artistic career lasted only 10 years but during that 
time he produced about 850 paintings about 50 of the paintings are 
still in private hands according to james roundell who supervised 
the sunflowers sale 
a highly placed source at the van gogh museum said on condition 
of anonymity last month that one great fear his museum had was that 
the record prices being paid for works by van gogh would bring ideas 
of theft into peoples heads 
van gogh sold only one painting during his lifetime

prime minister brian mulroneys government 
announced its intention monday to make sure canada can start the 
free trade agreement with the united states as scheduled jan 1 
but his opponents said too many issues remain to be discussed for 
the legislation to be rushed through parliament called back into 
session for work on the trade bill 
the prime ministers progressive conservative party won 169 of 
the 295 seats in the house of commons in the hotly contested nov 21 
elections so it could force quick passage of the legislation 
the measure will phase out all remaining tariffs between the 
united states and canada over a 10year period 
the people have spoken in a general election three weeks ago 
gov gen jeanne sauve said in the formal throne speech 
traditionally opening a new parliamentary session in ottawa in 
the election my government sought and received a mandate for its 
policies including the free trade agreement between canada and the 
united states that is to take effect on jan 1 1989 
the opposition liberal party which won 82 seats in commons and 
the socialist new democratic party with 43 seats have said they will 
not stand in the way of ultimate passage but want extensive debate 
on the problems they believe the trade agreement will bring 
the bitter debate over free trade that marked the fall election 
campaign would be renewed in parliament 
one seat won by a conservative who died after the election is 
vacant 
liberal leader john turner who led a selfproclaimed crusade 
against the trade agreement said in an interview with the canadian 
broadcasting corp that he was not stalling the legislation 
to insist on a thorough debate thats not stalling he 
said noting that the popular vote showed more canadians in favor of 
the two parties opposing the agreement than for the conservatives 
new democratic leader ed broadbent said he wanted amendments to 
be introduced to protect workers whose jobs are lost in company 
restructurings tied to the trade agreement 
he told the cbc that mulroney won a mandate for the trade 
agreement but he received no mandate to ramrod it right through 
parliament 
a delay of days weeks or probably even months in completing the 
enabling legislation needed would not hinder the agreement 
the united states has completed all its legislation for the 
agreement signed by mulroney and president reagan last jan 2 
in canada it passed the elected house of commons last august but 
then was bottled up in the liberalcontrolled appointed senate to 
force the election the legislation approved last august has expired 
and the process now must be repeated in commons

the government and a communistled mine 
workers federation signed an accord late monday to end an 
8weekold strike that has cost peru nearly 300 million prime 
minister armando villanueva said 
strike leader saul cantoral said miners will resume work 
nationwide in three days bringing an end to a paralysis in perus 
most important industry 
villanueva told reporters the strike cost the nation nearly 300 
million onefourth of last years mineral export income of 12 
billion last year 
peru is a leading world producer of silver and copper and a major 
source of gold lead and zinc it traditionally received more than 
half of its hard currency earnings from mineral exports 
perus 60000 miners struck on oct 17 to force mine companies to 
honor a governmentunion pact permitting labor contracts in the 
mining industry to be negotiated jointly with all mining enterprises 
rather than on a companybycompany basis 
the strike came as peru entered a severe recession marked by 
inflation expected to surpass 1500 percent this year and a shortage 
of dollar reserves to purchase vital imports 
industry officials said strikers were being manipulated by 
communist guerrillas seeking to undermine the nation the miners 
federation denied it 
terms of the new accord signed by cantoral and other leaders of 
the national federation of mine and metalworkers and by villanueva 
were not immediately announced 
federation director guillermo diaz said earlier monday that the 
federation was demanding that the government promise to enact a law 
to force public and private mining firms to abide by the 
governmentunion pact 
such an agreement will greatly strengthen the miners bargaining 
position during contracts industry analysts said 
the national mining society perus most important association of 
private mine owners has strongly opposed joint contract 
negotiations it says the federation will use its bargaining power 
to cripple the industry at will 
government and industry officials said more than half the 
strikers began returning to work last week the federation which 
represents dozens of mine unions denied the report 
thousands of highland miners many with families marched on lima 
after the strike began and set up camps around the city to publicize 
their plight miners engaged in street protests which at times ended 
in violence and arrests

earthquake relief efforts in armenia are 
hampered by bad organization premier nikolai i ryzhkov said 
monday hope dwindled for people trapped in the rubble and the 
smell of decaying corpses filled the air 
other officials said rescuers working around the clock with 
everything from their bare hands to fiber optic cameras have pulled 
more than 18000 people from earthquake wreckage 
the work is not going badly but we would wish it to be more 
organized ryzhkov told foreign journalists at a news conference 
in yerevan the capital of armenia 
he also said many people died unnecessarily in wednesdays 
earthquake because poorly built houses collapsed into ruins we 
believe gross violations were permitted in designing and building 
the apartment houses that collapsed 
if the homes had been of goodquality construction something 
like this would not have happened ryzhkov said 
he said this view was shared by a government investigative 
commission and by president mikhail s gorbachev who visited the 
disaster area over the weekend 
pravda the communist party newspaper published a scathing 
article monday about scrapbuilders who constructed shoddy 
apartment buildings that crumbled into concrete and metal graves 
over victims who were buried alive 
health minister yevgeny i chazov estimated the temblor killed up 
to 60000 people ryzkhov said it was certain that 15000 had died 
but the figure would problably rise to 45000 
five days after the tragedy struck shelter and salvage equipment 
remained in short supply 
reporting monday from leninaken near the quakes epicenter the 
official soviet news agency tass said people wander among the 
debris of what used to be their homes straining their ears in the 
hope of hearing the voice of a missing sister father brother or 
simply any human voice 
soviet television showed a worker in kirovakan where 60 percent 
of the houses were destroyed bending a metal reinforcing rod in a 
collapsed concrete wall by hand his face strained with the effort 
another man moved mounds of broken concrete with a shovel 
a man and boy huddled over a fire in a small bucket their only 
source of warmth during what the television announcer described as 
five nights on a pile of rubble because there were not enough tents 
snow and temperatures of 1423 degrees fahrenheit were forecast 
boris shcherbina a deputy prime minister who directed the 
cleanup after the april 1986 chernobyl nuclear plant accident told 
tass in leninakan 
we shall work without letup to save everyone still alive under 
the debris even on the 10th and the 12th day after the disaster we 
shall work for as long as there is a chance to save the life of at 
least one unhappy victim 
he said more than 5000 people had been rescued in leninakan 
tass said 18500 had been saved in the entire disaster area which 
had a population of 700000 
but ryzhkov said at the new conference that only 5398 had been 
saved throughout the region he said 10 people were pulled alive 
from the rubble on monday 
associated press correspondent carol j williams visited spitak 
a city of more than 25000 before the quake and said the smells of 
burning and decomposing bodies were everywhere 
a british charity called international rescue corps said its 
14member team in spitak was using ultrasonic listening equipment 
and fiber optic cameras to locate survivors trapped under collapsed 
buildings 
more than 200 search dogs were helping and infrared devices that 
can detect the warmth of bodies trapped under rubble 
many of the nearly 1000 foreign helpers have said local 
officials are not organizing the rescue well and interpreters to 
help translate the many languages are scarce 
the second crash of a relief plane in two days was reported 
all seven crewmembers died when a sovietbuilt yugoslav military 
transport loaded with medical equipment and other supplies went down 
10 miles from the airport in yerevan capital of the armenian 
republic boris panyukov first deputy aviation minister made the 
announcement in moscow 
local reporters said the an12 cargo plane crashed before dawn 
because the pilot mistook a welllighted highway for a runway 
on sunday a soviet military plane bringing soldiers to help the 
rescue effort crashed as it approached leninakans airport killing 
78 people 
aid continued pouring in from abroad council of ministers 
spokesman lev voznesensky told the moscow news conference 38 foreign 
relief planes had arrived and the most six were from france 
george reid of the genevabased league of red cross and red 
crescent societies said in yerevan there was little hope of finding 
more survivors 
he said the only people still alive would be those who found 
water and air where they were trapped reid quoted reports that only 
150 people survived in spitak other reports say 10 percent lived 
meanwhile armenian activists said demonstrators fought with 
soldiers because several nationalist leaders were arrested 
one activist who avoided arrest raphael popoyan said by 
telephone three protests took place sunday in yerevan because 
leaders of the karabakh committee were arrested the committee has

rescuers and officials trying to save 
survivors of the earthquake in soviet armenia said monday they 
desperately need a better command system more coordination and 
better equipment 
in addition no soviet troops were visible among the rescue 
workers in leninaken one of the hardesthit cities in wednesdays 
earthquake 
instead the rescue operations were being carried out mostly by 
friends and relatives of those still trapped they used small tools 
like hammers and torches 
soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov said enthusiam was plentiful 
but today the question is organization he spoke at a news 
conference late monday in yerevan the armenian capital 
sverre kilde a un disaster relief officer said the rescue 
effort appeared well organized on the national and regional level 
but locally in leninakan it was suffering from a lack of control 
here there are 5060 people shouting in all directions said 
un diaster relief officer sverre kilde speaking of a rescue site 
he visited in leninakan on sunday it would have been much more 
reasonable to have an army captain or colonel in charge of it 
defense minister dmitri t yazov told reporters that more than 
18000 soldiers were in the earthquake area but in leninakan none 
was seen helping with rescue operations 
asked about the situation yazov and ryzhkov said the soldiers 
were ensuring order in leninakan and helping unload relief supplies 
from cargo planes 
they also said troops were involved in rescue operations in 
spitak a city of more than 25000 people that was almost totally 
destroyed by the earthquake 
ryzhkov said soldiers had cut off both cities to all but relief 
traffic 
two relief planes have crashed in heavy air traffic in the 
region a crash of a soviet military plane on sunday killed 78 
people and one of a yugoslavian military aircraft left seven dead 
early monday 
the soviet premier gave high marks to the medical effort saying 
doctors had performed 2500 complicated operations in the field 
during the first 24 hours after the quake 
however area doctors said they badly need artificial kidney 
machines and bloodfiltering devices they hope to receive more of 
both from abroad 
veterans of rescue efforts for past earthquakes in mexico city 
and el salvador say it is difficult to supply the remote soviet area 
near the turkish border 
rescuers meanwhile pleaded for more cranes and bulldozers to 
pull away slabs of concrete and other debris in an effort to free 
those still trapped in the rubble

a washingtonbased forensics expert 
arrived monday to begin examining the bodies of six women found in 
southeastern massachusetts since july believed to be the victims of 
a serial killer 
douglas ubelaker of the smithsonian institution will seek more 
details on the cause of death of all six and will attempt to 
identify the three bodies that remain unidentified according to a 
spokesman for the investigation 
high on ubelakers agenda will be examining a sixth body found 
over the weekend by hunters in a wooded area of dartmouth off 
interstate 195 the body is one of three which has yet to be 
identified 
to make a positive identification we need to find something on 
the skeleton that is absolutely unique ubelaker said in an 
earlier interview 
state police dogs and a specially trained dog from connecticut 
returned to the woods outside of new bedford on monday and combed a 
6 to 8squaremile area where the bodies have been found 
pina said monday that he believes the sixth body was connected to 
the other five and was likely the victim of the same killer or 
killers 
there is no doubt in my mind that its all similar he said 
the sixth woman whose skeletal remains were badly decomposed was 
believed to have been dead for the longest period dating back to 
last spring

gold silver cannons and other wreckage from a 
pirate ship that has lain buried in sand off cape cod for 271 years 
belong to the salvage entrepreneur who found them the massachusetts 
supreme court ruled monday 
barry clifford will be entitled to keep the artifacts now worth 
an estimated 40 million and will not have give the state of 
massachusetts a 25 percent share according to cliffords attorney 
allan h tufankjian 
in a unanimous opinion the high court rejected the states claim 
of sovereignty over the wrecked sailing vessel whydah lying beneath 
the sand in the waters of wellfleet on cape cod where it foundered 
in april 1717 
its a great christmas present clifford said in a telephone 
interview from his home in chatham calling the whydah the only 
pirate ship in the world ever to be found and salvaged this is 
it theres really nothing else 
he said it was unfair of the state to claim onequarter of the 
find when all the risks associated with underwater salvage were 
taken by him and his company maritime underwater surveys inc 
in 1982 based on research from contemporary accounts clifford 
found an unidentified wrecked and abandoned vessel one mile off 
wellfleet under about 14 feet of water and 5 feet of sand 
since 1ereignty as surely as the whydah foundered on the shoals 
off wellfleet justice neil lynch wrote for the highllinois box

by the time marine lt col william r 
higgins left for college he was well on the way to fulfilling the 
ambition he expressed in his senior yearbook for my family to 
always be proud of me 
his uncle delbert eagle of lancaster said following higgins 
abduction feb 17 in lebanon that whatever happens higgins would 
continue to make his family and his country proud 
he loves his country eagle said at the time he is capable 
of standing up as well as an ordinary man will under the 
circumstances i dont think they could bring enough pressure or 
pain to cause him to betray his country in any way 
i think he would die first 
on monday lebanese kidnappers holding higgins 43 said in a 
statement they have sentenced him to death as a spy for israel 
we have issued the irrevocable sentence to execute this 
american spy said the typewritten arabic statement signed by the 
organization of the oppressed on earth 
but the statement did not set an execution date 
higgins sister mary fisher of louisville said she had no 
knowledge of the death threat other than what she has heard from 
news reports 
i have not been contacted by anyone she said 
higgins was a onetime aide to former defense secretary caspar 
weinberger when he was abducted he headed a 75member observer 
group assigned to a united nations peacekeeping force in south 
lebanon 
a pentagon official said at the time of the abduction that 
higgins was on temporary detail serving as the chief of the un 
truce supervision organizations lebanon observer group 
the group monitors ceasefire violations on the lebanonisrael 
border higgins was the topranking american officer assigned to the 
group holding the title of senior us military observer 
when higgins was growing up in southern jefferson county in the 
late 1950s and early 1960s his friends never expected the chunky 
cheerful youngster to make his career in the military 
he was just pretty much an average guy at southern high 
school rudy fischer an old friend recalled after higgins 
abduction 
i think people were kind of surprised when he went into the 
marines fischer added you think of the marines as being macho 
types and he really wasnt like that 
even so higgins won appointment to west point but chose instead 
to study at miami university of ohio on a navy rotc scholarship 
he opted for the marines rather than the navy after suffering 
seasickness during a summer cruise to scandinavia his 
brotherinlaw harold fischer recalled 
others who knew higgins in louisville remember him as a bright 
wellrounded young man who stood out in school and on the athletic 
field 
higgins whose friends knew him as rich or pinky earned 
mostly as and bs he played guard on his high school football team 
in 1962 and 1963 
he gave us 100 percent effort said henderson wilson then 
the teams line coach 
higgins was president of his sophomore class vice president of 
his senior class and won membership in the beta club and key club 
according to his senior yearbook 
his fellow seniors and teachers voted him one of the top 10 
members of the class of 1963 based on scholarship leadership 
school spirit and personality said assistant principal ralph allen 
he was commissioned as a second lieutenant when he graduated from 
miami university of ohio and later earned masters degrees in human 
resources management at pepperdine university and political science 
at auburn university 
higgins was born in danville and lived in lancaster covington 
and louisville he and his first wife the former bonita spalding of 
louisville have a 17yearold daughter christine lynn he has 
another sister linda lee miller of memphis tenn 
higgins second wife marine maj robin higgins works at the 
pentagon 
both of his parents have died his mother mary ethel higgins 
in 1979 and his father william f higgins shortly after his

black students especially in the south are far 
more likely than whites to be targets of corporal punishment or 
school suspension according to a study 
teachers often overreact to blacks especially black males 
interestingly thats true even with black teachers said joan 
mccarty first executive director of the bostonbased national 
coalition of advocates for students which sunday released an 
analysis of federal school data 
the report found black youngsters are more than twice as likely 
to be hit or be labeled mentally retarded as whites and while 
blacks make up 16 percent of the school population they comprise 
only 8 percent of those in gifted student programs the findings 
were based on an analysis of biennial data published by the us

panamanians are fleeing unemployment 
is rising the panama canal is suffering the american military is 
steaming and bank profits are falling 
about the only firm thing in panama is gen manuel antonio 
noriegas grip on it 
the country is going down the drain fast said ricardo arias 
calderon leader of the opposition christian democratic party 
he and ruben carles of the opposition newspaper la prensa said up 
to 40000 panamanians have left in 18 months unemployment is up 
from 11 percent in 1987 to 23 percent the treasury is in a bind and 
public employees went on strike demanding to be paid on time 
the us administrator for the panama canal says his job may not 
be turned over to a panamanian next year as required by the canal 
treaty and that washingtons antinoriega sanctions indirectly 
hinder operations at the canal which is to be turned over to panama 
at midnight dec 31 1999 
in recent months noriega has imprisoned critics changed 
election laws to make it easier for himself to run for president in 
may 1989 and closed four opposition newspapers including la prensa 
the opposition is reduced to receiving news by facsimile machines 
from the united states fax and photocopies the no 1 means of 
communication carles said in an interview 
panamas trip down the chute began in june 1987 with allegations 
that noriega rigged the 1984 elections laundered money and 
trafficked in drugs and arms 
relations with the united states traditionally close because of 
the canal took a nosedive last february when president eric arturo 
delvalle tried to fire noriega as head of the 15000member panama 
defense forces noriega had the legislature dismiss delvalle instead 
washingto refused to recognize the new president manuel solis 
palma and imposed economic sanctions in an effort to force noriega 
out 
six opposition parties recently signed a petition calling for 
noriegas ouster and formation of a transition government for 
panamas 22 million people 
they have not yet decided whether to enter candidates in next 
years presidential election nor has the general said whether he 
will run 
the people are scared to death carles said how can we 
have elections if everything is under noriegas control 
repeated calls were made to noriegas spokesman maj edgardo 
lopez and to leading members of the militarybacked democratic 
revolutionary party but were not returned 
banks closed for nine weeks last march and figures issued by the 
government indicated deposits at the more than 100 institutions 
operating in panama dropped from nearly 30 billion to just under 8 
billion 
us sanctions put panama in the same economic boat with cuba and 
nicaragua the other latin american countries on which washington 
imposed boycotts and compounded problems that began with the 
political strife 
this is one of the things that has really hurt the external 
image said edgardo lasso president of the panamanian banking 
association because the others are communist countries 
the government limited bank withdrawals putting a 100 ceiling 
on what could be withdrawn from savings accounts many panamanians 
stopped banking and sold certificates of deposit for less than 
market value 
noriega has taken up the timetested cry of cuba and nicaragua 
about a threat of imminent us invasion except that in panamas 
case about 10000 american soldiers already are in the country 
panama is headquarters for the us southern command and the 
soldiers nominally stationed here for the purpose of defending the 
canal use the strategic location for intelligence gathering and spy 
flights over central america 
officers of the southern command claim panamanian troops trespass 
nightly on us military facilities and have reported exchanges of 
fire in two dozen cases a us marine was shot to death by a 
comrade in april 
the goal is to embarrass the united states and raise the level 
of a sense of vulnerability a us official said 
the 1977 panama canal treaties specify that the troops must leave 
when the 50milelong waterway is turned over to panama but an 
accompanying pact requires the united states to assure 
indefinitely a regime providing for the permanent neutrality of 
the canal 
dennis mcauliffe administrator of the panama canal commission 
said the provision calling for a panamanian to take over his job at 
the end of 1989 is up in the air because the us president must 
approve the choice and anyone who bears the noriega imprint will 
never be acceptable 
mcauliffe said canal operations suffer somewhat because under 
the economic embargo the canal commission cannot pay its panamanian 
employees withholding taxes and the government has begun harassing 
workers for the money 
the fact is they are so nervous right now its affecting morale 
and that affects the efficiency of our operation said mcauliffe 
a retired army general

each day children on their way home from 
school calmly walk past the headquarters of japans largest 
underworld syndicate behind plastered beige walls in a classy 
residential district overlooking the sea 
across town a redtiled building controlled by the gang is 
within 100 yards of the kobe district courthouse it bears the 
golden diamondshaped logo of the gang which leaders wear on their 
lapels and which is printed on members business cards 
over the past few years the yamaguchigumi syndicate has waged a 
successful war of revenge against a major rival doubled its 
membership and raked in millions of dollars annually said takashi 
ishii assistant director of the national police agencys organized 
crime control office 
but all is not well within the criminal empire 
the years business for the 20000member syndicate traditionally 
starts dec 13 when ranking bosses gather at headquarters in this 
western port city for a formal celebration called koto hajime 
the beginning of things 
but since gang leader masahisa takenaka was killed by a splinter 
groups gunman in 1985 custom has forced the yamaguchigumi to 
cancel the annual ceremony because it has no top don 
takenaka was replaced by two men acting gang leader kazuo 
nakanishi and young leader yoshinori watanabe who led the gang 
into a war to avenge takenakas killing police say 
though that vendetta which has left 25 dead and 70 injured by 
police count now seems to be nearing an end police say the long 
time without a leader has led to factionalism in the gang weakening 
its pyramidstyle command structure 
public reaction to the highprofile violence has also plagued the 
gang japan has low rates of violent crime and very strict 
guncontrol laws but gunfights have brought attention to the gangs 
spawning grassroots movements to rid residential areas of gang 
headquarters and offices 
a yamaguchigumi subgang in the central japanese city of 
hamamatsu was in the media spotlight until public opposition forced 
it to relocate last year the gang is now on the verge of collapse 
according to ishii of the crime control office 
but masafumi ueda director of the office said in an interview 
that the public outcry and tough police crackdowns also may have 
worked to the syndicates benefit putting many smaller gangs out of 
business or forcing them to seek yamaguchigumi protection 
a recent issue of endless advance an inhouse journal 
published by the kyokuto shinseikai a large tokyo syndicate 
attested to the trend toward consolidation 
in the 120page edition obtained by the associated press were 
photos of top underworld figures gathered for dinner at a posh tokyo 
hotel to pursue friendly relations and cooperation and avoid 
intergang trouble 
technically the yamaguchigumi has only 86 members but each of 
the top 86 controls a network of subordinate gangs which in turn 
have their own kasa japanese for umbrella 
top bosses rarely face prosecution for serious crimes as 
underlings take responsibility sometimes even turning themselves 
in since doing prison time can bring a promotion 
according to an annual report by the national police agency more 
than 86000 gangsters in 3201 gangs are spread across the country 
roughly 40 percent belong to the big three nationwide syndicates 
the yamaguchigumi the tokyobased sumiyoshi rengokai and the 
inagawakai also based in tokyo 
ueda of the national police agency estimated total underworld

in the spectacularly beautiful vosges 
mountains of eastern france half a dozen czechoslovak lynxes 
roaming the forest are the seed of a new population struggling for 
survival against nature and man 
for most of the people in this region of low mountains west of 
the rhine river reintroduction of the european lynx into an area 
from which it disappeared in the 19th century is a wonderful thing 
but you only need two or three people against it if those 
two or three have rifles said patrick barbier secretarygeneral 
of the regional association for the protection of nature 
perhaps only 3000 to 3500 european lynxes are left on the 
continent and nearly all of them are in eastern europe says 
veronique herrenschmidt head of frances lynx reintroduction 
program 
of the 12 lynxes released in the vosges in the past five years 
only six are alive and perhaps not that many its difficult to 
know now because the transmitter collars have ceased to function 
some lynxes have been shot either for sport or out of anger one 
was a female whose two young then died others have just disappeared 
early next year one last effort will be made its the final 
cast of the dice for miss herrenschmidt the french ministry of 
environment the national office for hunting and wild fauna and the 
world wildlife fund all participating in the program 
six more lynxes have been reserved in czechoslovakia and are 
being held there until the end of the french hunting season in 
january they then will be brought here acclimated and freed 
we havent won yet said barbier this is double or 
nothing we are going to put six more in and if that doesnt work 
well have to rethink the whole program 
success according to miss herrenschmidt a 32yearold 
agricultural engineer with a doctorate in ecology will be when 
there is reproduction in the vosges and those lynxes themselves 
become adult maybe in two or three years 
opposition comes essentially from some hunters and farmers 
hunters claim lynxes reduce the game population particularly the 
beautiful and tasty vosges roe deer and farmers worry about their 
sheep 
this region is mostly mountainous forest or vineyards with few 
sheep so farmers are less of a problem even so the world wildlife 
fund reimburses farmers for the loss of domestic animals proven to 
have been killed by lynxes a protected species usually there is 
no mystery a lynxs kill is a signature 
its always the same said miss herrenschmidt he kills by 
strangling biting his prey in the throat 
in france where virtually every square foot of huntable land is 
parceled out and leased often at incredibly high prices hunters 
have a very proprietary view of wild game any reduction of roe 
deer for example means fewer for the hunters to shoot 
nonetheless the majority of hunters support the program 
we accepted the reintroduction of the lynx on condition that if 
it becomes prolific it will be opened for hunting said gilbert de 
turckheim president of the hunting federation of the lower rhine 
here the price of hunting leases is very expensive he said 
hunters have the right to question anything that affects the level 
of game population 
ecologists like miss herrenschmidt would argue that the lynxes 
provide a service by culling out the weak unfit animals which in 
the long run leads to a better healthier deer 
like their predecessors the new lynxes will be taken to a site 
high in the vosges kept in large cages in the forest and fed wild 
rabbits after a month or two the cages will be opened 
the scientific aspect of the lynx program is to study the role of 
superpredators in the ecosystem of the area 
this was seen as an experiment with the idea of introducing the 
lynx into other zones in france miss herrenschmidt said adding 
that the vosges are ideal because each lynx needs about 75000 to 
125000 acres though zones may overlap 
they have all they need to feed and reproduce she added 
the only problem is they must be respected and that means by man 
the lynx must become a species like any other like a deer or a 
wild boar the lynx must become integrated in the french forest

alseeb oman ap hut hut the young jockeys screeched 
whipping their camels with bamboo sticks as omans national day 
races started with a dozen ships of the desert thundering off at 
a longlegged lope 
trainers and relatives of the diminutive jockeys 5 to 14 years 
old roar down the side of the track in fourwheeldrive pickup 
trucks and toyotas screaming instructions yelling their riders on 
in a cacophony of noise 
halfway down the twomile arrowstraight track 25 miles west of 
the capital muscat senior government officials and sheiks dressed 
in pristine white robes lounge in an opensided tent sipping 
cardomanscented arabic coffee and iced soft drinks served on silver 
platters as the camels gallop past 
there is no betting its forbidden in islamic oman but there is 
prestige for the owners of winning camels specially bred as racing 
steeds 
camel racing once little more than a desert pastime has become 
a big sport in oman and the other arab states on the persian gulf 
patronized by the regions billionaire princes and sheiks racing 
camels sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars 
an omani breeder saeed malki earlier this year sold a 
throughbred female racer to a sheik in the neighboring united arab 
emirates for a record 155000 
wealthy arabs are spending millions of dollars in breeding racing 
camels and in prize money during the novemberapril season when the 
searing desert temperatures cool to a tolerable 95 degrees 
prizes can be as high as 250000 in some of the bigger meets 
particularly in the united arab emirates in one race in saudi 
arabia recently some 600 camels took part 
the sport has given camels a new lease of life with the 
helterskelter modernization brought by the persian gulfs oil 
riches camels have largely become obselete as beasts of burden or 
transportation in a region where just about everyone drives a car or 
pickup 
once camels were also the bedouin nomads source of milk hides 
and often food but even this has disappeared as many desert 
dwellers moved to the towns some sheiks provide subsidies for camel 
breeders 
omans national day races dont come near matching the kentucky 
derby 
the camels and their trainers handlers and jockeys who are 
dressed in ragged robes or colored track suits squat in the sand at 
one end of the track waiting their turn to race hurling 
goodnatured insults at each other 
a whiterobed steward named ahmad curved omani dagger in his 
ornate silver belt tried to maintain order while keeping in touch 
with the finish line through a squalking walkietalkie 
the runners are selected the handlers strap in the boy jockeys 
behind the camels humps with cloth straps and velcro pads so they 
wont be hurled off 
the starters gun cracks and a dozen camels stampede from the 
starting line 
the handlers have to be agile to get out the way of the forest of 
hooves one middleaged man was a little too slow and was trampled 
stunned and shaken but apparently with no broken bones he was 
carried to an ambulance 
sometimes the jockeys do fall off but they hit the ground with 
a roll that a paratrooper would be proud of there are bumps and 
bruises but no serious injuries

when marlo thomas accompanied her husband phil 
donahue to moscow last year she had more in mind than sightseeing 
in red square 
the trip gave her the idea for what will be the first 
sovietamerican coproduction of an entertainment show her special 
free to be a family airing wednesday on abc 
its an entertainment exchange between kids and superstar 
performers from this country and the soviet union thomas said 
we present our favorite performers and they present theirs its a 
fun show of comedy and song but the show also challenges 
destructive stereotypes about families 
our goal is to show children that every family no matter whos 
in it or where they live is a real family as long as its members 
nurture and love each other 
we also talk about the global family its no longer we and 
they we have to start thinking of us steve martin talks about 
feeding the entire world with one turkey and how big it was would 
have to be carly simon sings the song that became our theme turn 
of the tide it says we are the turn of the tide and we have to 
speak up 
the onehour special is a sequel to free to be you and 
me which won peabody and emmy awards in 1974 
thomas made arrangements for the special while her husband was 
taping a weeks worth of his syndicated talk show donahue in the 
soviet union 
free to be a family was put together later by means of a 
satellite hookup between the hard rock cafe in new york and 
gosteleradio studios in moscow 
thomas is host of the special in new york and tatiana vedeneyeva 
is host in moscow among the american performers are rock group bon 
jovi actress whoopi goldberg comic magicians penn and teller 
singersongwriter carly simon comedians lily tomlin and robin

each other by exchanging letters and photos 
a free to be a family book was published in 1987 and 
half a million copies have been sold an album featuring many of the 
stars on the special was issued last month 
soviet rock star vladimir prezhnikof is on the show i was 
surprised to learn the russians dance to the same dance steps we do 
and know more about us than we know about them they know all of our 
rock stars and see our movies 
thomas said the first project free to be you and me was 
an attempt to rewrite childrens literature to eliminate sexual and 
ethnic stereotypes 
there were too many stories about prince charming coming along 
and carrying the girl off she said i wanted to liberate the 
definition of boy and girl the way we had liberated the definition 
of men and women the new book liberates the definition of the 
family and expands its meaning

the rage of hong kong these days is easy to 
spot just look for the tiny antennas the telltale sign of the 
portable telephones so many people are carrying wherever they go 
despite price tags of 2000 or more the handheld telephones 
have become a huge hit in this british colony where doing business 
is a 24hour preoccupation and new status symbols are always in 
demand 
downtown streets are filled with professionals ready for business 
with the cellular phones tucked under their arms or stuffed 
antennaup into briefcases 
away from the financial district people can be seen barking into 
the phones while eating in restaurants riding public buses and 
ferries or sitting in darkened movie theaters everyone from 
executives to proprietors of produce stalls can be seen chatting 
away 
the hong kong standard newspaper spotted a telephone in a recent 
100kilometer 62mile charity walk along a rural trail 
in driving rain and a lashing wind a young man was spotted 
eagerly and conspicuously talking into his mobile telephone it 
said 
in a more normal society one would expect him to hand the 
phone over to one of his seconds before starting the race but a 
few kilometers down the track the young man was spotted merrily 
informing the financial markets at large of his continued 
existence 
the government estimates about 60000 portable cellular 
telephones roughly six times earlier projections will be in use 
by the end of the year in this territory of 57 million people said 
deputy postmaster general henry wise whose department is in charge 
of telecommunications 
while most cellular telephones sold in other countries are for 
use in cars roughly threefourths of the units sold in hong kong 
since the market opened three years ago have been the more expensive 
handheld models 
we were amazed when the whole thing really took off in a great 
way wise said 
hutchison telephone co which has sold about 26000 cellular 
telephones recently stopped sales for six weeks because demand was 
outpacing the companys capacity to handle all the calls 
the market just caught everybody by surprise said peter 
grant president of china telephone co ltd a rival firm were 
all frantically rebuilding networks 
harry hui a psychology lecturer at the university of hong kong 
attributed the popularity of the telephones here in part to the 
importance of face its a status symbol 
wise believes the hong kong work ethic of doing business whenever 
and wherever possible is largely responsible for the tremendous 
sales 
virtually the whole day is part of the working day he said 
although industry officials see no end in sight to demand for the 
telephones their indiscriminate use in public places already is 
viewed as an irritation by some 
people are becoming aware of the annoyance factor 
acknowledged grant 
several exclusive clubs demand that their patrons and guests 
check their telephones at the door

thus far however the government has refused to commit its own 
resources forcing rheault to raise 40000 to 50000 a year from 
veterans organizations foundations corporations and individual 
donors 
he has appeared before congress and regularly speaks at ptsd 
conferences hopeful that the va will eventually embrace the program 
as an effective means of helping the wars psychological casualties 
most of whom are now in their early 40s 
theyre on a knife edge rheault says if they fall off on 
one side theyll be ok if they fall off on the other side theyll 
be alcoholics bums suicides jailbirds or longterm mental 
patients at a tremendous cost to society 
the outward bound course is demanding he says but those who 
complete it are more likely to progress than those who remain 
institutionalized throughout their treatment 
while there is no scientific data on the effectiveness of the 
program the director of psychiatry at the va medical center in 
northampton says participation in outward bound has been shown to 
make patients more amenable to other aspects of the treatment 
process 
ptsd patients are distrustful aloof and unable to interact with 
others dr william boutelle explains citing a symptom known as 
emotional numbing 
its as if there is novocain in their emotions he says 
the courses boutelle says recreate the camaraderie and mutual 
dependence shared by soldiers during combat encouraging the 
veterans to open up to each other as they sit around a campfire and 
share their successes and failures during the climb 
rheault blames institutionalized bureaucracy within the va for 
the slow pace at which the program is being accepted 
if during all of this time i had merely been butting my head 
against the brick wall of the va i would have given up long ago 
he says but while we were waiting for the glacier to move we 
have helped vets 
at va headquarters in washington a spokeswoman said a study is 
under way among patients at the tacoma and augusta centers to gauge 
the effectiveness of patient participation in outward bound 
the veterans who are involved in the program have very positive 
feelings about it but no one has done a study to determine the 
therapeutic effect of it and that is what they are doing right 
now said the spokeswoman donna st john 
positive changes in americas attitude toward vietnam veterans 
many of whom were greeted with hostility or indifference when they 
first returned home have created a climate of greater acceptance 
and a willingness to deal with such lingering problems as 
posttraumatic stress according to rheault 
the vietnam war memorial in washington he said was part of a 
symbolic change in which the people were able to separate the war 
from the warrior 
on balance it is a more accepting society and the vietnam 
vets now dare say they were there and thats ok he says 
rheaults belief in the war waned as the us military buildup 
peaked during the late 1960s pushing counterinsurgency efforts to 
the background and deemphasizing the social economic political 
and psychological aspects of the struggle 
the turning point came when american troops shifted from an 
advisory role and became the chief defenders of the saigon regime 
he says 
interestingly in 196465 nobody called vietnamese gooks but 
by 1968 everybody did he says 
to rheault the rigorous climb up the mountain while shouldering 
heavy packs typifies the trail the veterans must take if they are to 
overcome their deepseated problems 
the climb is deliberately evocative of the vietnam experience 
placing squadsize groups of veterans in an unfamiliar wilderness 
environment where they help and encourage each other to reach the 
top 
i maintain that the war was evil stupid and immoral but their 
experience as human beings experiences of courage selfsacrifice 
and brotherhood that was all valid stuff rheault says 
the mountain is a great metaphor you climb it a step at a 
time you cant see the mountain you can only see a few feet of the 
trail 
if you could see the whole mountain it would be too 
intimidating to climb but since you can only see a little bit of 
it you take a few steps and eventually youre up there

editors note as late as the 1930s about two in five 
jordanians were nomadic bedouins today the government estimates the 
number at less than one in 20 while many bedouins still refuse to 
abandon their culture the lure of modern conveniences and 
government services is putting the brakes on a society that has been 
on the move for thousands of years

a way of life 6000 years old is fading 
away in the arabian desert as nomadic bedouin tribesmen settle down 
todays ships of the desert are trucks not camels 
it is dying and its a shame says sheik mohammed trad 
alshaalan leaning against a pillow in a woven tent open to a 
sprawling vista of the barren jordanian desert 
shaalan is a leader of the rwallah tribe which has roamed for 
hundreds of years across land now divided by the borders of syria 
iraq jordan and saudi arabia 
of some 200000 rwallah clansmen i would say less than 5 
percent are still moving even less than that the sheik says 
shaalan says perhaps a third of them are partly nomadic the 
women or children living in town while the husband lives in a tent 
and follows the herds of goats and sheep 
as shaalan speaks about 100 camels slowly glide by in the 
distance led by a rwallah tribesman shalaans own fourwheel drive 
vehicle with custom wheel rims is parked beside the tent not far 
from the perch of two tethered hunting falcons 
the camel has become more a status symbol than a necessity today 
trucks kick up plumes of dust over the hardfloored jordanian desert 
miles from any roads they carry water livestock and tents from one 
site to another making it easier for bedouins to reach their herds 
from fixed campsites or villages many of which have sprung up 
around wells and schools provided by governments throughout the 
region 
greater mobility and government services have encouraged the 
bedouins to settle as have a long drought and the problems of 
crossing borders 
as people are able to travel farther they dont have to move 
as much in terms of their residences says don henry a university 
of tulsa paleontologist who has lived among modernday bedouins in 
jordan while studying their ancestors 
women always like to get away from the hardship of living in a 
tent and moving every day or every week and having to collect 
branches for cooking fires shaalan says they prefer to be 
living in a house with electricity and gas ovens and to have bread 
coming from the bakery 
um khader a bedouin woman in the hills south of amman agrees 
oh lord how i love the cement house she says im rid of the 
dust 
about two in five jordanians were nomadic bedouins in the 1920s 
and 1930s today the government estimates that less than one in 20 
still follows the old way of life 
i think what youre seeing is the last of the mohicans says 
kamel abu jaber a university of jordan political scientist who led 
a survey of bedouins in the late 1970s 
it never crossed my mind to leave the tent and live in a 
house says sheik ahmad hamadi alguesam i like the freedom i 
like the peace i want to die in this black tent 
but like many bedouins alguesam says he keeps his children in a 
nearby town where they can go to school two have already graduated 
and joined the army a favored occupation for a martial people who 
once treated raiding as a sort of sport 
inside his black goathair tent the sheik offers visitors the 
cardamonspiced bedouin coffee and repeated cups of sugary tea from 
pots kept steaming on the fragrant bed of coals before him 
a pet cat stalks out from behind a bamboo screen that sets off 
the womens quarters within the sound of small children giggling 
and chatting drifts through the reeds 
shaalan in addition to his tent has a house in remote alfeida 
and sends his children to school in amman where he says they are 
closer to health care and other services 
shaalan himself studied management at biscayne college in miami 
a catholic school since renamed st thomas university 
henry says nomadic herders broke away into the desert from small 
farming settlements in jordan some 6000 years ago although it is 
unclear if those ancient people were the same as todays bedouins 
even so he says its just uncanny the number of parallels you 
see between 6000yearold camps and the ones you see occupied 
today 
camels arrived perhaps 2000 to 1500 bc making it possible 
for the nomads to range farther into the arid expanses of arabia 
scholars say the bedouins have developed a complex and 
sophisticated culture while living beyond the reach of governments 
their complicated system of unwritten laws based on intensely felt 
honor and hospitality operates even today alongside formal laws 
crimes such as murder or rape once could lead to bloodshed and 
still often today require restitution to the victim an element 
often missing in western law 
shaalan says the offenders also might be banished from the tribe 
a stiff penalty in a society where identity is based on the clan 
for lesser crimes a man would be disgraced not be presented 
with a cup of coffee in a group like thishis sister would not be 
married to a dignified person shaalan says 
but the sheik says the old ways are eroding as bedouins settle 
living in a city has made people lose a great deal of their 
dignity generosity truth in dealingsthey have acquired the bad 
habits of the city shaalan complains 
in the city people are becoming very busy so generosity is 
lostyou cant just come to a tent and enter and whoever is there 
serves you food and coffee 
shaalan compares bedouin virtues to those of rural americans 
i really felt as if i was in a bedouin society when i was in 
oregon in the country when i was in tennessee close to the smokey 
mountains he says when i went to the big cities i felt like i 
was in a jungle 
bedouin values even weakened continue to permeate arab society 
hospitality is prized families are tight and behavior is bound by 
codes of honor consensus is preferred to majority rule 
im fairly convinced that being bedouin is not a way of life at 
all its a political ideology says william lancaster a british 
anthropologist who spent several years living with the rwallah

editors note he worked his way through college as a midget in 
sideshows at fairs and expositions he became a living trademark for 
a national brand of wieners but the highpoint of meinhardt raabes 
career came when he landed the role of a munchkin in the wizard of 
oz 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
there are no yellow brick roads or 
wicked witches in this north florida retirement community but there 
is a fugitive from the land of oz 
hes a munchkin name of meinhardt raabe 
although its been half a century raabe can still repeat the 
lines he sang as the munchkin coroner in the wizard of oz the 
1939 movie classic starring judy garland 
when the tornado dropped the house on the wicked witch it was 
raabe carrying a large death certificate who sang shes not 
only merely dead shes most sincerely dead 
the coroner had one of the nine speaking roles for the 116 little 
people who played munchkins in the movie based on l frank baums 
books 
at the time the movie was filmed raabe was promoting oscar mayer 
wieners as little oscar the worlds smallest chef 
he took a twomonth leave of absence and headed for hollywood 
where he was given the role in the wizard of oz 
raabe was 22 years old and only 46 inches tall he had worked his 
way through college in midget shows at fairs hes since grown to 
4foot7 
when the film was made raabe says he had no idea it would become 
a classic he was only familiar with the scenes in which he played 
we didnt know what came before or what came after he says 
we had no idea what the picture was all about until we saw it 
released 
at the time of its release it was overshadowed by gone with 
the wind 
gone with the wind won four academy awards including best 
picture that year 
it was only after cbs got the film in 1956 and used it for 
their promotions that it became as well known he says 
now retired and living in this community established by jc 
penney raabe 73 believes the movie has become an enduring classic 
because people saw it as children and still remember it 
thats one factor but the second basic factor is there is 
nothing in the picture that dates it he says there are no old 
vintage cars or old vintage streetcars and its a fantasy picture 
that will be fantasy for generations to come 
i have so many middleaged people come up to me and say i 
just bought the video of the wizard of oz for my grandchildren 
but after talking to them you realize that it was they themselves 
who were most interested because it was nostalgia for them 
although raabe leads an active life as the horticulturist at 
penney farms he and his wife marie often travel to oz reunions 
including a recent one in chesterton ind 
one of the reasons why the munchkins are getting attention is 
that all the major stars of the picture are gone so there are just 
a few of us munchkins left raabe says 
there are fewer than 30 former munchkins still living 
it was 50 years ago and i was one of the younger ones he 
says many of them were 30 and 40 years older than i was at time 
raabe says being involved in the movie was the experience of a 
lifetime 
for a young man of 22 from a farm in wisconsin to be in that 
atmosphere was naturally a big thrill raabe said he got to meet 
judy garland and many of the other top stars at mgm 
when the little people chosen to play munchkins were hired each 
was measured for a costume while the costumes were made the 
munchkins rehearsed their parts 
as we marched we had to be on a certain yellow brick on a 
certain note we were all wellrehearsed so when the costumes were 
finished we were ready to do the shooting he says 
work began at 6 am each day and continued until 8 pm each 
night 
raabe says he cant remember what he was paid for his role in the 
movie but remembers it was very low 
by todays standards people would say you were crazy to work 
for that he says 
raabe born in watertown wis in 1915 was a member of the 
midget city cast at the chicago worlds fair in 1934 he also 
performed at the san diego exposition in 1935 and the texas 
centennial and cleveland great lakes worlds fair in 1936 
by working at these worlds fairs as a midget i was able to 
work my way through the university raabe says he holds both a 
bachelors degree in accounting from the university of wisconsin and 
a masters degree in business administration from drexel university 
raabe says some short people resent the word midget but that 
was the description widely used when he was in show business 
my wife and i were both in show business were both midgets my 
wife worked from 1929 to 1932 as a member of roses royal midgets 
the largest midget troupe in vaudeville he says they have been 
married for 43 years 
when raabe graduated from college he was unable to get a job as 
an accountant because of his size 
but his size worked to his advantage when he was hired as 
little oscar the worlds smallest chef a job he held for 30 
years 
raabe who wore a chefs uniform traveled around the country 
doing cooking shows school shows lectures and handing out samples 
i was on the road all the time i never had an office job he 
says we were constantly on the road traveling 
when the wizard of oz was released in 1939 raabe performed a 
double duty 
i traveled with the picture for six months he says i was 
being paid by oscar mayer i was getting the little promotion bit 
ahead of the picture and we passed out wiener samples in the lobby 
at the end

editors note it stands as a symbol of the old south named for 
the goddess of agriculture but the historic ceres plantation east 
of vicksburg in its new incarnation is also becoming a symbol of 
the new south an industrial park and hightech center in a state 
struggling to polish its image 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the family of a prominent confederate 
minister fled to the old ceres plantation when union gunboats began 
the civil war siege of vicksburg bringing along what was reputed to 
be the biggest library in the south 
yankee soldiers who later sacked the mansion used those books to 
pave the muddy road to the big black river 
today yankees or anyone else with bucks to invest in hightech 
businesses are welcome at the former cotton plantation 
the old south is merging with the new south on the plantations 
1300 acres which have been acquired by the warren county port 
commission for development into an industrial park 
the twostory countrystyle antebellum home was named for the 
goddess of agriculture now it is being offered as a potential 
corporate headquarters in a state trying to diversify its economy 
ers to clear away the debris 
bodies were ripped apart and the trains were tangled 
together said firefighter chris fitzgerald we had to use our 
heaviest cutting gear and it was like nibbling away at the wreckage 
just a little at a time 
among the first rescuers were boys from nearby emanuel college 
we just heard a crunch just like metal going together said 
henry livesey 12 a student at the private school i saw a man 
with metal stuck in his head he was obviously dead 
chris reeves 38 of southampton was in the buffet car when the 
crash happened there was furniture and enormous lumps of metal 
flying everywhere he said as he waited for treatment at st 
georges hospital all i can remember is dust and debris as youve 
never experienced it in your life 
the whole of the buffet car disintegrated reeves said the 
roof split open like a ripe tomato and thats how we got out we 
tried to find people underneath the rubble but there was so much 
debris there was nothing we could do 
ian underhill 41 of farnborough said there was a hell of a 
bang as his train approached clapham 
the train seemed to shoot backwards and the guy opposite me 
flew into my face said underhill who also was taken to st 
georges amazingly enough there was not a lot of panic it was 
fairly calm and people were helping one another to get out i saw 
one man helped out who had lost his foot and there were many others 
with terrible injuries 
mike clarke 41 of northbourne said the restaurant car just 
disintegrated 
the roof just split open and the bogey the wheels came up 
through the floor he said 
keith larner 36 from southampton said there were people 
underneath me and under the metal and there were people with metal 
in their bodies 
a woman was trapped with metal which was in her chest and we 
just started to get people out immediately it was the most horrible 
sight i have ever seen

editors note its a place for aspiring women writers like the 
pennsylvania mother of seven who wrote that there hasnt been much 
opportunity for quiet in my life and if they get an invitation to 
the writers colony at hedgebrook farm on puget sound it wont cost 
them a cent its all a gift from a woman who believes that people 
of her gender deserve to be heard 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a quaint farm on an island in puget sound 
has been converted into a retreat for women who want to write and 
think and dream in solitude beyond the press of family and jobs 
the writers colony at hedgebrook farm which began receiving its 
first authorsinresidence in august is the creation of nancy 
skinner nordhoff the 56yearold daughter of a shipping executive 
who has long been active in community affairs in the seattle area 
women need the chance to explore their craft without having to 
wait until the kids are in college says nordhoff a 1954 graduate 
of mount holyoke college in south hadley mass women have 
something important to say they need to be heard 
women writers selected by a screening committee can spend two 
weeks to two months at hedgebrook farm free of charge nordhoff 
bought the farm with her own money she declines to say how much 
and foots all the bills 
why 
its a gift to myself and to the writers she says its 
because i know from my own life the pain of not being affirmed you 
know i have the ability i have the interest to be able to say 
women deserve to be heard and to be able to do something about it 
the 30acre farm 30 miles north of seattle on whidbey island 
has a remodeled yellow stucco farmhouse and two timberframed 
skylighted cabins with four others in the works 
every day a picnic basket lunch is delivered to each writers 
doorstep with just a loud enough thump so that they know its 
there nordhoff says 
almost every article in the cabins is handcrafted from the 
porcelain sink basins to the pillows and afghan for curling up next 
to three groundlevel windows a loft and bed look out stainedglass 
windows into the trees 
none of the cabins windows faces other cabins nordhoff says 
they were designed that way so writers would feel separate but 
not isolated 
the cabins were designed by architect chuck dougherty a 
university of washington graduate who now designs structures for the 
amish in lancaster county pa 
writers are afforded solitude all day but eat dinner in the 
farmhouse at a big wooden table looking out over puget sound along 
with nordhoff and the farm family of carpenters cooks and other 
friends 
its a place where people can work the way theyve always 
wanted to says sheryl feldman 47 of sommerville mass a 
nonfiction writer 
nordhoff gave up her long career as a community activist to 
develop the farm 
it was meetings meetings meetings all the time nordhoff 
says too much formality and ritual 
nordhoff had been instrumental in forming the city club a united 
way volunteer bureau she also served on bellevues overlake 
hospital board and was president of the seattle junior league 
nordhoff says that after traveling around the country in a van 
she realized she felt most at home in the country with her hands in 
the dirt 
she bought the farm as something for me and as something she 
wanted to share 
nordhoff who now grows vegetables in her hedgebrook garden 
cowrote a book on fundraising for nonprofit organizations but 
she says she doesnt consider herself a writer 
she says the idea for hedgebrook came from a visit to the 
mcdowell writers colony in new hampshire she liked the colony 
which is for published writers but wondered where people who hadnt 
published anything could go 
the idea for hedgebrook became attractive to me nordhoff 
says a place where i could say i care about women writers and 
support what you are doing even if you havent been published 
a selection committee composed of five writers recommended to 
nordoff by bookstore owners english professors and librarians 
screens the applicants two of the five are men nordhoff says they 
look for women who are dedicated to being a writer we want people 
who cant not write she says 
an applicant must submit a sample of her writing and a letter 
saying why she feels a stay at hedgebrook farm would be important 
for her work 
letters from women have been pouring into hedgebrook 
i have seven children and there hasnt been much opportunity 
for quiet in my life wrote a pennsylvania woman who wants to 
write poetry 
a 42yearold counselor for disabled people in new mexico wrote 
i have been writing poetry since i was a teenager for a long 
time i put my work as a counselor first but now i realize i need to 
nurture parts of me i had previously set aside 
although nordhoff started out advertising mainly through local 
networks she is now receiving applications from all over the 
country 
she hopes to eventually accept writers from different locations 
but for now is focusing on writers from the northwest 
fourteen writers were in residence at some time during the first 
session that ended dec 10 the next session which runs from jan 
10 to june 30 can accommodate 18 
residents have included judith barringer a published poet from 
portland ore who used her stay to finish a second book of poems 
sharon hashimoto of seattle who stayed for a month used her 
time to pull together a book of poems and write several short 
stories a sciencefiction writer finished a couple of chapters 
writers choose how long they want to stay anywhere from a week 
to two months 
i feel fortunate to be able to do this nordhoff says 
helping an artist do her work thats the joy

live to act as long as im healthy enough i want to find a medium 
to express myself i hope to be playing old ladies in the near 
future 
it has nothing to do with money it has to do with the joy one 
has in plying ones trade this is fun for me its rewarding 
moore obviously does not need the money shes quite wealthy from 
the sale of mtm enterprises which she cofounded with former 
husband grant tinker to britains tvs she retains a 20 percent 
ownership 
eight years ago she moved to new york for the stage play whose 
life is it anyway then decided to stay she has been married 
for the past five years to a new york cardiologist dr s robert 
levine they also have a home in new yorks duchess county where 
moore says she has discovered such pastimes as gardening walking 
and horseback riding 
ive become almost bucolic she says 
still moore who professes she gets homesick for new york the 
instant she crosses the hudson river is back in la doing another 
sitcom 
moore wearing a red warmup suit with her hair cut stylishly 
short is sitting on a couch in her trailer parked outside stage 3 
at the mtm studios its the same trailer she used for the mary 
tyler moore show and was also once used by judy garland 
up close despite her diabetic condition and too many years spent 
exposing her skin to the california sun she looks as good as her 
bank account she credits this to a change in lifestyle she has 
quit smoking does light impact aerobics and has adopted a healthier 
diet 
in annie mcguire moore is a woman who works for the 
manhattan borough president has a teenage son and remarries a 
structural engineer with a son and daughter she has a mother 
eileen heckart whos an ultraliberal activist and her new 
husband denis arndt has a father john randolph whos a staunch 
conservative 
the stories are a little different from the usual sitcom fare in 
one show shes held up by a man in a wheelchair then feels 
obligated to find him a job in another her husband admits to 
having had an affair with his late wifes sister once she had to 
clear her fatherinlaws reputation from an old accusation that 
food poisoning in his restaurant cost thomas e dewey the presidency 
were breaking a few molds she says we do some outlandish 
things and conduct ourselves like adults having a great time 
its moores first onecamera show without an audience since she 
displayed only her legs as sam on richard diamond private 
detective in 1959 she says she finds it a much easier way to 
work 
cbs had asked me to come back and do another series after the 
last attempt failed she says we wanted elliot shoenman who 
had been on the cosby show to create the show we talked over 
various concepts for about a year 
we did miscast a very talented actor edward j moore as my 
husband he was replaced by denis arndt and the first show turned 
out a little broader than what we had in mind but thats what cbs 
saw and this put us in at 830 pm after dick van dykes new show 
which is very broad 
the writers strike gave them time to think it over the first 
show was scrapped and the first show on the air was actually the 
second show moore says she wants cbs to move the show because she 
feels its adult content deserves a later time slot 
moore realizes its impossible to avoid comparisons to mary 
richards her character in the mary tyler moore show 
but annie is radically different from mary richards she 
says annies more mature more creative and not as compulsive 
she can have a wrinkle in her skirt or a stain on her blouse 
annies a caregiver she gives of herself to other people shes 
not terribly organized shes a little cynical shes 
freespirited

nancy marchand can speak with authority about 
very proper wasp matrons 
i know a lot of those ladies says the actress who grew up in 
an upper middleclass family in buffalo ny the way they lived 
is the way i lived 
proper is how many audiences view miss marchand too from her 
role as the nononsense wealthy newspaper publisher mrs pynchon 
on televisions lou grant to the befuddled mayor in this 
seasons surprise movie success the naked gun to her latest 
stage role an uppercrust matriarch with a fierce family loyalty in 
the offbroadway hit the cocktail hour 
the play written by ar gurney gets its title from that 
particular time of day usually before dinner when drinks and good 
conversation are served but in this case the conversation is not 
so agreeable 
a son has returned home to ask his parents permission to present 
a play he has written about them miss marchand plays the mother a 
peacemaker who tries to soften the generational squabbles and she 
walked off with glowing notices from the critics 
the actress has worked before with gurney who also comes from 
buffalo and from the same upperclass wasp society its a society 
gurney has written about before in such plays as the dining 
room the middle ages and the perfect party 
often when a playwright is writing a play there comes a point 
when he wants to hear it says miss marchand sitting in the 
living room of her upper west side apartment so ive done a lot 
of readings of his plays and when i read the cocktail hour i 
thought its the best play hes written 
the actress knew she had to play this woman and drew the 
character from her memories of other women her mother and even 
herself but dont ask her to explain how 
this is very hard for me to talk about because its all kind of 
subliminal she says with a laugh 
what i do is sit down right away and learn the role thats 
when i make a lot of discoveries about the character i get so 
involved that i become that person i know that sounds silly but i 
really do 
for miss marchand the cocktail hour has turned into 
particularly gratifying employment it will keep her in new york for 
a while for much of her career she needed to travel for work 
still she has managed to maintain what she calls a real 
household in new york it includes her husband actor paul sparer 
recently seen offbroadway as the father in the hit play a shayna 
maidel the couple raised three children now grown 
even when she was filming lou grant in california miss 
marchand was able to shoot most of her scenes in one day and come 
back to new york for the remainder of the week 
my husband was here and my youngest daughter was just finishing 
up high school she says this is my home but the producers 
were very good to me 
miss marchand also had the luck of appearing in what was a 
quality television show 
the topics that it dealt with were interesting and 
thoughtprovoking she says so it was a challenge for me 
so was the character in one episode early in the series run 
mrs pynchon had a stroke miss marchand recalls the illness gave 
her an opportunity to explore the character further 
she began using a cane for the role something she carried over 
to later episodes and then added other strokerelated 
characteristics to the womans personality like her having trouble 
remembering things 
for most of her career miss marchand has had to juggle family 
and career 
there were stretches of 12hour days when husband and wife never 
stopped running between family and career particularly when they 
both were members of the apaphoenix repertory company in the 1960s 
after working five or six hours rehearsing then rushing home 
and getting dinner on the table and listening to problems about 
trigonometry or getting kids bathed and ready for bed it cleaned 
out that period of time for me emotionally she recalls i could 
go back to the theater fresh and ready to do a show 
it was good for the children too 
it made them more independent and helped them get along 
together she says now they have left home and she can 
concentrate on her career 
i love the work so im not averse to doing something that isnt 
necessarily going to reflect my 35 years in the business she says 
a year ago she was klytemnestra in a production of elektra 
by ezra pound at a miniscule offoffbroadway theater for a 
miniscule salary if it interests me ill do it 
right now she still is fascinated by the cocktail hour 
striving to make the production and her performance better 
although its a play of language its economical she says 
because language is so specific you cant fool around with the 
words changing them or changing the syntax because you will change 
the rhythm and often change the meaning that is the hardest thing 
to do to get the words absolutely perfect 
the woman i play is very smart about dealing with the rhythms 
of the family miss marchand says quite early on in the play 
she says i want to know what i missed and discovers what she 
missed was not very good so she immediately drops it and then picks 
up and approaches it from a totally different point of view but 
its all done i hope as smooth as silk she calms the waters

rain man 
 
the autistic savant syndrome has been used to describe a 
spectacular skill or talent that occurs in an autistic or retarded 
child it might seem a likely subject for a diseaseofthemonth 
television movie instead it is the theme of a motion picture 
rain man which is the most original and compelling american 
drama since one flew over the cuckoos nest 
yes its a drama though as in cuckoo there are hearty 
laughs essentially its the saga of two longlost brothers seeking

trust 
but for whom cruise is astounded to learn that he has an older 
brother hoffman who has been institutionalized most of his life

california 
hoffman may seem like an automaton but he has a superhuman way 
with numbers this pays off at the blackjack table in las vegas 
that helps ameliorate cruises rage and he begins to understand and 
cope with his brother 
no good to give away all the plot suffice to say that the 
inspired script by ronald bass and barry morrow based on morrows 
story offers a wealth of surprises both comedic and dramatic 
barry levinson tin men good morning vietnam directs 
in masterful style it is his best effort in what promises to be a 
distinguished career he maintains a beautiful balance between the 
harddriving cynical cruise and the childlike hoffman

raymond babbitt and never allows him to become monotonous or 
pitiable cruise dashing in his risky business shades carries 
a heavy load talking at a fast clip as the car dealer and as the 
exasperated brother struggling to communicate with raymond cruise

the naked gun 
 
when was the last time you had some real fun at a movie if you 
have to stop and think then run dont walk to the nearest theater 
showing the naked gun from the files of police squad 
be prepared for a zany sidesplitting collection of gags some 
of them off color and most of them outrageous and get ready to give 
your laugh muscles a workout 
naked gun is the latest product of those masters of hilarity 
david zucker jim abrahams and jerry zucker who gave us the 
memorable airplane and the notsomemorable top secret 
this time theyre parodying one of their own failures the short 
lived tv series police squad 
tried and true leslie nielsen is back as the unsmiling klutz of 
the police world lt frank drebin who smashes police cars into 
trash cans gets his hand stuck in a fish tank and falls over his 
own feet in the pursuit of justice hes wonderful 
drebin trying to foil a plot on the life of queen elizabeth ii 
sets off a series of hilarious nonstop gags for instance he winds 
up as the singer of the national anthem and the umpire at a major 
league baseball game where reggie jackson plays an unexpected role 
as assassininwaiting 
david zuckers direction of these complex sight gags is flawless 
priscilla presley is drebins romantic interest jane spencer 
whose deadpan delivery is a match for nielsens a scene in which 
the two practice safe sex in body size condoms is typical of the 
giggle power of this film 
there is a villain played by a silky ricardo montalban a 
bemused sidekick played by george kennedy and lots of celebrity 
cameos as well as a dumpy queen elizabeth lookalike 
there are no messages here and the story is just an excuse for 
some terrific jokes call it slapstick call it crazy call it a hit

funny farm warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated pg 
 
it takes courage for the makers of a comedy to put the word 
funny in the title sometimes its an accurate assessment as in 
a funny thing happened on the way to the forum that 1966 bawdy 
farce starring zero mostel 
then again it might be the kiss of death and warner bros 
funny farm definitely shows signs of rigor mortis this chevy 
chase comedy is about as funny as picking cotton on a 103degree 
august day the laughs such as they are are forced and the 
situations predictable the video reeks of country bumpkin cliches 
and chase as usual does a turn or two with murphys law 
what makes this movie an even greater travesty is that its 
directed by george roy hill who made the very excellent butch 
cassidy and the sundance kid and the academy awardwinning the 
sting 
the thin story line revolves around a writer and his wife who 
decide to leave the noise filth and crowds of city life for the 
bucolic splendors of the country there our hero hopes to write the 
great american novel instead he becomes blocked out of his mind 
grows fat and lazy and idles while his wife turns a simple 
experience with a squirrel into a bestselling childrens book 
in its theatrical release funny farm which costars madolyn 
smith urban cowboy all of me stayed around for a blink 
perhaps some kindhearted filmmaker will one day find some decent 
material for chase whose acting talents and comedic genius have 
been dashed in hollywood in the meantime if you want to see this

rated r 
 
what if wyatt earp met tom mix and the legendary heroes team up 
to solve a murder and get the bad guys in blake edwards 
sunset the reallife cowboys do indeed get together for what 
turns out to be a surprisingly delightful romp 
james garner and bruce willis star as earp and mix respectively 
its an interesting pairing that produces just the right screen 
chemistry garner is his usual homey goodguy with just the right 
amount of laidback seasoning willis usually brash and pseudohip 
plays mix with a certain reserve and honesty 
the time is hollywood in the 1920s mix is the hottest action 
actor around and has been cast to portray the great lawman wyatt 
earp earp has been hired to be a consultant on the film only 
problem is the movie is pure hollywood hogwash and earps character 
is made to look like a moron the movie doesnt sit too well with 
mix either so the two heroes soon have a meeting of the minds 
meanwhile back at the ranch so to speak the studio boss wife 
is an old pal of earps and asks him to help her with a little 
problem this tiny problem turns out to involve murder and scandal 
and is centered on her husband a venal brute played viciously by 
malcolm mcdowell 
the dialogue from edwards slick screenplay based on a story by 
rod amateau is fresh and funny and the action and adventure lure 
us to another time the glittery golden age of hollywood and best 
of all its all true give or take a lie or two

the dead vestron video vhsbeta 8998 rated pg 
 
while most of the dead takes place at a christmas party this 
is not a video to watch with a bunch of pals and a few beers john 
hustons interpretation of james joyces short story is quiet 
powerful and elegant 
it requires attention and you will be rewarded the dead can 
be funny and sweet but its lasting impression is a profoundly sad 
vision of the lack of connection between a husband and wife 
the story unravels during a rather proper but entertaining party 
given annually by two unmarried sisters and their niece in 1904 
dublin among the guests are young lovers a drunk a rebellious 
nationalist woman and the couple gretta anjelica huston and 
gabriel conroy donal mccann 
anjelica huston is a beautiful and surprisingly authentic irish 
woman tormented by the memory a young man she loved as a teenager 
and who she believes died for her 
as those memories slowly are stirred by various events at the 
party gabriel comes finally to realize how poor a part ive 
played in her life his preoccupation with a speech he gives at 
the party suddenly seems so trivial and his steadfastness so dreary 
nominated for an academy award for best screenplay by hustons 
son tony the dead was finished just before john huston died in 
august 1987 
the dead is lovely to look at and truly moving

verne miller nelson entertainment vhsbeta 7998 rated r 
 
verne miller is a tight fastpaced entertaining and 
ostensibly accurate portrait of the prohibitionera 
lawmanturnedgangster who engineered the botched and bloody 
kansas city massacre trying to spring a pal 
scott glenn has the title role of this unpretentious gangster 
movie he invests his character with a grace nobility and charm the 
real verne miller lacked 
filmed mostly on location in alabama its full of nice period 
costumes and architecture that frame some gorgeous performances 
including the brilliant thomas g waites as al capone ed oross as 
brother ralph capone barbara stock as speakeasy chanteuse vi and 
richard bright as adam richetti 
writerdirector rod hewitt took some chances with his abrupt 
montage but it works months pass between some scenes minutes and 
seconds between others yet each has its own compelling logic on the 
journey miller is making 
on nov 29 1933 miller was found shot to death in a ditch 
outside detroit glenns performance is so poised and intense that 
he can give you the character while withholding his secrets 
ultimately we dont know verne miller but then glenn makes us wish 
we could 
this ones a real find

die walkuere deutsche grammaphon the metropolitan opera 
orchestra conducted by james levine 
 
theres no shortage of recordings of wagners die walkuere in 
the catalog but the newest version featuring the metropolitan 
opera orchestra conducted by james levine has been eagerly awaited 
since the project was announced more than two years ago 
for once the results justify all the excitement this deutsche 
grammaphon release available only on cassette and compact disc has 
got to be high on anybodys list of the best opera recordings of 
1988 
the cast closely follows the one heard currently at the met in 
its new production of wagners fouropera ring cycle that means 
its about the best that could be put together from todays singers 
although not up to the superhuman standards set by golden agers such 
as flagstad or melchior or more recently by birgit nilsson 
but its hard to imagine a finer sieglinde than jessye norman 
her pillar of seamless sound and her impeccable diction are joined 
by a passionate commitment that makes the final scene of act 1 
breathtaking gary lakes americas latest entry in the heldentenor 
sweepstakes is a morethanrespectable partner for her as siegmund 
bass james morris has the vocal weight and the beauty of tone to 
make a worldclass wotan an occasional blandness mars his 
interpretation of this complex character but he is still relatively 
new to the part 
as bruennhilde hildegard behrens sounds as good as she ever has 
which is splendid the voice is thinner than ideal but she never 
sounds harsh or raw here as she sometimes does in performance and 
her understanding of the character is impressive 
the lesser roles are cast impeccably christa ludwig as fricke 
provides a link to the great tradition of early postworld war ii 
operatic singing and kurt moll the hunding is one of the finest 
german basses in recent memory even the chorus of valkyries is 
unusually strong including such major artists as marita napier 
marilyn mims and linda kelm 
levine and the orchestra do themselves proud the sound is always 
smooth and sonorous and the interpretation is quite moving at the 
climactic moments especially wotans eloquent farewell to the 
disgraced bruennhilde in act 3 
the orchestra widely regarded as one of the worlds finest 
ensembles had not recorded a homegrown production for 16 years 
since bizets carmen with leonard bernstein conducting 
this walkuere certainly whets the appetite for the rest of 
the ring recordings and one hopes for more met projects to follow

imaginos columbia blue oyster cult 
 
crashandburn guitars monstermovie lyrics sinister vocals 
durn it must be the blue oyster cult 
yes all the trademarks of the cult are evident on imaginos 
but they seem hollow and sometimes downright silly amid the dense 
plodding heavy metal that characterizes most of bocs latest effort 
this band has sounded stagnant for about a decade now coasting 
on the devilinleather imagery that at one time produced some of 
the most ferocious music on the rock n roll landscape 
can anyone who experienced the multiguitar raveups of bocs 
first five albums or their mindblowing live shows fail to be 
disappointed with the overdone bashing about on imaginos 
the band has one of the genres finest guitarists in donald 
buck dharma roeser and the blue oyster cult does know how to 
rock but the good moments here are just that a good guitar lick 
here an imaginative vocal turn there buried in secondrate 
material you can sit and nod when the good bits emerge if thats 
your idea of a good time 
giving credit where its due del rios song soars above the 
rest distinguished by its crisp production eric blooms rawedged 
vocal and a strong tuneful melody theres also an interesting 
fanciedup remake of astronomy a song they first did in 1974 
by most standards this would be a decent hard rock lp but the 
blue oyster cult has demonstrated many times they are more than a 
decent hard rock band thats what makes listening to imaginos 
so infuriating

paint another picture columbia darlene love 
 
darlene love is one of the greatest rock n roll singers ever to 
grace our planet her work with phil spector in the 1960s hes a 
rebel da doo ron ron recorded under a variety of names 
stands as the definition of the spector sound and christmas 
baby please come home is simply the best rock n roll 
christmas record ever 
thats why her first solo album even with help from tom petty 
joan jett paul shaffer and master producer jimmy iovine is a 
disappointment 
love isnt the problem here thankfully shes not one of those 
timeravaged legends croaking their way to another payday after 
more than two decades at it she still sings stunningly well 
the problem is the material which is simply uninteresting too 
often love is forced to fight her way out of synthopop musical 
cliches and thats a tremendous waste 
best is pettys we stand a chance which rocks a bit but 
isnt exactly hes a rebel and the inclusion of a straight 
cover of youll never walk alone yep the same one jerry lewis 
moans on labor day is simply puzzling 
the record clocks in under 32 minutes which one assumes is 
testimony enough to the problem love had in finding worthy songs for 
this project 
since paint another picture probably wont sell a zillion 
copies heres hoping columbia gives her another chance the notion 
of darlene love making rock n roll records again is exciting its 
too bad this record isnt

they are in their late 70s yet hume cronyn 
and jessica tandy manage to throw off more creative energy than a 
crowd of brat packers 
some of that energy can be viewed in cocoon the return in 
which they reprise their roles as a married couple facing the 
husbands serious illness in the first film the rejuvenated cronyn 
dived swam and ran this time he was scheduled to join don ameche 
wilford brimley and jack gilford in a pickup basketball match with 
four teenagers 
i had never played basketball in my life at my school it was 
not a big activity said cronyn dan petrie the director of 
cocoon ii said at least youve got to learn to dribble and pass 
properly im sending you a basketball 
the basketball arrived while i was teaching at the university 
in boca raton fla i tried to hide myself in the hotel parking lot 
because to see an old boy of 77 bouncing a basketball all by 
himself hour after hour 
of course when i got to the filming of it they had doubles i 
hardly did anything but pass the ball to get rid of it i felt quite 
bitter about it 
cronyn is no stranger to movie stunts he reminisced about the 
1947 brute force in which he and burt lancaster staged a 
climactic battle atop a burning prison tower 
at the end of it burt picked me up and hurled me off the 
flaming tower the actor recalled i dropped 20 feet onto a 
platform that is a long drop ive done some diving in my time get 
20 feet above the water and make a mistake you dont forget it if 
you dont fall right onto a pile of mattresses thats the last time 
youll do anything i wouldnt dare do anything like that now 
oh yes you would miss tandy corrected with a laugh its 
the challenge that attracts him and hume keeps himself in good 
shape i dont worry about him 
the veteran stars who are husband and wife require a large 
amount of vitality especially when they are appearing in a 
twocharacter play such as the pulitzer prizewinning the gin 
game 
its essential if you are performing that you keep your 
energy miss tandy said you cant let go youve got to keep in 
good shape 
we get old and we cant do quite as much as we used to but at 
least you have to do the best you can 
the pursuit of excellence has marked both their careers hers 
began in london where she was born in 1909 at 16 she made her 
stage debut at 21 she was appearing in the new york theater cronyn 
was also born in london ontario he started acting in the montreal 
theater and moved to broadway in 1934 both of their careers 
flourished after their 1942 marriage 
how did they meet 
tandy i was working in a play in new york hume was in the 
audience and he came backstage to see a friend of his who was also 
in the play he said how do you do and we went out to supper 
with our mutual friend then we 
cronyn quarreled 
tandy we quarreled quite often yes it was not a sort of 
blinding light 
cronyn my version was hilarious i went back to see this 
actor alex knox who was appearing in the play with jessie i had 
seen her on the stage a couple of years previously in a play called 
the white steed and had admired her we went out to supper 
together and i made what i thought was an amusing and caustic 
remark about the nature of the english which jessie found 
heavyhanded and stupid which she let me know in no uncertain 
terms 
tandy it wasnt that night at all it was another occasion 
entirely laughing so there you are it really doesnt matter 
during the early years of marriage they pursued separate 
careers he appeared in such films as shadow of a doubt the 
seventh cross and ziegfeld follies she in the valley of 
decision the green years and forever amber 
her greatest fame came when she created the role of blanche 
dubois in a streetcar named desire jack warner chose her 
costar marlon brando for the film version but passed up miss 
tandy for a movie name vivien leigh 
in recent times the cronyns have appeared separately but they 
have earned a reputation as the latterday lunts costarring in 12 
plays including the fourposter and a delicate balance 
films such as cocoon and batteries not included and the 
recent television film foxfire which he cowrote and for which 
she won an emmy 
will they ever retire 
tandy oh yes i hope that i shall be wise enough to stop 
before everyone else knows i should stop i think that i will do 
less than i used to but i do long for a challenge i do want to do 
another play even though eight shows a week is hard work however 
thats what i enjoy most 
cronyn i think jess is a more dedicated actress than i am an 
actor it means a great deal in her life and it means a lot in 
mine but there are other things i enjoy doing i like trying to 
write 
i find it very difficult just to sit i would love to learn how 
to do that with contentment i fill my life with a lot of busyness 
in between jobs then i work very hard some of it is quite 
unhealthy its compulsive i dont know what to do about that im 
a little old to change

craft are gnarled and scarred and stained 
kumin pulls sugar into ropes to weave a basket as delicate and 
precious as porcelain he blows sugar just as glass is blown to 
create shimmering pieces of fruit to fill the bowl and he molds 
sugar for flower petals and leaves 
one of his baskets is part of an astonishing exhibit of 200 
culinary fantasies called the confectioners art now at the 
american craft museum in new york the show will travel to 10 cities 
into 1991 
pulling sugar is hard work requiring strength and speed at a 
touch he shapes the petals of a rose a twist and theres a leaf 
and in no time he has pretty much a rose like mother nature makes 
em 
kumin a former white house pastry chef who is tall and trim 
apparently is able to resist the temptation of his own creations 
however no matter how lovely or ingenious what he creates is 
temporary and his basket and some of the other pieces may not even 
last through the tour of the confectioners art 
in our trade you understand if it lasts forever we would 
lose our jobs so you make another said kumin now executive chef 
at the international pastry arts center in elmsford ny during a 
demonstration of his work at the museum 
the confectioners art is one rarely recognized but 
apparently popular as people have lined up outside the museum to 
see such works as a sugar recreation of a spanish cathedral door 
stunning in its intricacy what appears to be a tapestry of the 
statue of liberty actually made from jelly beans a gorgeous blown 
sugar vase with a surprise cadre of sugar ants marching up one 
side a chocolate bowl that looks like swirled pottery or an 
extravagant chocolate new york city skyline carved into a giant big 
apple 
there are edible bracelets a dazzling sugar white house and 
disney castle glorious wedding cakes and a licorice mosaic some 
pieces are witty and silly some are literally too pretty to eat 
the creators are equally diverse some without formal training 
pastry chefs or artists who also work with more lasting materials 
even major manufacturers who introduced some whimsy in their 
products 
the exhibit also includes the history of sugar and chocolate 
tools of the trade holiday sweets and packaging and presentation 
meryle evans a food historian and curator of the exhibit said 
its popularity stems from the place sugar and chocolate hold in our 
hearts and tummies 
sweet foods are associated with celebration with rites of 
passage prosperity and collective joy she said sweets and 
their creators have over many centuries provided a mirror of 
civilization reflecting the customs and traditions of society 
in renaissance italy the confectioner first flourished as an 
artist 
in that opulent extravagant era with its ferment of 
expression in all the arts the confectioner joined the sculptor 
wood carver and architect to produce all manner of elaborate 
allegorical tableaux to grace the banquet tables of popes and 
princes evans wrote in the catalog to the exhibit 
today food arts have been revived 
food has become a much more important part of our lives again 
the whole idea of an artistic presentation evans said in a 
telephone interview she also noted that many pieces mirror more 
traditional art including peter boyles pink and lilac blown sugar 
vase called ode on a grecian urn 
people are coming in not expecting to see art theyre 
surprised somehow at the results said boyle who also blows 
glass but some of the pieces could be in any gallery if they were 
in ceramic or a conventional medium 
but food holds special appeal 
an artist of course hopes that his art can be consumed by the 
mind and the eye and if its consumed by the stomach its 
another way to have it touch people said boyle an artist from 
hoboken nj who said his initial proposal for a sugar sculpture 
of a fullsize barbecue grill with hotdogs and hamburgers was turned 
down as too lowbrow but he said he couldnt resist the marching 
ants 
the confectioners art sponsored by nestle chocolate is in 
new york through jan 22 and travels to atlanta philadelphia 
blooomfield hills mich chicago denver seattle salt lake city 
and tampa fla 
evans said she hopes people will leave this exhibit with an 
appreciation of the art of men and women dedicated to making our 
lives a little pleasanter as well as tastier 
but its all lookbutdonttouch 
for some reason the mere fact that its in a museum seems to 
be a deterrent she said even none of the little kids have 
tried to take a bite

richard thompson has been making records for over 
20 years his music though draws on sources much older 
i hope that things like age arent that important said 
thompson 39 a guitarist singer and songwriter who helped form the 
seminal english folkrock group fairport convention in 1967 
when i was 20 i was listening to people who were dead you have 
to listen to everything 
fairport convention seemed to work in the opposite direction of 
rock music at the time instead of being influenced by the 
psychedelic sounds of the beatles on sgt pepper fairport 
convention incorporated music from previous centuries rather than 
use backward tape loops and distorted guitars fairport convention 
experimented with the fiddle and mandolin 
thompson who left the group in 1971 recalled the sense of 
purpose the members shared 
we were concerned about reviving a traditional music in 
britain i listened to a lot of scottish music thats a thing 
thats important to me we listened to traditional music and jazz 
and rock n roll 
there was a great spirit of camaraderie and musical 
exploration i remember a feeling of kinship with the bandmates at 
the time 
and hit singles were not important 
i never even thought about it it never crossed my mind that i 
was going into the music business i just found myself being a 
professional musician 
his first solo album henry the human fly came out in 1972 
and combined folkrock music with thompsons hardedged singing 
the same year he married linda peters a former backup singer 
and the two went on to record seven lps together in 1982 they 
released shoot out the lights one of the most acclaimed records 
of the year but were divorced soon after 
the popularity of the recording duo threatened to overshadow 
thompsons solo career as fans speculated whether his often bitter 
love songs were about peters 
songs are really work of the imagination thompson said i 
think its putting too much of a limit to say this songs about this 
person or that person it should be bigger than that 
in i still dream a ballad off his new album amnesia 
thompson sings and i never was to know that id come to miss you 
so but time winds down and i turned my back long ago he stressed 
the song was not about his exwife 
its really a story song its not me im telling a story 
about a guy whose life seems aimless it seems dull and dead hes 
compromised himself all the way 
thompson took six weeks to make amnesia and for the first 
time recorded in the united states yankee go home another 
song from the lp might impress listeners as an attack against 
american imperialisn but thompson doesnt see it that way 
i see it as a friendly arm around the shoulder of america 
saying how we in england used to have an empire and it got frittered 
away finally weve learned to adjust to this tragic fact now 
its your turn its time for america not to be number 1 
on jerusalem on the jukebox thompson deals with a subject 
familiar to most americans television evangelists 
jerusalem is the name of a hymn sung in england its a great 
song i heard it played on a television show and was so alarmed that 
things would reach this point 
is evangelist jimmy swaggert the tip of the iceberg what 
passes for spirituality 
thompson says there is not yet an english equivalent to jimmy 
swaggert but there is the possibility britain is dying for 
someone like jimmy swaggert that sort of professional sincerity 
hed be huge in britain 
many of thompsons songs have sad overtones he sings about 
jealousy lost love death but he noted that just because songs are 
about sad events theyre not necessarily sad songs 
its sad but cathartic expressing sadness isnt such a sad 
business it can make you feel quite good i supposed im a really a 
realist 
a realist not a cynic rock was once considered a music for 
young people but many of its greatest performers are now 
middleaged and have struggled for a reason to continue 
not thompson 
every once in a while i step to one side and ask myself the 
reason im playing music having reestablished the direction its 
easier to keep going he said 
if you see music as experiment and education there is no end 
to it youre always looking for the next thing if youre 
commercially successful and you see that as the end theres going 
to be a real anticlimax 
and thompson still believes in drawing on a wide array of music 
regardless of how many records he sells 
rock n roll is now so multigenerational you can fit almost 
every musical style in existence into rock music these days im on 
the edge of it rather than the middle of it

lawrence ferlinghetti whose fbi file once 
described him as a beatnik rabble rouser looked like an elder 
statesman with his trim white beard navy jacket and patterned tie 
as he promoted his first novel in 28 years love in the days of 
rage 
but the man whose city lights press published and sustained a 
generation of beat poets is not another yippie gone yuppie look 
closer and you see hes wearing an onyx stud in his right ear 
ferlinghetti is chiefly known as a lyrical poet whose 1958 work 
a coney island of the mind is one of the bestselling books of 
poetry in the past three decades and as a political anarchist whose 
publication of allen ginsbergs howl led to his arrest on 
obscenity charges 
although he has published some two dozen collections of poetry 
as well as essays and a handful of plays in his more than three 
decades of writing ferlinghetti has written only one other novel 
her published in 1960 is a surreal account of a young mans 
search for his identity 
love in the days of rage dutton 1595 is set in paris in 
1968 during the studentled spring riots that shut down the 
universities and paralyzed the city the historical events serve as 
the background for a love story between annie a painter who teaches 
at the beaux arts and julian a wealthy financier who calls himself 
an anarchist banker 
this new novel is much more accessible to the public its 
written in a much more conventional style said ferlinghetti 69 
sipping a beer in the lobby of the algonquin hotel as if to bear 
out the algonquins reputation as a literary haunt wellwishers 
twice interrupted the interview to greet the poet 
i really want to revivify the spirt of 68 as it was called 
by the french especially today when we need it said 
ferlinghetti who finds this decades emphasis on wealth and success 
disheartening 
in retrospect it was this youthquake against the 
dehumanization of man the new technocratic age 
ferlinghetti said many of the anarchist arguments espoused by his 
character julian were lifted from fernando pessoa a 
frenchportuguese poet who wrote a novella early in the century 
called the anarchist banker 
he was asked if pessoas philosophy of anarchism is his as well 
anarchism isnt really a philosphy and it isnt really an 
ideal its an idea the press has given anarchism a bad name 
theyve equated it with terrorism im talking about anarchism in 
the traditional sense he said its mostly civil libertarianism 
and antifascism really the individuals freedom today is more 
and more limited not just by our government but the whole 
industrial way of life the point of view of the philosophical 
anarchist is to stand up for the free individual 
he called charlie chaplin the archtypal anarchist the little man 
with the hat and cane fighting the big cruel world the comparison 
is not a flip one ferlinghetti named his city lights bookstore 
cofounded with friend peter martin after the classic chaplin film 
about the tramp who falls in love with a blind woman when the funky 
little shop opened in san francisco in 1953 it was the first 
allpaperback bookstore in the united states and an instant hit it 
is still open until midnight seven days a week 
a few years after the bookstore ferlinghetti launched city 
lights press which published ginsberg jack kerouac william s 
burroughs and others who would come to typify the beat generation 
the press publishes about 12 to 15 titles a year and ferlinghetti 
and coeditor nancy peters aim for a mix of poetry foreign authors 
what used to be called belles lettres and books on such 
topics as aids or environmental causes 
the bookstore and press support one another some years the store 
makes money while the press operates at a loss and vice versa the 
goal is always to break even to make a profit means paying taxes 
says ferlinghetti the anarchist 
he challenged an interviewers assertion that most of his writing 
is overtly political he said only about half was 
inside him is a lyrical individual this eros this 
pleasureseeking loveseeking being intent on his own pursuits 
he said and every once in a while he turns aside from these 
pursuits to give this political lout thats loping alongside a few 
clouts if you ignore him the lout he wont go away he just grows 
bigger and bigger 
itd be nice to just be writing love poems and be listening to 
concertos all the time but you have to fight the monster once in 
awhile said ferlinghetti blue eyes twinkling i dont do it 
anymore than i have to

its a tiny nightclub sandwiched between 
an office and recording studio and a childrens clothing store in 
the chic green hills section of the country music capital 
the bluebird cafe may be a few miles from the wellworn paths 
tread by tourists but its a gathering place for recording industry 
executives and those trying to get their attention its the place 
where country music stars of tomorrow yearn to perform waiting up 
to four months for a precious spot on the tiny stage 
its country musics answer to the comedy store the improv and 
catch a rising star its country musics proving ground 
kathy mattea got her break there so did the sweethearts of the 
rodeo steve earle t graham brown and foster and lloyd 
i started playing there about every three or four weeks and 
within three months of starting there i got a record deal said 
mattea whose 18 wheels and a dozen roses was voted single of 
the year by the country music association 
when featured performers are presented friday and saturday 
nights its standing room for those without reservations and a 
tight fit for those who do have them the intimate atmosphere is 
integral to the music owner amy kurland said she has no plans to 
move although the 6yearold club seats only 130 or 150 
sardinestyle 
it feels like a living room sometimes its more intimidating 
because you can see every face in the room mattea said 
songwriter fred knobloch agrees but adds the closeness of the 
audience is a barometer of how new songs and songwriters are being 
received 
the audiences are so close that they feel real involved in what 
youre doing if youre good they love you if youre bad they are 
polite and get up and leave he said 
about 90 percent of the crowd is involved in the music business 
and the remainder are tourists and locals or real people as 
kurland calls them 
i desire that people be specifically interested in the music 
that listening to live music is enough and maybe having a glass of 
wine not picking somebody up kurland said 
the quality of the performers is always excellent i maybe 
book one or two people im disappointed with in a year 
knobloch is often joined by fellow countryacoustic songwriters 
thom schuyler craig bickhardt and don schlitz to become skbs one 
of the clubs top draws 
schlitz wrote the gambler for kenny rogers knobloch created 
used to be blue for sawyer brown and bickhardt wrote the steve 
warinernicolette larson duet thats how you know when loves 
right 
knobloch got his start at the bluebird at a sunday writers night 
a night set aside for songwriters to perform their new 
compositions kurland is deluged with tapes from those who know that 
playing a writers night could mean a break 
we make the music business accessible to the new guy kurland 
said but if it wasnt for the bluebird and some other places to 
play you could never really function as a songwriter in 
nashville appearing here is a crucial part of the process 
budding songwriters know this and the walls of kurlands 
claustrophobic office prove it demonstration tapes fill racks on an 
entire wall and others are scattered on her desk where a phone rings 
repeatedly and a mammoth stuffed carnival prize snake curls watching 
overhead 
if the music satisfies kurlands discriminating ear there is a 
fourmonth wait between an audition at the bluebird until a writer 
can perform on a sunday night show from the time they get here to 
the time i would sign them as an act on a feature show it will be 
nine months to one year she said 
david wilcox a promising acousticfolk artist did his time on 
the bluebird circuit and kurland has for the first time decided to 
promote the undiscovered james taylorstyled artist among her 
contacts in the record world 
despite the time it takes to get on stage many songwriters 
hunger after a spot on the clubs calendar 
it is a songwriters paradise said maggie cavender 
executive director of the nashville chapter of the songwriters 
association international 
the bluebird plays a magnificent role in the industry it 
is one of the greatest clubs in town in my estimation i think the 
bluebird is the ultimate in that sort of thing displaying 
songwriters abilities

wurzells wormwood didnt count for much when it 
was alive in the wild but its at the center of a controversy now 
that its gone 
something thats completely new to the world in its only 
locality just wasnt looked after lamented brian wurzell the 
plants discoverer 
wurzells wormwood artemesia wurzellii was the pride and joy of 
the ecological consultant and botanist who in august 1987 discovered 
it growing on a 2squareyard plot in a park in north london his 
instincts told him it was something new and tests at leicester 
university proved him right 
he reported his discovery to the authority that runs the park 
and i assumed from then on that the plant would be safeguarded 
wurzell said on a recent visit to the site i found to my horror 
it had been dumped on it was no longer there 
the loss is also mourned by clive stace a botany professor at 
leicester university and president of the botanical society of the 
british isles 
this was notified to the people in charge of this site said 
stace they agreed that it was interesting and they agreed to look 
after it and not harm it and then some twit dumped something on 
it 
artemisia wurzellii was a hybrid of two common species one 
native to britain the other chinese such hybrids arent rare the 
2500 flowering plant species found in the british isles have 
spawned some 700 hybrid he said 
but wurzells discovery piqued botanists interest because of its 
unusual genesis its parents normally flower at different times of 
the year these two things must have flowered exceptionally 
either the one early or the other late and overlapped so that one 
could pollinate the other stace said 
the result wasnt much to look at 
its a rather ugly scruffylooking green plant with small 
brownishgreenish flowers stace said it is not at all 
attractive its interest is totally scientific as opposed to 
aesthetic 
but wurzell like a proud parent saw some beauty in the 
botanical mongrel its not something you would grow in your 
garden to look pretty but it had a dignity of its own 
leicester university botanists managed to cultivate a cutting 
from a small piece of root wurzell sent them shortly after 
discovering the plant but other than that artemisia wurzellii is 
just a memory 
it is extinct in the wild wurzell said he wants to know who 
to blame 
i cant point an accusing finger he said but it looks as 
though the contractors of a nearby road simply spread lots of soil 
having no idea that there was anything there that shouldnt have 
been dumped on 
the lea valley regional park authority promises to get to the 
root of things but an official who insisted on anonymity 
cautioned it might be nothing to do with road construction at all 
meanwhile botanists can only wonder what might have been 
if you destroy something you dont know what youve lost 
stace said wurzells wormwood might even have had commercial 
potential he said noting that it comes from the strongly scented 
artemisia genus 
but even if it was ugly and useless itll be missed 
its like a big jigsaw stace said you might say youve 
got a jigsaw of a thousand pieces so it doesnt really matter if 
you lose one youve only lost one in a thousand but it does spoil 
the jigsaw doesnt it

fifty years ago this month two german scientists 
working with relatively simple equipment on unfinished pine tables 
split the uranium atom rocking the physics world and ushering in 
the nuclear age 
an unthinkable idea at the time atomsplitting was later called 
nuclear fission and used to produce nuclear power and the atomic 
bomb 
it brought otto hahn a 1944 nobel prize in chemistry a year 
later the bombing of hiroshima turned his triumph to shock and 
selfblame 
i was shocked and depressed beyond measure hahn wrote in his 
autobiography the thought of the unspeakable misery of countless 
innocent women and children was something that i could scarcely 
bear 
hahn austrian physicist lise meitner and chemist fritz 
strassmann began their work after experiments by others who 
bombarded uranium with neutrons neutrons along with protons and 
electrons are building blocks of atoms 
starting in 1934 with research by physicist enrico fermi 
scientists were reporting varying answers about what elements were 
produced as a result of that bombardment hahn and colleagues 
decided to get to the bottom of that question 
the historic experiment began the evening of dec 16 1938 with 
another bombardment of uranium as hahn and strassmann worked to 
identify the new atoms that resulted we were faced by something 
distinctly odd hahn said 
to help in identifying the minute quantities of new atoms the 
scientists had been mixing in the element barium which would grab 
onto similar atoms the barium latched onto some newly created 
atoms meaning they were either radium or barium barium was out of 
the question according to theory at the time to produce barium 
the bombardment would have had to split the atoms 
but further experiments left no doubt 
on dec 21 hahn and strassmann finished a hastily written 
manuscript that announced their results but cautiously as 
chemists hahn said we hesitated to announce a revolutionary 
discovery in physics 
the theoretical explanation came from meitner and her nephew 
physicist otto frisch who realized the uranium atom had split like 
a wobbling raindrop that finally breaks into two they also realized 
that the splitting released an enormous amount of energy the energy 
from just one ounce of uranium could supply the average american 
household with electricity for 70 years 
the news spread quickly frisch had barely begun telling danish 
physicist niels bohr on jan 3 1939 when bohr struck his forehead 
and exclaimed oh what fools we have been we ought to have seen 
that before

when monthold vito colucci snuggles up to 
the babyblue teddy bear in his incubator hes getting more than 
creature comfort 
vito born 13 weeks premature also is learning how to breathe 
the handsewn sheepskin bear in the isolette at the university 
of connecticut health center in farmington has a balloon in its 
abdomen connected to a mechanical air pump so the bear mimics the 
deep gentle inhaling and exhaling of a healthy sleeping person 
a research project under way at the university and st francis 
hospital and medical center in hartford has shown that the bears can 
help regulate breathing by inducing deep quiet sleep in preemies 
who frequently suffer respiratory disorders said evelyn thoman the 
behaviorist who designed the project 
this is a stimulation that i call biologically relevant 
thoman said she came up with the idea about 15 years ago and 
experimented on rat pups deprived of their mothers those given a 
surrogate mother a warm moist pulsating tube survived those 
without a surrogate died 
premature infants were a natural subject for the study since 
they too are separated from their mothers when they are isolated in 
an incubator 
her experiment is based partly on the physics principle of 
entrainment which holds that all pulsating or beating objects 
animate and inanimate tend to match the rhythms of nearby objects 
the phenomenon explains why a halfdozen grandfather clocks on the 
same wall eventually will synchronize 
thoman theorizes that the bears may calm colicky babies and that 
aside from helping infants learn to breathe the bears stimulate 
brain development by letting the babies choose when to snuggle up to 
the toys

it was the year they held a presidential election and half the 
nations voters decided to stay home 
it was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered 
barnacleencrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the 
world it was the year an early decision to let yellowstone burn 
altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come 
it was the year oprah decided to diet soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev decided he wanted to be president attorney general edwin 
meese iii decided to resign evangelist jimmy swaggart decided to 
confess his sins and michael spinks decided to challenge world 
heavyweight champion mike tyson 
some decisions worked others didnt 
soviets and americans pulled together to free two surviving 
whales last seen cruising toward warmer waters soviet president 
andrei gromyko bowed out and gorbachev took over oprah winfrey 
the tv host lost 67 pounds 
in yellowstone however officials realized too late they might 
have made the wrong decision by the time firefighters arrived 
unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of 
control forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among 
area residents 
swaggart preached on but lost much of his audience after the 
assemblies of god decided to defrock him spinks lasted for just 91 
seconds and eight decisive blows 
the wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen 
faced with the choice between vice president george bush and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and frustrated by one of the 
most lowdown dirty presidential campaigns ever an ambivalent 
electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to 
overwhelming inertia 
ive always loved election years president reagan said but 
it seemed hardly anyone else did bushs 5446 percent victory over 
his democratic opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout the 
lowest in 64 years 
political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many 
voters werent voting for anyone so much as they were voting against 
the other guy they also determined that bush lost 2 percent of his 
supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision 
to tap as his running mate indiana sen dan quayle the first 
baby boomer on a national ticket and a choice that surprised 
even bushs advisers 
it was democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen the 
silverhaired smoothtalking senator from texas who provided the 
only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates 
senator you are no jack kennedy bentsen told a flustered 
quayle after the 41yearold senator had compared himself with the 
late democratic president 
the kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation the 25th 
anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on 
idealism lost and a world changed 
nowhere was that change more apparent than in ussoviet 
relations 
kennedy on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago shunned 
nikita khrushchev when he visited new york but gorbachev the first 
soviet leader since khrushchev to taste the big apple had a 
superpower lunch with reagan and bush on dec 7 and addressed the 
united nations with no khrushchevstyle shoethumping instead he 
promised to trim 500000 men and 10000 tanks from the soviet armed 
forces 
the visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit soviet 
armenia the soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated 
60000 had died and 500000 were left homeless as whole cities 
crumbled under the quakes force 
rescue teams doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in 
from around the world it was the first time since world war ii that 
the soviet union had accepted disaster relief from the united states 
reagan paid his first visit to moscow in june for a summit that 
failed to break new ground in arms control the president hammered 
away on human rights issues and gorbachev later sent america living 
proof of his commitment to change 
nobel laureate andrei sakharov father of the soviet dissident 
movement was allowed his first trip outside the soviet union after 
years of agitation over soviet human rights policies 
americans vigorously agitated for their own causes more than 
5000 people were arrested in antiabortion protests that began in 
july in 32 cities and continued through the year roe vs wade the 
supreme court decision legalizing abortion turned 15 years old 
intact 
anthony mcleod kennedy confirmed as a supreme court justice by a 
unanimous senate inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but 
gave no hint of his views 
court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the 
oncepowerful 
former philippine president ferdinand e marcos and his wife 
imelda were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they

as capt will rogers guidedmissile cruiser the uss vincennes 
exchanged fire with iranian speedboats iran air flight 655 appeared 
on the us warships hightech radar mistaken reports said the 
aircraft appeared to be descending and accelerating as if 
attacking it failed to respond to warnings on civilian and military 
channels 
rogers gave the order to fire the decision he later said was 
in defense of his ship and crew but what rogers feared was an 
iranian f14 fighter actually was an airbus a300 with 290 people 
aboard all of whom died 
the reagan administration defended the decision but also decided 
to compensate the victims families among the dead a woman flying 
with her eight children to meet her husband an iranian couple 
flying to dubai to shop for a daughters wedding 
three days later a north sea oil and gas platform exploded 
killing 167 men in the worlds worstever oilfield disaster and

with his decision to compete and his subsequent fall hours after 
his sisters death 
as winter turned to spring the fickle weather that had delayed 
ski and sled events in calgary became devastating drought across 
america baking the nations farmland and turning the mighty 
mississippi into a muddy mess impassable for weeks crops and 
profits shriveled in the fields as grain production dropped by 
onethird but the farmer got some help from congress 39 billion 
in drought relief 
there was little relief on the other side of the world as floods

as the 1988 political year began the 
conventional wisdom was that ronald reagans retirement would mean a 
close race for the white house and george bush his 
loyaltoafault vice president had little chance to succeed him 
now at the end of a long campaign road strewn with the wreckage 
of such assumptions bush is forming his administration and democrat 
michael dukakis is back at his old stand as governor of 
massachusetts 
democrats are taking comfort in their gains in other races 
despite bushs 40state victory nov 8 the democrats added to their 
congressional majorities picking up one senate seat and three in 
the house 
with one more democratic governor the party now has 28 to 22 
for the republicans 
but after losing their fifth presidential election out of the 
last six the democrats were wondering when they would ever regain 
control of the white house 
for the voters election day brought a welcome end to a campaign 
that often was more slime than substance 
convicted rapist willie horton gained celebrity status and a dead 
fish floating among the boston harbor debris became a familiar 
television image 
dukakis was another liberal governor coming out of nowhere 
who had vetoed legislation to require the pledge of allegiance in 
massachusetts schools and who was a cardcarrying member of the 
aclu 
republicans were portrayed as popping champagne corks in their 
penthouses and their nominee george bush is a man who was born 
on third base and thinks that hes hit a triple was one of the 
biggest applause lines at the democratic national convention 
was bush a wimp was dukakis too cold 
such matters overshadowed concerns about the budget and trade 
deficits education drugs and defense and foreign policy 
the election year opened with high hopes for the democrats the 
popular reagan after all would not be on the ballot 
the democrats had regained control of the senate in 1986 many 
polls reported americans wanted a change in political leadership 
after seven years of a republican white house and everywhere bush 
went he was dogged by questions about his role in the irancontra 
affair what did the vice president know and what advice had he 
given the president 
ive answered the questions and ive cooperated fully with any 
investigations none of which by the way were aimed at me he 
responded refusing to discuss what he had told reagan 
large fields were running hard in both parties at the start of 
the election year eight democrats and six republicans 
the democratic contenders along with dukakis were sens joseph 
biden of delaware paul simon of illinois and albert gore jr of 
tennessee rep richard gephardt of missouri jesse jackson former 
gov bruce babbitt of arizona and former sen gary hart of colorado 
on the republican side bush was regarded as a shaky frontrunner 
with senate gop leader bob dole of kansas and rep jack kemp of new 
york given strong chances of brushing the vice president out of the 
race the other contenders were former secretary of state alexander 
m haig jr former gov pete du pont of delaware and television 
evangelist pat robertson 
bush was written off after finishing third to dole and robertson 
in iowa 
the hemorrhaging of george bush has begun said haig 
but new hampshire republicans stopped that hemorrhaging and put 
bush back on track to the nomination 
displaying an uncanny consistency iowa voters also gave dukakis 
a thirdplace finish and he too won in new hampshire 
the two big winners in super tuesdays combination of primaries 
were liberals jackson and dukakis gore did well in the southern 
primaries but he had to split votes there with jackson and had 
little support north of the masondixon line 
on the republican side bush swept all 16 primaries on the big 
day 
that effectively locked up the nomination for bush but dukakis 
still had a tough road ahead 
he finished third in illinois behind favorite sons simon and 
jackson and then was upset by jackson in michigan but when the 
race came down to dukakis against jackson the massachusetts 
governor ran off a string of victories that clinched the nomination 
the democrats roasted bush at their convention put on a 
closingnight unity show and saw their nominee jump to doubledigit 
leads in the national polls 
enter willie horton in television commercials and countless 
speeches the bush campaign raised the case of the massachusetts 
convict who while free on a furlough from prison raped a maryland 
woman 
the republicans also attacked the democratic nominee for vetoing 
the pledge of allegiance bill and for boston harbors pollution 
for weeks dukakis ignored the attacks but his big lead in the 
polls was dwindling and by labor day it was gone by the time he 
responded it was too late the big lead had swung to bush 
bush built his lead despite what was widely regarded as a major 
political mistake his selection of sen dan quayle of indiana as 
his running mate 
national polls consistently reported voters by a wide margin 
preferred democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen of 
texas over quayle 
but on nov 8 voters focused on the presidential nominees 
despite bentsens presence on the ticket bush carried texas 
i think one of the lessons of the campaign is that you have to 
respond and you have to respond quickly dukakis said at a 
postelection news conference 
it was one of the kinder assessments of his effort which many 
other democrats called the worst campaign of this century 
but the 1988 votes were no sooner counted than democrats began 
looking to 1992 when some old names jackson gephardt and gore 
may contend with some new sens bill bradley of new jersey sam 
nunn of georgia and the newly elected bob kerrey of nebraska and 
new york gov mario cuomo for the democratic nomination

guns fell silent on several battlefronts in 1988 
and hope emerged that mankind stood at the dawn of a more peaceful 
age it seemed as though the world had decided it had enough of war 
blood was still being shed in some parts of the globe but iran 
opted for a ceasefire in its 8yearold war with iraq the soviets 
began to withdraw troops from afghanistan and cuba angola and 
south africa chose to work towards peace in southwestern africa 
the year began with the ink barely dry on the first superpower 
treaty to eliminate a class of nuclear weapons before the year was 
out many missiles were destroyed un truce troops won the nobel 
peace prize president reagan met not once but twice with soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev who announced unilateral reductions in 
military strength 
forces have already emerged in the world that in one way or 
another stimulate the arrival of a period of peace gorbachev said 
in a speech to the un general assembly 
among other developments olympic athletes from both east and 
west met in the summer games for the first time in 12 years in 
seoul fears of north korean sabotage of the games proved unfounded 
and the two koreas took steps toward reconciliation 
the united nations also mediated peace talks on the western 
sahara between morocco which occupies most of the northwest african 
territory and the polisario independence movement 
southeast asias noncommunist nations japan and the 
unrecognized cambodian governmentinexile worked toward getting 
vietnamese occupying forces to withdraw from cambodia 
greek and turkish cypriot leaders met to discuss the possibility 
of reuniting the divided mediterranean island 
the plo said it recognized israels right to exist but the 
united states and israel said yasser arafats statements still did 
not go far enough meanwhile palestinians died at the rate of 
almost one a day in their antiisraeli uprising in the west bank and 
gaza strip 
and conflicts raged on in many other parts of the globe 
burma struggled through political turmoil 
central america simmered with continued fighting in el salvador 
and an uneasy truce in nicaragua 
moslem guerrillas continued their fight in afghanistan against 
the sovietallied government 
the sikhs still struggled for an independent homeland in india 
as did the tamils in sri lanka and other rebel groups in the sudan 
and ethiopia 
five thousand died in ethnic violence in burundi 
dozens died and thousands were forced to leave their homes 
because of domestic unrest in armenia and azerbaijan in the southern 
soviet union 
and in lebanon the streets of beirut remained a battleground 
the nation came closer than ever to formal partitioning into 
christian and moslem sectors and israeli raiders struck repeatedly 
against the south in retaliation for antiisrael guerrilla activity 
still the year wound to a close with a sense of hope 
there is a new mood of understanding and common sense un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said in accepting the 
peace prize dec 10 
we can and must achieve what we have dreamed of for so long 
that is to make the rule of law the standard rather than the

with tension high the countdown 
clock for the launch of space shuttle discovery ticked down to nine 
minutes and then was stopped deliberately to be held there for 10 
minutes while one man made the critical decision on whether to 
proceed toward liftoff 
this was no ordinary countdown it was to be americas first 
shuttle flight since the challenger explosion killed seven crew 
members 32 monthsture of the us space program was 
at stake 
memories of that tragedy were earlier the fu on everyones mind as 
five 
astronauts boarded discovery on the morning of sept 29 
one of the astronauts own navy capt robert crippen a veteran 
of four shuttle missions had the awesome responsibility to make the 
decision that would send them on their way or keep them on the 
ground for another day 
crippens assignment was a product of challenger no one man held 
sole authority to say go or nogo on any of the previous 26 
shuttle launches 
nasa decided it needed such a launch czar to avoid the 
communications failures that prevented the concerns of lowerlevel 
engineers about cold weather from reaching those making the decision 
to launch challenger the frigid temperature was cited by 
inve 
two months later the count reached nine minutes on the second 
postchallenger mission again high altitude winds were a problem 
this time they were too strong but they moderated gradually 
throughout the morning 
crippen looked at the latest data and made his decision 
dispatching atlantis and five astronauts on a secret defense 
department mission during which they reportedly released a 
sophisticated reconnaissance satellite it was another successful 
flight on nasas comeback trail 
the successes set the stage for a steppedup shuttle launch 
schedule in 1989 seven flights are planned including three 
scientifically prized missions that will deploy the hubble space 
telescope and dispatch payloads to venus and jupiter

for sale dozens and dozens of insolvent savings 
and loan institutions bleeding red ink to the tune of millions of 
dollars ultimate cost to clean up the industry between 50 billion 
and 100 billion 
contact the bush administration the new landlords 
if 1988 was a year of decision for the american electorate for a 
navy captain in the persian gulf for millions of amnestyseeking 
aliens and for countless others then it was also a year of 
indecision for those charged with resolving the multibilliondollar 
savings and loan crisis 
a result of economic recession here in the southwest highflying 
antics of speculators and developers and widespread fraud in the 
early 1980s the sampl problem has grown over the past few years from 
a milliondollar headache to a billiondollar migraine that may 
hinder budget and nonewtaxes planning by the bush administration 
the thrift industrys problems alone now demand funding on a 
massive scale said william seidman chairman of the federal 
deposit insurance corp and one of the nations top banking 
regulators that funding requirement appears to exceed the 
combined resources devoted to europe under the marshall plan and 
the bailouts of lockheed chrysler penn central and new york city 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates sampls launched 
a muchheralded southwest plan in 1988 to begin folding the 
losers into moneymaking thrifts 
but analysts have criticized the slow pace of the plan and the 
cost fiftyfour grossly insolvent sampls were sold but at least 164 
remained unresolved 
its fullsteam ahead and were going as fast as we can get 
the cases done said carl hoyle fhlbb spokesman 
federal prosecutors launched one of the biggest 
whitecollarcrime task forces in history taking over almost an 
entire floor of an fbi building in dallas but the pace of major 
indictments has been slow and the statute of limitations on bank 
fraud five years was hanging over the effort 
and despite the dire economic predictions and an indecision 
meter adding 1 billion a month to the cost of resolving the sampl 
problem congress opted to continue to study the problem rather 
than raise taxes to close out the cases 
we were calculating the cost of closure at 20 billion three 
years ago said industry analyst warren heller of veribanc inc 
they didnt have the 20 billion back then either

the united states historically a nation of youthful orientation 
is now thirtysomething and heading upward reports the census 
bureau 
if present trends continue census officials expect that half of 
all americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010 and half 
younger the agencys most recent estimate of median age was 321 
as of last july 1 the highest ever 
the 3544 age group is the fastestgrowing segment of the us 
population and the population segments aged 85 and over and 7584 
rank second and third in growth since 1980 the bureau said 
combining to increase the median age of the population are the 
maturing of the massive post world war ii baby boom and that 
generations relatively low birth rates which reduce the number of 
babies to pull down the numbers 
the median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in 
1950 then slipped back as the baby boom produced a bouncing crop of 
youngsters to lower the numbers 
it took until the 1980 census to hit 30 again edged up to 317 
as of 1986 and is expected to climb to 33 by 1990 365 by 2000 and 
39 by the year 2010 according to the new projections from the 
census bureau 
despite the aging of the population however the report 
anticipates that the socalled dependency ratio will decline 
that ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 compared 
to the number of people of working age in between the younger and 
older groups are most likely to depend on those working 
the 1986 ratio of 622 dependents per 100 workers is expected to 
slip to 567 by the year 2010 with the low birth rate reducing the 
number of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds to 
the older group 
while there have been reports of increases in the total number of 
births in the last few years that is because the giant baby boom 
generation is largely in its prime childbearing years the rate of 
births per 1000 remains well below that of the postworld war ii 
period 
the repercussions of the baby boom are many and varied 
census bureau statistician louisa miller said they will continue 
to affect the united states for many years to come 
they are now at the age where they have more discretionary income 
and the effect can be seen in the nations culture and marketing 
she said 
the generations arrival spurred a boom in sales of baby 
products it then proceeded to overwhelm the school system 
following up with creation of a national orientation toward teenage 
music and styles 
now as the baby boomers set up more and smaller households they 
are prompting a boom in housing sales and household goods marketing 
experts say 
further down the road once they begin to reach retirement age 
they will obviously have a great effect on the direction the country 
takes miller added 
the census projections show the northeast remaining the oldest 
section of the country with the median age for that region 
increasing from 336 in 1986 to 403 in 2010 
the south will be second in 2010 at a median age of 384 up from 
314 in 1986 the midwest will mature from 316 to 388 and the west 
will go from 310 to 374 
florida will remain the state with the highest median age and 
utah will still be the youngest state according to the projections 
florida with a median age of 360 in 1986 will age to 453 
utahs median will rise from 255 to 276 leaving it the only state 
with a median age below 30 years thanks largely to a continuing 
high birth rate 
in the 1986 estimates no state had a median over 40 but several 
were under 30 including besides utah alaska idaho louisiana 
mississippi new mexico texas and wyoming 
in 2010 not only florida will have topped 40 other states with 
median ages above that milestone will include arkansas connecticut 
iowa maine nevada new jersey oregon pennsylvania rhode island 
tennessee washington and west virginia

the whole theme of this meeting is its never too late to start 
prevention koop said at a workshop on health promotion and aging 
old age is not a disease and there are many oldsters who are 
disease free said the 71yearold koop you dont necessarily 
have to have your kidneys fail you dont necessarily have to have 
dementia my plea would be to separate old age and disease they 
dont necessarily go together 
even though the us population is aging he said it is not 
becoming less healthy 
as we see people who are now in middleage come along into the 
graying years they are going to be far healthier than this 
generation was when it entered the 65andolder group he said 
these are the people who are jogging and swimming and hiking 
these are the people who are snacking on salad and yogurt these are 
the people who are wearing sensible shoes they have stopped 
smoking they have given up hard liquor they wear seat belts they 
understand the things they can do to preserve the quality of life 
and the function they already have

the returns are spectacular for lions club 
members average age 82 who give their time to collect old 
newspapers for recycling in this retirement community 
their efforts allow local charities to save an estimated 80000 
each year in rent send dozens of handicapped kids to a special camp 
at no cost to their families and provide drug education in nearby 
elementary schools 
the host lions and nine other lions clubs in the sun city area 
earn about 200000 annually by collecting bundling transporting 
and selling the old newspapers that residents would otherwise throw 
in the trash 
the newspapers pile up at the rate of 35 tons a day in the winter 
time dropping to about 18 tons a day in the summer when many of 
the retirement community residents leave their suburban phoenix 
homes for cooler climes 
in 1987 the 10 lions clubs collected 335000 from the sale of 
the old newspapers and after paying 132000 for loading shipping 
string to tie the bundles and leases for their collection sites 
earned a net profit from the newspaper recycling of just over 
200000 
it may not be as profitable this year in november 1987 old 
newsprint was selling for 5470 per ton this year because of 
increased competition from city governments who have turned to 
recycling and a cutback in export sales of recyclable paper the 
market price is down to 2840 per ton 
sam higginbotham 79 who retired about 30 years ago started the 
project 20 years ago when host was the only lions club here as more 
clubs were formed higginbotham involved them in the project 
gene gravlin 72 is running the project now with help from 
george oldham 69 
higginbotham was one of the first residents of the retirement 
community started by del webb buying in before the first house was 
completed 
the good lords been good to me and this is a way i can give 
something back higginbotham says its only fair to do that 
gravlin who ran the marketing division of a major shoe 
manufacturer before retiring says its a good way to keep active he 
says the retirees have been through the pressure years of earning a 
living and now that they have time available they can turn their 
attention to helping others 
helping others is a moral obligation that every human being 
has he says some accept it and some dont 
oldham who ran a department store in kansas before he retired 
and a mens shop in colorado after his retirement is getting set to 
take over the operation 
we return something to the community he says that gives 
us a good feeling were not just sitting around 
higginbotham was involved in construction railroading real 
estate and the hotelmotel industry before moving to sun city 
we built three buildings with the money we got for the 
newspapers he says del webb co donated the land but the lions 
paid the 330000 cost of construction 
weve got a dozen charities that weve given the space to for 
1 a year he says a financial consultant told us three months 
ago that judging by what office space is renting for were saving 
the charities about 80000 a year in rent thats 80000 more they 
can use to help others 
money from the newspaper recycling is added to funds collected by 
other lions clubs in arizona to support their special mountain camp 
for handicapped children 
there is one counselor for every two handicapped camper 
gravlin says its a great experience for them 
newspaper recycling profits are also invested in el mirage 
schools for an antidrug program that gravlin says is credited by 
school officials with reducing the dropout rate in the distrct

millions of mature americans are spending their time 
independence and money on traveling in recreation vehicles reports 
a national association for the retired 
the american association of retired persons aarp estimates that 
nine million senior americans use recreation vehicles each year 
mature travelers are good candidates for rv travel says ron 
noe member services specialist for aarp because many have the 
time discretionary funds and desire to see and experience the small 
towns big cities popular attractions and natural beauty of the 
united states 
rvs provide them with an enjoyable comfortable and economical 
way to take it all in and enjoy the social benefits of camaraderie 
on the road 
a university of michigan survey of the recreation vehicle 
consumer reported that nearly 10 percent of heads of households over 
50 who own vehicles own 30 percent of the rvs in use

older drivers pose a greater risk of being 
involved in accidents but driving should not be restricted solely on 
the basis of age says a recent government study 
the study by the national research council says roadway signs and 
markings should be redesigned to better meet the needs of older 
drivers and that screening should be improved to identify impaired 
drivers of all ages 
the report urges states to tighten their screening programs and 
issue restricted licenses in some cases such as limiting certain 
applicants to daytime driving only 
it criticized a movement in some states to allow drivers licenses 
to be renewed by mail without drivers being required to undergo 
vision tests at least every four years 
but the study concluded that age alone is a poor predictor of 
the driving performance of any individual although 
acknowledging after age 75 a driver is about twice as likely per 
mile driven to be involved in a crash as middleaged drivers 
the national research council panel composed of experts 
assembled by the national academy of sciences spent two years 
examining questions about transportation and the elderly 
it said problems of meeting the transportation needs of older 
citizens will increase in the years ahead as the numer of people 
over 75 increases and more elderly people live in the suburbs where 
less public transportation is available 
the states are not prepared to handle the growing number of 
very old drivers or to identify those at high risk of accident 
involvement the study concluded 
most older persons will probably be quite capable and safe 
drivers but current statistics indicate that drivers 75 and over 
are more at risk of crash involvement than the average driver 
thes facts must be acknowledged even though there is no 
justification for restricting driving on the basis of age alone 
furthermore the panel said elderly people are more likely to 
suffer serious or fatal injuries than other drivers in accidents of 
similar severity 
the study said elderly people especially those 75 years or 
older often have problems reading traffic signs seeing clearly at 
night gauging traffic flow when merging into traffic or making left 
turns and turning their heads when backing their vehicles 
but when examined in terms of incidents the problem that older 
persons represent to overall traffic safety is small relative to 
that of the teenage driver the committee wrote 
the panel encouraged older drivers to buy automobiles equipped 
with air bags the devices that inflate automatically to protect the 
head and upper torso in a crash 
the committee also urged the use of seat belts but suggested 
manufacturers could make them more comfortable and easier to use it 
also suggested that roadway markings and signs be made larger or 
brighter it said the current road sign standard currently exceeds 
the visual ability of about 40 percent of drivers who are 65 years 
or older 
even with various design improvements in the coming years an 
increasing number of older people will require public transportation 
communities should improve public transit for the elderly 
develop subsidized taxi programs and construct walkways in suburban 
areas if the transportation requirements of the elderly are to be 
met the study said

older adults generally do not have to give up driving because of 
aging changes in vision but they should recognize their 
limitations advises the american optometric association 
more than 37 million americans over 55 years old drive and 
according to the national safety council they have a poorer accident 
record than drivers in their middle years 
failure to yield rightofway improper lane changes passing and 
turning are among the most common traffic violations committed by 
older drivers national studies have shown 
according to the optometrists changes in vision may interfere 
with older drivers abilities to see and recognize what is on the 
road ahead to see effectively at night to see against the glare of 
oncoming headlights and to recover quickly from glare 
other factors include faulty judging of distances between 
themselves and other vehicles or objects and the detection of 
movement from the side while looking straight ahead 
suggestions from the optometrists on how older drivers can 
compensate for vision changes include 
avoid driving at dusk 
when driving at night reduce speed try to limit driving to 
welllighted or familiar roads and keep headlights taillights and 
turn signals clean and properly adjusted 
take time to adjust to a new eyeglass or contact lens 
prescription before driving 
avoid frames with wide side pieces that may block side vision 
wear quality sunglasses on sunny or bright cloudy days but 
never wear sunglasses or fashiontinted lenses when driving at 
night 
confine driving to places speeds and hours in which they are 
comfortable and competent 
avoid pulling off alongside the highway if necessary use the 
cars fourway emergency flashers 
keep windshield and rear windows clean inside and out and 
replace worn wiper blades promptly 
keep rear view and outside mirrors clean and properly adjusted 
be aware of their limitations

elderly americans living alone were more likely 
to still be alive two years later than those who made their home 
with someone other than a spouse a government researcher has 
reported 
more than threequarters of them also were still living 
independently after two years said dr mary grace kovar of the 
national center for health statistics 
her findings are based on interviews in 1984 and 1986 with people 
who had been aged 70 and over in 1984 
the most important thing is the stability most of these 
people two years later are still living in the community those 
who were living alone are still alone and those with someone else 
are still with someone else kovar said in a telephone interview 
as you would expect because these people are 72 or older 
death rates are high but relatively few of them are in nursing 
homes she said 
of nearly 64 million elderly americans living alone in 1984 
898 percent were still alive two years later the study found 
by comparison 873 percent of those living with others survived 
two years those living with a spouse did nearly as well as those 
alone 890 percent surviving but of those living with someone 
else friends or family only 843 percent were still alive 
people living with brothers and sisters tended to live longer 
but that may have been because longevity ran in the family kovar 
speculated 
of those who had been on their own in 1984 778 percent were 
still living by themselves in 1986 she found about 74 percent of 
them had moved in with someone else most often family and 46 
percent were in an institution 
it certainly appears that for some of them life is better two 
years later kovar said some have remarried and when we asked 
those who had moved why we got answers ranging from health to 
being nearer to children to spending the summer in maine and winter 
in florida one she commented even cited lower golf fees for 
moving 
a major factor in continued independence is likely that those 
living alone were more healthy at the start of the study she 
concluded in the report aging in the eighties people living 
alone two years later

more than 40 percent of nursing homes failed to 
meet sanitary standards for food and nearly 30 percent failed to 
meet standards for maintaining residents personal cleanliness 
according to the federal governments first consumer guide to 
nursing homes 
the survey also found that more than onefourth of the nursing 
homes do not administer drugs properly 
however dr william l roper chief of the health care financing 
administration that compiled and released the statistics cautioned 
against reading more into the figures than is warranted 
this is not the ultimate report card for nursing homes around 
the country roper told reporters 
he said the metunmet criteria for each of the 32 categories 
included in the statebystate reports contains no measure of 
severity and represented a onetime snapshot of conditions at 
the nursing homes most recent unannounced inspection to some 
degree he said it relied on the subjective judgment of the 
inspector 
at the same time roper defended release of the report against 
industry criticism that it would mislead consumers 
one complaint was for example that a nursing home might be 
given an unmet mark on proper administration of medication if 
one patient was five minutes late getting his or her medicine 
if one person was five minutes late im sure they would not 
have been dinged in the survey roper said what were looking 
at what the surveyors look at is the pattern of care over time 
we are not in the business of making arbitrary bureaucratic 
judgments we are trying to evaluate what is really happening to 
people in that nursing home 
he added 
what we are looking for is not nursing home providers that 
barely scrape by were looking for people who are good providers 
consistently over time 365 days a year and i have to believe that 
if thats where a nursing home operator has his or her nursing home 
they are not going to be worried about being dinged on some trivial 
point 
the 75volume guide shows how each of the 15000 nursing homes 
fared on 32 health safety and care standards based on periodic 
inspections by state agencies about 2400 of the 15000 received 
passing marks in all 32 categories 
according to the survey nearly 43 percent of the homes failed to 
meet sanitary standards for food almost 30 percent failed to meet 
standards for maintaining residents personal cleanliness and 29 
percent failed to administer drugs according to doctors orders 
however the report also said that only a small percentage of the 
nursing homes failed to meet standards in many other categories 
overall among skilled homes the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 
only 10 categories 
paul willging executive vice president of the american health 
care association which represents more than 9000 nursing homes 
said the report is misleading it is going to confuse the 
public by making it appear conditions are worse than they are he 
said that something like a cracked egg in a refrigerator could lead 
to a nursing home failing to meet a care standard 
but elma holder executive director of the national citizens 
coalition on nursing home reform said we think the national 
statistics are misleading conditions are worse

the focus on alzheimers disease generally is on the patients 
not their families 
but a new program uses coloring books a mascot dog and movies to 
show elementary school pupils how the debilitating ailment can be 
battled for a few hours the students put aside their reading 
writing and arithmetic to look at a disease that may not afflict 
them for 60 years if at all 
the purpose of the effort is not so much to understand how the 
disease works but to show how the loved ones of an alzheimers 
sufferer can with patience helpful advice and love minimize the 
worst of the diseases effects 
alzheimers characterized by memory loss and other dementia 
afflicts an estimated 5 million mostly elderly americans 
the southern massachusetts town of westport which is in the 
third year of a federal health and human services grant intended to 
promote community programs developed the daylong seminar on 
alzheimers after meetings between school officials and william 
connolly of new jerseybased sandoz pharmaceuticals corp who 
spends summers there sandoz manufactures hydergine a drug that can 
ease some symptoms of alzheimers in milder cases 
westport changed the emphasis because of mounting evidence that 
children are often acutely aware of and confused by the decline of a 
loved one 
a coloring book titled helping grandma by westport high 
school art teacher betsey macdonald told the story of a grandmother 
who gradually begins to show signs of memory loss 
children are often kept in the dark about aging said 
macdonald they automatically think that old means sick but 
children are wonderfully resilient and surprisingly insightful when 
spoken to directly on the subject 
the point of the coloring book geared toward elementary school 
children is to teach them understanding and to teach them that 
what she needs is support 
also mature wellbehaved dogs from an animal shelter can 
provide some stability and love for an alzheimers sufferer 
connolly said jeff a black and white mongrel from a rhode island 
animal shelter has become the national poster dog for the socalled 
humananimal bonding campaign and he travels with connolly to 
events on the subject 
the alzheimers event was tried out earlier this year in 
bloomington ind

women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by 
regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives but 
calcium supplements taken after menopause probably wont be 
effective researchers say 
in a study in the journal of the american medical association 
researchers said the key factors in bone density among 
postmenopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally 
occurring hormone estrone 
moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do 
not appear to prevent osteoporosis a frequently debilitating 
disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner 
and more brittle they found 
swallowing calcium pills at 50 years of age probably is not 
going to make your bones thicker said dr lewis kuller of the 
epidemiology department at the university of pittsburghs school of 
public health 
kuller a coauthor of the study involving 174 healthy 
postmenopausal women over a fouryear period also said there is 
no evidence that moderate exercise in these women increased their 
bone density 
the most important message is that an adequate calcium 
intake during childhood adolescence postadolescence and the 
reproductive years is probably a very important part of good health 
and will probably help prevent bone fracture and osteoporosis he 
said 
osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and can lead to 
bone fractures and spinal problems like dowagers hump some 
estimates project that by age 70 onequarter of the women in north 
america will have suffered a fracture related to the disease

use the rubber end of a pencil or pen to push the buttons of a 
telephone or turn the pages of a book 
use an electric stapler to help reduce fatigue in hands wrists 
and shoulders 
if you arent up to typing use a dictating machine 
these are among suggestions for office workers who suffer from 
arthritis to help ease their work the advice comes from frances 
mason who has had rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis for nearly 20 
years and is now a volunteer counselor for the new york chapter of 
the arthritis foundation 
until recently she said in a recent issue of aimplus an 
arthritis information magazine people with arthritis found it 
very difficult to keep on working not because they didnt want to 
but because the attitude of society in generally has been that a 
disabled person just couldnt do the job 
while attitudes have changed she said and many disabled persons 
are finding less difficulty in finding and keeping a job some 
people with arthritis may find that their condition does somewhat 
limit their abilities to accomplish as much as they would like 
she offers some other suggestions to ease that problem 
conserve energy by planning ahead schedule the more demanding 
tasks for times of day when you are feeling your best 
make sure your chair provides firm support for your lower back 
and has armrests to help reduce fatigue in your shoulders the chair 
should be high enough to get in and out of without strain and low 
enough so you dont have to hunch over while working 
to ease strain on your neck place text on a tying rack rather 
than keeping it flat beside your desk

collecting from toy soldiers to vintage perfume bottles is one 
way for grandparents to share a hobby or activity with their 
grandchildren

bond between you and your grandchild says stephen roedler 
director of the manhattan arts and antiques center in new york 
whats more when you explore the past together your 
grandchild gets a window into former times and can better appreciate 
your world too 
the collection can also encourage other activities he says both 
with the grandchild and on your own it could mean enrolling in 
courses or seminars and sharing the learning with the grandchildren 
museums and galleries magazines and journals are other 
resources he says 
roedler says there are numerous local clubs for collectors where 
news and information is exchanged

when it comes to shopping mature consumers prefer the 
oldfashioned way walking around the stores according to a baylor 
university study 
the baylor researchers said the gray marketers 55 years or 
older like to see what that are buying before they part with their 
money and thus go to the stores rather than order from mailed 
catalogs or television or telephone 
many of them actually prefer the social aspects of going 
shopping says marjorie caballero executive director of the 
center for professional selling at baylors hankamer school of 
business waco texas 
they like walking the shops and meeting people getting out of 
the house is something they look forward to she says 
she conducted the yearlong survey with baylor professor lawrence 
chonko chairman of the marketing department and former baylor 
faculty member james lumpkin now a marketing professor at the 
university of mississippi 
the study direct marketing to the elderly sources of 
dissatisfaction and remedies was funded by the andrus foundation 
of the american association of retired persons 
sixty percent of the more than 4000 people surveyed were in the 
65plus age category 20 percent in the 5564 age group and 20 
percent were adults up to age 54 more than 2500 responded to the 
survey 
the study also found that the elderly strongly prefer the 
personal touch from sales people and dislike high pressure 
sales tactics 
the survey had some advice for those doing the selling as well 
be patient with the elderly caballero suggested dont 
assume because of their age that they cannot understand complex 
information they grasp things just like everybody else but it may 
take them longer 
dont give them too much clutter to wade through their 
eyesight may not be quite as good use larger type in your printed 
material slow down in your approach simplify and above all 
never think of the elderly as senile or cranky in their ways 
she says 
they resent these stereotypes

after the children grow up and leave home there may be a problem 
left over what to do about the piano 
dont let it just sit in a corner of the living room gathering 
dust says the national piano foundation which suggests parents of 
adult children who have left the nest can find many enjoyable ways 
to keep the piano an important part of their homes 
a piano is not only a beautiful piece of furniture but it 
represents an investment both in time and money according to the 
foundation 
there are a lot of memories attached to our piano says paul 
krouse a publisher from lake forest ill who bought the family 
piano with his wife anne when they were first married even 
though my eldest daughter our piano enthusiast has moved out of 
the area i wouldnt dream of giving it up 
although the krouses are not piano players themselves they have 
kept it in frequent use by hiring pianists to play at several 
parties theyve hosted and they have a few friends who play the 
piano when they visit 
one way to enjoy your piano after the kids have stopped playing 
suggests the foundation is to take lessons yourself 
james sevitz a retired mechanical engineer in huntington beach 
calif recently began piano lessons marking the first time hes 
studied piano in nearly 50 years and the first time his piano has 
been used regularly since his stepdaughter moved out of the house 
when i retired i had all this newfound free time says 
sevitz and the piano wasnt getting much use so i decided it was 
a good time to learn to play something ive wanted to do all my 
life 
sevitz signed up for a piano class in beginning techniques with 
allen giles head of the piano department at golden west college in 
huntington beach 
giles teaches many adult students as well as the colleges 
regular student body and finds that playing piano is something for 
which emptynesters and recent retirees are perfectly suited 
older people make excellent piano students says giles 
those who are retired of course have a lot of free time too 
but even working adults can fit piano study into their schedules and 
budgets

depending on where they work aging whitecollar workers face a 
job outlook ranging from crashandburn to a possible triple 
career ladder according to a study of 25 fortune 500 companies 
the state of the economy and the industry the company 
personality the nature of corporate leadership and the 
organizational structure were among the factors shaping company 
responses to the university of michigan survey 
all of these factors can change over time so you cannot lock a 
company into a particular behavior pattern says barbara hirshorn 
research fellow at the universitys population studies center 
it is clear however that a company under economic stress is 
much more likely to consider actions hurtful to older workers 
typical corporate responses indicated five distinct company 
policies toward elder employees those over 55 hirshorn notes they 
were characterized as proactive performancefocused at 
crosspurposes positive meansnegative ends and 
antagonistic 
proactive companies deal most effectively with older 
workers she explains planning strategies that build in options for 
workers at all ages as well as options for the company as a whole 
dual or even triple career ladders are not uncommon in 
proactive companies she adds they encourage lateral career 
changes and intentionally reassign workers at all ages to relieve 
boredom and stress 
hirshorn says performancefocused companies try to ignore age 
as a criterion altogether consistently applying a reliable 
evaluation system to all workers 
but occasionally companies are at crosspurposes in their 
policies she notes 
the company ethos may hold older workers in high regard and 
managers may even design some effective policies for them she 
says at the same time they are designing others that have an 
unfortunate effectthey dont coordinate policies and plan for 
change 
an example of such crosspurposes would be companies that offer 
limited opportunities for promotion or lateral moves and massive 
sweetened early retirement programs 
some companies are actively antagonistic toward older workers 
and the hostility shows up in a variety of policies hirshorn found 
i came across one insurance company where age bias ran deeply 
throughout the ranks she recalls those who refused to relocate 
were fired and since so few employees over 55 were promoted many 
older workers left

much of the gi generation that fought in world 
war ii and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is 
retiring in relative comfort a florida researcher has reported 
more than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double the 
poverty level and 12 percent form an elite with income from at 
least three sources according to charles f longino of the 
university of miami 
but elderly affluence isnt spread evenly across the nation 
longino reported in american demographics magazine 
there are a cluster of states with a large share of the 
comfortably retired longino said in analyzing 1980 census data 
the most recent information available with sufficient detail for the 
study 
connecticut florida hawaii nevada and new jersey had many of 
the comfortably retired while the pension elite made strong 
showings in connecticut and washington longino found 
the poverty level for a family of four was 8414 in 1980 
the world war ii gis reaped the benefits of government programs 
that provided educations and home loans costofliving escalators 
for their social security benefits and federal laws protecting 
private pensions longino noted in addition many were able to 
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy 
longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study those 
aged 55 to 64 6574 and 75 and over in 1980 he termed them the gi 
generation after the term government issue which became a 
popular tag for soldiers in the 1940s 
just over half 511 percent of those in the 6574 age group 
were listed as comfortable and 123 percent were in the elite 
elite 
for the younger group 591 percent were comfortable and 47 
percent were in the elite they were less likely to qualify as elite 
since few were receiving social security in addition to other 
retirement benefits 
the oldest group listed 375 percent as comfortable and 85 
percent as elite few in this group had incomegenerating assets and 
most completed a large share of their working lives before world war 
ii when pension benefits were less common and lower 
longino found the confortably retired of the 6574 age group in 
such resort and retirement states as florida nevada and new jersey 
in connecticut where many new york executives have retired and 
hawaii 
hawaii has a large asian population where extended families are 
more common a situation which boosts the household income measure

spains major trade unions unhappy over the 
economic austerity of prime minister felipe gonzalezs government 
are taking to the streets to demand a bigger share in the countrys 
new prosperity 
a broad spectrum of society including autoworkers actresses 
soccer players and sportswriters say they will support wednesdays 
general strike called by the socialist general workers union and the 
communistdominated workers commission 
strike organizers say they want to bring the country of 38 
million to a standstill to force a change in the governments 
economic policies the unions also called for a demonstration on 
friday in madrid and said if the government does not respond more 
demonstrations will follow 
since taking office in december 1982 gonzalez has encouraged 
moderate wage increases to stem inflation prod economic growth and 
create jobs to cut spains 193 percent unemployment rate the 
highest in western europe 
due partly to lower wage increases backed in the past by the 
workers union spain has been booming since 1986 
more than 600000 new jobs have been created although growing 
numbers of youths and women entering the market have kept 
unemployment high 
annual inflation has dropped from 145 percent to 51 percent 
there have been reports of huge profits by spanish banks and 
corporations 
now the unions are demanding a share of the wealth for workers 
who sacrificed higher pay in the past few years to help pull spain 
out of a 10year economic recession 
the causes of the economic problems included the sharp rise in 
oil prices after the oil embargo of the early 1970s when spains 
energy needs were met by imported crude and protectionism under 
francos 19391975 rule 
what set off the strike call was the council of ministers 
passage oct 28 of a youth employment plan it allows businesses who 
hire 18 to 25yearolds for six to eight months at wages below the 
minimum to reduce their contributions to the government social 
security plan 
the government said the plan will create incentives to hire 
youths an estimated 40 percent of the age group have never held a 
job 
unions say the plan exploits young people benefits businesses 
and jeopardizes jobs and pay for older workers 
the nationwide general strike would be the first in spain since 
october 1934 when a leftistinspired work stoppage turned into an 
insurrection that was put down by troops commanded by gen francisco 
franco under orders from the thenconservative government of the 
second republic 
analysts do not expect violence this time but the feud between 
union leaders and top socialist party officials has taken on the 
hallmarks of a dramatic showdown 
nicolas redondo head of the general workers union has compared 
remarks from socialist party executive jose maria benegas 
criticizing the planned strike to comments by nazi propaganda chief 
joseph goebbels 
gonzalez in turn has accused the workers union of sliding 
toward the red falling under the influence of the more combative 
communist union 
when rightwing and centrist opposition parties with socialist 
support tried to pass a motion to urge the unions to call off the 
strike two small leftist parties voted against it approval 
required a unanimous vote 
newspapers described the incident as a sign of the 
ineffectiveness of the parties and parliament in breaking the 
uniongovernment impasse 
after uniongovernment wage talks broke down in the autumn the 
unions began accusing the gonzalez government of arrogance and lack 
of social sensitivity 
in a recent news conference gonzalez acknowledged that some 
arrogance could have creeped into his government but said this was 
no reason to stage a general strike

the decision to sell off tenneco oil co was a 
difficult one but the mammoth 73 billion sale still leaves 
tenneco inc with five profitable businesses 
after the sale the houstonbased company remains the citys 
largest public company with 1988 revenue close to 13 billion and 
projected revenue of about 14 billion in 1990 
i think it will surprise a lot of people to realize that we are 
as big as this without the oil company tenneco chairman james l 
ketelsen said in a wideranging interview published in sundays 
editions of the houston chronicle 
ketelsen said the tenneco oil sale was difficult not only because 
of the impact on the nearly 9000 oil company and corporate 
employees involved but also because of tennecos new identity as a 
diversified industrial corporation 
the companys other businesses include shipbuilding automotive 
chemicals packaging and natural gas pipeline operations which are 
all making money 
one business making money is case ih the construction and farm 
equipment company that tenneco formed in 1985 when ji case acquired 
the agricultural implement division of international harvester co 
for 513 million 
since then tenneco has plowed more than 700 million in capital 
expenditures into the subsidiary case ih has become the companys 
biggest business but it has yet to show a profit 
ketelsen has designated 1989 as the makeorbreak year for case 
ih if the profit are not there case ih could have a for sale 
sign hanging on its corporate door 
but roger khlopin of smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
doubts that tenneco has plans to divest any other operations 
nothing this company has said has led anyone to believe they 
would sell anything other than exploration and production he 
said theyre building up not ripping down 
although case ihs performance has fallen short of expectations 
ketelsen said the harvester acquisition and the subsequent 
consolidation and reorganization of case ih were planned as a 
fiveyear project 
what the company did not count on was the recession in the us 
farm belt that resulted in north american tractor sales falling from 
90000 in 1984 to 61000 in 1986 and 1987 or last summers drought 
that made many farmers postpone new equipment purchases 
to help matters tenneco installed a new management team at the 
case ih headquarters in racine wis the new president james k 
ashford previously headed tenneco automotive which more than 
doubled its operating income during his five years as the top 
executive 
tennecos other business segments are demonstrating growth and 
improved profit at rates ranging from modest to booming ketelsen 
said 
natural gas transmission is tennecos original business and its 
second largest source of revenue after agricultural and construction 
equipment since the natural gas transmission industry is mature 
overall growth opportunities are limited he said 
nevertheless the tennessee gas pipeline group is a consistently 
strong earner and supplier of cash flow ketelsen said its 
20000mile system from texas and the gulf of mexico to new england 
serves one of the two areas where demand for natural gas is growing 
increases in federal defense spending since 1981 have helped 
tennecos newport news shipbuilding and dry dock co grow at a 
compound annual rate of 156 percent but ketelsen acknowledged that 
defense expenditures probably will be cut in the bush administration 
an 8 billion backlog that includes construction of two aircraft 
carriers and two submarines along with future contracts for 
modernization and upgrading of existing us navy vessels should 
ensure at least incremental growth the tenneco chairman said 
packaging corporation of america offers the best potential for 
solid growth ketelsen said although it is the secondsmallest 
tenneco unit by revenues pca should have the secondhighest 
operating profits for 1988 and should grow at an annual rate of 15 
percent to 20 percent over the next five years he said 
cardboard boxes are pcas primary product ketelsen said 65 
million of pcas projected 1988 operating income of 220 million 
will come from specialty products the company did not make five 
years ago 
albright amp wilson ltd of london a specialty chemicals producer 
and tennecos smallest subsidiary should grow an average of 20 
percent for the next five years the chairman said 
albright amp wilson is a major supplier of phosphates for 
detergents soaps and shampoos primarily in europe and is the 
worlds largest producer of sodium chlorate used to bleach paper 
products 
tenneco automotive has grown at a 13 percent rate for the past 
five years and is the leading manufacturer of mufflers exhaust 
systems and shock absorbers for the replacement parts and 
accessories market 
tennecos other two major business segments natural gas 
pipelines and shipbuilding also will be solid performers though 
not as the others ketelsen said

retail sales fell by a largerthanexpected 05 
percent in november as producer prices rose 03 percent less than 
forecast the government said monday raising hopes that higher 
interest rates were slowing down consumer spending and inflation 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was down 75 
points or 04 percent to 17428 after the department of trade and 
industry issued its two reports late in the morning but the index 
had been down as much as 118 points shortly before the economic 
figures were released the pound held steady at about 18405 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson pushed up interest rates 
to 13 percent from a decade low of 75 percent in june to discourage 
consumer spending and curb inflation which has picked up to an 
annual rate of 64 percent from 33 percent in january 
private economists had forecast a rise or fall of 02 percent in 
retail sales and a 04percent gain in producer prices 
there are fairly clear signs that growth in retail sales is a 
lot slower than it was earlier this year said economist gwyn 
hacche of the london investment firm james capel and co its in 
the right direction 
but he added i wouldnt expect there to be clear evidence of 
the kind of slowdown we want probably for a few months really the 
growth has got to come down quite a lot further 
retail sales were up 52 percent from november 1987 the 
department of trade and industry said 
by comparison retail sales volume rose 20 percent in october 
from the previous month and was up 62 percent from a year earlier 
producer output prices or prices of manufactured goods were up 
48 percent from november 1987 the department reported 
by comparison output prices rose 04 percent in october from the

of working rigs dropped by 18 last week the count dropped by six 
to total 905 
a year ago the count was 1181 baker hughes said monday 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity

merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states the biggest gains were posted 
by new mexico with seven additional rigs followed by california 
three kansas ohio and wyoming two each and north dakota

churchs fried chicken embroiled in a battle 
to prevent a hostile takeover by popeyes famous fried chicken and 
biscuits announced today it would immediately close 120 of its 
stores whose losses have totaled 74 million in the past year 
our decision to close certain unprofitable stores within the 
churchs system will have a positive effect on cash flow ernest 
renaud president and chief financial officer of the san 
antoniobased company said in a statement 
the closings are an important part of our plan to improve 
profitability of churchs he said the closings will be in 20 
states 
in the statement renaud said the closings would allow for 
between 22 million and 27 million in writeoffs for this fiscal 
year 
churchs which has gone through several management changes in 
the past two years currently has about 1500 restaurants and is 
second in the fastfood chicken industry behind kentucky fried 
chicken popeyes is third in the industry with about 725 restaurants 
churchs expects to see sales this year of 520 million down 
from 570 million in 1986 and 633 million in 1984 
popeyes is expected to have sales of 485 million this year 
the restaurant closings come at a time when churchs is in the 
midst of a takeover battle with new orleansbased popeyes which has 
made an 8pershare 290 million unsolicited bid for churchs 
churchs board of directors has rejected the offer as inadequate 
the company also claims that former churchs employees gave popeyes 
confidential information which it used in the takeover bid 
a federal judge in new orleans earlier this month issued an order 
preventing popeyes owner al copeland from buying churchs stock 
until 10 working days after popeyes revealed information on its 
buyout offer 
popeyes first takeover deadline was nov 30 but has been 
extended to friday copeland says he already owns 32 percent of 
churchs stock and has been offered 146 million shares or about 
406 percent of the 359 million outstanding shares of churchs 
stock 
meanwhile churchs has been courting offers from other 
investors but also has become the subject of a classaction suit 
filed by a shareholder who claims the offer by popeyes is adequate 
and that the churchs boards refusal to accept it could cost 
shareholders huge profits

societe generale de belgique belgiums 
largest holding company monday forecast a loss of between 500 
million and 2 billion belgian francs between 135 and 54 million 
this year due to restructuring costs 
but the company said it expected much better results next year 
possibly more than doubling the 3611 billion francs or 975 
million profit made last year 
sgb said in a statement that its operating results would have 
totaled about 10 billion francs or 2702 million in 1988 if 
restructuring costs were not subtracted 
those costs however were estimated to be between 105 billion 
francs and 12 billion francs or the equivalent of 2838 to 3243 
million wiping out the profit and leaving the estimated loss of 500 
million to 2 billion francs 
the company predicted that it would post operating results of 
about 12 billion francs in 1989 but declined to give a specific net 
profit forecast because the extent of restructuring costs was 
uncertain for that year 
meanwhile in paris french company suez now the leading sgb 
shareholder announced that that compagnie generale delectricite 
would sell its 33 percent stake in sgb in order to acquire a 28 
percent holding 
belgian groupe ag second sgb shareholder confirmed that 
sodecom the holding company which contained 42 percent of sgb was 
being divided into three new units 
one will be fully controlled by suez a second by groupe ag and 
the two companies will share the third 
groupe ag said that an effort will be made to return 12 percent 
of sgb shares to the public only two percent are currently traded 
and an additional 5 percent is being placed with institutional 
investors

an investment partnership offered almost 700 
million cash today for pennwalt corp a large philadelphiabased 
chemical concern that makes industrial products such as caustic soda 
and chlorine 
the new york investor group centaur partners which already owns 
127 percent of pennwalts approximately 76 million shares 
outstanding said it would pay other stockholders 100 a share for 
the rest 
pennwalts stock rocketed higher on the new york stock exchange 
after the announcement from 83 at fridays close to 98 a share 
around midday today 
company officials declined to comment on the offer but pennwalt 
a rumored takeover target for months had taken several defensive 
steps to thwart any unwelcome suitors including the 460 million 
sale of pharmaceutical operations three months ago and a stock 
repurchase completed last week 
we believe that our offer represents a fair price and is in the 
best interest of pennwalts shareholders centaur principals abbey 
j butler and melvyn j estrin said in a letter to pennwalt 
management 
the partners who claimed to have assembled bank financing to 
make the purchase said they were willing to negotiate any aspect of 
their offer including price 
at the same time the partners indicated they would resort to 
more hostile means to buy pennwalt saying they had moved to 
invalidate the companys socalled poison pill shareholders 
rights plan with a lawsuit in philadelphia federal court 
the poison pill which many companies have adopted is designed 
to make an unwanted takeover prohibitively expensive 
pennwalt produces and markets industrial chemicals and is a 
leading maker of chlorinated plastic commonly used in building 
cable insulation the company which had sales of nearly 12 
billion last year also has operations in mineral and petroleum 
processing 
in august the company sold its pharmaceutical unit maker of 
products such as allerest allergy relief pills and desenex foot 
powder to the british firm fisons pennwalt also repurchased about 
376 percent of its outstanding stock as part of a plan to boost the 
price 
those moves were seen partly as a defensive move against centaur 
principals butler and estrin financiers who had indicated they 
might make an offer for pennwalt 
butler 51 is former chairman of financial world magazine and is 
president of cb equities corp a new yorkbased investment 
portfolio mangement company estrin 45 is a washingtonbased 
investor and former chairman of american health services a hospital 
and nursing home management concern

it has all the ingredients for the kind 
of soap opera television viewers love an intriguing former prime 
minister international big business and the roman catholic church 
fighting for wealth and power 
but this is not dallas this is portugal and a reallife battle 
for control of one or two new commercial television channels is 
brewing in western europes poorest nation 
most observers say former social democrat prime minister 
fransisco pinto balsemao publisher of the countrys most respected 
weekly paper expresso is in the best position to win the first 
concession 
but british press baron robert maxwell and the portuguese church 
are also eager to profit by bringing information opinion and above 
all advertising into the homes of portugals 10 million 
inhabitants 
rtp portugals 32yearold twochannel state television system 
already carries advertising 
according to radio televisao commercial the commercial arm of 
rtp 729 percent of portuguese watch tv every day rtc says this is 
the highest rate in western europe 
the most popular programs usually early evening tv novels 
like roque santeiro imported from portuguesespeaking brazil 
find up to 90 percent of the countrys viewing population glued to 
the screen 
there is certainly demand for more choice new stations 
said fernando santos sales director at rtc adding that many 
portuguese especially in poorer isolated rural areas have little 
other entertainment 
theyre all waiting for private tv because they think it will 
bring better programs 
but some enterprising portuguese cannot wait highpowered 
satellite dishes capable of picking up neighboring spains two 
programs and several eurosatellite channels have sprouted on more 
affluent rooftops in lisbon oporto and the southern algarve 
at 200000 escudos about 1300 per dish the antennae are too 
expensive for the average portuguese whose minimum monthly wage is 
27100 escudos 179 about half that of spain and a quarter of 
the minimum monthly wage in france 
poorer areas often solve the problem by pooling cash to buy 
communal dishes that can pick up programs from abroad for easy but 
illegal retransmission by cable to individual homes 
plans to introduce commercial television via private extension of 
the regular network were first discussed in 1982 but only now are 
likely to become a reality 
in october social democrat prime minister anibal cavaco silva and 
the main opposition socialist party reached an agreement to secure 
the necessary twothirds parliamentary majority on a vote expected 
next spring to change the constitutional clause that restricts 
private ownership of tv stations 
but the government could set up new channels by concession now 
without having to transfer ownership 
its very much a question of political will balsemao said 
and according to rtcs santos a new commercial channel could be up 
and running by the end of 1989 
balsemao has already attracted support from portuguese publishing 
circles and a minority participation from britains independent 
granada tv to register sic independent society for communication 
he sees privatization of rtp2 the second stateowned channel 
as the quickest way to bring commercial television to portugal 
the longer the government waits the more inroads foreign tv 
interests will make here and the more difficult it will be for new 
portuguese stations to break into the market 
maxwell head of maxwell communications plc and publisher of a 
new european newspaper could be one of the foreign interests 
maxwell communications has set up a joint venture with lisbon 
communications concern emaudio international connected with 
socialist president mario soares and has already started to make 
inroads into the portuguese media market 
our principal objective is to control a regular tv channel but 
we plan to go ahead with the launch of a portuguese satellite 
channel by 1990 at the latest raul junqueiro mastermind of 
emaudios tv plans said 
emaudio is already making headway in the expanding newspaper 
market here two weeks ago it launched the first of two planned 
newspapers a nonglossy investigative weekly called primeira 
pagina maxwell plans to launch a daily called 24 horas by the 
end of january 
magalhaes crespo president of the administrative council of 
radio renascenca the churchs nationwide radio network and 
frontman for the future televisao catolica says the churchs 
position as a mainstay of portugals education system gives it a 
right to own a tv channel 
market surveys show 29 percent of adult listeners tune in to 
radio renascenca a figure twice that of the combined audience of 
its two stateowned competitors 
but many are wary of the objectivity of a churchcontrolled 
channel 
its true we are conservative in our outlook crespo said 
but in the case of our radio station we never mix comment with 
information 
more channels may not mean better television santos of rtc said 
if these new channels want to make profits they will have to 
resort to showing lowcost repeats of old films 
it costs 10 times as much to produce a homegrown product he 
said than to buy a foreign import

when chris crowell says his latest project 
folded its not a matter for concern all his schemes collapse by 
design 
crowell 55 is the founder and president of structural graphics 
inc a connecticut company that specializes in print advertisements 
that pop up play music and flash lights 
his companys work has been displayed in millions of magazines 
numerous sales brochures and store displays it also has been 
featured in books and greeting cards and hung from the ceilings and 
walls of businesses across the country 
one recent popup advertisement his company produced for camel 
cigarettes was used to mark that brands 75th anniversary readers 
of the march issue of rolling stone magazine who opened up the 
advertising insert on page 16 had a cigarettesmoking camel pop up 
while an electronic chip played happy birthday 
crowells company produced 15 million such inserts a sign of 
how far threedimensional ads have come since structural graphics 
was established in 1976 
the business began with fewer than a handful of employees in a 
colonialstyle home in old lyme crowell whose background was in 
graphics and advertising was convinced that 3d ads deserved a 
place in business and he went after skeptical advertising 
executives 
i began pushing to get the advertising industry interested 
he said during a recent interview now they believe it works 
crowell said the big break came in 1984 when his company 
designed an advertising insert for yves saint laurents paris 
perfume in vogue magazine when a seal on the ad was broken a 
bouqet of roses popped open and the smell of perfume was released 
we had been primarily in direct mail until that time crowell 
said explaining his company is now deeply involved in magazine 
inserts 
crowell says structural graphics is one of the largest companies 
in its field but he declined to release sales figures for the 
privately owned firm he said he produces between 50 million and 100 
million 3d pieces a year a popup can cost as little as 15 cents 
or as much as 10 apiece 
we get a kick out of just making effective ads and making 
them pay for the advertiser crowell said its almost as good 
as the money 
crowell takes pride in his companys innovation citing numerous 
awards and patents for instance structural graphics launched the 
first musical print advertisement in december 1987 in people 
magazine the twopage spread for canadian mist featured a winter 
scene and the christmas carole deck the halls 
the business of producing a 3d ad typically begins when an 
advertising agency contacts structural graphics with a proposal 
once presented with an idea crowell unleashes a team of engineers 
and others who design a popup to fit the agencys requirements 
once the ad is accepted it is printed outside structural 
graphics and then assembled usually by hand by about 300 people 
employed at a company plant in piedras negras mexico some smaller 
volume ads also can be completed at the structural graphics plant in 
essex or another in dallas the projects take 20 to 25 days to 
complete 
because of the work involved 3d ads are more expensive than 
ordinary print ads as a result companies interested in the ads are 
usually major companies seeking to promote themselves or new 
products said eric thruelsen structrual graphics marketing and 
sales director 
the companys list of clients includes xerox ford general 
motors ibm macdonalds pitney bowes and donald trump 
rj reynolds tobacco co decided to use a 3d ad as part of its 
camel promotion because it wanted to celebrate in a contemporary 
fashion said seth w moskowtiz a senior public relations 
representative at the cigarette maker the musical ad was the first 
of its kind in the tobacco industry where 300 styles compete for 
consumer dollars 
we were looking for eyestoppingness and in this case also 
earstoppingness he said 
crowell said advertisers like 3d ads because they are extremely 
effective studies conducted by crowells companies and others have 
shown that as many as 90 percent of those who see a popup ad also 
read it he said a typical print ad has about a 30 percent 
readership if its lucky crowell said 
crowell believes the surface has barely been scratched for 3d 
advertising he said hes always coming up with new ideas and has 
yet to put most of them into production 
its being used but not as much as the media blows it up he 
said lots and lots of people are considering it

many business consultants make a very good living 
analyzing corporate weaknesses and devising fixup procedures that 
include new people equipment and processes 
much time is involved lots of money repeated conferences too 
computer reports and graphs prove the erudition of the 
consultants indeed if impressions were the measure of results 
these analyses would be invaluable 
contrast this complicated procedure with another approach 
championed by a respected consultant in which you focus on one 
problem or an aspect of one attack it immediately with existing 
talent and produce immediate results 
ive never seen a company in which it cannot be done says 
robert h schaffer who has written a remarkable book of common 
sense and canny insight buttressed by more than 25 years of 
experience 
while companies search far and wide for esoteric formulas to 
get them back in the running some very powerful solutions lie close 
at hand he says 
schaffer based in stamford conn has demonstrated his theories 
in big companies and small and now relates the story in the 
breakthrough strategy using shortterm success to build the high 
performance organization 
it confirms some widely held suspicions that management problems 
arent as complicated as they might seem that they seldom require 
the immediate purchase of new equipment and that they can be solved 
today rather than tomorrow 
overly simplified schaffer preaches resultsbased management 
development of which this is an example 
in january 1986 pennwalt corps headquarters informed wayne 
oquinn manager of its calvert city kentucky plant that a 
corporate study to evaluate the facilitys future was underway 
the reason costs of its key chemical products were overly high 
and its market was eroding after 37 years of operation the future 
of the plant and the jobs of its 400 employees were on the line 
seventeen improvement teams organized months before to tackle 
the plants myriad problems had failed to produce significant 
gains partly because their efforts were too broad now they sought 
to focus on one critical element 
the results showed up in just eight weeks they were able to 
raise by 20 percent the feed rate of raw materials into one kiln 
among the many used to produce chemical reactions success 
this first success changed the character of their turnaround 
efforts now they felt they could produce change the team moved on 
to other kilns with productive results then they moved on to other 
projects one at a time 
over the next six months the plants managers were able to reduce 
overall production costs by 18 percent focusing on one task at a 
time benefiting from the enthusiasm and confidence generated by 
their successes 
schaffer head of robert h schaffer amp associates is a devout 
believer in the principle that problems refined to their elements 
can be simple to deal with whereas problems taken as a whole can be 
impossibly difficult 
his approach is to get results at once utilizing the personnel 
and other resources already existing within a company why he asks 
does a crisis so often produce its own solution where months of 
earlier effort had failed 
why because a crisis produces a real sense of urgency a 
personal challenge to workers a sense of shared commitment to a 
welldefined goal a freedom to experiment with new ideas and a 
feeling of imminent success 
he calls them zest factors while he doesnt believe in 
creating artificial crises he does think it important to recognize 
the lessons that crises produce zest factors can be used to 
mobilize effective action 
in his book produced by ballinger publishing co a subsidiary 
of harper amp row he describes how initial successes become launching 
pads for a continuing process of improvement 
he asserts that companies can build their basic capacity to 
compete in the longterm while in fact because of obtaining a 
succession of small but immediate and tangible successes 
rarely does a business consultant offer you simplicity of 
approach low cost immediate results and a procedure for a 
continuing never ending series of improvements

grand metropolitan plc of britain today 
increased its cash tender offer for pillsbury co common stock by 3 
per share to 63 but pillsbury quickly rejected the proposal as it 
had a separate offer for a richer negotiated deal 
late sunday grand met had said it would amend its tender offer 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission the amended 
offer values pillsburys more than 86 million outstanding shares at 
about 542 billion 
but pillsburys board of directors immediately rejected the 
63pershare offer as inadequate and not in the best interests of 
the company and its shareholders 
grand met said sunday it decided to raise its formal tender offer 
after minneapolisbased pillsbury declined to endorse its offer to 
pay 65 a share for a friendly negotiated acquisition 
pillsbury had said earlier sunday night that grand met was 
willing to raise its offer to as much as 66 a share 
both companies issued statements saying that pillsbury chairman 
philip l smith met over the weekend with grand met chief executive 
officer allen sheppard in new york but did not reach an agreement 
the jockeying occurred ahead of a hearing this afternoon in 
delaware chancery court on pillsburys poison pill antitakeover 
measures the cornerstone of its defense against grand met the 
british companys offer is conditioned on the removal of the pill 
as of friday night stockholders had tendered 874 percent of 
pillsbury shares to grand met under its 60 bid grand met a major 
hotel and beverage conglomerate has declined to buy any of the 
shares until the court rules on pillsburys defense 
court chancellor william duffy has told participants that after 
oral arguments today he will make a decision by the end of this 
week 
at an initial meeting friday evening pillsbury said sheppard 
indicated he was prepared to increase grand mets offer to 63 a 
share smith responded that he was not willing to discuss at this 
time a price which was not in the range of 68 to 73 a share 
pillsburys statement said 
on saturday morning grand met indicated it was making a formal 
offer of 65 a share for a negotiated acquisition according to both 
companies statements 
pillsbury said its board of directors met sunday but there was 
no enthusiasm for the 65ashare proposal 
at a meeting sunday afternoon sheppard indicated that although 
65 was his official final offer 66 a share could be

churchs fried chicken inc which is fighting 
a hostile takeover takeover bid from a rival restaurant chain said 
monday it was closing 120 unprofitable restaurants and taking 
writeoffs of up to 27 million 
churchs is scrambling to fend off the hostile overtures from the 
parent of new orleansbased popeyes famous fried chicken and 
biscuits whose latest 8pershare 290 million offer expires 
friday 
ernest renaud churchs president and chief executive officer 
said the restaurant closings in 20 states involved outlets that lost 
74 million in the past 12 months he said the losses from the 
restaurants were affecting the companys cash flow as it struggled 
with tough economic situations and the takeover attempt 
there will be 24 closings in texas 12 in illinois 10 in 
alabama nine in virginia seven in ohio six in kansas and missouri 
and three to four each in several other states 
there was just too much chicken competition in those areas we 
just overbuilt renaud said we were taking big losses for a 
long time these units were just a big drain 
they should have been closed a year ago but this is just part 
of my plan to make the company profitable again he said 
renaud said the comapny would take writeoffs of between 22 
million and 27 million for its current fiscal year 
churchs stock dipped 25 cents to 775 a share monday in new 
york stock exchange trading 
churchs which has gone through several management changes and 
poor sales over the past two years had 1500 restaurants before the 
closures second behind kentucky fried chicken churchs expects 
sales this year of 520 million down from 570 million in 1986 and 
633 million in 1984 
popeyes the nations thirdlargest chicken chain with about 725 
restaurants expects to have sales of 485 million this year 
churchs board of directors has rejected popeyes offer as 
inadequate and is challenging various aspects of it in federal court 
as well as seeking possible other suitors 
a federal judge in new orleans earlier this month issued an order 
preventing popeyes from buying churchs stock until 10 working days 
after popeyes disclosed further information on its buyout offer 
popeyes first takeover deadline was nov 30 but has been 
extended to friday popeyes chairman al copeland says he already 
owns 32 percent of churchs stock and says he has been tendered 
146 million about 406 percent of churchs 359 million 
outstanding shares under the 8 a share offer

the governments marketmoving monthly trade report 
gold prices eased republic national bank quoted bullion at 
42025 a troy ounce as of 4 pm est down from 42250 late friday 
currency strategists read little significance into the dollars 
small gain saying it largely was due to internal market influences 
of supply and demand not any outside news 
but some said speculation that the federal reserve would move to 
tighten interest rates may have strengthened the dollar a bit 
higher interest rates make dollardenominated investments more 
attractive

behavior was reticence to take any risky positions before the 
commerce departments report on the october trade deficit due 
wednesday

the most visible symbols of us economic strength and 
competitiveness abroad with an enormous potential to influence

copper futures prices fell steeply monday on new yorks commodity 
exchange after the exchange reported the first increase in nearly a 
month in deliverable supplies of the metal 
on other markets precious metals mostly were lower livestock 
and meat futures moved sharply higher energy futures were mixed 
grains and soybeans were mixed and stockindex futures fell 
copper settled 1 cent to 440 cents lower on the commodity 
exchange with the spot contract for delivery in december at 1585 a 
pound and the more actively traded march contract at 1352 a pound 
daily increases in the amount of warehoused copper registered 
with the commodity exchange have been rare since october 1987 when 
the comex copper inventory stood at nearly 90000 short tons 
late last week the exchange reported that warehouse stocks had 
dropped to 5204 tons and copper for december delivery on the 
exchange soared to an alltime high of 16475 a pound 
but copper traders who had expected the trend to continue were 
shocked monday morning when the comex reported that warehouse stocks 
had risen to 6545 tons a 24 percent increase from last weeks 
tally 
that was an unpleasant surprise to the market said craig 
sloane metals analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co in new 
york 
the comex last reported an increase in copper stocks on nov 17

ounce silver was 07 cent lower to 04 cent higher with march at 
6298 a troy ounce 
pork futures rose strongly on the chicago mercantile exchange on 
speculation that last weeks drop in slaughters meant hog kills had 
passed their seasonal peak said dale durchholz an analyst with 
agrivisor services inc bloomington ill 
strong retail demand and the arrival of wintry conditions in the 
midwest also contributed to the advance in pork futures he said 
farmers just havent been willing to move hogs with the kind of 
temperatures weve had because it stresses them a little more 
durchholz said 
cattle futures rallied in sympathy with the pork complex and in 
reaction to renewed demand he said 
live cattle settled 25 cent to 60 cent higher with december at 
7242 cents a pound feeder cattle were 50 cent to 1 cent higher 
with january at 8395 cents a pound live hogs were 63 cent to 120 
cents higher with december at 4277 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 103 cent to 135 cent higher with february at 4460 
cents a pound 
home heating oil prices closed sharply higher and lent support to 
crude oil futures after subzero temperatures hit the northeast

west texas intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents 22 cents higher 
with january at 1606 a barrel heating oil was 10 cent to 70 
cent higher with january at 5020 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 11 cent to 40 cent lower with january at 4420 cents a gallon

rumors of impending grain sales to the soviet union while soybean 
prices settled mostly lower in response to weekend rains in south 
america

report after the close in which it increased its estimate for the 
us wheat stockpile at the end of the current marketing year to 533 
million bushels from 528 million bushels 
wheat settled 1 cents to 3 cents higher with december at 428 
a bushel corn was 1 cents to 4 cents higher with december at 
261 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 5 cents higher with december 
at 207 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents lower to 4 cents higher 
with january at 769 a bushel

the disneyheld company seeking to acquire polaroid 
corp amended its takeover offer monday to meet a federal court 
order that was blocking the bid 
shamrock holdings inc said its hostile 42ashare bid for 
polaroid was now contingent on whether a judge in delaware 
invalidated or rescinded the polaroid employee stock ownership plan 
being challenged by shamrock 
analysts said the move would not dramatically alter shamrocks 
26 billion tender offer which has been in abeyance pending court 
action 
in delaware us district judge caleb wright on monday ordered 
shamrock to modify the language of the offer and issue a news 
release on the changes the burbank califbased television 
concern wholly owned by the roy e disney family met the 
conditions immediately 
shamrock said it would purchase polaroid shares under its 42 
offer only if the employee stock plan was invalidated by delaware 
chancery court where shamrock is challenging the plan 
previously shamrock had maintained that the deal could have 
proceeded merely if the 10 million shares in the stock plan were 
ruled not part of the companys outstanding shares 
if the 300 million plan is invalidated shamrock would try to 
buy 62 million outstanding shares if not it would be faced with 
acquiring about 72 million shares under an earlier 40ashare 
offer analysts said 
shamrock owns 5 million shares of polaroid 
polaroid spokeswoman marcia phillips said the company had no 
comment on the development 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in philadelphia last month 
ordered the district court to issue a preliminary injunction 
blocking the takeover bid until shamrock clarified its position on 
the employee stock plan 
the plan places 14 percent of the company stock in employee 
hands a move shamrock claims was designed intentionally to defend 
against its hostile takeover bid under delaware law a hostile 
bidder must acquire at least 85 percent of a company 
cambridgebased polaroid which introduced instant snapshots in 
1948 is incorporated in delaware 
i dont think this implies a change in the approach of shamrock 
to the offer or really any material change in the offer said alex 
henderson an analyst with prudential bache securities 
arguments in the chancery court case are scheduled for friday 
shamrock said it would extend its offer for polaroid past next 
mondays expiration date to wait for a court ruling

economic and finance ministers from 
seven latin american nations agreed monday to take urgent 
collective measures to reduce their foreign debt 
the socalled group of eight also agreed in a closeddoor meeting 
to present the measures which were undisclosed to their respective 
presidents 
the group is composed of ministers from argentina brazil 
colombia peru uruguay venezuela and mexico panama dropped out of 
the group last year due to internal political turmoil together the 
eight member countries owe around 400 billion in foreign debt along 
with 25 billion in interest due in 1989 
the measures should be accompanied by a call for cut in interst 
rates below the market rate according to brazilian finance minister 
mailson da nobrega 
in the six years since the world debt crisis erupted this is the 
first time that debtor nations have proposed an apparently 
unconventional collective answer to the debt question some 
observers said at past meetings some members have stressed that 
each countrys particular characteristics make a casebycase direct 
resolution of their respective debts with creditors the more 
appropriate path to follow 
during the rio meeting as in past years the group of eight 
avoided talk of a debt cartel

chevron corp announced monday it will post 
a loss in excess of 100 million after taxes in the fourth quarter 
on the sale of its 489 percent stake in irving oil ltd 
but a spokesman for the oil giant said the charge should not 
result in a net loss for the quarter 
chevron said it sold its interest in irving oil on friday after 
having an interest in the firm for more than 30 years said steve 
mclennan manager of investor relations for chevron 
chevron would not disclose the details of the transaction irving 
oil is a privatelyheld company based in new brunswick canada that 
operates a refinery and has a number of marketing outlets 
chevron officials denied that the sale which had been negotiated 
for some time was prompted by anything in particular 
its been a profitable enterprise for us he said the 
charge were taking in the fourth quarter is in a sense undoing a 
little bit of the profits of the past overall its been a 
profitable investment 
mclennan said it was in neither one of our interests to 
continue the minority interest the two companies have some very 
very small joint operations that will continue under contract he 
added 
although it is a substantial loss to take it should not put us 
in the red for the quarter said mclennan it shouldnt really 
even come close 
chevron had net income of 220 million or 64 cents a share in 
the foureth quarter a year ago after taking a charge of 93 million 
related to the disposition and writeoff of assets 
in trading on the new york stock exchange chevron rose 12 cents 
a share to 46 on monday
