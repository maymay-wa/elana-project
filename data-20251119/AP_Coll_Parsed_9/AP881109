democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen from his campaign 
headquarters at the driskill hotel 
how wonderful to be with our friends were just delighted to be 
home in texas ive about given this voice away crossing this great 
country of ours but im so pleased to be home with our family 
and in the back room in the room back there where they cant see 
us and i know there they are 
well this evening is still early but its not boy my voice 
is just about gone the last speech was at 300 this morning at a 
rally here in austin i think yesterday we did four states and eight 
rallies and i dont know how many interviews that sort of thing 
its been an incredible experience 
the evening is still early but its not too early to claim 
victory in my reelection to the united states senate those returns 
are not complete but they sure are conclusive and i didnt want to 
wait a minute longer to thank the people of texas for their 
wonderful and generous support and their commitment to me 
id also like to make a comment about mike dukakis he and i 
waged a campaign thats worthy of the american people we told you 
the truth and we stepped up to those issues we challenged america 
to do better we fought fair and we never quit and we never lost 
our faith in the truth thats what you need in a campaign i have 
never seen a candidate that worked any harder or in those last 
three or four weeks delivered a message any stronger than did mike 
dukakis in those closing days 
and he made me proud to be his partner he made me proud to be 
his running mate and he made me proud to be an american but right 
now i want to focus on texas because texas is our home this has 
been an unusual campaign i recognize the difficulties that you had 
to go through as friends of mine and supporters of mine i think 
truly unlike any campaign thats gone before every hazard was 
there every difficulty was twice as hard and victory is twice as 
sweet in that senate race 
and your efforts are very important because there is still a lot 
of work to do a lot to be done for this great state of ours thats 
really taken some hits its been through one of the toughest 
decades in the history of our great state but we all know that the 
people of texas have been through crises before from the alamo to 
the dust bowl to the great depression the boom and bust of the 
energy industry we have always solved those problems and we have 
always come back tougher than before because the people of this 
great state they have spirit 
theyre risk takers you bet they are risk takers who work hard 
to overcome any adversity and to build for the future thats 
texans our state is rich in resources but our richest resource 
the people that i see before me and across this great state of ours 
ba and i have spent most of our lives working with you with the 
wonderful people of this great state to create opportunity and 
justice and prosperity for all the people of this state 
we have a secret weapon in those battles the support of friends 
like you to know that weve earned your support that youd be here 
tonight and we have some them at two oclock in the morning this 
morning can you imagine that out there but thats the great 
reward of public service to have that kind of support and 
satisfaction from you it made us realize how rich we are in 
friends how much you mean to us 
so i want this last word in this campaign to be a word of thanks 
to you to all of you who have made it possible who have given us 
the strength and the kind of support to run and to win thank you 
very much

assets of this campaign 
just 18 months ago on what some of you will recall was a cold 
and snowy april day i asked you for your support in running what i 
called a marathon for the highest honor that the american people can 
bestow on anyone i said thered be good days and we had a lot of 
good days didnt we and i said thered be notsogood days and we 
had a few of those too and i talked about another marathon that i

or two and people saying to me looking good duke go to it 
that is what you have done and im very grateful to you we had 
those good and not so good days we reached heartbreak hill and 
overcame it and then we found the strength to make that final kick

made this extraordinary experience of ours possible from my 
friends and neighbors here in massachusetts to those 3000 people 
who were waiting for us at 3 oclock this morning in des moines

this magnificent land from those beautiful colonial villages of new 
hamphsire to the farmland of iowa to the magnificence of yellowstone 
and the california coast but most of all ill remember the people 
ive meet their strength their values their generosity and their 
hospitality to kitty and me and to our family and it is very

and this great and good nation ought to be able to do that 
weve got to fight for those unemployed steel workers in 
mckeesport pennsylvannia and youngstown ohio who ought to be 
able to have a good job at a good wage to support themselves and 
their families and weve got fight for those families i met with in 
glen avon calif whose children today are permanently crippled 
because they happened to live next door to one of the worst toxic 
waste dumps in the united states of america 
this campaign has not been just about me and lloyd bentsen its 
been about these families and the challenges they face every day of 
their lives its been about all of us and the values and the ideals 
that we share thats what weve been fighting for and that is what 
we must continue to work for every day and every week and every 
month of our lives 
im going to continue to work for these goals with you with my 
fellow governors with the democratic congress and im proud to say 
that we not only will continue to have a democratic congress but it 
looks as if a strengthened democratic senate well be working with 
the new administration and above all ill be working with the people 
of massachusetts 
let me say thank you to many many people in this counrty those 
who gave us their support those hundreds of thousand of volunteers 
who worked so hard and so long and so tirelessly 
i want to thank the members of the worlds oldest and greatest 
party the democratic party for all that they did i want to thank 
this wonderful family of mine kitty and john and andrea and todd 
and lisa and my mother and kittys dad theyve been terrific 
and let me simply conclude by saying this to all of you and to 
people like you all across the country and especially to those of 
you who are young people and there are many young people here 
there is nothing you can do in this world more fulfilling and more 
satisfying than giving of yourself to others and making a 
contribution to your community and your state and your nation and 
your fellow citizens

the thousands and thousands of young people who are involved i 
dont want you to be discouraged i want you to be encouraged by 
what youve done in this campaign i hope many of you will go into 
politics and public service it is a noble profession a noble

has been given to you and much is expected of you much has been 
given to the young people of this country the opportunity to live 
and grow up in the greatest nation on the face of this earth and

the controversy over exitpolling was raised 
again during tuesday nights election coverage when the networks 
once again called the presidential race before polls had closed on 
the west coast 
the networks had a handshake agreement with congress which is 
considering a law setting a uniform pollclosing time that they 
would not call a race in a state until that states polls had closed 
however they also said if projections in states where polls had 
closed indicated a candidate with the 270 electoral votes necessary 
to win they would project that candidate the winner 
at 917 pm est cbs was the first network to call the election 
an hour and 43 minutes before polls closed on the west coast abc 
followed suit three minutes later nbc called it at 1030 cnn 
called it at 1042 but based on counted votes not exit polls 
bruce herschensohn a commentator for kabc abcs owned station 
in los angeles complained about his own networks projection i 
understand it when the networks want to report the news he said 
but this isnt the news theyre making the news and then 
reporting the news that they made i think that its terribly unfair 
to the western states 
the networks based the projection on exit polls interviews with 
voters after they cast ballots 
exit polling and network projections have been a controversy 
since 1980 when nbc projected ronald reagan the winner at 815 
pm almost three hours before polls closed on the west coast 
critics complain that such projections discourage voters who still 
have time to vote and can affect the outcome of local races and 
referendums the networks counter that projections are news 
congress has considered a uniform poll closing time nationwide to 
counter the effects of exit polling 
john tunney another kabc commentator and former democratic us 
senator said he was furious once again we see the east 
coast networks treating us out here in the west as though we dont 
count we count a lot 
on kcbs the cbs owned station in los angeles bob naylor 
chairman of the california republican party said on the air i 
think its a real injustice to have the early projections that might 
depress voter turnout in california 
cbs dan rather stressed that it was important for voters on the 
west coast to go to the polls if they hadnt already 
let me pause and say that is our cbs news estimate our 
headline of the moment is that george bush has been elected he 
said it does make a differenece those of you in states where 
polls havent closed whether you vote 
fifteen minutes after calling the race abcs peter jennings 
offered what almost amounted to an apology on the air i must 
confess im feeling a bit defensive jennings said to his 
colleague david brinkley 
cbs had bush with 277 electoral votes to michael dukakis 76 and 
abc 271 for bush and 72 for dukakis based on projections in states 
where polls had closed at the same time nbc still had bush with 
only 214 electoral votes only a small fraction of the popular vote 
had been counted by 1030 nbc finally called the presidential 
race estimating bush had 279 electoral votes to dukakis 72

a landslide victory by republican sen john 
heinz for a third term tuesday helped george bush win pennsylvanias 
prize of 25 electoral votes by a razorthin margin 
in an unusual twist of the coattails scenario heinz popularity 
as heir to his familys ketchup and pickle fortune boosted bushs 
fortunes in a state where heavy industry has declined and democrats 
hold a voter registration edge 
with 91 percent of the precincts reporting in one of the states 
closest presidential elections ever bush had 1990346 votes or 50 
percent while dukakis had 1974795 votes or 50 percent 
in the senate race heinz had 2376281 votes or 66 percent and 
vignola had 1238261 votes or 34 percent 
heinz 50 raised 5 million for his reelection 10 times the 
amount spent by vignola 39 a former philadelphia city controller 
bushs attack on democrat michael dukakis positions on gun 
control and abortion appeared to have helped the vice president in 
conservative central pennsylvania as well as in the traditionally 
democratic northeastern region 
dukakis won key sections of northeastern and southwestern 
pennsylvania but did not do as well in philadelphia as walter 
mondale did four years ago philadelphias black community needed an 
enthusiastic turnout to help push dukakis over the top statewide 
in the congressional races all 23 incumbents were reelected 
keeping the democratic edge at 1211

dukakis spent the day at home not sleeping despite a 48hour 
sleepless campaign finale crisscrossing america he took an 
afternoon walk and raked leaves in his back yard 
but with aides saying his race was tight he spent an hour and a 
half in the late afternoon doing interviews with television stations 
in selected states by satellite from a boston tv studio 
dukakis spent the evening at his brookline duplex watching the 
returns on three television sets tuned to each of the networks 
top aide kirk odonnell asked what the mood was among dukakis 
and his family as he emerged from the home said very upbeat 
considering 
he traveled by motorcade to the trade center where comedian 
robert klein had warmed up the crowd and a laser light show 
accompanied dukakis campaign theme song neil diamonds coming to 
america in laser art the words we love the duke and thank 
you america appeared on a screen 
after speaking dukakis went into a private meeting with staff 
and major contributors before heading home to his perry street 
duplex 
his supporters cheered 92 92 in reference to another quest 
for the presidency in four years but dukakis made no reference to a 
repeat of his candidacy and his mother euterpe dukakis had a 
quick answer when asked if she wanted him to run again no 
arriving in boston tuesday morning the democratic presidential 
nominee and his family went first to their polling place before 
heading home for the first chance to sleep in bed since saturday

best in the final weeks and had presented america with an image of

jesse jackson said tuesday it is too early to 
start talking about the 1992 election and that democrats should be 
looking for some common ground with republican george bush 
asked in an interview on abctv whether he would start 
campaigning immediately for the next presidential race jackson said 
at a democratic electionnight gathering its much too early 
premature and downright immature to be talking about 1992 politics 
on this night 
jackson is a veteran of two unsuccessful bids for the democratic 
presidential nomination jackson said in an interview published in 
sundays chicago suntimes if michael dukakis loses on tuesday 
the next political season will begin on wednesday 
with bush poised to win the white house jackson hoarse and 
visibly tired after a long day of campaign rallies in four states 
sounded conciliatory toward the vice president 
at the top of the ticket it is not looking good but certainly 
mike dukakis has run a gallant race with integrity said jackson 
who returned to his chicago base to await election returns 
with a bush victory he said all of us will reach out for some 
common ground agenda 
recalling bushs pledge at the republican national convention for 
a kinder gentler nation jackson said i hope people will get 
the campaign behind us and look at that kinder gentler agenda as it 
relates to health care and day care and workers and family farmers 
but he said the vote did not mean americans were rejecting the 
democratic platform 
the vote certainly cant be against the message jackson 
said michael dukakis certainly had the right message i 
believe that the dukakisbentsen priorities were good for america

a triumphant george bush hailed his presidential 
victory and vowed to work to heal wounds opened by a harsh negative 
campaign saying an election clears the way for harmony and 
peace 
i know that well come together as we always have the 
presidentelect told several thousand cheering supporters at a 
victory party where he also pledged to reach out and work 
constructively with the democraticcontrolled congress 
a campaign is a disagreement and disagreements divide but an 
election is a decision and decisions clear the way for harmony and 
peace bush said 
i mean to be a president of all the people he said and to 
those who did not vote for him bush said my hand is out to you 
and i want to be your president too 
bush added thank you new hampshire referring to his 
comeback republican primary victory last winter that put him on the 
path to becoming the first sitting vice president to win the 
presidency in more than 150 years 
bush surrounded by nearly two dozen family members told 
campaign workers who filled a convention center that he had received 
a call from defeated rival michael dukakis 
i want you to know he was most gracious his call was personal 
he was genuinely friendly and in the great tradition of american 
politics he said 
bush also received calls from president reagan gop vice 
presidential candidate dan quayle democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen democrat jesse jackson and canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney 
the new presidentelect voiced special praise for the man he will 
succeed reagan for turning our country around and being my 
friend and for going the extra miles on the hustings 
he is certainly one of the most decent men i have ever met 
repeating a favorite campaign theme bush told his audience 
when i said i want a kinder and gentler nation i meant it and i 
mean it 
this is a moving night for all of us bush said and you 
cant help but be moved when your country endorses your hopes and 
your candidacy and the feelings are so personal that the decision 
is larger than that 
on dukakis bush said i think i know how governor dukakis 
feels i lost a few along the way myself and it hurts 
asked by reporters when he would begin making decisions on a bush 
administration the vice president said tomorrow 
earlier as he cast his ballot at a hotel set up as a precinct 
polling place bush shied away from predicting victory because it 
brings you bad luck the republican presidential nominee cites 
another houston hotel as his legal voting residence 
arriving with his wife shortly after the polls opened at 7 am 
bush gave a thumbsup sign to reporters 
i feel as if i wish there was a decision he said its a 
nervous stage so well just have to wait and see 
he spent most of the rest of the day with family and friends at 
the houstonian hotel where the bushes lease a suite and he went 
for a morning jog in a nearby park 
bush was to appear at a rally late tuesday in houstons 
convention center on wednesday morning he was to conduct a news 
conference in houston then fly back to washington for a 
welcomehome rally 
despite bushs reluctance to predict a win campaign officials 
were clearly joyous it looks good said press secretary sheila 
tate 
at the polling place the bushes punched out paper ballots and 
handed them to election officials as the vice president chatted 
his wife urged lets move on because others were waiting to vote 
outside several dozen demonstrators held protest signs 
including one that said hunger isnt kind or gentle 
bush also went to the local republican headquarters where he 
spoke to volunteers and made a few getoutthevote calls 
wonderful he said into the phone during one call now i 
know ill get at least three votes because bar and i already 
voted 
speaking with reporters he said i saw some of the very same 
people with whom i started in politics 24 25 years ago people on 
the telephone volunteers getting out the vote putting up signs 
very inspirational 
bush said the gop volunteers were very optimistic about his 
chances although he added but you expect your strong supporters 
to feel that way 
when bush left the polling place a frenchspeaking television 
reporter shouted questions at him 
je peux parler un peu de francais i speak a little french 
bush replied 
tres heureux aujourdhui very happy today he added 
but when mrs bush was asked in french how she felt she 
responded in spanish muy bien very good 
au revoir bush shouted to dozens of waiting news media 
representatives as he climbed into his limousine

new yorkers voted tuesday to borrow a record 3 
billion during the next four years for highway work the second such 
bond issue approved in the last five years 
with 79 percent of the precints reporting the bond issue 
proposal led by 1704659 votes or 54 percent to 1477287 votes 
or 46 percent as expected the bond issue passed because of strong 
support in new york city and its suburbs 
the proposal was strongly backed by gov mario cuomo and leaders 
of the legislature as the best way to finance road and bridge 
repairs interest on the borrowing was calculated at 21 billion 
during the next 30 years 
the proposal came five years after new yorkers agreed to cuomos 
request to borrow 125 billion for transportation projects 
with the money from that bond issue due to run out in march new 
york still has 1600 miles of highway considered in poor condition 
by its inspectors 660 miles of roads that arent big enough to 
handle their traffic and 7400 bridges rated unacceptable 
cuomo had argued that borrowing was the only way to pay for 
repairing highways without raising taxes and avoiding another 
tragedy like the collapse of a state thruway bridge last year in 
which 10 people died

vice presidentelect dan quayle pledged in 
triumph tuesday night to serve the nation with devotion and 
dedication under george bush and proclaimed the republican partys 
victory an endorsement of the changes president reagan has brought 
to america 
standing under the glare of lights in a hotel ballroom packed 
with some 4000 wellwishers quayle also promised i wont rest 
ever in my determination to serve our next president george bush 
you have truly made this the most memorable night of our 
lives said quayle who got off to an uneven start as the no 2 
man on the ticket as he left the hotel he said he felt great 
quayle 41 was accompanied on the stage by his wife marilyn 
and their three children tucker 14 benjamin 12 and corinne 9 
you did it we did it and george bush did it he said 
quayle said he would give bush all the help he could to help him 
have the constant and personal strength to lead america into the 
1990s 
you need never question the devotion and dedication i will 
bring to this job he said 
the crowd had waited for several hours for quayle to make his 
appearance which did not come until after midnight but the 
enthusiasm wasnt diminished as men women and children waved flags 
snapped pictures and cheered vigorously as he delivered his victory 
speech 
quayle awaited a televised statement by bush from houston before 
before entering the hotel ballroom in washington 
it is our task to fall behind george bush to give him the 
fullest measure of our assistance and commitment as he receives the 
mantle of the most powerful position on earth quayle said in a 
statement which he later delivered to the ballroom crowd 
i know that my obligation to our consitution and to our people 
is sacred the vice presidency is not a job it is a trust created 
by each of you i will never violate that trust 
quayle had been a controversial choice because of his youth 
military record and other reasons however questioning of voters 
leaving polls on tuesday showed no overwhelming impact on the 
presidential voting 
according to nbcwall street journal exit polling 21 percent of 
voters said they had reservations about quayle but voted gop anyway 
16 percent said they might have voted for bush but quayles presence 
on the ticket helped them decide to vote for dukakis 
however nbc poll analyst sheldon gawiser said almost all the 16 
percent were democrats leading him to conclude quayle actually had 
little effect 
some 63 percent said quayles selection did not affect their vote 
for president 
tuesday night quayle entertained about 50 supporters and friends 
from indiana and his parents james and corinne quayle were at his 
side along with the three quayle children aides said 
earlier tuesday quayle cast his ballot took a walking tour in 
his hometown and visited his 97yearold grandmother 
im not voting against someone im voting for george bush 
the gop vice presidential nominee said after emerging from the 
polling place at the huntington county courthouse in indiana 
well we got one sure vote quayle said when asked whether he 
voted for himself two added his wife marilyn who accompanied 
him to the polls 
quayle began his day by going to his hometown dentist to get his 
teeth cleaned he said he had done that on election days in the past 
and thought it was a good luck charm 
after casting his vote he walked through a part of the downtown 
surrounded by cheering townspeople 
before flying east to await the election results at a washington 
hotel he visited his grandmother martha pulliam at a nursing home 
in franklin ind 
she said to keep going in the right direction but dont do 
anything you shouldnt do quayle said when asked what advice she 
had given him 
during his october debate with democrat lloyd bentsen quayle had 
cited his grandmother as someone who had been an inspiration to him 
in his early life

voter turnout this year appears to have been at 
least as low as turnout in the 1948 presidential election when 
slightly more than 51 percent of eligible voters went to the polls 
according to preliminary figures 
curtis gans of the committee for the study of the american 
electorate said voter turnout could be as low as it was for the 1924 
election which he pegs at around 48 percent to 49 percent 
he predicted early wednesday that voter turnout would be 
somewhere between the figures for 1948 and 1924 and we may just 
barely escape being below 50 percent 
gans said his preliminary prediction was based on analysis of 16 
states that by early wednesday had 90 percent or more precincts 
reporting of those 16 states all were showing declines in voter 
turnout from the previous election and some of them quite sharp 
gans said several factors account for the low turnout 
we had a horrible election in a variety of ways and the 
people responded accordingly he said there are a combination 
of factors like people feeling their vote doesnt make a 
difference a declining allegiance to political parties and the 
conduct and coverage of the campaign 
the committe for the study of the american electorate is a 
nonpartisan nonprofit taxexempt research and public policy 
organization looking into voter turnout

a proposed smoking ban that would have 
given oregon the nations toughest antismoking law was rejected by 
voters tuesday 
with 36 percent of the ballots counted the measure was rejected 
by 210907 votes or 61 percent to 135862 or 39 percent 
although many jurisdictions have passed antismoking laws 
oregons proposal would have been the strictest in the nation 
because it would have wiped out designated smoking areas and imposed 
an outright ban on smoking in virtually all indoor work areas and 
enclosed places frequented by the public violators would have faced 
a 250 fine 
i dont think it was just an issue of smoking i think it came 
down to an issue of fairness said mark nelson who headed the 
opposition 
proponents blamed their loss on an advertising blitz financed by 
more than 2 million in contributions largely from tobacco 
companies 
frankly a contract was let on oregon and a hit was made 
said bob neely chairman of cleaner indoor air for oregonians the 
tobacco industry bought an election 
nelson called that hogwash 
we had a difficult job of educating the public on what this 
measure did nelson said that took money 
neely said the antismoking campaign would be carried to the 
legislature 
the bill is already drafted and in salem he said

former chief justice warren burger defended 
prison furloughs but waited to speak out on the issue until just 
hours before the election of fellow republican george bush who had 
campaigned for months against a furlough program in his opponents 
home state 
burger in a statement released to the associated press on 
tuesday contended that the furlough issue had become very much 
garbled during the presidential campaign 
the campaign left a general impression that furloughs are 
bad the former chief justice who now chairs the commission on 
the bicentennial of the united states constitution said in a 
telephone interview he said he doesnt believe that either bush or 
defeated democrat michael dukakis actually opposes prison furloughs 
unfortunately the issue of corrections is never likely to 
become adequately treated in any political campaign burger wrote 
his statement was issued late tuesday afternoon just hours 
before polls closed on the east coast 
i dont want to get into anything relating to the campaign 
itself said burger who was appointed chief justice in 1969 by 
thenpresident nixon and retired in 1986 to head the bicentennial 
commission 
burger declined to say whether he approved of bushs campaign 
tactic of attacking massachusetts prison furlough program and 
repeatedly citing the escape of furloughed inmate willie horton who 
later raped a woman and attacked her fiance 
however the former chief justice said before this campaign 
ever started there was some public confusion about the idea of 
furloughs and now there may be more 
burgers statement said the system of prison furloughs is 
useful and should be continued 
the issue raised in the campaign was not whether furloughs are 
basically a good idea and a useful tool in the field of corrections 
but whether it was administered properly he said 
in the interview burger said there really wasnt any debate 
on corrections here during the campaign there was the single 
episode that was referred to 
i dont think either of these men bush or dukakis would 
disagree that prison furlough programs are a good idea he said 
in the statement burger wrote any prison furlough system must 
be administered with great care when it is applied to persons found 
guilty of serious crimes of violence or when it is sought to be 
applied to a serious repeat offender 
burger said the united states should move away from prison 
warehouses and instead build factories with fences in which 
inmates learn a marketable skill so they can earn a living after 
release 
so long as we continue to casually allow so many prisons to be 
simply warehouses we can anticipate that many of the inmates will 
be worse when they leave than when they entered he said 
in scandinavian prisons everybody works and everybody gets 
paid said burger who was part of a team that studied prisons in 
those countries about five years ago 
there they have weekend furloughs consistently he said in 
the interview they are administered very very carefully if they 
dont come back by monday morning at 7 oclock they get a penalty 
that is almost as bad as the original crime as a result they come 
back 
the american people have got to be prepared to spend a lot more 
money on corrections burger said but 30 years of experience 
convinces me it would pay off in the long run 
burger said he decided to speak out on the prison furlough issue 
after being contacted by prison experts and by a number of inmates

president daniel ortega said late 
tuesday that he expects george bushs presidential victory will mean 
better relations between the united states and nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government 
we hope in this case bush doesnt commit the same errors that 
president reagan did ortega told a news conference 
ortega said it wouldnt be strange if the new republican 
president requests renewed military aid for nicaraguan rebels but 
said that would be a very serious error 
bush has said he backs renewed contra military aid which ended 
feb 29 and the democraticled us congress has refused to renew 
most rebel fighters have since moved to bases in neighboring 
honduras 
asked about prospective relations with the bush administration 
ortega said i think that mr bush doesnt have the commitment 
that president reagan had with the counterrevolutionary project 
he said earlier tuesday that reagan is obsessed with overthrowing 
the sandinistas 
ortega in a later interview with the nbctv network said i 
hope mr bush has a more realist policy to follow so that he can 
reach an understanding with nicaragua what i hope is that i find in 
him the will to find a solution to the central american crisis 
he was part of the problem now he must be convinced that that 
was a mistaken policy because it is a policy that has failed 
ortega said bushs first step should be to resume talks with 
nicaragua that the united states cut off in 1985 
the reagan administration says nicaragua is a beachhead for 
communism that threatens us security and cut off aid in 1981 it 
began financing rebels called contras that year and imposed a 
trade embargo in 1985 
rebel commander enrique bermudez said tuesday the contras would 
continue fighting even without the us military aid suspended 
contrasandinista talks aimed at ending the 7yearold conflict have 
had little success 
if the united states abandons its friends who fight for 
democracy we will continue the fight he said on clandestine 
radio liberacion our fight is not based on support from the 
united states

following his wifes example soviet human rights 
activist andrei sakharov underwent a heart examination as part of 
his first trip to the west 
the 67yearold nobel peace prize winner who was examined 
tuesday might receive a pacemaker to regulate his heartbeat before 
returning to moscow a family member said sakharov suffers from 
chronic angina or chest pain 
his wife yelena bonner came to the same hospital massachusetts 
general for heart bypass surgery in 1986 
the hospital said it would not release test results or provide 
any other medical information for the next 10 to 14 days at the 
request of sakharovs family 
his soninlaw efrem yankelevich says if doctors decide a 
pacemaker is needed sakharov will undergo surgery before returning 
to the soviet union later this month 
the physicist is scheduled to fly home nov 18 but relatives and 
colleagues have said his visa is flexible and could be extended 
yankelevich said last week that pacemakers which are implanted 
under the skin are not generally available in the soviet union 
though frail sakharov has maintained a demanding schedule and 
appears to be in generally good health 
he is believed to have suffered a minor stroke when soviet 
authorities forcefed him during a 1985 hunger strike 
that fast which lasted several weeks prompted the soviet 
authorities to allow his wife to come to boston for heart surgery 
she had suffered two heart attacks 
sakharov was also weakened by a hunger strike in 1981 said 
joshua rubenstein an amnesty international specialist on soviet 
dissidents that 18day fast forced the soviets to allow a young 
woman elizaveta alekseyeva to emigrate to the united states to 
marry sakharovs stepson alexei semyonov 
but it wasnt just the hunger strikes themselves that caused 
the damage rubenstein said it was the psychologcial pressure 
the isolation being forcefed the stroke being forcefed is a 
form of torture after all 
sakharov has commented little on his physical condition asked at 
a news conference monday about his health he said only that it 
hasnt changed either way recently 
on friday he is scheduled to travel to new york city for a 
luncheon given by the union of concerned scientists from new york 
he plans to go to washington for a board meeting of the 
international foundation for the survival and development of 
humanity of which he is a director 
on monday sakharov plans to visit president reagan at the white 
house 
in two public appearances since his arrival four days ago 
sakharov has called attention to soviet political prisoners and 
warned that perestroika the restructuring of his countrys 
political and economic system faces a grave threat from new laws 
restricting demonstrations and increasing police powers 
sakharov who won the 1975 nobel peace prize for championing 
human rights was banished to the closed city of gorky in 1980 for 
his opposition to soviet presence in afghanistan sakharovs living 
conditions during his internal exile were harsh and he frequently 
carried a 30pound bag with his possessions rubenstein said 
in 1986 soviet leader mikhail gorbachev allowed sakharov to 
return to moscow

in ancient greece the spartans sent their warriors 
off to battle with the cry return carrying your shield or lying 
upon it words with fresh meaning for returning governor michael 
dukakis 
now that voters have sent the governor home to massachusetts from 
the battlefield of national politics he may need a shield to 
protect himself from the secondguessing delayed revenge and flat 
out sense of disappointment felt by an ambivalent populace and an 
openly restive legislature 
its going to be unpleasant state rep william galvin a 
boston democrat who is part of the house leadership said of 
dukakis return to the statehouse 
others compare dukakis plight to the boston red sox another 
home team that fell short this year in pursuit of a national title 
boston can be a fickle town and having done no better in the big 
leagues than the baseball team dukakis could be in for a long cold 
winter 
even before tuesdays voting speculation was rampant in the 
statehouse hallways about dukakis future in massachusetts two 
years remain in his gubernatorial term 
most observers said he would be well advised to keep his options 
open to avoid the political weakness of a lame duck if he chooses 
to seek an unprecedented fourth term in 1990 dukakis would probably 
scare off a few politicians but he could still face challengers 
just two years after winning a landslide reelection dukakis 
held onto his home state in the presidential voting by just 8 
percent over bush he fell far short of the 35 percent margin he ran 
up in the 1986 governors race 
to make matters worse massachusetts voters endorsed a ballot 
question repealing a 1987 government payraise package that will 
cost dukakis 10000 
wednesday could be even worse than tuesday said galvin 
citing the states fiscal problems including last weeks news of 
tax collections falling behind projections and the states overdraft 
at the bank of boston last month by as much as 190 million 
but john devillars the governors deputy chief of staff 
maintained that dukakis was in good shape before he lost to 
republican george bush 
he cited the governors endorsement by the boston globe the 
administrations success in sustaining dukakis budget vetoes and 
the signing of an auto insurance reform bill along lines proposed by 
dukakis 
but the governors aide acknowledged that the states revenue and 
cashmanagement problems would force dukakis to make some very 
tough choices and momentarily unpopular decisions 
publicly the states leading democrats closed ranks behind 
dukakis late tuesday with boston mayor raymond flynn saying dukakis 
had nothing to be ashamed of and state party chairman rep 
chester atkins adding hes really put his all on the line and i 
would hope thats appreciated and rewarded 
but republican david locke the state senate minority leader and 
a massachusetts cochairman for bush saw a seething discontent 
within the democratic party for dukakis 
locke said most bay state politicians have gone easy on dukakis 
in recent months because they knew he was going to be either 
president or governor and elected officials did not want to get on 
the wrong side now though locke said his colleagues in the 
legislature smell blood in the water 
the problem according to most observers is not ideological 
instead dukakis appears to be the victim of his status as a chief 
executive and of his own political style 
as governor he is a lightning rod for all sorts of discontent 
and gets blamed for everything from unheated subways to a potential 
budget deficit caused by giving massachusetts residents a tax break 
last year if theres a blizzard this winter hell get blamed for 
it galvin said 
locke cited the governors arrogance his aloofness from the 
crowd as a factor hes never been one of the boys 
consequently i do not think he has the broad base of goodwill that 
others in his position might have 
as he slid in the national polls dukakis also took a battering 
at home throughout september and october 
a majority of house members voted to override his budget vetoes 
the boston herald ran a threepart frontpage endorsement of bush 
a federal court ruled that the governor could not block national 
guard training assignments and the state had to borrow another 225 
million to pay its bills

george bush likely will open his presidency by 
offering an olive branch to congress calling a summit with nato 
allies and seeking an early meeting with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev so each can size up the other 
moreover bush promises a global conference about the 
environment a hemispheric summit on illegal drugs and a meeting 
with the nations governors to discuss educational standards 
yet whatever bush hopes to accomplish with all these meetings is 
mostly a mystery hidden by the cloud of campaign smoke from 
emotional issues such as gun control and the pledge of allegiance 
even some republican strategists are puzzled about his aims 
now that hes gotten elected hes got to figure out what are 
the critical issues he wants to deal with said thomas griscom 
onetime white house communications chief for president reagan 
it aint gonna be about willie horton and the american flag 
griscom said horton was the massachusetts murderer whose furlough 
from prison was used by bush as a symbol of michael dukakis 
supposedly soft stand on crime 
lyn nofziger who was reagans first white house political 
director said of bush i think he likes the idea of being 
president i dont think he has any bold ideas 
griscom observed maybe you dont have to have broad sweeping 
ideas maybe stability is enough 
in 73 days bush will take the oath of office his presidency 
promises to be a change largely of style rather than substance bush 
made his campaign a referendum on reagans stewardship and pledged 
to stay the course with minor changes 
a president known as the great communicator will be replaced by 
one who acknowledges hes not a great speaker and may lack charisma 
there may be some surprises especially in staffing the bush 
administration after all no one expected bush to pick sen dan 
quayle as his running mate 
and when bush takes the oath of office three liberal judges on 
the supreme court will be 80 years old bush has promised to appoint 
moderate persons of conservative views 
whatever is on his agenda bush will have to deal with a congress 
still firmly in the hands of democrats there is a widespread 
expectation bush will try to make peace with the democrats after a 
nasty campaign 
his problem is that theres going to be virtually no 
honeymoon said gop consultant david keene the democrats in 
congress are of the opinion that the republicans took over in 1980 
and they had their honeymoon and now its business as usual and 
partisan warfare from day one 
bush pledged tuesday night ill do my level best to reach out 
and work constructively with the united states congress 
bush whose political anchor has never been set in concrete 
promises to bring to the white house a less ideological brand of 
leadership than reagan 
he likely will be more of a handson manager than reagan more 
involved in the daytoday operation of government but not as deeply 
absorbed in the mechanics as jimmy carter was 
bush is a delegator he believes that the best way to develop 
goals and get things done is to put the right people in the right 
places 
i suspect that george bush will want a staff that includes sort 
of credentialed experts as opposed to ideological soul mates around 
him said keene who once worked for him 
james a baker iii the former treasury secretary who was bushs 
campaign chairman is expected to play a major role in selecting the 
people and planning the policies for a bush administration 
baker is considered a sure bet to wind up as secretary of state 
former sen john tower of texas has been campaigning hard to be 
secretary of defense 
bush is expected to keep nicholas brady as treasury secretary 
dick thornburgh as attorney general lauro cavazos as education 
secretary and ann mclaughlin as labor secretary or in another 
cabinet post 
craig fuller who is bushs chief of staff is considered a top 
candidate to be white house chief of staff however new hampshire 
gov john sununu also is considered a contender for that job or 
else to be secretary of energy 
the first appointments on bushs postelection agenda are with 
visiting west german chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher on wednesday they both will be in 
washington for talks with reagan 
mrs thatcher would like to see next junes scheduled nato 
foreign ministers meeting upgraded to a full nato summit to develop 
strategy for dealing with a rapidly changing kremlin bush already 
has proposed a nato summit so its likely theyll be talking on the 
same wave length 
that could pave the way for bush to meet with gorbachev bush 
said recently he would like to meet the soviet leader at the 
earliest time so they can size each other up and determine how to 
move ahead with strategic and conventional arms talks and deal with 
other problems 
among the first major domestic problems facing bush are the 
budget deficit and the national debt interest payments alone on the 
debt will hit 160 billion in the fiscal year 1989 
bush has promised to personally lead negotiations with congress 
on deficitreduction and has called for a flexible freeze on all 
federal spending except social security that would allow programs 
including defense to grow no faster than inflation 
but he hasnt said what programs would be cut to free money for 
increases in spending on education and child care that he promised 
during the campaign

federal regulators are growing increasingly 
concerned about the vulnerability of banks participating in 
leveraged buyouts or corporate takeovers in which the buyer 
uses mostly borrowed funds to make the acquisition 
a spokeswoman for the office of the comptroller of the currency 
which regulates 4450 nationally chartered banks said tuesday that 
the agencys examiners will receive new guidelines within the next 
several weeks requiring them to evaluate financial institutions 
risk from making loans in leveraged buyouts 
we want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis of 
exactly what the risks are spokeswoman lee cross said 
leveraged buyouts have become increasingly common in recent years 
amid an explosion of corporate takeovers 
two weeks ago federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
whose agency regulates bank holding companies told the senate 
banking committee he has warned banks making leveraged buyout loans 
to consider borrowers prospects in a range of economic and 
financial circumstances 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures commercial bank deposits has said the 
proliferation of leveraged buyouts is increasing the risk to the 
financial system 
in a leveraged buyout such as kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos 
206 billion bid for rjr nabisco inc an investment group uses 
mostly borrowed money to purchase a company the debt is repaid 
either with the acquired companys cash flow or with money raised by 
the sale of some of its assets 
often the investors are the target companys managers who are 
acting to thwart a threatened takeover by outsiders 
the popularity of such deals and the resulting mushrooming of 
debt has led to concern about the ability of debtburdened companies 
to withstand an economic downturn 
critics of the financing trend say most of the deals have been 
put together since 1982 when the economy began expanding and have 
not been tested by a recession 
if a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn the value of 
its stock falls however a highly leveraged company could be forced 
into bankruptcy after a setback to pay creditors 
according to loan pricing corp a new york company which 
monitors large bank loans to corporations banks have lent 70 
billion to highlyleveraged transactions since mid1987 leveraged 
buyout and takeover lending comprised 59 percent of the banks big 
corporate loans in the julyseptember quarter 
ms cross said the comptrollers office began revising its 
leveraged buyout guidelines after surveying the practices of 11 
large money center banks and five regional institutions in late 
spring and early summer 
we found that so far the banks that have been involved seem to 
have taken a pretty reasonable approach no bank was perfect 
but we did not see any really substantial problems ms cross said 
but she said our concern now is going forward as competition 
in this area heats up 
the new examiniation guidelines will not impose limits on 
leveraged buyout lending but ms cross said they will direct 
examiners to determine if a banks policies include limits on such 
lending as a whole and limits for single deals 
one problem in developing the guidelines is that banks have 
widely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveraged 
lending she said

the highlevel advisory commission on the 
federal budget deficit probably will miss its selfimposed deadline 
for producing a plan to reduce the governments red ink one of the 
panels cochairmen says 
democrat robert strauss says the recommendations from the 
national economic commission may not be delivered to the bush 
administration and congress until march 1 or even later 
the commission will hold a full day of hearings on nov 16 with 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan heading up a list of big 
names expected to testify 
this hearing had been billed as a showcase that would launch the 
panel into a month of intensive deliberations aimed at coming up 
with a deficit reduction plan by dec 21 in time to influence the 
next administrations first budget submission to congress 
but strauss said tuesday those plans will likely be scrapped in 
favor of a more leisurely approach to the budget deliberations if 
that meets the wishes of presidentelect george bush 
the 12member commission created by congress last december was 
viewed by many as offering the best hope of breaking through the 
sevenyear political deadlock over reducing the federal budget 
deficit 
supporters hoped the commission would be able to come up with a 
package of spending cuts and tax increases that would be acceptable 
to congress and the next president 
but bush has already said he will ignore any recommendations for 
higher taxes to reduce the deficit 
at its first meeting last may the commission announced it had 
agreed to an accelerated schedule that would have a final report 
completed by dec 21 so the panels recommendations could help shape 
the bush administrations first budget package the law set a march 
1 deadline while giving the president the option of extending the 
deadline to sept 1 
strauss comments tuesday at a conference sponsored by the 
american stock exchange were the first public confirmation of 
reports that the commission would not meet its selfimposed 
deadline he conceded the panel was going to have a hard time 
coming up with an acceptable package 
two republican members of the panel former defense secretaries 
caspar weinberger and donald rumsfeld want faster growth in 
military spending but at the same time oppose higher taxes 
another panelist dean kleckner president of the american farm 
bureau federation has said he will work to block recommendations 
for tax increases 
in comments to reporters after his speech strauss said he was 
not totally ruling out an attempt by the commission to complete its 
work before christmas but he said such an effort would not be 
launched without approval from bush who will appoint the final two 
members of the panel 
whatever he wants he can have strauss said of the 
presidentelect

the government may seek a search warrant or 
subpoenas to get documents from cornell university before the fbi 
tries to interview the graduate student who is the focus of a 
computer virus probe federal law enforcement sources say 
thomas guidoboni the lawer for robert morris jr said tuesday 
he hasnt been contacted by the fbi since informing the bureau that 
he was representing the 23yearold morris 
the balls in their the fbis court were waiting to hear 
from them said guidoboni 
prior to the morris familys retaining guidoboni the bureau had 
sought to question the student said his father robert morris sr 
of arnold md 
guidoboni said he didnt think well have enough information by 
the end of this week to determine whether to talk to the fbi and 
that he wants to talk more with his client before deciding what 
course of action to take 
the possibility of seeking grand jury subpoenas or a search 
warrant for data at cornell that could shed light on the computer 
virus incident was considered tuesday within the fbi it was 
discarded as being unnecessary and then revived in discussions with 
justice department lawyers said the sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
m stuart lynn the universitys vice president for information 
technologies reiterated that cornell will cooperate fully with the 
investigation

weary but happy after three sleepless final days 
and two years of raising money bob farmer was ready to rest 
farmer the finance guru of michael dukakis campaign helped the 
democratic party raise 56 million five times what walter mondale 
raised in 1984 and a record amount for the traditionally 
cashstrapped party 
i am very happy we provided the democratic party with the 
ability to compete on a level playing field for the first time in 
history with the republicans farmer said at an election night 
party for 500 thrown by his partys finance committee 
the democrats socalled victory fund 88 exceeded its 50 
million target with 325000 donors an average of more than 150 per 
contribution 
but it was the fat cats who mattered most at least 142 
individuals donated 100000 or more many of them greekamericans 
with immigrant roots like the democratic presidential nominee in 
new york state alone greekamericans gave 1 million 
we felt a great deal of pride that one of our own could have a 
chance at bat for the greatest office in the world said john 
catsimatidis a firstgeneration greekamerican and chairman of the 
2 billion red apple supermarket chain 
farmers relentless telephonecalling and other financial

his democratic rivals in the primaries raising 27 million 
by june 30 1987 the campaign already had raised 42 million a 
threemonth record for a democrat

race and that turned out to be true said stanley s shuman a new 
york investment banker and 100000plus contributor who grew up 
with the governor in brookline mass 
the republican party again proved richer raising 92 million

here is the text of president reagans 
thanksgiving proclamation for 1988 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the celebration of thanksgiving day is one of our nations most 
venerable and cherished traditions almost 200 years ago the first 
president of these united states george washington issued the 
first national thanksgiving day proclamation under the constitution 
and recommended to the american people that they be devoted to 
service of that great and glorious being who is the beneficent 
author of all the good that was that is or that will be 
he called upon them to raise prayers and supplications to the 
great lord and ruler of nations not merely for continued 
blessings on our own land but on all rulers and nations that they 
might know good government peace and concord 
a century ago president grover cleveland called for prayers 
and song of praise that would render to god the appreciation of 
the american people for his mercy and for the nation through the 
labor of its farmers shopkeepers and tradesmen 
both of these proclamations included something else as well a 
recognition of our shortcomings and transgressions and our 
dependence in total and in every particular on the forgiveness and 
forbearance of the almighty 
today cognizant of our american heritage of freedom and 
opportunity we are again called to gratitude thanksgiving and 
contrition thanksgiving day summons every american to pause in the 
midst of activity however necessary and valuable to give simple 
and humble thanks to god 
this gracious gratitude is the service of which washington 
spoke it is a service that opens our hearts to one another as 
members of a single family gathered around the bounteous table of 
gods creation the images of the thanksgiving celebrations at 
americas earliest settlement of pilgrim and iroquois confederacy 
assembled in ferstive friendship resonate with even greater power 
in our own day 
people from every race culture and creed on the face of the 
earth now inhabit this land their presence illuminates the basic 
yearning for freedom peace and prosperity that has always been the 
spirit of the new world 
in this year when we as a people enjoy the fruits of economic 
growth and international cooperation let us take time both to 
remember the sacrifices that have made this harvest possible and the 
needs of those who do not fully partake of its benefits 
the wonder of our agricultural abundance must be recalled as the 
work of farmers who under the best and worst of conditions give 
their all to raise food upon the land the gratitude that fills our 
being must be tempered with compassion for the needy 
the blessings that are ours must be understood as the gift of a 
loving god whose greatest gift is healing let us join then with 
the psalmist of old 
o give thanks to the lord call on his name 
make known his deeds among the peoples 
sing to him sing praises to him 
tell of all his wonderful works 
glory in his holy name 
let the hearts of those who seek the lord rejoice

the networks leaped up in the middle of the first 
act of tuesday nights election drama and shouted the butler did 
it 
once again television projected the winner in the presidential 
race thanks to those dreaded exit polls before many voters had a 
chance to cast their ballots 
cbs led the way at 917 pm est an hour and 43 minutes before 
polls closed on the west coast abc followed at 920 nbc was the 
most restrained of the big three waiting until 1030 to call the 
race for george bush cnn called it at 1042 based on counted votes 
abcs computer did misfire calling maryland for dukakis the 
network later retracted the projection and put it in bushs column 
network projections based on sophisticated exit polling 
interviews with voters who have already cast ballots have been a 
controversy since 1980 when nbc called the race for ronald reagan 
at 815 there were reports from california of voters walking off 
lines at polling places figuring their votes didnt count anymore 
the critics complaint is that those voters could have made a 
difference if not in the presidential race then in local races and 
referenda 
the networks will argue the projections are news they are news 
news created by the networks whats next seeding clouds then 
breathlessly reporting rain 
election night is getting to be an exercise in anticlimax the 
pollcrazy networks as well as the rest of the news media called 
the race days if not weeks ago abc led its sunday newscast with a 
projection that 439 electoral votes were in or leaning toward bushs 
column while dukakis could count 30 cbs news on election day 
morning led with a poll showing bush leading dukakis by 9 percent 
then tuesday night the networks reported low turnout in many 
states and sent correspondents out into the field to ask voters why 
they were so apathetic 
polls are like predicting the sex of the baby some of us would 
rather wait to find out after nature takes its course 
over at cnns waiting room there was more traditional pacing 
cnn called races the oldfashioned way they stuck their neck out 
and guessed based on small percentages of the vote already counted 
cnns reporting was superb it covered issues region by region 
examined key congressional races interviewed key politicians races 
were called with all appropriate speed but it was leisurely 
informative good ol reporting 
and it entertained cnns bumpers were beautifully edited 
snippets from the years campaign coverage enough to make even the 
most cynical voter look back a little mistily dukakis throwing a 
football cut to bush catching one bush staring into a fish tank 
surrounded by kindergarteners insisting i can talk to fish 
dukakis gritting his teeth while an insistent tot yanks painfully on 
his tie 
over on cbs dan rather was slinging the similes like well an 
anchorman on election night george bush is sweeping through the 
south like a tornado through a trailer park some of these 
senate races are crackling like a hickory fire occasionally one 
got away bush is jumping off like a rabbit with a a real fast 
headstart 
since the primaries dan has expanded into metaphors however 
the buzzards are beginning to circle over dukakis chances 
george bush turns out to be the best milker on the farm in 
nebraska 
after cbs had called the race rather assured voters their 
ballots still counted let me pause and say that is our cbs news 
estimate our headline of the moment is that george bush has 
been elected he said it does make a difference those of you 
in states where polls havent closed whether you vote 
minutes later he was asking jesse jackson how it felt now that 
the democratic ticket was not only going to lose but going to be 
absolutely swamped 
aware that his competition had long since called it nbcs tom 
brokaw seemed to go slightly haywire at one point declaring that 
123 states had gone to george bush 
fifteen minutes after calling the race based on exit polls abcs 
peter jennings offered what almost amounted to an apology on the 
air remarking to colleague david brinkley i must confess im 
feeling a bit defensive 
on cnn where such things could be spouted former network 
correspondent linda ellerbee vented her spleen at exit polling and 
the networks scoop mentality echoing chicago columnist mike 
roykos suggestion of 1984 she called for rightthinking citizens 
to foil pollsters by fibbing to them 
you lie your head off she suggested from one end of the 
ballot to the other from sea to shining sea imagine if television 
called the wrong winner maybe we cant teach television manners 
but we can teach it a little humility

george bush owes his victory to the votes of 
white american males if women and blacks had had their way 
michael dukakis would be presidentelect today 
that picture emerged from exit polls the networks conducted with 
tens of thousands of voters tuesday 
the republican vice president stitched together much of the old 
reagan coalition despite some defections that allowed his 
democratic rival to make a far more respectable showing than jimmy 
carter in 1980 or walter mondale in 1984 
the exit polls showed bushs strong suits were the economy a 
strong defense and experience he routed dukakis in the south but 
the democrat ran strongly in the west 
nbc news pollster sheldon gawiser said the economy was foremost 
in voters minds people are pretty pleased with the way things 
are he said 
an abc news exit poll of 22000 voters found bush was the choice 
of men 5444 percent while women preferred dukakis 5247 blacks 
went for dukakis 899 but they were only 8 percent of those polled 
by abc 
bush carried the white vote 5544 percent while dukakis won the 
hispanic vote 6831 according to abc which said its poll had a 
margin of error of two percentage points 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts drew high marks for his 
vision concern for the poor and honesty but fewer people were 
concerned about those qualities 
dukakis got 52 percent of the bluecollar vote once a gimme for 
the democrats bush got 47 percent 
voters from union households went for dukakis 6732 while 
people with no family tie to a union were in bushs camp 5346 abc 
said 
dotty lynch chief political editor for cbs said dukakis fell 
down in the industrial rust belt areas the yuppier areas he did 
well in 
the cbsnew york times poll of more than 10000 voters with a 
twopoint margin of error also showed bush winning among men 
5543 and losing among women 5148 
what basically happened was that dukakis failed to carry men 
and his margin with women was not enough to offset the problem 
said lynch 
in the abc poll one voter in four cited the candidates 
experience as a foremost issue and they went with bush 936 
those who felt strongly the presidential candidate cares about 
people like me were dukakis supporters 8712 
a third of those polled by abc said the abortion issue was very 
important they went for bush 5445 one in nine said prison 
furloughs were a very important issue they were for bush 8316 
among the oneinfive who ranked social security among the uppermost 
issues dukakis was the choice 5939 abc said 
cbss lynch felt the crime issue worked for bush in the cbsnew 
york times poll of more than 10000 voters 25 percent of bush 
voters cited crime as a top reason for voting for bush 
dukakis gained back some of the roman catholic votes that 
deserted the democrats for reagan catholics chose dukakis 5446 
and jews went with the democrat 7128 according to abc but bush 
pulled a formidable 5940 majority of the protestant vote 
bush pulled in 16 percent of the democrats vote less than 
reagans 24 percent and carried the independents 5345 while 
dukakis got 8 percent of the republicans abc said 
bush won handily among collegegraduates 5643 while dukakis 
carried those with only a high school diploma 5148 and dropouts 
6237 abc said 
dukakis won 5841 among voters from families making less than 
20000 a year bush won those in the 20000to40000 bracket by 
5148 and those above 40000 by 5841 
bush won among voters in their late 20s and 50s and led narrowly 
among those in their 30s and 40s abc said while dukakis had a 
narrow edge among the youngest voters under 25 and oldest 60 or 
older 
an abc analyst who asked that his name not be used said 
clearly the american electorate made up its mind early while 
dukakis got up to 62 percent of the votes of those who made up their 
minds in the races closing days bush won 5346 among the 
4outof5 voters who decided more than a week ago 
bushs choice of dan quayle the 41yearold indiana senator 
apparently changed few votes the polls indicated 
in the nbcwall street journal poll of 11700 voters with a 
threepoint margin of error opinion was evenly divided on reagans 
economic policies among those who thought they were doing better 
than eight years ago 84 percent backed bush of those doing worse 
80 percent backed dukakis 
this is very much an economic election people are in fact 
voting their pocketbooks said gawiser 
by 5044 percent voters in the nbcjournal poll said they wanted 
the country to change rather than continue its course bush got 91 
percent of those who opposed change dukakis got 82 percent of those 
who favored change

percent to 49 percent in 1986 this time ms williams lost by a 
5743 margin 
in a strong challenge to incumbency nita lowey a former new 
york assistant secretary of state was running slightly ahead of 
twoterm republican rep joseph dioguardi but thousands of absentee 
ballots remained to be counted lowey declared victory and retired 
for the night but dioguardi refused to concede and admonished 
stick by me were not finished yet 
in washington democratic state legislator jolene unsoeld was

it started quietly with a few cans of sweet corn 
illegally sold on sunday but before long the contraband bought 
from cape cod retailers grew to include carrots and green beans and 
the case wound up in massachusetts highest court 
i knew which items to buy because i checked with the da 
state trooper james palth said with a wink 
the case went before the massachusetts supreme court on tuesday 
several plainclothes officers including palth caught a number 
of retail stores in the act of violating the states blue laws 
which were imposed by the puritans about 1650 and restrict retail 
sales on sunday the legislated day of rest 
in some towns we found no violations but some stores chose to 
stay open and were taken to court palth said most violators 
resolved the issue in district court by paying a 40 fine he said 
but the great atlantic amp pacific tea co whose aampp stores 
allegedly violated the blue laws took exception to the code 
a lot of people might want to buy their canned carrots on 
sunday and thats fine said thomas yonce assistant district 
attorney in the cape cod city of barnstable prosecutors in the 
case were basically just looking for guidance from the highest court 
in the state as to the meaning of the particular clause in 
question 
at issue is the interpretation of a blue laws amendment which 
was adopted in 1982 and aampp attorneys argue liberalized 
restrictions placed on sunday retail sales 
attorneys for the supermarket chain maintain stores that are 
authorized to sell one exempt item such as a newspaper or film are 
authorized to sell any and all items without restriction 
if thats the case then anyone that sells film is now 
exempt associate justice paul liacos on tuesday told attorney 
evan t lawson who presented the defendants briefs do you think 
thats what the legislature had in mind 
attorneys agree the amendment is vague it specifies only that 
any store or shop which qualifies for exemption under this clause 
but does not qualify for exemption under any other clause in this 
section shall not open for business on sunday prior to the hour of 
noon 
the supreme court took the matter under advisement and plans to 
issue a ruling later 
the case puts the state in a winwin situation yonce said the 
commonwealth cant lose in this case he said it will clarify 
the legal issues 
attorney eugene richards who helped prepare the case for law 
firm lawson amp wayne in boston said more was at stake for his client 
it is humorous in a way but its an important issue to the aampp 
in that its a big service for the stores to be open on sunday 
morning particularly in summer when people want to shop before 
going to the beach he said they do a tremendous amount of 
business in the mornings and on the weekends 
lt john symington of the dennis police department on the cape 
said his officers were duty bound to enforce the law when they 
received a complaint 
however symington said that in at least one case retail 
competitors tipped authorities off to the blue law violation 
theres always been a great amount of controversy over the blue 
laws he said retail establishments feel they shouldnt be in 
place but id say its a dangerous thing for police agencies to 
determine what laws are or arent going to be enforced based on 
their perceived popularity

democrats rode a tidal wave of incumbent 
victories to renewed control of the house of representatives tuesday 
as voters turned out a democratic chairman dogged by ethical 
controversy and a twoterm republican under indictment 
by early morning democrats appeared likely to pad their 257178 
margin of control perhaps by as many as four seats a 
recordbreaking 99 percent of incumbents were reelected or leading 
compared to 98 percent in 1986

california voters on tuesday overwhelmingly 
rejected an emotionally charged aids initiative which would have 
forced doctors to report aids patients and required health 
professionals to trace others who might have infected 
but a second aids measure proposition 96 was approved by voters 
by 636 percent to 364 percent margin it will allow aids testing 
of people arrested for certain crimes 
the approved measure was designed by los angeles county sheriff 
sherman block to help protect rape victims and law enforcement 
officials who fear they may have been exposed to aids or other 
communicable diseases 
i think the voters have rejected the introduction of politics 
into public health in california said dr michael gottlieb an 
aids research pioneer who resigned from gov george deukmeijians 
aids commission after the governor backed proposition 102 
with 393 percent of precincts reporting proposition 102 whose 
main supporter was former tax rebel paul gann who is now suffering 
from aids failed by 639 percent to 361 percent 
homosexuals expressed disappointment at the success of 96 and 
peaceful marches were staged both in san francisco and in los 
angeles about 1500 homosexuals and supporters marched to the state 
building near san francisco city hall and about 30 people marched in 
the west hollywood area 
susan jester southern california campaign manager of the no on 
102 campaign credited a coalition of gay groups and medical 
professionals for the propositions defeat 
once again the voters of california have said no to an 
initiative that was meanspirited and illadvised and have given the 
california medical association and aids researchers their vote of 
confidence she said 
rep william dannemeyer rfullerton sponsor of proposition 102 
said the cornerstone of being able to deal with an epidemic is 
reportability in confidence to public health authorities 
he said he would press for adoption of a similar policy next 
year he did not say what form his move would take

scot ebbinghaus knew he wanted to be a 
doctor when he graduated from high school in 1982 but he hoped to 
begin his medical education immediately rather than spend four years 
at a liberal arts college 
ebbinghaus applied to university of missourikansas citys school 
of medicine whose concentrated program turns freshmen into 
physicians in just six years 
the school gave me the ideal opportunity to get right into 
medicine he said recently and i liked the idea of not having 
to reapply for medical school after four years in college 
the school has been attracting students like ebbinghaus since 
1971 when dr e grey dimond organized a program that still is 
considered significantly different from typical medical education 
i felt from the beginning that the country needed a different 
approach to training our doctors dimond said i think our 
program anticipated some of the problems that are being discussed 
today our results our students have shown this program can work 
today there are about 25 sixyear medical schools in the united 
states 
missourikansas city differs from most by giving students 
clinical experience early in the first week of classes and in 
its socalled docent system 
students are organized into small groups with a permanently 
assigned physicianteacher called a docent each docent is assigned 
12 students and follows them throughout their educations 
docent teams make rounds together for two months of each of the 
last four years fifth and sixthyear students within the groups 
are assigned third and fourthyear students as partners 
ebbinghaus a sixthyear student has been paired with thirdyear 
student barbara bumberry 
it is nice to have one central figure who can be an adviser and 
a role model she said and having scot as a partner helps 
because it hasnt been that long since hes been in my shoes 
sometimes its easier to talk to someone closer to your age 
students in the program learn a way of life not just medical 
facts said dr stephen hamburger assistant dean of the medical 
school and chairman of the department of medicine 
much of medical knowledge changes about every five years he 
said so we try to integrate the factual knowledge with a personal 
sense of being a good doctor of knowing how to be a problem solver 
and how to best help a patient 
in order to earn a bachelor of arts degree and a medical degree 
in six years students attend classes 11 months each year and have 
some classes on saturday 
we were not trying to create a lightweight quick school 
dimond said the 11 months was a deliberate decision its one way 
to get medicine into their bones it helps them mature rather than 
letting them spin off into summer ennui every year 
in the past five years the school has averaged about 450 
applicants it accepts 100 students every year based on class rank 
standardized test scores extracurricular activities and interviews 
with a physician and a lay person 
about 825 percent of the students graduate and all pass their 
national board of medical examiners examinations the school said 
we have been rich with brilliant students said dimond but 
we cant objectively measure our success yet we want them to become 
leaders among physicians that is still down the road a little but 
we think that goal will be reached

cartels us operations could easily flee and live abroad a

might have used panamanian banks to stash some of the millions of 
dollars he is accused of making through the medellin cartel 
us district judge thelton henderson took the nobail request

tapes of conversations in which two codefendants and an undercover 
drug agent discuss pradas activities

oct 19 in connection with a cocaine ring authorities said imported 
as much as a ton of cocaine into the united states per month

import cocaine the defendants are from san francisco los angeles 
miami new york and phoenix 
pradas bail originally was set at 350000 then raised to 1 
million 
lyons sait that according to the taped conversations prada 
received a 2 million annual salary from the cartel and worked to 
lower bail for eight colombians arrested on drug charges then 
helped them escape to south america on flights he arranged 
in one conversation lyons said prada talked about buying planes 
under the table to import cocaine in another a codefendant 
allegedly said prada had worked five years for the cartel and its 
chieftain colombian soccer team owner and codefendant jose 
rodriguezgacha who is a fugitive 
codefendant paul eugene smith a private investigator who 
sometimes worked for prada also is reported to say on a tape that 
prada had stashed some of his drug earnings in panamanian banks

the soviet union said today that it expected to be 
able to work for peace and disarmament with george bush who it 
characterized as a close follower of president reagan 
the official news agency tass reported in a brief dispatch early 
today that bush had won tuesdays us presidential election 
in a later broadcast official radio moscow said the soviet 
union proceeds from the understanding that a dialogue between the 
two countries will be continued with a new administration in the 
interests of nuclear disarmament and world peace 
it said observers noted that the election of bush was decided 
first and foremost by the improvement in the national economy 
which took place lately under the present administration a 
reduction of inflation and the number of jobless 
radio moscow said bush had promised during the campaign to follow 
reagans course in both domestic and foreign policy including 
ussoviet relations 
improving superpower relations helped bush but so did his 
promise of a strong america the radio report said in contrast it 
said democrat michael dukakis was portrayed as a liberal who was 
weak on foreign policy issues 
the soviet media had not expressed a preference for either 
candidate 
we prefer the winner foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov told a briefing last week 
he said the soviets would like a prompt summit meeting with the 
next us president something observers in washington say bush 
would like as well 
the two sides reached agreement on a treaty to eliminate both 
superpowers intermediaterange nuclear missiles but talks have 
slowed considerably as the reagan administration comes to a close 
and the us focus turned to selecting his replacement

voters in michigan arkansas and colorado dealt a 
blow to prochoice forces by overwhelmingly approving bans on 
taxfinanced abortions for poor women 
prior to tuesdays election prochoice advocates had lost only 
one of 22 referendums around the country 
in michigan the measure banning statefunded abortions won by a 
6040 margin with 36 percent of the vote counted early today 
antiabortion and prochoice forces waged an intense struggle 
over the proposal which ends the expenditure of 58 million a year 
for about 18600 abortions for lowincome women passage of the 
measure makes michigan the 37th state to refuse to pay for the 
procedures 
barbara listing chairwoman of the committee to end taxfunded 
abortions said the vote showed michigan voters commitment to the 
unborn child 
the victory is truly a grass roots victory the people in the 
communities have won despite opposition from the gov james 
blanchard administration and despite the opposition from the 
abortion industry both here in michigan and also nationwide she 
said 
coloradans endorsed a ban on state funding of abortion by nearly 
a 21 margin 
in a much closer vote arkansas voters approved a similar 
amendment which also established as state policy the protection of 
unborn children the states voters had turned down a similar ballot 
issue in 1986 by just 519 votes 
were elated said rob shafer of the unborn child amendment 
committee one of the measures chief authors there is no way to 
measure the sacrifices made the personal sacrifice of time to 
circulate petitions it was a grassroots effort we didnt have the 
budget we relied on our supporters 
with 95 percent of the precincts reporting the vote for the 
amendment was 382161 or 52 percent to 354926 or 48 percent 
prochoice forces in michigan refused to concede defeat early 
today but an official of one national group watching the vote said 
lowincome women will suffer 
in essence its tough on poor women and its tragic said 
eleanor smeal president of the fund for a feminist majority 
were going to come back were not going to desert poor women 
were going to keep fighting until we have choice for all classes

his resume crowned with an unsurpassing entry 
george bush now confronts the challenge of matching it with 
performance as 41st president of the united states 
after a bitter campaign the presidentelect must take command of 
a divided government so burdened with debt that options are scarce 
with a long agenda of problems that cannot wait and with little 
guidance from the voters because they seldom were consulted on the 
issues of governing 
and bush the multijob republican appointee who became an 
eightyear understudy must prove that his resume of government jobs 
has prepared him for the presidency as president reagan said it had 
for the first time since he left congress 18 years ago bush is 
beholden to no boss except the voters he hasnt told them a lot 
about what he intends to do but he must tell them soon 
symbolism slogans and lip readings wont suffice they belong to 
a campaign that never did turn kinder gentler or very instructive 
about either candidates blueprint for the future 
bush won a hefty majority of tuesdays popular vote and that 
translated into an electoral vote landslide with it he overcame 
what hed jokingly called the curse of martin van buren the last 
sitting vice president elected president 152 years ago 
bush captured about 54 percent of the popular vote and 426 of 
the 538 electoral votes that actually elect a president 
conceding defeat in boston gov michael dukakis promised to 
cooperate with bush this nation faces major challenges ahead and 
we must work together he said at the same time he noted 
pointedly that congress remained solidly democratic on both sides 
of the capitol 
bush is well aware of that ill do my level best to reach out 
and work constructively with the united states congress he said 
hell have to do without the kind of political clout reagan 
carried during his first term reagans 1980 election helped fashion 
republican gains in congress and produced a gop senate majority 
that lasted six years bush showed no such coattails while his 
republican ticket was winning the democrats were strengthening 
their congressional majorities a bit 
clearly the first mission for the presidentelect was to bury 
the hatchet hed been using on dukakis all fall in a campaign that 
concentrated on negatives on showing that the other candidate 
didnt deserve the job 
democratic grudges wont be forgotten soon so the bush 
peacemaking effort is not going to be easy he wasted no time in 
getting started his electionnight celebration was a rally with a 
sermon 
a campaign is a disagreement and disagreements divide he 
told supporters in houston but an election is a decision and 
decisions clear the way for harmony and peace and i mean to be 
president of all the people 
he said he would seek to be worthy of the trust of his supporters 
and to earn the trust of his opponents my hand is out to you 
he said i want to be your president too 
the policy proposals so lacking in the campaign fare will have to 
follow quickly bush must fill in the blanks in his oxymoronic 
flexible freeze of the federal budget he still has some 
persuading to do to convince even republicans that the deficit can 
be curbed with read my lips no new taxes 
one campaign specific was his call for a cut in the capital gains 
tax which dukakis denounced as a tax break for the rich bush said 
it would spur investment and create jobs now he will have to make 
that case to congress and in particular to chairman lloyd bentsen 
of the senate finance committee while losing as democratic vice 
presidential nominee bentsen was overwhelmingly reelected to the 
senate in texas 
candidate bush promised to maintain the foreign policy and 
economic achievements he credited to reagans leadership reagan 
said the new gop administration has a mandate to continue the 
changes that create jobs prosperity and peace for all americans 
presidentelect bush must define the changes he will indeed 
continue and those he will change

americans stayed away from the polls in droves 
again this year probably pushing voter turnout levels below that of 
the 1948 election when 511 percent of eligible voters cast ballots 
preliminary figures showed today 
voter turnout could even dip below the 50 percent mark said 
curtis gans director of the committee for the study of the american 
electorate a nonpartisan nonprofit research and public policy 
organization 
gans predicted turnout would end up between the level of the 1948 
election and the low reached in the 1924 election pegged at around 
48 percent to 49 percent 
we had a horrible election in a variety of ways and the 
people responded accordingly he said there are a combination 
of factors like people feeling their vote doesnt make a 
difference a declining allegiance to political parties and the 
conduct and coverage of the campaign 
gans based his preliminary prediction on analysis of 29 states 
and the district of columbia that by early wednesday had 90 percent 
or more precincts reporting 
with the exception of possibly mississippi and new hampshire 
which may equal their turnout in 1984 but not substantially exceed 
it in every other state and the district of columbia turnout is 
down and sharply in some he said 
gans said it was unclear whether the television networks early 
calls of the election had any effect on turnout in western states 
cbs the first network to proclaim bush the winner called the 
race at 917 pm est an hour and 43 minutes before polls closed on 
the west coast gans noted that in 1984 and 1980 the networks 
called the race twoandahalf to three hours before the polls 
closed in the west 
gans said the apparent decline broadly reflected voting patterns 
of the past three decades 
weve had a sliding turnout since 1960 with the exception of a 
slight uptick in 1984 he said 
turnout was 531 percent in the last presidential election 
slightly up from the 526 percent in 1980 after steadily declining 
since 1948 the year of harry s trumans upset victory over thomas 
e dewey 
weve had nothing but negative elections since 1964 on the 
presidential level he said americans went to the polls to vote 
against the vietnam war against watergate and against jimmy carter 
among other things he said 
he said voters are also turned off by images of government 
officials being sent off to jail and by television coverage that 
makes people spectators to politics instead of participants 
ive seen people turn out in high numbers in a few isolated 
races in recent years and they all had something in common he 
said people will vote when they have something to vote about 
when theres something important to decide 
but increasingly nonvoting is becoming a rational act and 
a response and protest to the politics they see

pollsters said voters cited their belief that the economy was 
doing well as the major reason they opted to continue republican 
control of the white house 
this is very much an economic election said nbc news 
pollster sheldon gawiser people are in fact voting their 
pocketbooks 
bush worked off a solid southern base and picked off several of 
the northern industrial states essential to dukakis dream of an 
upset 
when ohio michigan and new jersey fell into the republican 
column it was apparent that bush was headed for victory then he 
scored a narrow victory in pennsylvania once considered part of the 
democratic base and closed with a narrow win in california 
pickings were slim for dukakis he carried his home state of 
massachusetts and the solidly democratic district of columbia then 
rhode island new york minnesota iowa west virginia wisconsin 
oregon washington and hawaii voted for him 
twelve states elected governors and democrats replaced 
republicans in indiana and west virginia in montana the republican 
was leading in the race to succeed democratic gov ted schwinden 
who did not seek reelection 
two other republican senate losers were david karnes of nebraska 
who was trounced by former gov bob kerrey and chic hecht of nevada 
defeated by gov richard bryan 
former democratic gov charles robb of virginia easily defeated 
republican maurice dawkins in a race for the seat being vacated by 
republican paul trible 
republican rep trent lott won the seat of retiring democratic 
sen john stennis of mississippi that deep south state will have 
two republican senators for the first time in this century 
house seats proved safe for incumbents with 99 percent winning 
new terms 
the most prominent loser was banking committee chairman fernand 
st germain dri whose bid for a 15th term was shaken by 
disclosure of a justice department document which cited 
substantial evidence of serious and sustained misconduct in the 
congressmans dealings with financial industry lobbyists 
another loser was twoterm georgia republican pat swindall who 
was under indictment for perjury he lost to democrat ben jones a 
recovered alcoholic who played cooter in the television series 
dukes of hazzard 
despite a 4 million campaign by the national rifle association 
maryland voters overwhelmingly endorsed a law banning cheap handguns 
voters in michigan and colorado approved measures banning use of 
state funds for abortions massachusetts voters rejected a proposal 
that would have shut down the states two nuclear power plants 
bushs victory culminated a quest that began in 1979 early in 
1980 he upset favored reagan in the iowa caucuses only to be 
crushed a month later in the new hampshire primary 
bush was reagans 11th hour choice for a running mate the gop 
victory over incumbent democratic president jimmy carter placed bush 
firmly in the shadow of one of the nations most popular presidents 
for the next eight years 
giving reagan total loyalty the vice president won his bosss 
gratitude and the grudging support of many conservatives holdouts 
on the republican right looked for alternative candidates for the 
presidential nomination but when the battle was joined in 1988 none 
could overcome bushs identification with reagan 
i felt like i was running against reagan complained dole 
after a series of primary election defeats earlier this year 
the son of an investment banker from greenwich conn bush was 
derided early in the campaign as a wimp and as a politician with no 
vision of his own but he underwent a remarkable transformation at 
the republican convention 
after trailing dukakis in the polls early in the summer bush 
went on the attack and by labor day the race had changed 
dramatically the democratic candidate paid a heavy political price 
for refusing to respond to the attacks on his record on crime and 
the environment as well as on his patriotism 
by the time dukakis shifted his tactics it was too late and bush 
was on his way to victory

with a full heart and great hopes george herbert walker bush 
today claimed a presidential mandate from american voters who 
tempered his triumph by strengthening the democratic oppositions 
control of congress 
after a campaign in which many voters expressed dismay over their 
choice between bush and democrat michael dukakis the 
presidentelect vowed to work for the respect of those who opposed 
him and moved to spell out some of his plans for his presidency 
he planned a news conference today in houston and then a trip to 
washington to talk over the election and the future with ronald 
reagan in the oval office 
bush won the election easily the third straight convincing 
republican presidential victory but he fell short of the 49state 
sweep by ronald reagan four years ago 
that was little consolation for the democrats who now have lost 
five of the last six presidential elections 
he will be our president and well work with him dukakis 
said tuesday night in a gracious yet unbowed concession speech 
god knows theres lots of work to do said the republican 
presidentelect looking ahead to next january when he will succeed 
reagan after eight years as loyal understudy 
the people have spoken he told cheering supporters in 
houston and with a full heart and with great hopes i thank all 
of the people throughout america who have given us this great 
victory to those who supported me i will try to be worthy of 
your trust and to those that did not i will try to earn it 
bush became the first sitting vice president to win the 
presidency since democrat martin van buren in 1836 an ominous note 
for bush van buren was defeated for reelection 
according to surveys of voters as they left polling places a big 
factor working for bush was the continued popularity of his boss 
speculation was that bush campaign chairman and former treasury 
secretary james a baker iii would be the next secretary of state 
and that current treasury secretary nicholas brady a bush 
confidant would remain in his cabinet job 
attorney general dick thornburgh and education secretary lauro 
cavazos also are good bets to keep their posts in a bush 
administration 
dukakis closed out his campaign with an exhausting 48hour race 
from state to state with no break for sleep all the same he was 
out powerwalking on election day and when he appeared before 
supporters for his concession speech they chanted 92 92 92 
92 
the weary candidate looked not quite ready to plunge into the 
next presidential campaign 
in the popular vote with 93 percent of the precincts reporting 
bush had 44539772 or 54 percent dukakis had 37957059 or 46 
percent 
in the critical tally of electoral votes bush won 40 states for 
426 electoral votes dukakis won 10 states and the district of 
columbia for 112 electoral votes 
but democrats were padding their advantages in both houses of 
congress by two seats in the senate for a 5644 edge and with a 
likely pickup of four more in the house for a 261174 advantage 
there 
not all the storm clouds for the 41st president formed in the 
opposition ranks 
republican senate leader bob dole of kansas lost no time chiding 
bush for not campaigning more for gop senate candidates 
we could have used a little help from the vice president in 
some of those states said dole who waged a bitter fight with 
bush last winter for the republican presidential nomination 
hardline conservatives also were already demanding that bush 
replace thornburgh too moderate for their tastes 
two veteran senators lost their seats republican lowell weicker 
jr of connecticut and democrat john melcher of montana 
weicker a maverick to the end refused to concede to democrat 
joseph lieberman and a recount appeared likely liebermans margin 
in the unofficial count was 4897 votes out of more than 13 million 
cast 
melcher was defeated by republican conrad burns a former farm 
broadcaster 
bush and dukakis ended their campaign noteworthy for its 
bitterness with words of conciliation and cooperation 
bush said he had received a call from dukakis and i want you to 
know he was most gracious his call was personal it was genuinely 
friendly and it was in the great tradition of american politics 
dukakis also referred to the conversation and told his 
supporters this nation faces major challenges ahead and we must 
work together 
the massachusetts governors running mate sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas easily won reelection to the senate seat from the lone star 
state 
bentsen said he and dukakis waged a campaign thats worthy of 
the american people we fought fair and we never quit 
vice presidentelect dan quayle told supporters in washington 
that you need never question the devotion and dedication i will 
bring to this job 
bushs selection of the indiana senator as his running mate was 
one of the most controversial acts of the campaign and one that many 
observers thought would cost the republicans votes but polls showed 
the quayle factor had little impact on the results

pet as a cat or a dog he said theyre a lot more interesting

blacks picked up one house seat and 
congresswomen at least held their ground on election day but both 
groups failed to bolster their ranks in the allwhite mostly male 
senate 
new jersey elected its first black congressman and all 22 
incumbent blacks were returned to the house bringing the total to 
23 for the next congress all are democrats 
all 23 female house members were reelected as well and women 
were ahead in the race for an open seat in washington and possibly 
ousted an incumbent male in new york 
victory eluded the two women and two blacks who sought to join 
the senate meaning the chamber will remain all white and hold 
steady at just two female members 
feminist leader eleanor smeal blamed the slow progress on a 
political system that is weighted in favor of incumbents 
its locking out women and blacks she said weve got to 
do something about the rules these are incumbent protection clubs 
the way the rules are working 
the chairman of the congressional black caucus rep mervyn 
dymally dcalif said the results for blacks were not 
encouraging at all despite the slight gain on tuesday 
the problem is this blacks vote for whites in large numbers in 
the south but whites do not vote for blacks said dymally 
it was a vacancy in washingtons house delegation where 
democratic state legislator jolene unsoeld sought victory she was 
leading republican bill wight in the race to succeed rep don 
bonker who ran unsuccessfully in a senate democratic primary 
and in a strong challenge to incumbency nita lowey a former new 
york assistant secretary of state was ahead of twoterm republican 
rep joseph dioguardi with thousands of absentee ballots yet to be 
counted 
lowey declared victory and retired for the night but dioguardi 
refused to concede and admonished stick by me were not finished 
yet 
women were trailing in two other close races democrat anna eshoo 
was losing to republican tom campbell in californias silicon 
valley and democrat lana pollack was behind rep carl pursell 
rmich 
the best hope for adding another woman to the senate had been 
wisconsin state senate minority leader susan engeleiter a 
republican she was unable to catch democrat herbert kohl owner of 
the milwaukee bucks basketball team although the race narrowed at 
the end 
the other female candidate for the senate republican maria 
hustace was easily defeated by sen spark matsunaga dhawaii 
the two incumbent women in the senate nancy landon kassebaum 
rkan and barbara mikulski dmd were not up for reelection 
in new jersey two blacks had competed to succeed rep peter 
rodino a 40year house veteran and staunch civil rights supporter 
who was pressed to make way for a black congressman in the 
minoritydominated district 
i believe this will make all of the people feel part of 
this great nation said newark councilman donald payne who 
defeated republican michael webb the house of representatives 
should be truly representative 
the only other district where blacks had a good shot at picking 
up a seat was in louisiana where black attorney faye williams 
fought a losing rematch with firstterm rep clyde holloway a white 
republican ms williams lost by a 5743 margin this time compared 
to a 5149 defeat two years ago 
linda williams a political analyst at the joint center for 
political studies which focuses on black political affairs said 
future gains for blacks will be hard to come by since most 
blackdominated districts now have black congressmen 
its going to be slow as a tortoise for a good while to come 
she said it really comes down to blacks winning a lot of white 
votes 
the last black to serve in the senate was edward brooke a 
massachusetts republican who was defeated in 1978 
overall there were 58 women 32 democrats and 25 republicans 
running as majorparty candidates in 55 house districts this year 
and 35 blacks 26 democrats and nine republicans running in 31 
districts 
also reelected was walter fauntroy a black who is the 
nonvoting delegate to congress from the district of columbia

was displayed at the museum will begin its return journey to 
bangkok on thursday 
the ancient lintel will be installed over an entrance to the

the 2by3 foot carving depicting the god vishnu reclining on 
water disappeared from a thai temple in the 1960s and later was 
donated to the art institute by the chicagobased alsdorf foundation 
thailands government has been seeking its return for more than a 
decade but was unable to negotiate a settlement with the art 
institute which wanted other thai objects to display in return 
the cheney foundation which has helped the institute previously 
agreed to provide funds for a piece of comparable artistic merit 
said museum spokeswoman eileen harakal 
after the lintel disappeared from the temple it was purchased by 
a dealer in bangkok who sold it to a new york dealer who finally 
sold it to the alsdorf foundation it was on loan to the art

appeal for a selfproclaimed prophet who said god ordered him to 
kill his sisterinlaw and her infant child 
the states highest court said tuesday it will reopen portions of 
an appeal filed on behalf of condemned killer ronald lafferty 
because the court did not have the complete trial transcript at the 
first hearing

24 1984 throatslashing deaths of his sisterinlaw brenda wright 
lafferty and her 15monthold daughter erica at their american

tentatively scheduled a hearing for early next year the court did 
not indicate if the ruling was unanimous 
in oral arguments monday laffertys attorney michael esplin

laffertys competence to stand trial his waiver of an insanity 
defense and his ability to effectively assist his attorney during 
the 1985 trial 
deputy attorney general sandra sjogren who argued against the 
motion said the missing 550 pages would do nothing to change the

an administrative law judge ruled that the 
star tribune engaged in an unfair labor practice by imposing drug 
and alcohol testing policies without bargaining with the newspapers 
union 
the companys refusal to provide information about the policys 
enforcement at the unions request also constituted an unfair labor 
practice the judge wallace nations said in his ruling last week 
in washington 
such testing meets legal definitions of issues that must be 
negotiated between employers and unions the judge said 
nations recommended the newspaper offer a job to any applicant 
rejected under the policy since it was imposed in january 1987 and 
to pay the applicant for related losses he also recommended that 
the company rescind any punishment that might have been imposed on 
employees under the policy and compensate them for their losses 
diane williams assistant director of the national labor 
relations boards information division said the ruling may set a 
national precedent because the board has not ruled on appeals of 
such matters 
the star tribunes policy requires a medical exam including drug 
and alcohol screening for applicants to whom the company offers a 
job if applicants test positive for drug use the company will 
withdraw the job offer 
under the policy current employees also may be asked to undergo 
screening when management believes job performance or conduct is 
impaired by alcohol or drug abuse 
john dennison vice president of labor relations for the 
newspaper said monday that no employee has been tested under the 
policy since it took effect jan 1 1987 and that he knew of one 
job applicant who had withdrawn after learning about the policy 
the newspaper also was urged by the judge to revoke its drug and 
alcohol testing policies covering applicants and employees in guild 
jobs and to negotiate future policies with the newspaper guild of 
the twin cities the guilds local 2 represents about 350 newsroom 
and circulation employees of the star tribune 
dennison said the company was disappointed by the ruling but had 
not decided whether to appeal to the full nlrb 
joe moore the boards deputy executive secretary said that if 
the company does not appeal nations ruling by dec 1 the board 
will adopt it probably in early december and the recommendations 
will take effect if the company does appeal a panel or the full 
board will consider it

robbery in the 1985 seizure of the athens to rome flight us navy 
diver robert stethem was killed and 39 americans were held hostage 
for 17 days during the ordeal 
the two hijackers were going up and down the plane relieving 
passengers of jewelry they took a diamond ring from me and more 
than 9000 in cash money said former passenger jimmy dell 
palmer a 51yearold american 
palmer an air conditioning technician said he was returning 
from a job in saudi arabia and had been paid in cash 
the hijackers robbed the passengers hamadi conducted the 
search palmer testified i was in fear of my life from the 
beginning i was very scared hamadi seemed to be the leader he 
seemed to be giving orders 
palmer did not provide his hometown under guidelines set by the 
court to protect witnesses palmer lived in little rock ark at 
the time of the hijacking 
hamadis accomplice struck palmer once on the head and he lost 
consciousness briefly the former passenger said the accomplice 
hassan ezzeddine is a fugitive 
hamadis parents fatima and ali hassan hamadi were in the 
spectators section of the courtroom today separated from the 
defendant and judges by bulletproof glass 
on tuesday when his mother entered the heavily guarded courtroom 
in preungesheim prison and began answering questions from the chief 
judge the defendant broke into tears 
i know that my son is innocent i know that hes very young and 
that we live under terrible conditions in beirut hamadis mother

he was born on lebanons independence day nov 22 in 1964 i 
can remember because its a holiday and i did not have to work that 
day the 59yearold father told the court 
the issue of age is important in determining the length of prison 
sentence if mohammed is convicted if he was not yet 21 when the 
hijacking occurred he would receive a more lenient sentence 
prosecutors say mohammed was born june 13 1964 and that he 
turned 21 the day before the hijacking and is not entitled to 
leniency

a police dispatcher has resigned after he 
mistakenly held a call for more than 30 minutes about a house fire 
that killed five people 
police chief mack vines said tuesday the 911 call was received at 
1031 pm sunday but the dispatcher held it believing whoever was 
on the other end had hung up 
fire trucks responded at 1107 pm after a neighbor reported the 
fire 
killed were mary graham 75 two of her grandchildren and two of 
her greatgrandchildren officials said 
dispatcher james d mercer was in his fifth week of six weeks of 
dispatch training 
mercer called his failure to act swiftly a mistake that he 
blamed on inexperience 
i feel very distraught and very sad he said 
this was a priority one call and i should have dispatched it 
earlier but i neglected to mercer said 
the dispatcher said he had no available patrol cars to send at 
first and then overlooked it as other calls came in i had 
held calls like that before everybody does you have to when you 
dont have officers available many times in the five weeks that 
ive been there weve been 15 to 20 calls behind there are not 
enough offices to answer the calls 
vines said he doesnt know if quicker action could have saved any 
of the victims 
its difficult to say obviously because we dont know the 
time of death the time or origin of the fire vines said but 
we are an emergency center and we are compelled to dispatch people 
on an emergency basis

the resignations of key proponents including walter cronkite 
seventeen states have now passed laws or amendments designating 
english their official language 
in florida where the us justice department had joined 
unsuccessful efforts to remove the measure from the ballot 84 
percent of voters decided to declare english the official state 
language with 98 percent of the tally in opponents had complained 
that petitions werent circulated in spanish in six of floridas 67

especially high in florida 
we want to turn the heat on this one and try to slow it down 
said jeff browne statewide coordinator of speak up now for florida 
which opposes the amendment if it passes in florida i think it 
makes texas which is the next target state more likely to pass 
this type of law 
browne had contended that english is already the de facto 
official language of both florida and the country and that the 
amendment would threaten fundamental liberties 
in an action growing out of the campaigns former cbs anchorman 
cronkite resigned on oct 13 from the advisory board of us 
english a group founded in 1983 by john tanton and former sen si 
hayakawa of california to promote a us constitutional amendment

advocated forced sterilization she did not elaborate

the winners sang amazing grace in georgia 
in massachusetts in a sons of italy hall already set up for 
tonights bingo game redhaired redfaced paul caseys victory 
he became the first democrat sent to the state legislature from tony 
winchester in at least 50 years was marked by a rendition of 
toura loura loura played on a banjo 
a crowd of about 100 chomped on cold cuts and swigged budweisers 
as the favorable results trickled in 
no matter that a tv in the corner its sound turned down was 
reporting that another son of massachusetts michael dukakis was 
losing another race 
the song in new jersey where sen frank lautenberg defeated 
republican pete dawkins was bruce springsteens born in the usa 
and in nebraska former gov robert kerrey who lost part of his 
right leg in vietnam fulfilled a longstanding promise by serenading 
supporters with an a capella version of waltzing matilda a song 
about an australian soldier who loses a leg in battle 
kerrey a medal of honor winner said he had promised members of 
his navy seal team that hed sing the song if he won the senate seat 
he sang for five minutes then well waltz tonight and work 
tomorrow he said and the quiet auditorium erupted into cheers 
election day 1988 transformed weary campaigners into energetic 
winners and singers losing candidates became philosophers and 
sometimes bitter rivals became peacemakers willing to bury the 
hatchet 
im not tired im ready to go out and answer the bell for the 
next round said lautenberg while the band belted out the 
requisite springsteen anthem 
dawkins who had frequently accused his opponent of using his 
office for personal gain offered his congratulations lautenberg 
who had accused dawkins of deceiving voters suggested they get 
together for coffee 
a battle lost is often the strongest beginning said dawkins 
the loser 
in my view we have won said his wife 
amazing grace was the song democrat ben jones chose to sing 
at the omni hotel in atlanta where he celebrated his us house 
victory over republican rep pat swindall 
jones is a former tv star who once battled alcoholism swindall 
is under indictment for perjury 
the contest had reached a memorable crescendo when jones told 
swindall being called dishonest by you is like being called ugly 
by a possum 
on election night swindall was all smiles ben won it fair and 
square lets all wish seriously ben and vivian jones the very 
best for the next two years he said 
in kentucky a long winning streak grew a bit longer democratic 
rep william h natcher held fast to the 2nd district seat he first 
won in a special election 35 years ago 
the victory also will enable natcher to add to his record string 
of consecutive rollcall votes on capitol hill 15902 an 
achievement that has earned him a spot in the guiness book of 
records 
ive been to the post 46 times in primary and november 
elections natcher said im in excellent health and they spent 
a lot of money against me but my blood pressure is good they dont 
scare me 
natcher refused to engage in an open campaign with his republican 
opponent who was reduced to traveling the district with a cardboard 
cutout of natchers likeness the incumbent who accepts no campaign 
contributions said he spent 2564 of his own money compared to 
the 78000 spent by his republican opponent martin a tori 
some more are going to run and spend some money said 
natcher but with the help of the people of the 2nd district

democrats bolstered their majority control of 
the senate by ousting threeterm gop maverick lowell weicker of 
connecticut who refused to concede defeat and by capturing 
republican seats in virginia nevada and nebraska 
democrats won four seats previously held by republicans and the 
gop captured two seats held by democrats raising the democratic 
margin of control to 5644 a twoseat gain if democrats hold on to 
florida 
several races were decided by narrow tallies and the contest in 
florida remained extremely tight and too close to call by 
midmorning democratic rep buddy mackays 8000vote lead over 
conservative republican rep connie mack had dropped to about 5300 
with 100000 absentee ballots to be counted later in the day 
we might have a couple of recounts before were done said 
tom mason a spokesman for the republican senatorial campaign 
committee 
the gops wins came in montana where former farm broadcaster 
conrad burns edged out democratic sen john melcher who was seeking 
a third term and in mississippi where rep trent lott the deputy 
house republican leader defeated rep wayne dowdy for the seat 
being vacated by sen john stennis the senates senior democrat 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who went down to defeat with michael 
dukakis as the democratic vice presidential candidate did not end 
election day emptyhanded he won reelection to a fourth senate 
term 
the election decisions give presidentelect george bush the 
prospect of opening his administration with congress solidly in 
democratic hands 
its going to be tougher said senate minority leader bob 
dole of kansas conceding that the gops numbers in the senate would 
be shaved in the 101st congress were going to have fewer than we 
had last year 
but sen edward m kennedy dmass said he believes that bush 
will find a cooperative spirit on capitol hill because the 
problems are too important for congress not to work with the 
president 
connecticut attorney general joseph lieberman edged weicker by a 
paperthin margin after a hardfought campaign in which he accused 
the senator of pursuing his own brand of liberal politics while 
ignoring home state concerns 
weicker who first gained national attention as a gruff 
outspoken member of the senate watergate committee and who became 
one of the senates most liberal and independent members refused to 
concede 
i wish i were here to declare a victory or defeat weicker 
told supporters unfortunately im not in a position to do either 
right now 
but he added no matter how all this turns out i dont have 
one single gripe 
lieberman portrayed him in television commercials as a sleeping 
bear who missed important votes the attack undermined weickers 
winning coalition of moderate republicans and democrats 
the senate race in florida remained too close to call and 
republicans had high hopes of picking up the seat of retiring 
democrat lawton chiles 
the race was so tight that a decision might rest in the counting 
of an estimated 100000 absentee ballots the mack campaign said 
they expected to do better than mackay since traditionally a large 
number of such ballots are cast by military personnel a group that 
mack considers among his constituency 
macks strategists said they would request an automatic recount 
of the ballots a process to which they are entitled under florida 
law if the winner and loser are separated by half a percentage point 
or less 
dole who lost to george bush in the partys presidential 
primaries was critical of the republican winner for doing too 
little to help gop senate candidates 
we could have used a little help from the vice president in 
some of the states florida dole said we pleaded with them to 
go to florida

west german jews today led their 
fellow citizens in a day of atonement on the 50th anniversary of 
kristallnacht and hecklers jeered chancellor helmut kohl during a 
solemn ceremony 
in austria parliament observed a minute of silence for 
kristallnacht victims and american jewish activists reenacted the 
nazi practice of forcing vienna jews to wash city streets with 
toothbrushes 
israels president chaim herzog said kristallnacht laid the 
groundwork for the tragedy of the jewish people and he urged 
israelis to work together to avoid a repeat of the tragedy 
on the night of nov 910 1938 nazi thugs beat and murdered 
jews ransacked their homes and businesses and destroyed 
synagogues the rampage left city streets littered with glass 
hence the name kristallnacht which means crystal night in german 
on the eve of krstallnacht ceremonies rightwing extremists 
spraypainted swastikas and pronazi slogans on a synagogue in a 
small bavarian village police said the incident occurred early 
tuesday in binswangen in southern west germany 
jews objected to kohls presence at the frankfurt ceremony 
citing his 1985 visit to the bitburg cemetery where 49 nazi ss 
officers are buried and his alleged insensitivity to jewish 
concerns 
mr chancellor what about bitburg one of two hecklers in 
the balcony of frankfurts west end synagogue shouted as kohl spoke 
mr chancellor why are you lying we want our rights both 
men shouted 
let me finish kohl interjected 
other voices were heard from the main floor of the synagogue but 
it was not clear what they were shouting 
even today the wounds of this conflagration are not fully 
healed said west germanys jewish community leader heinz 
galinski 
galinski a 75yearold survivor of the auschwitz death camp 
delivered the main address in a service televised nationwide from 
west end the only synagogue in frankfurt that was not destroyed on 
kristallnacht 
the synagogue was badly damaged but has been completely 
refurbished with its stone walls majestic pillars and sweeping 
arches returned to their former splendor 
west german police surrounded the building to guard against 
possible attacks on the politicians church representatives and 
other guests inside 
the younger generation just as we ourselves are always on 
guard against a return of the indescribable galinski said 
remembering not forgetting must be our command the command 
for all he said 
an estimated 6 million jews died during the nazi holocaust 
viennas parliament president leopold gratz said ordinary 
austrians who were rapacious antisemites or obsessed with the 
evil spirit of nazism joined nazis in the fearsome pogrom 50 
years ago 
in the shadow of viennas landmark st stephens cathedral rabbi 
avi weiss glenn richter and bernie glickman of the new yorkbased 
coalition of concern donned yellow stars like those the nazis 
forced jews to wear 
the three used a giant yellow toothbrush to rub away a nazi 
waldheim slogan they scrawled on the sidewalk weiss said any 
commemoration of kristallnacht in austria was false and form 
without substance as long as kurt waldheim is president 
waldheim has been accused of participating in war crimes when he 
served with the german army in the balkans in world war ii he 
denies the allegations 
israels president during a ceremony at jerusalems yad vashem 
holocaust memorial urged israelis to maintain unity despite sharp 
political disputes 
we have to work together so this dark period will never return 
and that those who today follow in the path of the nazis will not 
reach their goal he told about 200 people in yad vashems hall of 
remembrance a bare room with an eternal flame and the names of 
death camps imbedded in the floor 
west german justice minister hans engelhard said 91 jews were 
murdered during the kristallnacht porgram while 267 synagogues were 
destroyed generally accepted figures say about 7500 jewish 
businesses were ransacked and 30000 jews were sent to concentration 
camps 
communist east germans also were marking kristallnacht with the 
main ceremony scheduled in east berlin but president horst 
sindermann has rejected responsibility for the nazis murder of the 
jews 
for years the east german government has argued that because it 
only came into existence as a nation in 1949 it did not have a 
legal responsibility for the atrocities of the nazi regime

the soviet union said today that george bushs 
election shows that americans support the reagan administrations 
arms control efforts and that an early summit with the new 
president is likely 
such summits have become normal phenomena in our relations 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev told a briefing 
when asked about a meeting between bush and soviet president mikhail 
s gorbachev 
i can be absolutely confident that such summits would follow 
but i cant provide concrete information as to the next summit he 
said 
we note with satisfaction that the american electorate express 
their view with regard to the continuation of arms control 
negotiations and for expanding cooperation between the usa and 
the soviets in all possible areas perfiliev said 
the soviets had not expressed a preference in the election but 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said last week the 
soviets would like a prompt summit with whomever won 
correspondents of the official tass news agency reported from 
washington that bushs election victory over democrat michael 
dukakis showed americans were satisfied with reagans economic 
policies and pleased with his progress on arms control 
they noted that bush committed himself to the policy of the 
current incumbent of the white house ronald reagan 
tass referred to the treaty signed in washington in december by 
reagan and gorbachev under which the superpowers agreed to eliminate 
their medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles 
negotiations toward a 50 percent cut in strategic weapons are 
continuing but slowed considerably as the reagan administration 
comes to a close and the american focus turned to selecting his 
replacement 
tass said bush also had campaigned on a platform calling for 
negotiations with the soviet union from a position of strength 
through strengthening nato and upgrading nuclear forces 
tass reported in a brief dispatch at 745 am that bush had won 
the presidential election in the united states the official media 
reported more details of the election for the white house congress 
and governorships throughout the day 
soviets who passed by the us embassy on the busy garden ring 
road stopped and looked at a pictoral display about bush including 
a biography with the headline new president 
the afternoon daily izvestia ran a frontpage story about bushs 
victory headlined george bush president of the usa along 
with his biography and a portrait 
in its reports official radio moscow said the soviet union 
proceeds from the understanding that a dialogue between the two 
countries will be continued with a new administration in the 
interests of nuclear disarmament and world peace 
it said observers noted that the election of bush was decided 
first and foremost by the improvement in the national economy 
which took place lately under the present administration a 
reduction of inflation and the number of jobless 
radio moscow said the republicans successfully portrayed dukakis 
as a liberal who was weak on foreign policy

employees at two small shipyards in gdansk 
called off strikes today after solidarity leader lech walesa urged 
workers to end protests against a government plan to close the lenin 
shipyard 
several hundred workers gave up their strike and took down 
banners at the wisla shipyard after receiving a promise that 
employees who took part in the strike would not be fired a strike 
leader said 
at the repair shipyard 200 workers held a morning rally then 
ended their strike after several appeals by walesa strike 
participants said 
they also said they acted after management threatened to fire 
them and police arrived and tore down their signs at the yard 
gates we decided to leave because it made no sense to fight 
said striker krzysztof kamolak 
the strikes began tuesday at the wisla and repair yards in this 
baltic port to protest the governments plan to close the nearby 
lenin shipyard bithplace of solidarity the outlawed free trade 
union movement 
on tuesday night workers at both yards defied an earlier appeal 
by walesa to end their strikes and stayed put overnight in 
nearfreezing weather 
last week communist authorities said they were closing the lenin 
shipyard dec 1 because it is losing money solidarity leaders said 
the plan to close the shipyard was an attempt to cripple solidarity 
at a time the government says i wants to negotiate 
walesa after meeting with the lenin shipyard management on 
tuesday indicated he would not insist on an immediate reversal of 
the closure plan before talks open with the government he said he 
was told at the meeting it could take two years or more to close the 
yard 
at first we had one month now we have two years said 
walesa an electrician at the yard and winner of the 1983 nobel 
peace prize 
we will fight for it the lenin shipyard and we will save 
it he said but the blade is not at our throats we have time 
and we can talk about the shipyard later 
strike leaders said tuesday that they were protesting both the 
closure order and the delay of governmentopposition talks on 
solidaritys future leaders of the movement are demanding its legal 
reinstatement 
this is a warning to the authorities that we want the 
government to set about talks right away said jan stanecki a 
protest leader at the wisla yard which has about 1000 workers who 
make yachts and river craft 
he said 400 to 500 wisla workers supported the strike some of 
the strikers at the plants gates huddled over fires roasting 
sausages tuesday night as police vans were posted at the entrances 
about 150 strikers at the 4500worker repair shipyard which 
renovates ships also vowed tuesday night to stay off the job to 
the end according to one worker in a group standing at the gate 
through emissaries walesa urged the strikers to end the 
protests he said there was time to solve the lenin shipyard dispute 
and strikes could hinder resolution of the issue of talks with the 
government 
but he also said that to improve the climate for the talks 
officials must reinstate 100 coal miners in southern poland fired 
after strikes in august 
the government promised the negotiations in exchange for walesas 
help in ending those strikes polands worst labor unrest in seven 
years 
but both sides have since disagreed on the agenda and the 
government objects to longtime solidarity advisers adam michnik and 
jacek kuron as members of the oppositions delegations 
authorities told walesa in august that solidaritys future would 
be on the agenda along with broader issues of political and 
economic reform 
polands centrally planned economy is in disarray with inflation 
at 60 percent so far this year 
solidarity the only free trade union movement ever allowed in 
the soviet bloc was chartered by the government in 1980 it was 
crushed in a december 1981 military crackdown and later outlawed

south dakota dealt a victory for legalized gambling in deadwood 
the black hills town where wild bill hickok was gunned down while 
playing poker 112 years ago and state lotteries won in kentucky 
indiana idaho and minnesota 
in south dakota voters tuesday approved a constitutional 
amendment that gave the legislature the power to set rules and 
regulations for legalized gambling in deadwood with 95 percent of 
the precincts reporting the measure was approved by 179136 to 
99138 votes or 6436 percent 
deadwood voters ultimately would have to approve the idea by 60 
percent 
the plan would permit slot machine and card games with proceeds 
helping finance historic preservation in the town 
in kentucky voters approved an amendment allowing a lottery by 
6139 percent with all but three of the states 3228 precincts 
reporting 687246 people voted to lift the constitutional ban on a 
state lottery and 439198 people voted against it 
the vote was victory for kentuckys children senior citizens 
and vietnam veterans gov wallace wilkinson said during a 
celebration in tuesday night he then asked the general assembly to 
enact legislation for a lottery during a special session beginning 
nov 28 
in indiana voters overwhelmingly approved a lottery amendment 
but opponents said they will continue to fight it 
with 93 percent of precincts reporting early today 62 percent of 
voters were in favor of the proposition that would remove the state 
constitutions ban on lotteries and other forms of gambling 
thirtyeight percent were opposed 
were not finished said paul r oakes chairman of indiana 
citizens against legalized gambling the legislators still have to 
approve a lottery were going to make a prediction that its 
possible in indiana that we may have parimutuel horseracing and no 
lottery 
debate will begin in january as legislators decide how a lottery 
will be run and how to spend the projected 150 million in annual 
revenues 
in idaho prolottery forces turned back an intense media drive 
by wellfinanced opponents and narrowly won support for a 
constitutional amendment authorizing a staterun lottery 
we were under a barrage of media messages to the tune of 
threequarters of a million dollars idahoans for the lottery 
leader larry larocco said 
with all but five of the states 875 precincts reporting the 
lottery had 210532 votes or 52 percent opponents garnered 196268 
votes or 48 percent 
we were pleased with the results when we went to bed said 
the rev ken wilde chairman of the antilottery umbrella group 
consider i suppose well rally our forces and consider what to do 
next 
in minnesota a state lottery measure was approved by 1205858 
votes or 59 percent to 835256 votes 41 percent 
since approval of a constitutional amendment requires a majority 
of all voters who cast ballots a 60 percent majority is generally 
considered the minimum needed to ensure passage because large 
numbers of voters traditionally skip the constitutional questions 
the legislature now must decide whether a lottery will actually 
be established in minnesota

in a victory for the main opposition 
party a provincial court has ruled the government cannot force 
people to show identity cards before voting in national elections 
nov 16 
the lahore high court ruled tuesday that such cards are not 
required by the constitution which says the right to vote can only 
be limited by a persons age citizenship residence and competency 
no further qualification conditions or limitations can be 
put on his constitutional right or franchise by any subordinate 
legislation the court said the federal government said it will 
appeal to the supreme court 
the lahore court encouraged people to bring some form of 
identification to polling places where their names will be checked 
against a list of registered voters 
the main opposition pakistan peoples party which has a large 
following among the poor said during the threeday court hearing 
that many lowerclass people do not have identity cards and would 
thus be barred from voting 
some women have identity cards but without the required 
photographs because they come from strictly moslem famlies that do 
not allow women to be photographed the party said 
the government said the use of identity cards would reduce voter 
fraud 
earlier this year the pakistan peoples party won another legal 
victory when a court ruled that candidates can run affiliated with 
political parties 
the government had ordered they must run as individuals peoples 
party leader benazir bhutto said that order favored the governing 
party 
ironically it was ms bhuttos father zulfikar ali bhutto who 
as prime minister in 1973 demanded all pakistanis carry an identity 
card 
he ruled until 1977 when gen mohammad zia ulhaq ousted him in a 
coup he was executed in 1979 zia died in a plane crash aug 17 
after calling the nov 16 general election a government inquiry 
found the plane was sabotaged but the probe was unable to say 
exactly how it was done or by whom

a living womans healthy heart has been 
removed and transplanted into another patient and the donor then 
was given the heart and lungs of a girl who died in a fall 
doctors said tuesday they decided to do a heartlung transplant 
on the st paul woman and give her heart to someone else rather than 
replace just her damaged lungs because it is an easier operation 
it is one of only a handful of such domino transplant 
procedures done since the first one at johns hopkins university 
hospital in baltimore 1 years ago said dr robert emery head of 
transplant surgery at abbot northwestern hospital 
the important thing is that the donor organs were used 
maximally said emery we kind of got two for one on this the 
second patient might have had to wait a long time so the timing was 
nice 
late sunday doctors from abbott northwestern obtained the heart 
and lungs of an unidentified braindead 17yearold girl 
surgeons then removed the heart of barbara tremble 28 of st 
paul and transplanted it into eva hallberg 61 of roseville whose 
heart had been badly damaged by several heart attacks 
trembles lungs left almost useless by cystic fibrosis were 
then removed and she was given the 17yearolds heart and lungs 
tremble was in critical condition late tuesday breathing with 
the help of a respirator emery said he expects her recovery to be 
slow 
emery said tremble knew her chances of surviving the operation 
were only 5050 because she had been weakened by cystic fibrosis a 
genetic disease that attacks the lungs and by diabetes 
hallberg was reported in good condition tuesday 
tremble transferred to abbott northwesterns transplant waiting 
list several weeks ago because of a personnel shakeup in the 
university of minnesotas lung and heartlung transplant program 
she had been on a waiting list at the university for about a year 
emery said doctors talked to tremble about the possibility of 
donating her heart to someone else well in advance of her surgery

the international committee of the red cross said 
today that it has proposed that iran and iraq begin releasing sick 
and wounded prisoners on nov 20 
the red cross said the exchange would include a total of 1569 
disabled prisoners captured by both sides during their 8yearold 
war 
technical talks are still under way to undertake the 
exchange red cross spokesman juerg bischof said we have 
proposed nov 20 as the starting date but we have not received a 
formal answer from the two sides 
iraq announced tuesday that it was ready to begin immediately 
with the repatriation of sick and wounded iranians the red cross has 
identified in iraqi camps provided iran also agrees to send home 
disabled iraqi pows 
iran had said oct 21 that it was prepared to release the sick 
and wounded should iraq be willing to reciprocate 
bischof said the red cross has registered 1158 disabled iraqi 
pows and 411 iranians 
in a note to both governments on oct 4 the agency encouraged 
them to proceed with the repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners 
and the registration of all prisoners estimated to total more than 
100000 as a matter of priority 
tehran and baghdad described their offers to return the sick and 
wounded as humanitarian initiatives as signatories of the 
geneva conventions both countries already were pledged to 
repatriate them 
the red cross has registered a total of 50182 iraqi pows in iran 
and 19284 iranians in iraq but estimates that each side holds 
another 20000 to 30000 it has urged both governments to supply 
complete lists and insists that all prisoners be interviewed by red 
cross delegates to make sure repatriation is voluntary 
reports in the iranian press said that about 20000 iraqis want 
to stay in iran about 2500 iraqis have torn up their red 
crossissued identity cards in front of red cross delegates iranian 
pows who publicly announced their opposition to the revolutionary 
government may also be reluctant to accept repatriation 
in the unmediated peace talks that began aug 25 five days 
after the ceasefire took effect iraq has been pressing for the 
release and repatriation of all pows independently from the 
negotiations on consolidating the truce 
iran insists that such global release be linked to other 
provisions in the un ceasefire resolution 598 it urges that 
priority be given to the withdrawal of forces to internationally 
recognized borders 
that border is disputed since iraq a few days before the 
outbreak of the war repudiated a 1975 treaty delineating it the 
issue has stalled the peace talks since they began

the moslem half of lebanons dual 
government appointed a new commander of the lebanese army even 
though gen michel aoun the christian prime minister still holds 
the post 
adel osseiran defense minister in the moslem cabinet announced 
the appointment today of moslem maj gen sami khatib as acting 
commander of the lebanese army 
but with aoun still claiming the post the move could hasten the 
disintegration of the 42000member regular army along religious 
lines and solidify lebanons partition into sectarian territories 
after 13 years of civil war 
osseiran told reporters in moslem west beirut that the post of 
the army commander is considered vacant because the original 
commander gen michel aoun has taken up other duties 
asked whether his move means the lebanese army will have two 
rival commanders osseiran said khatib is appointed in an acting 
capacity gen aoun is the original commander he has the right to 
return to his post once his other duties are over 
aoun a maronite christian was named prime minister of a 
caretaker military cabinet by president amin gemayel when his term 
expired sept 23 gemayels decree stipulated that aoun would also 
retain his post as army commander 
but syrianbacked moslem and leftist factions rejected aouns 
premiership charging it violated a 1943 unwritten national covenant 
that gave the premiers post to sunni moslems the presidency to 
maronites and the parliament speakers position to shiite moslems 
they pledged allegiance to the government of sunni moslem prime 
minister salim hoss which ruled under gemayel 
lebanons parliament has been unable to meet to elect a successor 
to gemayel 
aoun who considers the hoss cabinet and its decisions 
illegitimate made no immediate comment on osseirans decision 
but the lebanese front the coalition of christian groups opposed 
to syrias military presence in lebanon rejected khatibs 
appointment 
this appointment is illegitimate because it comes from an 
illegitimate authority the front said in a statement 
khatib 55 a retired sunni officer announced his acceptance of 
the new post saying i shall exercise this job in a way that will 
serve the unity of the army and the country 
in reality however khatib will have authority over five 
predominantly moslem army brigades stationed in moslemcontrolled 
areas 
five other brigades stationed in the christian heartland north 
and northeast of beirut remain under aouns control 
khatib had served as figurehead commander of the allsyrian arab 
deterrant force which intervened in lebanon at the behest of the 
arab league in 1976 with a mandate to end lebanons civil war

an archaeologist says he has dug up 
primitive tools that suggest humans lived in north america 13500 
years earlier than the date commonly accepted by scientists 
don wyckoff director of the oklahoma archaeological survey said 
tuesday he is convinced his preliminary dating is accurate but that 
expensive testing is needed to prove the age of the tools unearthed 
along with bison bones at a site near alva in september 
carbondating tests on the bones were inconclusive but wyckoff 
said the same test on snail shells found at the same level indicates 
an age of 25000 years 
based on current evidence scientists have thought that ancient 
humans first lived in north america about 11000 to 11500 years ago 
experts say carbontesting on snail shells can be inaccurate 
because snails incorporate old carbon molecules in their shells 
these are the kind of dates that often turn out to be 
inaccurately old said donald grayson professor of archaeology at 
the university of washington 
wyckoff acknowleges the problem but said he is confident that 
the discovery 30 miles west of alva in northwest oklahoma will prove 
to be the oldest evidence of human inhabitation of north america 
i feel pretty comfortable about the whole thing the geological 
context is good i look at this location and i say its got to be 
old wyckoff said 
the state agency he heads is affiliated with the university of 
oklahoma and uses its students for research and field work 
wyckoff reported on his initial findings last weekend at a 
meeting of the plains anthropological conference in wichita kan 
he said a resident came across bones in june 1986 while digging a 
pond and called the archaeological survey 
a university of kansas archaeologist larry martin who was 
visiting at the time recognized the skull of an ancient bison 
we really werent thinking that the site had anything to do 
with people we were just looking to get a look at what oklahoma 
looked like in the ice age wyckoff said 
after more than a year of tedious sifting of dirt from the site 
the archaeologists turned up two flakes identified as debris from 
resharpening of a stone tool 
they then tried radiocarbon dating on the bones but when that 
didnt work out of desperation we submitted a group of aquatic 
snails that were present around the bison skull wyckoff said 
the test completed in october 1987 showed they were 31150 
years old give or take 700 years 
wyckoff said he allows another 20 percent for possible carbon 
contamination to come up with the age of about 25000 years 
it would be very rare for a snail shell to be more than 20 
percent contaminated he said 
the national geographic society turned them down for funding to 
do the expensive accelerator dating saying the few flakes were not 
evidence enough of a human site 
so we just decided well get a bunch of volunteers go back up 
and dig a few more squares we did that in september and recovered 
a good broken tool as well as part of another tool and more 
flakes wyckoff said 
wyckoff said it costs 600 a sample for testing by accelerator 
dating based on extracting specific proteins from tiny amounts of 
material 
meanwhile wyckoff said he is awaiting the results expected by 
weeks end of another dating test based on the presence of uranium 
thorium in the bison teeth 
the southern methodist university doctoral student conducting 
that test said that while his results arent complete yet he felt 
like it was going to be fairly compatible with our age of 
25000 years wyckoff said 
if so he said it would be the most important archaeological find 
in the last 60 years 
if it is that old it would be that important said grayson 
the washington archaeologist 
theres good reason to believe people were here earlier but we 
havent proved that yet grayson said

the violin was made in 1676 by austrian 
jakob steiner it may be as valuable as a stradivarius and it was 
left behind by burglars in a rundown apartment raided by police 
police believe the violin was stolen from the home of a family 
that has owned it for five generations and values it at 800000 
detective tom ryan said tuesday he found the violin as he 
searched an apartment in neighboring daytona beach for jewelry guns 
and other items taken in a string of house burglaries in the last 
two weeks here and in adjoining ormond beach 
two men arrested last week tipped off police to the apartment 
which they said also had been used by two other men as a stash house 
for stolen property ryan said he suspects the other men took the 
violin in an oct 20 burglary 
violins made by steiner who died in 1683 may be even rarer than 
those of the italian antonio stradivari because steiner made fewer 
of them according to some collectors 
according to library records stradivari made about 650 violins 
the series of about 18 burglaries netted the crooks between 
35000 and 50000 in jewelry and guns police said 
the two arrested jason lee signore 18 and edward revas 20 
were picked up in an unrelated burglary detectives said

a flash fire that killed an infant undergoing 
heart surgery at cedarssinai medical center was not linked to the 
fact the surgery took place outside an operating room health 
officials ruled 
there is no reason to believe that this incident would have 
been any different had it taken place in an operating room 
said robert karp program manager for health facilities at the los 
angeles county department of health 
however karp said health officials are studying whether such 
future procedures should be limited to approved operating rooms 
the oct 6 fire at cedarssinai took place in a patient care room 
while doctors were attempting to close a small vessel between the 
15dayold babys pulmonary artery and aorta major blood vessels 
near the heart 
it was believed caused when a small electric cauterizer used to 
seal off blood vessels emitted a spark that ignited something in 
the rooms oxygenrich atmosphere 
hospital officials said the same surgical team had performed the 
operation safely dozens of times they characterized the fire as a 
freak accident 
health services officials said they were surprised to learn the 
operation was not performed in an operating room hospital officials 
responded that many medical facilities perform such surgeries 
outside operating rooms and that they had permission to use the room 
for surgery

a man who fathered 13 children with three of his 
daughters has pleaded guilty to sexual assault and indecency with 
those children the last of several charges pending against him 
lewis charles elliott 53 had been scheduled to stand trial 
tuesday on one of the remaining charges when his attorney pat 
robertson and prosecutors negotiated a plea agreement 
elliott of dallas was sentenced to 20 years on seven charges of 
indecency with a child and three of aggravated sexual assault and 
forfeited parental rights under terms of the agreement 
he got to talk to the family and say goodbye to all of them 
robertson said this takes care of all the other 10 cases and he 
gets to appeal his 50year case 
last week elliott was sentenced to 50 years in prison following 
his conviction of sexual assault involving one of the children 
last year elliott was assessed 10 years in prison after pleading 
guilty to three charges of incest involving the three daughters 
the children range in age from 1 to 8 and the mothers are 
between 25 and 30 authorities said 
assistant district attorney lynne ann cartsunis said she and 
fellow prosecutor dorothy reid accepted the plea agreement because 
elliott was willing to forfeit his paternal rights saving them that 
extra legal step 
we were concerned about the children having to put all those 
children through one trial after another ms cartsunis said we 
wanted to let the family get on with their lives without him 
ms cartsunis called the 50year sentence for a man of elliotts 
age just short of a life sentence

a disappointed lloyd bentsen returned by 
the voters to the us senate says hell work to help george bush 
but hes offering no apologies for the losing campaign he waged for 
the white house with michael dukakis 
he and i waged a campaign thats worthy of the american 
people said the democratic vice presidential candidate who often 
criticized vice president george bush for running on lies and 
distortions 
surrounded by family as he addressed supporters at the historic 
driskill hotel where lyndon johnson watched his national elections 
in 1960 and 1964 the texas senators voice cracked from the strain 
of nearmarathon campaigning in the final days 
we told you the truth and we stepped up to those issues we 
challenged america to do better he said we fought fair and we 
never quit and we never lost our faith in the truth thats what 
you need in a campaign he said 
bentsen called off plans for a morning news conference and went 
to see a doctor because he lost his voice spokeswoman ellen 
moskowitz said today he planned to return to washington later in 
the day 
unlike johnson in 1960 bentsen was unable to deliver his home 
state of texas for his massachusetts running mate 
during the campaign bentsen sometimes was critical of dukakis 
for failing to respond sooner to gop attacks on his character and 
record but bentsen had kind words as he ended his campaign 
i have never seen a candidate that worked any harder or in 
those last three or four weeks delivered a message any stronger than 
did mike dukakis in those closing days 
and he made me proud to be his partner he said he made me 
proud to be his running mate and he made me proud to be an 
american 
bentsens voice was nearly gone by the time he spoke later at a 
party for his campaign workers he struck a note of conciliation 
toward the republican victors 
im committed to help george bush said the chairman of the 
senate finance committee i think the time for partisanship comes 
at elections 
under an unusual texas law bentsen ran for both the senate and 
the vice presidency he claimed victory in his senate race which he 
won handily over rep beau boulter rtexas 
jack devore bentsens longtime senate spokesman said the 
election results were bittersweet 
on the one hand theres gratitude to the people of texas on 
the other hand theres not he said

democrats retained their control of most state legislatures but 
republicans made small inroads as the parties looked ahead to the 
battle over redistricting that will follow the 1990 census 
gop state legislators did not do nearly as well as in the 
previous two presidential elections in 1980 the democrats lost 302 
seats and 10 chambers and in 1984 they lost 330 seats and seven 
chambers 
we would obviously have liked to pick up some more seats 
said molly gaylord a field director of the republican national 
committee she said she hoped republicans would pick up more seats 
in 1990 the last elections before the legislatures redistricting 
battles of 1991 
based on early results of tuesdays voting republicans picked up 
roughly 16 to 30 seats in state legislatures according to the 
republican national committee 
republicans lost control of the new mexico senate to democrats 
but took control of the montana senate which had been democratic 
the committee said 
republicans split evenly with democrats in three houses that had 
been democratic the committee said the oregon house and the 
vermont house and senate 
democrats strengthened majorities in the legislatures of at least 
five states gained in the republicandominated houses of new york 
and in indiana vice presidentelect dan quayles home state and 
retained control in southern strongholds 
were doing extremely well said timothy dickson a 
strategist in the democratic state legislative leaders association 
this points out george bush not only doesnt have coattails he 
doesnt have any coat 
the democrats control twothirds of all state legislative 
chambers but the makeup of the legislatures is especially important 
this year because it is the last election before the 1990 census 
which will be used to redraw congressional districts 
much of the power in influencing how those districts are 
reshaped which can result in lost seats for either political party 
lies in the statehouses 
in new mexico voters ousted five republicans giving the 
democrats a 2616 majority and stripping republican gov garrey 
carruthers of the only legislative advantage he has had the first 
half of his term 
in ohio where democrats lost a seat in each house strengthening 
the republican control of the senate to 1914 and weakening the 
democrat majority in the house to 5940 
first of all we obviously got a boost from george bush running 
well second of all we got a real boost from michael dukakis 
picking lloyd bentsen said james tilling the chief gop 
strategist in ohio he referred to the decision to pass over popular 
ohio sen john glenn as a vice presidential candidate 
in iowa democrats held a 2921 senate majority and a 5842 house 
majority over republicans prior to the elections late returns 
showed democrats were virtually assured of holding those margins and 
possibly strengthening leads 
the rhode island senate was 3812 democrat and now will be 419 
democrat the house was 8020 democrat and will be 8317 democrat 
in kentucky which went solidly for bush republicans lost one 
seat each in the senate and house the new democratic majorities are 
308 in the senate and 7228 in the house 
democrats easily retained control of connecticuts general 
assembly incomplete returns showed republicans gaining just three 
seats two in the house and one in the senate compared with the 
average of 23 seats the gop has picked up in previous presidential 
election years since 1968 
among southern states the democrats maintained or strengthened 
dominance in the mississippi south carolina and west virginia 
statehouses 
in north carolina republicans toppled nine incumbent house 
democrats and picked up at least one senate seat that narrowed the 
democrat advantage in the house from 8436 to 7145 and in the 
senate from 4010 to 3911 
the democrats advantage also shrank slightly in georgia from 
4610 to 449 in the senate and from 15129 to 13829 in the house 
with several races still undecided 
likewise in arkansas the democrats lost a few house seats but 
still retained dominance with an 8811 majority the house balance 
of 31 democrats and four republicans was unchanged 
in delaware unofficial returns showed senate democrats 
apparently retained their 13seat majority over the eight 
republicans while in the house republican control of 2219 
increased by three giving the gop 2516 advantage 
in illinois democrats held on to control of both chambers of the 
general assembly they have a 6751 majority in the house and a 
3128 majority in the senate 
in texas democrats remain in firm control despite losing a 
senate seat the democratic majority is 247 in the house 
democrats have a 9456 edge the same count as before the election 
in nevada democrats picked up a seat in the nevada assembly and 
have a 3012 edge in the lower house republicans increased their 
control of the senate to 138 by gaining one seat 
arizona republicans lost a net of two state senate seats and two 
house seats but appeared to have retained control of both chambers 
where they have held majorities since 1974

vice presidentelect dan quayle paid a visit to 
his transition office today saying hes anxious to sit down with 
george bush and start things rolling for a new administration 
looking relaxed but somewhat tired after a long election day 
quayle traveled to a fourstory white townhouse facing lafayette 
park across the street from the white house 
chatting briefly with reporters as he left his home in suburban 
mclean va the senator said his aim was to get started 
assembling thoughts conversing with people 
but he said he had no specific tasks planned at the transition 
office a source close to quayle who declined to be named publicly 
said that dan evans an indianapolis lawyer and friend who managed 
quayles 1980 senate campaign had been picked to head up the 
transition office 
on his arrival at the transition office quayle was asked to 
describe his first order of business get organized he replied 
asked whether that would be difficult he said a cinch 
on tuesday night quayle vowed to be a devoted public servant 
and said that he wont worry about changing his image to please 
those with lingering doubts 
showered with affection from some 4000 republicans jammed into a 
hotel ballroom on election night quayle basked in the glory but 
emphasized that he was eager to fall behind presidentelect 
george bush 
quayles selection last august surprised many political experts 
and the senator immediately encountered problems stemming from his 
youth his stumbles during interviews and questions about his 
military and academic background 
through the election campaign various public opinion polls 
showed that the 41yearold senator was a drag on the republican 
ticket quayle said tuesday that a strong bushquayle victory would 
represent a vindication of bushs judgment in selecting him 
quayle planned to greet bush later on when the vice president 
arrived at andrews air force base md the pair was expected to meet 
with president reagan at the white house 
quayle said he hoped americans would give me a chance to 
prove himself but said he could not let himself be preoccupied with 
peoples perceptions of him 
if in fact i was concerned about shaping or reshaping my 
image im going into probably the worst office to do that and 
thats being the vice president of the country he said the 
vice president submerges himself and implements the policies of the 
president that becomes your sole goal and your challenge in your 
job 
during an informal chat before the polls closed quayle said he 
had not given any thought to whom he would name as his transition 
director he said he felt that would be putting us ahead of 
ourselves 
but at least two of quayles key campaign lieutenants former 
white house political director mitchell daniels and issues adviser 
jim cicconi are leaving to return to private law practice 
chief spokesman david prosperi said he did not know whether he 
would remain in the new administration two other aides 
speechwriter kenneth khachigian of california and scheduler lanny 
wiles were brought in from california and florida respectively 
and are believed ready to go back 
other questions hover over the new vice presidentelect quayle 
must resign his senate seat and the senator has indicated he will 
do that well before indiana democratic govelect evan bayh is sworn 
in next january quayle has not said precisely when he would step 
down however 
quayle and his wife marilyn also have been questioned 
repeatedly about reports that mrs quayle would accept an 
appointment to serve out the unfilled term of her husband neither 
has been willing to discuss a prospect that has indiana political 
leaders engaging in rampant speculation although quayle said last 
week that its gov bob orrs decision to make 
quayles triumphant appearance in the chandeliered ballroom of 
the washington hilton hotel climaxed a checkered campaign for the 
vice presidency which started the day after the republican national 
convention with an extraordinary noholdsbarred 
questionandanswer session with reporters covering his homecoming 
appearance in huntington ind 
the senator was questioned repeatedly about indications he may 
have used family influences to get into the indiana national guard 
and avoid combat at the height of the vietnam war quayle also faced 
questions about his academic performance at depauw university and 
the circumstances under which he was admitted to law school with an 
undergraduate grade average of c 
although public opinion polls showed a large degree of anxiety 
over quayle even up to election day they evidently did not figure 
very much into the results 
quayle surmounted his tough period in late august and early 
september and his latest huntington homecoming on election day 
was a more festive occasion townspeople turned out in droves 
elementary school children marched at the senators side and sang 
cheering and clapping along the way through the downtown

presidentelect george bush turned to an old 
tennis partner and longtime political ally james a baker iii for 
the chief foreign policy job in the new republican administration 
at his first news conference as presidentelect bush announced 
this morning that he would nominate baker his campaign chairman as 
secretary of state the appointment had been widely expected 
the partnership between bush and baker dates back to 1970 when 
bush asked baker still grieving over the death of his first wife 
to help him in his run albeit unsuccessful for the senate from 
texas from that evolved an 18year political alliance 
a prized photo that baker keeps on his office wall tells the 
story underneath a smiling portrait of bush is the autograph 
what would we do without real friends 
bush told reporters today that baker had distinguished himself 
in every position he has held in the reagan administration 
baker served as chief of staff during the first four years of the 
reagan administration and then in a celebrated job switch took over 
the treasury post in 1985 when former treasury secretary donald 
regan became chief of staff 
baker resigned from the cabinet in august to take over as bushs 
presidential campaign chairman he was succeeded at treasury by 
nicholas brady who is widely expected to retain that post in a bush 
administration 
the vice president revealed no other cabinet choices at his first 
press conference since winning the election 
bush saluted secretary of state george shultz for giving the 
country the highest possible standards of public service during 
his tenure at the state department 
shultz in turn saluted the man designated to succeed him 
at a washington news conference shultz said baker will hit the 
ground running 
his close warm and productive relationship with 
presidentelect bush makes him just the guy to serve as the 
presidents chief foreign policy adviser and as chief spokesman for 
the president and for our nations interests in the new and bright 
era we have entered shultz said 
while baker is chiefly known for his skills in negotiating deals 
with congress bush cited his experience in foreign affairs gained 
as a member of the national security council during the reagan 
administration 
his 7 years as a member of the national security council his 
proven skills as a negotiator and the personal respect in which he 
is held will allow him again to demonstrate the highest standards of 
performance as our next secretary of state bush said 
in making the announcement bush said that he had encouraged 
baker then a houston attorney to first come to washington to serve 
as undersecretary of commerce in the ford administration 
baker headed up his friends losing presidential campaign in 1980 
just as 10 years earlier he had been campaign chairman in bushs 
losing bid for a senate seat in texas a race won by democrat lloyd 
bentsen 
the senate race marked the first time baker had dabbled in 
politics taking time out from a successful corporate law practice 
to help his friend and tennis partner at the houston country club 
bitten by the political bug baker then a democrat became a 
republican at bushs urging and their careers have been intertwined 
every since 
at treasury baker amassed more influence than any other recent 
holder of that cabinet post 
baker was credited with steering the 1986 taxoverhaul bill 
through congress just as he had maneuvered the reagan tax cut 
through a democratic congress in 1981 as chief of staff 
baker won plaudits internationally for persuading us allies to 
coordinate their economic policies in a managed effort to devalue 
the dollar an effort widely credited with dramatically improving 
the fortunes of us industry by making their goods competitive once 
again on overseas markets 
however baker achieved less success with the socalled baker 
plan an effort announced three years ago to solve the third world 
debt crisis by providing more loans to countries willing to adopt 
freemarket programs 
despite the new initiative the 12 trillion debt burden of poor 
countries remains as intractable as ever 
still baker has a reputation as one of the republican partys 
craftiest political strategists 
many baker admirers claims that some of the problems afflicting 
the reagan administration over the past few years including the 
irancontra arms sales might not have happened had baker remained 
on as chief of staff with his immense attention for detail 
both baker 58 and bush six years his senior came from wealthy 
families both went to prep schools in the east and both graduated 
from ivy league colleges baker from princeton and bush from yale

an insurance reform measure backed by consumer 
advocate ralph nader that sharply cuts california auto premiums was 
narrowly approved today 
with nearly 989 percent of precincts reporting proposition 103 
won by 512 percent to 488 percent 
proposition 103 one of five ballot issues on california ballots 
dealing with car insurance lowers almost all rates by an immediate 
20 percent below november 1987 rates it requires an additional 20 
percent cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers 
the naderbacked measure also gives an elected insurance 
commissioner control over future rate increases limits use of 
territorial rating to set auto insurance premiums and subjects the 
industry to state antitrust and unfair business practice laws 
also tuesday voters rejected industrybacked alternatives as 
well as a measure supported by trial lawyers 
the insurance industry mounted an unprecedented 60 million 
campaign but apparently was unable to persuade voters to back its 
measure creating nofault insurance 
the industrys nofault initiative proposition 104 was 
trounced getting just 25 percent yes votes to 75 percent against 
this isnt over yet said proposition 103 author harvey 
rosenfield the fact the insurance and trial lawyers measures 
failed is an indication that people are sick and tired of special 
interests meddling with the initiative process 
proposition 100 the initiative sponsored by consumer groups and 
trial lawyers that would have given good drivers a 20 percent car 
insurance discount was soundly rejected with 41 percent yes votes 
to 59 percent no 
proposition 101 a measure sponsored by a democratic assemblyman 
and an independent insurance company to cut the bodily injury 
portion of auto insurance rates was defeated in a landslide with 13 
percent yes votes to 87 percent no votes 
insurers proposition 106 which would have limited trial 
lawyers contingency fees had 47 percent voting yes to 53 percent 
no

here is the text of presidentelect george bushs 
news conference wednesday 
thank you all good morning and i hope everybody had a good 
nights sleep i did not i have a relatively short opening 
statement and then id be delighted to take your questions 
let me say at the outset once again as i did last night how 
thankful i am for the help and support of our family of our 
president of my running mate and his family and all those who 
worked so hard on this long campaign and particularly the american 
people i also want to thank martin van buren for paving the way 
its been a long time marty 
let me also add a word of thanks to you in the press 
particularly those in our traveling squad weve had a bump in the 
road here and there and differences but thats natural and i know 
i think as a result of this the last couple of years better 
than most americans how hard you must work and the dedication that 
it requires and how much the health of our whole system depends on 
that depends on that dedication you may not know it but you 
whove traveled with us are going to miss campaign aides alixe 
reed and bruce zanca its a little early but i know you will 
weve just come from a church service at our home parish st 
martins church and ive just begun as a result of that or just 
prior to that to think about the task ahead and i am certain that 
gods help is absolutely essential for anyone chosen to lead this 
great country of ours 
to my opponents again our opponents i offer my 
congratulations for a hardfought campaign both the governor and 
senator bentsen have given a major portion of their own lives to 
public service and i have the greatest respect for that commitment 
and i know that each one is going to serve the public interest as 
they see it with the same energy and conviction that they 
demonstrated so well in this campaign the very real differences 
between have been highlighted by the glare of the television lights 
but for my part ive never had any doubt that we share a common 
interest in building a better america and thats fundamentally what 
the american election is all about 
now just a few comments on the business of transition im 
pleased to announce the following initial set of appointments 
ive asked my current chief of staff craig fuller and my senior 
campaign advisor bob teeter to serve as codirectors of the 
bushquayle transition working closely with them will be the 
counsel to the vice president boyden gray who will serve as the 
transitions legal adviser and will be my general counsel in the 
white house my former executive assistant and secretary of the 
navy chase untermeyer who will serve as the transitions personnel 
director and i expect him to continue that after the transition 
and campaign press secretary sheila tate will now serve as the press 
secretary of the transition 
the transition organization will of necessity grow over time but 
it is nevertheless my intention to return to the tradition of a 
somewhat leaner transition organization than we had in 1980 just 
given the nature of what has to be done ive asked my friends bobby 
holt of midland texas and penny corth of washington to cochair 
the inaugural committee and theyve generously agreed to serve 
and today i can inform you of my first decision regarding my 
cabinet i talked to secretary of state george shultz this morning 
and he told me that he enthusiastically endorsed my choice for the 
next secretary of state george shultz has given a great deal of 
extraordinary service to this country a distinguished career and 
hes given us the highest possible standards for public service and 
he has helped our president achieve many foreign policy successess 
and i salute him 
as his successor it is my intention to name james a baker iii 
i first persuaded jim baker to leave houston and come to washington 
many years ago in the ford administration when he first came up to 
the commerce department and since then he has distinguished 
himself in every position that he has held in the reagan 
administration he set a new standard of excellence in his ouryear 
tenure as white house chief of staff and then over three years as 
secretary of the treasury in that experience his 7 years as a 
member of the national security council his proven skills as a 
negotiator and the personal respect in which he is held will allow 
him again to demonstrate the highest standards of performance as our 
next secretary of state 
he has big shoes to fill but will get the job done and i know he 
feels as i do about the distinguished men and women in our foreign 
service he will lead them and he will work constructively with them 
to achieve our foreign policy objectives in these coming months 
jim baker will not only prepare for his responsibilities but hell 
also serve as an adviser to me on key aspects of the transition 
that said on the subject of appointments i note the obvious 
president reagan is still the president of the united states and i 
will not be using the transition to try to make or unduly influence 
decisions that are properly the presidents and rather i will be 
using the transition to assemble the very best possible team to meet 
the challenges that lie before us while also doing what i can to 
help bring us together after this long and difficult campaign 
as i said in the campaign i will for the most part bring in a 
brand new team of people from across the country and in my view 
that will reinvigorate the process it will in no way reflect lack 
of confidence in those who have served president reagan so well 
after this press conference we head back to washington dc for a 
day or two and then probably on friday morning i will head south 
for perhaps four days and nights and then back to washington ill 
be glad to respond to questions gene

q mr vice president last night when you celebrated your 
victory here in houston you spoke of reaching out to all americans 
including those who did not support your candidacy other than 
simply calling for unity what specifically do you intend to do to 
achieve it 
and secondly how do you intend to approach congress 
cooperation you will need after spending so much of your campaign 
bashing the congress 
a well i think the way to heal is to have meetings with various 
people maybe those who have not supported us make very clear 
through this forum and others that i mean what i said and the 
american people are wonderful when it comes to understanding when a 
campaign ends and the work of business begins 
i dont think i was particularly in a congress bashing mode 
for the most of the campaign but i will i have my principles the 
american people in voting for me voted for certain things 
congress understands that and i understand the congress ive 
served in the congress and so i dont think it will be you know 
that theyll do everything my way and but i will try very hard 
because i start with a great respect for the institution in which i 
serve yeah terry 
q mr vice president what kind of job will you give dan quayle 
in your administration will he have the same access to the all 
the papers that you saw from president reagan and will he if you 
could just describe what he would be able to what hell do 
a i havent formulated in detail but certainly he will have 
access to the papers access to the intelligence access to the 
information because it is essential that a vice president be up to 
speed on every sensitive matter involving the government lest 
something happen to the president these two right on the aisle 
q mr vice president a lot of people said in 1980 president 
reagan was able to really accomplish objectives in his first term 
because he had a game plan that he moved swiftly on in the first 90 
days will you have a game plan and if so sir can you give us 
some sense of what it will be 
a i will have a game plan part of what the transition is about 
is to spell out the priorities i spelled them out in broad terms 
in terms of keeping the economic expansion going and in terms of 
world peace but the election ended yesterday 
we will now have 70whatever days it is to formulate a game plan 
a first 100 days priorities if you will and theyll be 
specific and i will do my level best to fulfill my commitments to 
the american people dave 
q mr vice president in your campaign you laid out a very 
ambitious agenda to deal with the soviet union eliminate chemical 
and biological weapons conventional weapons finish the work on 
strategic arms can any of this go forward as long as the soviets 
delay their withdrawal from afghanistan do you see any linkage 
between your plans looking ahead and the reality 
a i would not throw any firm linkage there but clearly one of 
the things ive addressed myself to in this campaign is the need for 
continued reduction of regional tension and if the soviets made a 
determination not to pull out of afghanistan which i doubt they 
will do that would throw a complicating factor over the whole 
relationship i believe that the soviets will keep their commitment 
yes saul and then britt 
q you said a few days ago but havent mentioned since that 
youre going to be trying to seek an early meeting with mr 
gorbachev now that youve named jim baker do you expect that he 
will begin at some point soon to try to seek that meeting 
a not before january 20th and i said would i would have the 
secretary meet with the nato leaders his counterparts in nato and 
that then he would meet with mr shevardnadze and that then he 
would make clear to the soviets that i would be willing to meet with 
mr gorbachev and that is about the way but i dont think saul 
that would start you know before the president before i become 
president of the united states

an air force bomber pilot was hailed as a 
hero for maneuvering his burning b1b away from houses and trailer 
parks and into the cow pasture where it crashed after all four 
crewmen bailed out 
the crash in west texas on tuesday afternoon was the third since 
b1 aircraft began flying four years ago as americas first 
longrange bomber in more than 25 years four crewmen died in the 
earlier accidents 
the 204 million aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff for a 
routine training flight from dyess air force base where 29 b1bs 
are based air force officials said 
three crewmen bailed out then capt michael e waters turned the 
smoking fourengine aircraft toward an unpopulated area and flew 
about a halfmile before ejecting air force spokewoman maj beth 
kilgore said today 
in my mind what that pilot did was not only save the lives of 
his crew but the lives of civilians in the area said walter 
gilstrap who drove a pickup truck though fields to rescue the men 
the pilot avoided a sparsely populated area of farm houses and 
trailer parks eight miles west of abilene 
he rode it out for as long as he could and set it down where no 
one would be hurt said gilstrap they ought to give that man a 
distinguished flying cross 
the air force set up a roadblock to seal off the site and would 
not speculate on the cause of the crash military investigators 
intended to examine the wreckage today said air force spokeswoman 
beverly foster 
the wreckage was scattered over an area seven miles by two miles 
said al dostal another air force spokesman 
waters and his crewmates capt george m gover capt charles 
m zarza offensive systems operator and 1st lt anton eret jr 
defensive systems operator were all in good condition today at the 
base hospital said air force spokeswoman linda gellnere 
the plane was flying about two miles north of interstate 20 near 
tye when smoke spewed from its left engine said witness lou paulsen 
at first there was just a puff of smoke then fire paulsen 
said it looked like it started to go out then it flared up big 
gilstrap said he was near the tye truck stop where he has a 
knifesharpening stand when people around him started yelling about 
a plane on fire 
i looked out the window and saw three parachutes and i knew 
what was happening he said so i got in the truck and drove i 
kind of had the coordinates figured out i drove to where i thought 
they would be 
gilstrap found the three crewmen scattered about one field and 
the pilot a halfmile away in a different pasture 
they were all in shock gilstrap said they hugged me and i 
hugged them and two of them asked me to call their wives 
gilstrap said there were flames in the field where he found the 
crewmen but not close enough to burn them other witnesses said 
flames from the crash rose 10 stories into the air and smoke was 
seen 20 miles away 
in all 100 aircraft in the b1 series have been built 
the b1bs were built at a cost of 2041 million apiece in 1987 
they are intended to be the mainstay of the us bombing force able 
to penetrate welldefended enemy territory in a nuclear war 
on sept 28 1987 another dyessbased b1b crashed at a training 
range in colorado when the jet built by rockwell international 
corp ran into a flock of migrating birds at 600 feet three 
crewmen died 
since that accident the air force has budgeted 40 million to 
make the b1b less vulnerable to birds by adding deflectors near 
sensitive hydraulic equipment 
in august 1984 one of four prototype models designated b1a 
crashed at edwards air force base calif killing one man and 
injuring two others

q mr vice president a subject dear to the hearts of 
conservatives but less dear to the hearts of democrats in congress 
in democrats who still control congress is aid military aid to the 
nicaraguan contras 
you have supported it consistently throughout your campaign yet 
you didnt emphasize it consistently throughout your campaign how 
high a priority will aid to the contras be in a bush administration 
a it will have a high priority because freedom and democracy in 
this hemisphere has a high priority and i know these leaders in 
this hemisphere i cant say i know daniel ortega that well but i 
met him a time or two 
and i will press to keep the pressure on the sandinistas to keep 
their commitment to the organization of american states the 
commitment being one to democracy and freedom yeah lisa 
q mr vice president you spoke during the campaign about your 
desire to eradicate bigotry yet you campaigned hardly at all in 
black neighborhoods and didnt receive very many black votes 
specifically what are you prepared to do to assure these 
americans that the next four years will not be a continuation of the 
last eight and what would you try to do to reduce the number of 
racial incidents that have occurred in recent years 
a well i hope i didnt understand the question properly because 
if you suggest the last eight have been eight years of bigotry i 
just dont agree with that i will do everything i possibly can 
thats not legislative necessarily its using the bully pulpit of 
the white house to speak out against the kinds of incidents youre 
talking about 
but when you look back at the history of the united states of 
america i think there are far fewer incidents that build on bigotry 
than there have been but i would certainly do my level best to 
make very clear from that white house that bigotry has no place in 
america 
q mr vice president let me follow up on a story on the 
question about the summit when jim baker talks to soviets is he 
going to place any conditions on terms for you meeting with 
president gorbachev or will you strictly get together with him for 
a gettogether getacquainted session in the first 100 days or six 
months 
a i am acquainted im acquainted with him and what i want to 
do is see progress and so i would have the secretary of state do 
exactly what ive said that theres no ive never supported 
meetings just for the sake of having a meeting i want some progress 
to take place but it doesnt have to be progress on start or on one 
category or another 
we have arms control we have human rights we have regional 
differences and i can see reasons to talk about any provided 
theres reason to believe there will be progress i would like to 
see my secretary of state continue that which george shultz has done 
in terms of the numbers of meetings with the soviet foreign 
minister i think thats been very very helpful jesse 
q mr vice president how are you going to communicate with the 
american people youre a person who writes notes all the time and 
you like to telephone all the time but with the demand on your time 
as president how are you going to talk to the people 
a reach out and touch someone use a telephone and im not 
going to change in terms of my belief that the more personal contact 
you have the better i recognize theres the parameters of this 
job are quite different but i will continue to do what ive done in 
terms of contact and im one who works with closely with the 
people that ive you know associated with on my staff not just 
one person i talk to i will continue just by way of example what 
ive been doing as vice president and in terms of being briefed 
directly by the central intelligence agency every single day its a 
little bit of a departure but thats the way im going to do it 
and it puts me in contact more with the experts but ill try to 
keep touch as best i can ann

q mr vice president now that youve been elected could you 
share with us the lessons you learned in the reagan administration 
and specifically how youll run your administration differently 
a well ill share with you the reason i think our president has 
been effective he takes a principled position and stays with it 
and he fights for what he believes in 
and true as somebody suggested he had the benefit of a 
republican senate when he started but progress didnt stop when the 
republican senate when the control changed hands so ive learned 
quite a bit about that 
certain principles fundamental principles and then fight for 
them and stay with them and thats what i will try to do and every 
president has his own management style ive learned a lot about 
delegation on the other hand i also as i just responded here to 
jessie i believe that you have to stay in close touch individually 
with these people 
q getting back to lisas question weve noticed as we followed 
you in the campaign that you generally stay in rather affluent 
suburban areas rather than poor inner cities and not in black 
neighborhoods at all since the convention and i wonder as a 
symbol is that a good symbol for a presidency that will try to 
reach out and touch these people 
a i think the campaign was properly designed strategically 
operated the message obviously got out to a lot of the american 
people and im very pleased with the amount of the vote but in a 
campaign you obviously have to be sure you get your vote out 
and that doesnt mean you dont want the votes of others because 
you have to turn out your own people and reach out to as many people 
as you can i dont know if you were with us saul at that 
breakfast in baltimore put on by josh smith a black businessperson 
there on very short notice a magnificent crowd of people there 
but i had to campaign set the agenda set the schedule and try 
to win this election and that is done now and i had a very nice 
talk incidentally last night and i want to thank him for it here 
from a phone call from jesse jackson with whom i met as vice 
president in the vice presidents residency at least twice without 
any fanfare talking about common objectives yes 
q mr vice president you said in your opening statement that 
you plan to bring a brand new team to washington but three of the 
present cabinet members secretaries brady cavazos and attorney 
general thornburgh are regarded as bush people do you plan to keep 
any or all of them on in a new administration 
a there could be but i will have announcements of that later 
on there will be as i think i indicated a major turnover but 
some people at various levels may be asked to remain but as i have 
stated over the campaign i think there is something to be said for 
reinvigorating the process by with new people yes 
q during the last weeks of the campaign you talked about 
getting a mandate and about mainstream values in america do you 
believe with the closeness of the popular vote that you have a 
mandate and could you be specific about what that means you will do 
a well i dont know whether i want to use the word mandate 
i am very pleased with the results and i dont think it was overly 
close ive got to be careful because i havent seen the numbers 
but i thought the latest i saw was around 54 percent which i think 
most people would consider a big win and with many states 
i think we exceeded well i dont know on the electoral vote 
the big strong support from many many states so i would simply 
say the american people have spoken the verdict was clear and 
therefore i will take what i think the prime issues of the campaign 
were and work constructively with congress to attain the will of 
the people yeah 
q mr vice president you said throughout the campaign and as 
recently as last night that you want a kinder gentler nation 
and that you hear voices of the quiet people 
two questions sir beyond the rhetoric and afterglow what 
specific programs are you proposing that will make this a kinder 
gentler nation and sir what are those quiet people those 
quiet voices telling you 
a well in the first place they spoke loud and clear last 
night which i was pleased about secondly i think to go to the 
first part of your question i think when i talk about investing in 
our kids in the many proposals ive made in that area that would 
be an indication of how i will pursue this objective of a kinder 
and gentler nation i threw in as you may remember the whole 
concept of trying to do the best i possibly can with the environment 
in that i used child care as a part of that yes

the visit by human rights activist andrei d 
sakharov to the united states has gone virtually unreported by state 
media with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition 
to the us star wars program 
that report from radio moscow carried on its 
internationalservice news programs tuesday apparently was the only 
mention made by soviet media of sakharovs visit to the united 
states which began sunday 
radio moscow said sakharov made the comments about the reagan 
administrations spacebased antimissile program at a boston news 
conference 
sakharov winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize is scheduled to 
spend two weeks visiting relatives in the united states undergoing 
medical tests and promoting a new international organization he 
belongs to 
a celebrity in the west since he helped form the soviet dissident 
movement of the 1970s sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal 
exile after criticizing the kremlins military drive into 
afghanistan 
president mikhail s gorbachev allowed him to return to moscow in 
december 1986 some statements and articles by sakharov have been 
printed in the soviet media since then including an article last 
week in a magazine that opposed some elements of gorbachevs 
blueprint for political and electoral reforms 
other activities by sakharov have gone unreported here including 
his delivery to gorbachev of a list of 200 soviets reportedly held 
in prison labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their 
political views 
the official tass news agency reported wednesday that the 
organization sakharov belongs to the international foundation for 
the survival and development of humanity held its first session in 
boston the previous day 
tass made no mention of sakharov in its threeparagragh report 
but said the soviet delegation to the meeting was headed by yevgeny 
velikhov vice president of the soviet academy of sciences

q mr vice president youve made it clear that you appreciate 
how hard all of us all of us journalists work well in the last 
month of this campaign youve made our jobs a lot harder by not 
holding news conferences very frequently certainly not frequently 
enough for us to feel we can report on you as well as we might as 
president will you be holding frequent or regular news conferences 
a well first i think youve done a superb job reporting on me 
and i know some of you arent going to believe this but this is our 
208th press conference since i announced for president of the united 
states 
and these arent just shouted questions these are where you sit 
there like this and take them or go to a rope line and have a 
microphone there now recently we havent had that many but i feel 
you have beautifully reported this campaign and that the message got 
out and i will strive to i wont strive to keep up 208 in a year 
and a quarter but i will do my best in terms of press conferences 
q when will you hold regular formal news conferences 
a im not going to set a date no im not going to have one 
every tuesday but i will hold regular press conferences and try to 
endeavor in the future as i have in the past to answer these 
questions owen and then over here 
q sir you campaigned against abortion for voluntary school 
prayer for a lineitem veto for a balanced budget amendment would 
you make these all top priorities of your administration by pushing 
either a constitutional amendment or if congress rejects that 
would you lead an effort for a constitutional convention that would 
adopt these provisions 
a i will be selling setting out the priorities on these and 
many other issues during the transition and then i will make clear 
the major priorities but on these issues that ive spoken on i do 
feel very strongly about them i have some real reservations about a 
constitutional convention however yes working our way down 
q mr vice president you in the course of the campaign 
youve spent quite a bit of time ridiculing liberals who make up a 
significant a significant number of people in the country consider 
themselves liberals do you and youve created a fair amount of 
bitterness as a result what specifically can you say to those 
people that consider themselves liberals are they 
a i said i want to be president of all the people and i dont 
think ive been was ridiculing as a matter of fact i was just 
trying to get the facts out there and i think the american people 
understood that but i would i cant do it their way 
i dont plan to suddenly say well okay i accept what i call 
the liberal agenda thats what this election was about come join 
us if youve got some good ideas as to how to move this country 
forward i need them yes kathy and then mark 
q mr vice president senator bentsen complained rather bitterly 
about the tone of your campaign and spoke of distortions you in 
turn objected to the democrats raising the issue of racism what 
kind of toll did this race take on your relationship with bentsen 
and will you be able to work with him as chairman of 
a his call last night pledging to work together which is 
certainly my objective and look this campaign is over theres 
no hard feelings about that the american people are smart they 
know a toughfought campaign on both sides when they see it 
so im just going to keep you know saying what ive said here 
and ive said yesterday and i think senator bentsens responding 
yesterday as he did was extraordinary and i think he means it 
yeah mark and then dave and then tom 
q mr vice president you told the american people to read your 
lips no new taxes but some people on capitol hill believe that 
there will have to be revenue enhancements to reduce the deficit 
youve ruled out income tax increases but will you rule out revenue 
enhancements to reduce the budget deficits 
a well youd have to define for me what you mean by revenue 
enhancement i got into a little flap in the campaign because i 
did support the catastrophic health plan and there was some charge 
that that was a tax increase i dont think it was 
and im talking about holding the line on taxes and i dont plan 
to deviate and i think the american people must have understood 
that when they voted in rather large numbers for my candidacy yeah

cape cod residents voted to limit growth in their 
communities and asked that future development be curbed before it 
ruins the regions character 
in california where a score of cities were considering various 
slowgrowth proposals four such measures on san diegos ballot were 
defeated and another was defeated in riverside county similar 
ballot issues were approved in two orange county coastal cities 
in cape cod two nonbinding ballot questions calling for a 
moratorium on future development until a countywide regulating board 
can be established were approved by a margin of about 21 
i think its a very strong message that comprehensive and 
practical solutions to unfettered growth are being sought after by 
the voters of cape cod said susan nickerson of the association 
for the preservation of cape cod 
the population on the 65mile finger of land has grown by 540 
percent in the last 60 years compared with a statewide increase of 
only 50 percent during the same period nickerson said about 
175000 people make the cape their yearround home and in the summer 
months as many as 500000 people are on the cape 
in california two measures to ensure that the rapidly growing 
university of californiasanta cruz would pay for services needed 
for expansion were approved by wide margins 
in huntington beach measure j limiting new development was 
defeated 506 percent to 494 percent similar measures were 
approved in costa mesa and san juan capistrano 
but a newport beach measure was defeated 462 percent to 538 
percent 
and in hawaii residents of oahu and hawaii islands took 
different courses on initiative proposals aimed at blocking 
multimilliondollar developments near two of the states most 
popular beaches 
on hawaii island voters defeated by a 3to2 margin a proposal 
that would have blocked a 350room 329 million resort hotel 
adjacent to hapuna beach at south kohala 
on populous oahu however the vote was nearly 2to1 in favor of 
a measure blocking a 171unit housing project across a highway from 
sandy beach a popular surfing site

sen lowell p weicker jr the maverick 
republican who gained national prominence in the watergate era 
refused to concede defeat in his bid for a fourth term despite 
unofficial totals showing him losing by a paperthin margin to 
democrat joseph i lieberman 
a recount appeared likely 
connecticut voters also helped republican george bush win the 
presidency over democrat michael dukakis handing him eight 
electoral votes tuesday 
final unofficial returns showed lieberman with 498 percent of 
the vote to weickers 492 percent or 678191 votes to 669983 two 
thirdparty candidates had a total of less than 1 percent of the 
vote 
weickers 8208vote loss exceeded the trigger that makes a 
recount automatic under state law a margin smaller than onehalf of 
1 percent and less than 2000 votes but the official vote total 
wasnt expected to be available until tonight 
liebermans upset came in a campaign that included television 
commercials depicting weicker as a bear who slept through some 
senate votes and missed others while traveling the country to 
collect speaking fees 
i wish i were here to declare a victory or defeat weicker 
told supporters his voice choking with emotion unfortunately 
im not in a position to do either right now no matter how all this 
turns out i dont have one single gripe 
a jubilant lieberman the states attorney general claimed 
victory my friends the american dream is alive and well in 
connecticut tonight lieberman declared at a victory rally in 
hartford 
lieberman styled himself the peoples lawyer on consumer and 
environmental issues during six years as attorney general 
in the presidential race bush had 735791 votes to dukakis 
667808 or 52 percent to 47 percent libertarian party candidate 
ron paul had 11522 votes or 1 percent of the total

q mr vice president youve you may well have a chance to 
appoint one or more supreme court justices in your administration 
youve promised to appoint men of conservative moderate views 
would someone who is prochoice on abortion fit that category in any 
way 
a ive said i dont have a litmus test for judges what i have 
is a test as to whether in my view they will legislate from the 
bench in which case i wouldnt want them or whether they will 
faithfully interpret the constitution of the united states in which 
case i would yeah tom 
q mr vice president a lot of economists keep saying that your 
idea of a flexible freeze to reduce the budget deficit is just an 
updated version of what somebody once called voodoo economics 
why are you so confident that the same basic policy that failed to 
balance the budget under ronald reagan for eight years is going to 
have more success under you 
q because other economists think it will you can cite some that 
think it wont and i can cite some that think it will and the 
predication is there to have to keep the economy growing and you 
have to have inflation control that growth of spending to the rate 
of inflation but theres a lot of good people that think its a 
wonderful idea so i will just push for it in the congress as best 
i can yes 
q mr president we tend to judge our incoming presidents by 
symbols as much as their policies have you given any thought to 
whose picture youre going to put in the oval office and whether 
there is a phrase a catchphrase that youll use for your 
administration like the new deal the fair deal the square deal 
will there there be something for the bush administration we can 
hang our hats on 
a i have not considered either one of those two things right 
now and there probably some thought will be given to the latter 
in the transition period but at this juncture ive not considered 
that mike 
q mr bush last night at your victory celebration you talked 
about healing the nation but at a victory celebration it didnt 
look like you were had the thrill of victory i mean youve been 
positioning yourself for this office for more than 10 years weve 
seen you get pretty excited throwing a good horseshoe you dont 
seem to be that up you said you had some trouble sleeping last 
night how does it feel has it hit you yet 
a its beginning to and youre right about last night because 
when i came over there there was still some uncertainty not 
really when we got to the convention center but when we were at the 
family dinner and went back to the hotel and there was still some 
uncertainty 
so ive been through a tugandpull before it became clear that 
the numbers would work out as they have and of course it was a 
culmination of a long effort and i do think that when you realize 
that youre elected president of the united states there must be a 
shifting of gears a recognition that the path ahead is going to be 
a tremendous challenge and you want to do your level best 
i guess maybe i wasnt jumping with joy as much because my heart 
was filled with a certain gratitude to the people that helped me get 
here not only staff people campaign people but family 
particularly and so it was an evening of mixed emotion for me 
and yet i think youre right mike when the balloons came they 
had a different feeling entirely than a campaign rally the 
exhilaration was underpinning it all 
but i think the recognition that ive got a tremendous job ahead 
and that i need gods help to get it done was also a part of that 
q how does it feel now 
a somewhere in between total exhilaration and recognition that 
the challenge ahead is going to be awesome that i need to get some 
rest and i think everybody involved in this campaign needs to get 
some rest and i will do that 
but i cant use the word exciting i can use the word 
gratified at the outcome better than many of us thought but i 
will not underestimate the challenge ahead and theres a 
seriousness that takes over right this minute yes 
q mr vice president you said earlier that you were going to 
provide the intelligence paper to vice president quayle do you 
intend to set up with mr quayle the same sort of relationship you 
had with president reagan in terms of coming in regularly for lunch 
and 
a yes i will do that yes 
q mr vice president in addition to gods help youre going to 
need senator doles help and throughout the campaign hes 
periodically given you 
a what order do you place those in

presidentelect george bush today named campaign 
chairman james a baker iii to be secretary of state and said the 
new republican administration would be holding the line on taxes 
barely pausing to savor his smashing election victory bush used 
a morningafter news conference to make the first handful of 
appointments to guide his transition to the presidency he promised 
a brand new team when he takes over from president reagan on 
jan 20 
bush said his victory was still sinking in and described his 
personal feelings as somewhere between total exhilaration and 
recognition that the challenge ahead is going to be awesome 
the presidentelect said he has no litmus test for the 
supreme court or other judicial appointments he will make over the 
next four years but said he didnt want to name anyone to the court 
who would legislate from the bench 
bush also pledged to work with the new democratic congress and 
said he thought he could work harmoniously with senate 
republican leader bob dole a onetime rival who complained that the 
newly elected president hadnt worked hard enough to elect 
republican congressional candidates 
bush was flying back to washington after his news conference to 
meet with president reagan and discuss the transition vice 
presidentelect dan quayle was expected to meet the nations newly 
elected leader on his arrival 
at his news conference in texas he renewed his campaign 
statement that he was willing to meet soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev but added i dont think that would start before i 
become president of the united states he noted the superpowers 
have differences on arms control human rights and regional 
conflicts 
he expressed confidence that the soviets would live up to their 
commitment to withdraw their troops from afghanistan 
he also said support for the nicaraguan contras would have a 
high priority in his administration 
in addition to baker bush appointed chief of staff craig fuller 
and pollster and senior campaign adviser bob teeter as codirectors 
of the transition 
his first cabinet appointment came as no surprise 
bush said baker a longtime friend and fellow texan had set a 
new standard of excellence as white house chief of staff and 
treasury secretary during the reagan administration secretary of 
state george shultz enthusiastically endorses baker as his 
successor bush said 
he praised bakers proven skills as a negotiator and said 
the personal respect in which he is held will allow him again to 
demonstrate the highest standards of performance as our next 
secretary of state 
bush told reporters as he was departing his 30minute news 
conference that he had spoken with british prime minister margaret 
thatcher on tuesday night the two are expected to meet next week 
asked about his oftrepeated antitax campaign pledge bush 
replied im talking about holding the line on taxes and i dont 
plan to deviate and i think the american people must have understood 
that when they elected him 
queried about whether his insistence on no new taxes also covered 
socalled revenue enhancements bush noted he had supported an 
increase in medicare premiums to finance catastrophic health 
coverage youll have to define what you mean he said 
he also said quayle would enjoy the same access to the papers 
access to the intelligence access to the information that bush 
has had in the no 2 slot bush did not cite specific duties for 
quayle but said his vice president would meet regularly with him 
bush opened his first news conference as presidentelect with 
thanks for those who had supported him and praise for the defeated 
democratic ticket michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen he also threw 
a verbal bouquet in the direction of the reporters who covered his 
campaign 
bush who attended church services before mounting the news 
conference podium said he had just begun to think about the task 
ahead and i am certain that gods help is absolutely essential for 
anyone chosen to lead this great country of ours 
he moved with unusual speed in making his first cabinet 
appointment but hedged on others 
asked whether he would keep attorney general dick thornburgh 
treasury secretary nicholas brady or education secretary lauro 
cavazos all appointed in recent months he said it could be 
ill have announcements on that later on 
he also said campaign press secretary sheila tate would serve in 
the same post for the transition but said nothing of his plans for 
a white house spokesman 
he said his close aide boyden gray would be working closely with 
fuller and teeter and would become his legal counsel in the white 
house 
at his news conference bush said his election was a clear 
verdict and said he would work constructively with congress to 
obtain the will of the people 
as he left his hotel residence on his first morning as 
presidentelect bush said he felt just fine thanks 
when a reporter suggested he might encounter a few problems with 
the democratcontrolled senate next year bush replied a few 
problems everywhere the democrats held a 5545 edge in the new 
senate with one race too close to call they had 54 seats in the 
outgoing senate 
bushs wife barbara said she felt great after going to bed

hatchet after the rough campaign in which he had repeatedly bashed 
the democratcontrolled congress

the united states congress he told a room jammed with jubilant 
backers

the financial markets headed sharply lower today in a 
surprisingly cool reaction to george bushs victory over michael 
dukakis in the presidential election 
economists said several factors depressed the dollar and stock 
and bond prices although uppermost in investors minds was how the 
presidentelect would deal with crucial problems such as the budget 
and trade deficits and with the democraticcontrolled congress 
i think the markets already thought bush would win and are 
viewing the election as a nonevent but some uncertainty 
remains said edward yardeni chief economist for prudential bache 
securities inc 
whats depressing the bonds and stocks is that the dollar is 
down pretty hard 
the dollar initially rallied overseas after bushs victory 
tuesday but it later eased in japan and europe largely on 
profittaking and it was down in early domestic trading despite 
reports of centralbank intervention 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 
1618 to 211131 as of 1230 pm est the closely watched indicator 
had advanced 285 points in election day trading 
interest rates shot up today as bond prices declined the yield 
on the treasurys bellwether 30year issue rose to around 9 percent 
for the first time in more than a month by midday while its price 
fell about 750 per 1000 face amount shortterm rates were up 
slightly 
stock and bond prices had edged higher and the dollar rose 
against major foreign currencies tuesday partly because of 
confidence that republican bush would defeat democrat dukakis and 
that the victory would mean continuation of the reagan 
administrations economic policies

president reagan on wednesday vetoed a bill he 
said would require unnecessary questions about plumbing heating and 
cooling facilities in housing units as part of the 1990 census 
in a statement reagan said the questions would not produce 
data sufficiently useful to justify their inclusion and would 
increase administrative costs and add to the paperwork burden 
imposed on the public by the census 
adequate data on plumbing and heating will continue to be 
available through the census and other sources the president said 
the bill also would have required tabulations relating to 
asianamericans and pacific islanders as part of the census 
reagan said this would require the census bureau to use a form 
of race question that the bureau has tested and found to be less 
accurate than the one it plans to use in 1990

ambassador william gleysteen jr and john wickham excommander of 
the us forces in south korea the two americans served here during 
the kwangju turmoil 
the united states is accused of helping chun suppress the kwangju 
uprising the accusation stems from the fact that wickham allowed a 
south korean unit under his operational control to be used to put 
down the revolt 
under a joint command system all south korean troops are placed 
under the operational control of the top us commander here 
gleysteen and wickham have denied washingtons involvement in the

assembly but said they would send letters clarifying their 
positions

republican stan stephens says he saw a need 
for change after 20 years of democratic governors but it took him 
nearly two years on the stump to make others see things his way 
the 59yearold cable television executive the first candidate 
to announce in the contest to succeed retiring gov ted schwinden 
soundly defeated former democratic gov thomas judge to win the 
gubernatorial race tuesday 
id like to feel we won the contest because people realize we 
represent change stephens said there was a desire on the part 
of montana to have change to put someone with business experience 
in the executive position of the state 
a canadian immigrant who came to montana to harvest wheat 39 
years ago and decided to stay stephens labeled himself and running 
mate allen kolstad as the candidates of change early in the campaign 
and stressed their combined years of legislative and private 
business experience in promising to revitalize montanas ailing 
economy 
stephens a former radio broadcaster from havre logged 16 years 
in the state senate before retiring in 1986 
he began his campaign in january 1987 to build statewide 
recognition needed to challenge a democrat as wellknown as judge 
the twoyear journey was necessary to market my candidacy and 
to let the people know who stan stephens is and what he stands 
for he said 
stephens made leaner government a campaign theme saying the 
economic plans of his opponent would lead to increased state 
bureaucracy he pledged to reduce certain property taxes and 
government regulation of business in an effort to invigorate the 
private sector

george bush has bashed and slugged his way into the white house 
now he faces the daunting task of pulling the nation together and 
getting on with the business of governing america bush got to 
the presidency by doggedness and not a little nastiness abetted by 
the ineptitude of michael s dukakis campaign 
bush is dragging a whole lot of baggage perhaps more than any 
other modern presidentelect he must move quickly and boldly to 
assemble an administration that exudes excellence competence and 
experience bush must overcome the doubts about his selection of dan 
quayle with the appointment of a cabinet and staff that contain the 
best that the nation can produce 
bush must move on from the reagan legacy unfortunately 
bushs notax vow not to raise taxes makes it virtually impossible 
for him to deal effectively with the voting publics single apparent 
demand for action from the new administration to do something about 
the budget deficit

apparently a majority of voters were untroubled by the deplorable 
campaign conducted by the vice president worse perhaps they were 
taken in by his insinuations that his opponent was an extremist was 
unpatriotic belonged to a subversive organization and personally 
let murderers out of prison 
in either case the first challenge facing the presidentelect is 
to demonstrate that notwithstanding his sleazy campaign his 
presidency will not be predicated on appeals to peoples worst 
instincts down the road lies national division and turmoil 
mr bush who was perceived through most of his career as a man 
of moderate views and tolerant instincts must move quickly to 
reassure the millions of americans who voted for mr dukakis and 
those who voted not at all that he will be president of all the 
people that he will seek to unite not exclude

george bush must swiftly put the uglier moments of the 
partisanship behind him that should come naturally to him except 
for his brief run in recent weeks as a tarttongued political 
infighter hes been a liftime model of style and class 
well before the inauguration a man with his hardwon sense of 
the realities of the office will want to start tussling with the 
intractable budget deficit and pushing for a sitdown with mikhail 
gorbachev to get an update on glasnost and perestroika and the 
climate for continued arms negotiation 
a bipartisan commission is working on proposals to whittle the 
deficit but the new president is going to need help from democrats 
in congress to work on acceptable compromises 
at least one other highpriority item should be on

41yearold senator with the best crash course that the brightest 
transitional aides can teach to start preparing him for the awesome

atlanta journal 
at first they called him a wimp in the end they were whining 
about him being a bully who was too tough on his opponent the truth 
is that from the beginning of the 1988 campaign george bush showed 
admirable strength of character coming back from defeat in the iowa 
caucus to win his partys nomination and holding steady throughout 
all the apparent ups and downs of the general election campaign 
since the democratic party had found itself unable to nominate a 
truly moderate candidate much less a conservative one it was the 
democratic party that defeated itself in 1988 rather than facing 
that reality some democrats will blame defeat on the unfair 
tactics of the opposition while others will find personal fault with 
their candidate 
the more liberal among them will find it particularly hard to put 
the blame on their own wing of the party but we say the election 
was decided on issues basic underlying issues george bush won 
because he discerned the depths of these issues and stayed on 
course the democrats did the rest to themselves

relations with japan and the asiapacific region and has in

japan is confident that with the election of mr bush 
japanus relations will be further strengthened and developed in

george bush finally won the biggest poker game 
in american politics not so much following the gamblers shrewd 
instincts as trusting in the luck of the draw 
in 1980 bush heard kenny rogers hit song the gambler 
played incessantly on his campaign bus youve got to know when to 
hold em know when to fold em went the refrain 
that may bush folded his cards and ended his twoyear quest for 
the presidency but a couple of months later he got lucky again he 
was tapped as ronald reagans running mate and spent the next eight 
years as vice president 
this year bush played his hand according to a carefully scripted 
media campaign he bested five republican primary rivals and then 
trounced democratic candidate michael dukakis to claim the jackpot 
you get a good bounce in life and then one event feeds on 
another bush once told a reporter 
george herbert walker bush the resume candidate ivy league 
education at yale university decorated navy combat pilot in world 
war ii successful texas oilman twoterm house member from houston 
unsuccessful senate candidate ambassador to the united nations 
chairman of the republican national committee director of the 
central intelligence agency vice president presidentelect 
son of a wealthy twoterm senator from connecticut grandson of 
the man who donated the walker cup to golf bush has sought to 
conceal his eastern establishment heritage with humor occasional 
annoyance and some goodoleboy gestures that dont always ring true 
theres a tendency to have you fit into a mold bush 
complained this year the mold for me is a kind of ivy league 
elitist and i resist it 
he resisted by climbing behind the wheel of a tractortrailer in 
new hampshire and announcing that he liked fried pork rinds this 
is the real me he said this is my home turf 
but try as he might bush had a hard time disguising his preppy 
origins 
just before his highly publicized truck ride bush loped into a 
cafe and asked the waitress to bring him a splash of tea he 
drew hoots when he was defeated in an iowa gop straw poll last year 
because his supporters were off at the air show they were off at 
their daughters comingout party or they were off teeing off on 
the golf course 
although bush declared he was not going to mess up his 
campaign against dukakis and largely succeeded he stirred 
controversy when he tapped sen dan quayle of indiana as his running 
mate but bush held his cards and rode out the storm over quayles 
military service and academic performance 
bush was an intensely loyal vice president to reagan he made few 
waves and submerged any political or personal differences they 
might have had 
hes the dog that doesnt bark said richard viguerie the 
directmail fundraiser for conservative causes viguerie said in 
1983 there was little evidence of bushs impact on white house 
policy decisions 
bush insisted he was out of the loop and played no part in 
the irancontra affair last year 
later he said he had some misgivings about the armsforhostages 
deal with iran in which weapons profits were diverted to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels but bush refused to say precisely what 
advice if any he gave the president 
the vice president did not escape criticism so easily when he 
praised ferdinand marcos at a dinner in manila telling the 
repressive philippine president before his ouster that we love 
your commitment to democracy 
bush also created a furor when during a visit to nato 
headquarters in brussels belgium he said soviet tank mechanics 
could teach detroit auto workers a thing or two 
perhaps the most controversial entry on the lengthy bush resume 
is his oneyear hitch as cia director beginning in 1976 at a time 
when panamas military ruler gen manuel noriega was on the spy 
agencys payroll as an informant 
bush has largely avoided questions about any relationship with 
noriega who was subsequently indicted by two federal grand juries 
in connection with his alleged involvement in drug trafficking 
bush dismisses suggestions that his cia tenure would be a 
liability as president 
i led something at a very difficult time he says i went 
in there when it had been demoralized by the attacks of a bunch of 
little untutored squirts from capitol hill 
and i stood up for the cia then and i stand up for it now and 
defend it so let the liberals wring their hands and consider it a 
liability i consider it a strength 
bush campaigned as a goldwater republican when he first ran for 
congress in 1966 when he sought the presidency in 1980 he shifted 
to a more moderate position referring to reagans supplyside 
proposals as voodoo economics he defends those same policies as 
vice president 
bush has provoked enduring suspicion among some conservatives 
summed up in a 1980 article in the conservative weekly human events 
bush was not anything close to being a goldwater 
conservative the article said noting that his ratings by the 
conservative americans for constitutional action dropped from a 
respectable 83 to 58 in three years as a congressman 
bush might as well have been in another party the article 
said 
bush can joke about his standing among conservatives 
the day in may 1980 when he pulled out of the presidential race 
bush was serving beer cheese and crackers to campaign reporters in 
the living room of his houston home 
someone teased him about having a copy of william f buckleys 
conservative magazine national review on top of a pile on his 
coffee table 
well that doesnt have to be there any more bush said and 
slipped it to the bottom of the stack

prosecution in the case 
the deputies suit claims dees and cohen wrested control from 
the lawfully elected district attorney of sabine county and 
appointed their own agent and servant john hannah to not only 
prosecute the sabine county criminal action but to use his position 
to publicly destroy the plaintiffs 
hannah is a former us attorney who was appointed special 
prosecutor for the trial 
the suit also alleges that dees and cohen are continuing to 
pressure the smith county district attorney to pursue murder charges 
against the three men although a state appeals court ruled earlier 
this fall that the trial would represent double jeopardy garner 
died in a hospital in smith county 
the lawsuit also accuses the defendants of inexcusable 
conduct that ended in a fundraising letter the law center mailed 
to many people in texas 
in only slightly veiled language the mailing compared hyden 
and horton to the ku klux klan and implied that all southern white 
people were racist and based on this hate mail they requested the 
recipient to send in money to the southern poverty law center

a marine corps sergeant 
was sentenced to death for murdering his pregnant 24yearold wife 
despite his plea to a court martial to spare his life for the sake 
of his children and family 
i realize you have returned a guilty verdict for the most 
serious of crimes sgt joseph l thomas 28 said tuesday in a 
courtroom at the base 45 miles southeast of los angeles 
but he added i have worked hard all my life i ask that you 
spare my life for the sake of my children and my family thank you 
thomas a father of two remarried after his wifes slaying and 
his current wife is nine months pregnant 
nevertheless he was sentenced to death for beating melinda jean 
thomas to death on dec 9 1987 and trying to cover up the murder 
by staging a fiery car accident 
the crime committed by the accused is so grievous so 
monstrous so inhuman that the only adequate response is death 
capt paul mcbride the assistant prosecutor said in arguing for 
the death sentence 
the prosecutor capt bradley n garber portrayed thomas as a 
calculating killer who faked the car accident so he could collect 
50000 from his wifes life insurance policy 
execution would be carried out by lethal injection marine corps 
spokesman staff sgt steve short said 
the sentence will be reviewed automatically by the commanding 
general of el toros third marine aircraft wing and forwarded to the 
marines court of military review and the court of military appeals 
thomas also can appeal his sentence to the us supreme court short 
said 
thomas joined the marines in 1983 and was working as a telephone 
and radio wiring specialist with a support group of the third marine 
aircraft wing at the time of the murder 
thomas was convicted nov 3 of beating his wife melinda jean 
thomas to death her body was found in the burned wreckage of the 
couples suzuki samurai on dec 10 1987 and the riverside county 
coroner at first ruled the death a suicide 
however thomas began to contradict himself months later in 
routine followup interviews with military officials 
thomas accomplice in the slaying lance cpl michael nelson 
testified during the monthlong court martial that he watched thomas 
beat his wife to death with a tire iron 
nelson who testified in exchange for immunity from prosecution 
said that he helped thomas load the womans body into the trunk of a 
rented car and drive it to a mountainous area 
once there nelson testified he helped thomas strap his wifes 
body into the couples vehicle doused the vehicle with gasoline and 
sent it hurtling off a 500foot embankment 
when the car failed to explode as expected nelson said he 
climbed down the ravine and set it afire 
defense attorney maj mark stevens maintained that nelson was the 
real killer 
thomas has been held in a camp pendleton brig since his april 5 
arrest he will eventually be transferred to the us disciplinary 
barracks at fort leavenworth kan pending completion of the 
military review process

soldiers with orders to shoot 
antigovernment demonstrators patrolled the capital wednesday the 
third day of a nationwide strike that has brought commerce to a 
standstill 
the government said the strike was called by a sinhalese radical 
group the peoples liberation front to disrupt thursdays formal 
nominations for the dec 19 presidential election 
hundreds of foreign tourists left for home after being evacuated 
from beach resorts threatened by extremists 
radio reports said soldiers were ordered to shoot any 
demonstrators but no protests were reported wednesday 
the navy moved sailors into colombo port where 25000 dock 
workers have been off the job since monday 
workers unite avoid a military takeover said 
sinhaleselanguage leaflets distributed by the ultraleft new lanka 
socialist party whose support is drawn largely from trade unions 
commerce in colombo and most major towns was at a standstill as 
banks and shops closed for fear of retaliation by sinhalese radicals 
demanding the resignation of president junius r jayewardene and the 
dissolution of parliament 
jayewardene has said he will not run for reelection his united 
national partys presidential flag bearer is the prime minister 
ranasinghe premadasa and the chief opposition candidate is former 
prime minister sirimavo bandaranaike of the sri lanka freedom party 
however jayewardene says he will ask for military help from 
india if anyone tries to overthrow him india already has 47000 
soldiers in sri lanka trying to end a tamil separatist war and last 
week the arrival of indian paratroopers in the maldive islands 
squelched an attempted coup in that tiny indian ocean nation by sri 
lankan tamil mercenaries 
more than 9000 foreign tourists were evacuated from resort towns 
on the coast south of colombo tuesday after hotel staffers said they 
received warnings the hotels would be attacked unless they closed 
the staffers said the threats were issued in the name of the 
peoples liberation front 
the tourists mostly from west germany italy france and 
britain were transferred to colombo and to negombo further up the 
coast many jammed the airport trying to catch flights off the 
island 
military officials said a crude bomb was thrown at a staterun 
bus in a colombo suburb wednesday injuring two people 
the government has blamed the peoples liberation front for the 
deaths at of least 550 people in the last 15 months but no 
foreigners are known to have been among the victims 
the front has vowed to kill anyone who supports the jayewardene 
governments peace efforts with guerrillas from the tamil ethnic 
minority 
jayewardene and most top government and military officials are 
sinhalese the ethnic group comprising 75 percent of sri lankas 16 
million people 
the presidents offers of some autonomy for separatist tamils 
spurred a backlash in his own sinhalese community after the 
announcement of a july 29 1987 peace accord designed to end a 
tamil campaign of terrorism 
more than 8500 people have died since militant tamils began 
attacking government troops and massacring sinhalese civilians in 
1983 
tamils make up 18 percent of the population the militant groups 
seek a separate homeland in northern and eastern sri lanka to 
counter what they say is discrimination by the sinhalese

secretary of state george p shultz on 
wednesday hailed the selection of james a baker iii as a welcome 
and heartening event 
shultz in a brief news conference said presidentelect george 
bush had telephoned him before announcing the selection he will 
hit the ground running shultz said of baker a cabinet colleague 
and partner at international economic summit meetings 
his close warm and productive relationship with 
presidentelect bush makes him just the guy to serve as the 
presidents chief foreign policy adviser and as chief spokesman for 
the president and for our nations interests in the new and bright 
era we have entered shultz said 
shultz and baker both are considered moderate to conservative in 
their political views and are internationally minded together they 
tried without much success to reduce the us trade deficit and 
strengthen the dollar in world money markets 
relations with moscow under energetic soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev is likely to be the primary foreign policy issue facing 
the new administration 
jim baker is an old friend and a man i have long admired and 
worked with closely and intensively shultz said 
presidentelect bushs announcement that he will nominate jim 
baker to be the 61st secretary of state is a welcome and heartening 
event 
shultz said however without being specific that there may be 
differences as well as continuity in us foreign policy in the bush 
administration 
of course the president is the man who sets the foreign 
policy shultz said i think it is important that the secretary 
of state be close to the president and were fortunate to have this 
team of president bush and secretary baker as two people who have 
had over a long period of time the closest kind of working 
relationship 
shultz added i think that augurs well for our foreign policy 
with a little more than two months left on the job shultz 
apparently plans no major foreign policy initiatives but he has a 
busy schedule nonetheless 
on monday he will fly to el salvador for a meeting of the 
organization of american states where he is expected to reiterate 
his concerns about continued sandinista rule in nicaragua 
shultz also will meet during the week with andrei d sakharov 
the soviet physicist who has championed the cause of dissidents 
west german chancellor helmut kohl and british prime minister 
margaret thatcher 
next month shultz plans to attend a meeting of the foreign 
ministers of the north atlantic treaty organization in brussels in 
january he will attend a meeting on chemical weapons in paris 
there are a lot of foreign policy issues that simply continue 
to move along said state department spokesman charles e redman

liberal for montana and not an effective senator he also labeled 
melcher a supporter of higher taxes and promised to vote against any 
tax increasing saying the federal deficit can be balanced by 
restraining spending 
i always like to win but i enter all these things realizing

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev congratulated 
presidentelect george bush on wednesday and said he hopes the new 
administration will continue developing ussoviet relations 
the soviet union is ready to continue and deepen mutually 
beneficial sovietamerican cooperation on many issues the kremlin 
leader said in a brief congratulatory message to bush carried by 
tass the soviet news agency 
i express the wish that your work on that high post will serve 
to further development of stable and predictable relations between 
the soviet union and the us and to the improvement of the entire 
international situation gorbachev said 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said an early summit 
is likely 
such summits have become normal phenomena in our relations 
perfiliev told a regular news briefing when asked about a meeting 
between bush and gorbachev 
i can be absolutely confident that such summits would follow 
but i cant provide concrete information as to the next summit he 
said 
we note with satisfaction that the american electorate express 
their view with regard to the continuation of arms control 
negotiations and for expanding cooperation between the usa and 
the soviets in all possible areas perfiliev said 
the soviets had not expressed a strong preference in the 
election but foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said 
last week the soviets would like a prompt summit with the winner 
tass correspondents reported from washington that bushs election 
victory over massachusetts gov michael dukakis showed americans 
were satisfied with reagans economic policies and pleased with his 
progress on arms control 
they noted that bush committed himself to the policy of the 
current incumbent of the white house ronald reagan 
the majority of american voters are satisfied with the 
presidency of reagan who managed to cut unemployment in the country 
to the lowest level of the past 14 years and to curb inflation by 
bringing its level to 4 percent a year tass said 
under reagan the first sovietus treaty on the elimination of 
two classes of nuclear weapons was concluded and way was open to 
agreement on halving the strategic arsenals of the ussr and 
usa tass said 
tass referred to the treaty signed in washington in december by 
reagan and gorbachev under which the superpowers agreed to eliminate 
their medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles 
negotiations toward a 50 percent cut in strategic weapons are 
continuing but slowed considerably as the reagan administration 
comes to a close 
tass said bush also had campaigned on a platform calling for 
negotiations with the soviet union from a position of strength 
through strengthening nato and upgrading nuclear forces 
soviets who passed by the us embassy stopped and looked at a 
pictoral display about bush including a biography with the headline 
new president 
the afternoon daily newspaper izvestia frontpaged a story about 
bushs victory headlined george bush president of the usa 
along with his biography and a portrait showing the presidentelect 
smiling and waving 
radio moscow said that observers noted the election of bush was 
decided first and foremost by the improvement in the national 
economy which took place lately under the present administration a 
reduction of inflation and the number of jobless 
radio moscow said the republicans successfully portrayed dukakis 
as a liberal who was weak on foreign policy

dan quayle was born into a life of privilege 
that took him from the golf course and fraternity row to the marble 
halls of congress with wondrous ease 
at 41 the next vice president is an ardent conservative who is 
praised by some for his quickness and derided by others as a 
lightweight whose best assets are his blond good looks and capacity 
to charm 
his upbringing as the scion of a midwestern publishing dynasty 
was a comfortable existence one in which quayle acknowledged i 
never had to worry about where i was going to go 
james danforth quayle was born in indianapolis oldest son of 
james and corinne quayle his maternal grandfather eugene c 
pulliam was a selfmade millionaire with newspapers in indiana and 
elsewhere 
as a teenager in the small town of huntington ind quayle 
attended republican rallies and played golf which his father called 
his first love and his passion 
in golf what it gets down to is youre competing with 
yourself his mother said he could be so hard on himself 
sometimes 
quayle chose not to apply that competitiveness in the academic 
arena 
at depauw university a small private school heavily endowed by 
the family quayle was only a c student affable andsays the size of his 
wealth also is exaggerated while the 
pulliam family trust is reported to approach 1 billion quayle 
receives no income from the trusts assets until after the deaths of 
his stepgrandmother and his mother the assets cannot be dissolved 
until 21 years after the death of his oldest son tucker now 14 
quayles meteoric rise in politics came after a desultory brush 
with the law practice he and mrs quayle set up above his fathers 
newspaper the huntington heraldpress where quayle was also 
associate publisher 
he defeated an eightterm congressman in 1976 and in 1980 ousted 
democratic sen birch bayh with a little help from ronald reagans 
long coattails quayle easily won reelection in 1986 
orvas beers the gop official who talked quayle into running for 
the house calls him a real charmer 
i thought hed get a lot of the womens vote because of his 
friendliness his personality and his good looks beers says 
charm aside many republicans were stunned when george bush 
plucked quayle from relative obscurity over more senior lawmakers 
on the campaign trail signs taunted but can he type and 
this quayle wont fly 
in congress quayle was never viewed as a heavyhitter but he 
touts his legislative accomplishments cosponsoring a jobs training 
act with sen edward kennedy dmass and his work on arms control 
measures like the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty 
he also supported contra aid voted to sustain president reagans 
veto of a civil rights bill supported the death penalty for drug 
kingpins and voted for the supreme court nomination of robert h 
bork he opposes abortion 
bushs choice was widely seen as a move to appease conservatives 
and bring him a malleable vice president without his own political 
agenda 
during the campaign quayle demonstrated that he was eager to 
please from his exhortation to bush at the gop convention to go 
get em to his travels to sometimes obscure rallies selected by 
bush strategists 
although occasionally frustrated by the controls imposed by the 
bush camp quayle followed his script and played the role of dutiful 
no 2 
a scandal that brushed quayle early in his political career 
resurfaced during the campaign when a former washington lobbyist 
paula parkinson claimed he had propositioned her on a 1980 florida 
golf outing with several lawmakers 
quayle angrily denied the accusation and said he had gone there 
only to play golf 
most people who know quayle say he is a straight arrow who is 
devoted to his wife and family marilyn quayle had the last word 
during the parkinson episode with a line she has repeated over the 
years anybody who knows dan quayle knows he would rather play 
golf than have sex any day

ronald reagan still the president of the 
united states promises a smooth transition from office as he moves 
to a lame duck role in the shadow of his successor george bush 
reagans term doesnt end until jan 20 but the publics focus 
shifted to the next occupant of the white house on wednesday at a 
presidentiallike news conference in houston there bush quickly 
followed up his convincing tuesday night election victory by 
announcing his intended secretary of state and the leaders of his 
transition team 
reagans top aides understandably were reluctant to call down 
the curtain on the reagan era and insisted their man was no lame 
duck that up until the moment bush is sworn in the world will know 
the great communicator is still in charge 
hes not going to drift off or ride off into the sunset 
reagans chief of staff kenneth duberstein insisted hes going 
to be active until the very end 
reagans national security adviser lt gen colin powell added 
this administration has a while to go before it becomes 
history in the next several months until january 20 there is quite 
a bit on our plate there is quite a bit the president has charged 
us to do he told members of the american stock exchange this week 
to bolster that argument reagans top aides have worked 
feverishly to fill his dance card in the waning days of his 
presidency with a round of speeches visits by foreign dignitaries 
work on arms control and preparations for the next 
commanderinchief 
and part and parcel to any reagan agenda a couple of nice 
california vacations over thanksgiving and new years have been 
penciled in with a groundbreaking ceremony planned in the golden 
state for the reagan presidential library 
duberstein said he and his assistants had studied presidential 
transitions over the past 20 years to prepare for the switch of 
power 
and whether it was republican or democrat he said 
something they all stressed was that only the president can make 
the decisions between now and january 20th 
given george bushs longtime deference and loyalty to the man who 
campaigned so hard on his behalf and reagans support for bush 
white house aides predict the transition should go well 
thats the easy part white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said 
the president and bush are good personal friends they 
genuinely like each other it should be a very smooth transition 
on tuesday night bush was quick to thank reagan for his help in 
the campaign and it was bush who made the pilgrimage to the white 
house to receive reagans congratulations wednesday not a reagan 
visit to the gop headquarters to offer a blessing as some had 
suggested might occur 
i note the obvious president reagan is still the president of 
the united states bush told the news conference wednesday 
fitzwater said the two mens schedules wont change much in terms 
of dealing with each other because they talk constantly on the 
phone and will continue their weekly lunches over mexican fare 
in one area fitzwater said reagan has a particular interest 
the ongoing arms control negotiations for a ussoviet pact on 
strategic weapons 
there are still problems to address until the talks go into 
recess fitzwater said he wants to give his successor a fast 
start and position the us as effectively as possible for when 
the talks begin anew in the new administration 
on the domestic side reagan must consider the plethora of bills 
pushed through the remaining days of the last congress and even if 
reagan has ruffled a few feathers with some vetoes such as a bill 
on limiting advertising on childrens television so be it 
fitzwater said 
thats good it lets congress know that hes still in charge 
the spokesman said 
duberstein said that even though congress has ignored reagans 
past budgets he intends to oversee the shipment of a final spending 
outline to capitol hill on jan 9 
the president does not intend to address congress personally in 
another state of the union speech the chief of staff said but he 
does plan to begin a series of speeches on such issues as 
international trade reagan wants to share some of the lessons 
hes learned duberstein said 
even though he has three months to go reagan might hold at 
least one more news conference and can be expected to address the 
nation on national television he added 
reagan has scheduled meetings next week with soviet dissident

the english village of messing said by 
genealogists to be george bushs ancestral home celebrated his 
presidential triumph wednesday with a toast at the local pub and a 
cake inscribed well done george 
the 19 children at messings primary school drew pictures and 
congratulatory cards while the grownups gathered in the old crown 
pub to drink a toast and to cut a cake adorned with elephants 
it has been so exciting we have been keeping our fingers 
crossed but we all knew hed do it said publican diana harris 
her husband david has written to the brewery chain that owns 
the pub asking permission to change its name to the george bush 
messing a village of 200 people is 45 miles east of london and 
two genealogists say bushs ancestor sailed from there to the new 
world in about 1630 
in june when bushs connection to messing was first reported 
the children wrote to him said their teacher gloria waymont 
she said bush wrote back although i really dont know a lot 
about my english forefathers from messing they obviously chose a 
lovely area to call home perhaps i will be able to see it someday 
the teacher said she asked the children to spare a thought for 
defeated democratic rival michael dukakis too we said prayers 
for him and i explained all about winning and losing a 
competition she said 
some villagers hoped the bush connection would attract visitors 
to messing in the same way president reagan put ballyporeen his 
ancestral irish village on the map when he visited there in 1984 
i know theres a lot of interest and we are anticipating quite 
a few visitors particularly from america said messings vicar 
rev martin clarke 
roger carter chairman of the messing parish council said he has 
invited bush to visit he told the today newspaper if george bush 
does come to visit it will be the first time anyone important has 
come here in years 
genealogists said bush comes from a long line of welloff and 
powerful relatives and is related to european royalty 
his family has for hundreds of years been at the top of the 
totem pole socially and economically although not at the 
pinnacle harold brooksbaker publishing director of the 
blueblood directory burkes peerage said in an interview if you 
like theyre the second string of the top 
he said his research shows that every presidential contender with 
royal connections has reached the white house and that bush a 
distant cousin to queen elizabeth ii has more such connections than 
any other 
even though this is a bit of scholarly nonsense which people in 
the street are amused at its true and interesting he said 
genealogist hugh peskett said the new presidents family tree is 
not a wimps pedigree by any means 
peskett said he recently sent bush research tracing the lineage 
to capt timothy bush an american revolutionary who fought first 
the indians and then the british under george washington 
he was largerthanlife a total nonwimp said peskett 
he added that fighting the british puts the family in the 
united states aristocracy in the us having an ancestor in the 
revolutionary party is about as high as you can get 
brooksbaker an american who has also sent his work to the new 
president says bush is directly descended from king henry vii from 
one of charles iis mistresses and from henry viiis younger sister 
mary who married king louis xii of france 
charles mistress barbara villiers who lived from 1641 to 1706 
was sixth cousin of bushs greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreat 
grandmother elizabeth wellington fay according to brooksbaker 
he said bush is related to all 60 royal families on the european 
continent and is the 13th cousin twice removed of the present 
british queen 
brooksbaker differs with peskett however on which bush 
ancestor was first to emigrate to america burkes peerage names him 
as a dr richard palgrave who left england in 1630 peskett opts for 
reynold bush son of a messing farmer

presidentelect george bush is headed for 
likely conflict with a strengthened democratic majority in congress 
but republicans say he can still enjoy a honeymoon if he gives 
assertive and moderate direction on the budget deficit housing and 
the environment 
democrats go into the 101st congress with slightly greater 
majorities in both houses in the senate the current 5446 
advantage appeared likely to be padded by one or two seats 
depending largely on the outcome of a cliffhanger race in florida 
and house democrats appeared headed for a net gain of five seats 
sen rudy boschwitz rminn chairman of the national republican 
senatorial committee said he was not overjoyed at the results 
and acknowledged the question is whether there will be a 
honeymoon certainly there will be considerable conflict between 
their agenda and our agenda 
im not sure what the mandate is he said adding that by 
retaining a republican white house and a democratic congress voters 
are saying theyre relatively satisfied with the conditions that 
they find 
and he agreed with senate minority leader bob dole rkan that 
this race was not about coattails gop candidates who linked 
themselves strongly to bush lost more than they won 
but he said major problems need to be addressed in the areas of 
the budget deficit the environment and lowincome housing while 
the new president may not get off at a gallop when he takes office 
in january if he takes charge of those outstanding issues 
quickly i think hell start off as president with a canter 
boschwitz said he believed bush would begin with a very 
aggressive team headed by top adviser james a baker iii the 
secretary of statedesignate hopefully that will be reflected in 
the legislative agenda he said and there will be a good chance 
for success 
bush agreed saying at a news conference the question is 
weve got to get some good support from the democrats for some of 
these ideas 
if there is one of the messages of the campaign it is that 
liberalism at least as some people define it is not as much in 
vogue as it was boschwitz said noting that democrats in 
nebraska ohio new jersey ran away from dukakis 
tuesdays results marked the first time since the 1960 election 
of democrat john f kennedy that the party which lost the white 
house gained seats in both houses of congress 
democrats unseated gop incumbents lowell weicker in connecticut 
chic hecht in nevada and david karnes in nebraska and picked up a 
previously republican seat in virginia republicans offset that by 
knocking off incumbent john melcher in montana and converting 
mississippis democratic seat to their column floridas race 
between democratic rep buddy mackay and gop rep connie mack 
remained too close to call and largely dependent on the outcome of 
100000 absentee ballots 
democrats agreed that the elections outcome was a mandate for 
the status quo but disagreed with republicans about what that 
meant they contended the voters called for a continuation of the 
past two years when the democratic congress has dictated much of 
public policy to a lameduck gop administration 
continuity over the last two years has meant congress setting 
the agenda on the budget trade clean water plant closing welfare 
reform and catastrophic health care said anita dunn spokeswoman 
for the democratic senatorial campaign committee democrats will 
seek to continue those kinds of priorities she said 
one early sign of potential friction came not from the democrats 
but from dole who will be in charge of shepherding bushs 
legislative agenda through the new congress as returns rolled in 
tuesday night dole criticized bush for turning aside requests to 
help mack in florida and he said when hecht pleaded for help in 
nevada bush flew over it 
boschwitz disagreed saying bush did most of the things we 
wanted not all the help but its not the nature of things that 
you get everything that you want 
dole also has made public comments doubting whether bush can 
honor his read my lips vow not to increase any taxes and has 
hinted that the bush campaigns idea to control the deficit through 
a flexible freeze lacks substance 
bush dismissed suggestions that trouble was brewing saying he 
would meet with dole he is an effective republican leader and i 
will work with him i think that we can work harmoniously 
together he said 
an unanswered question stemming from tuesdays voting was what 
will happen in indiana where republican sen dan quayle will leave 
his congressional seat to take over the vice presidency a successor 
will have to be appointed by the governor and it was assumed that 
quayle would resign from the senate early to allow that choice to be 
made by republican gov robert orr whose term expires in january 
boschwitz said he would be counseling orr to select somebody who 
can hold the seat when it comes before the voters in a special 
election in 1990 names that have been mentioned include gop rep 
daniel coats lt gov john mutz who lost in his bid to become 
governor on tuesday and steve goldsmith the indianapolis 
prosecutor who ran as mutzs lieutenant governor nominee also 
mentioned has been quayles wife marilyn but boschwitz called that 
suggestion not realistic

the ties between james a baker iii and george 
bush go back nearly two decades when baker left his law practice in 
houston to help bush a tennis partner campaign unsuccessfully for 
the senate 
their political careers have been intertwined every since and 
over the years the two men developed a close friendship 
among the mementos cherished by baker who was announced 
wednesday as bushs choice for secretary of state is a bush photo 
signed by the presidentelect with the note what would we do 
without real friends 
bakers selection came as no surprise it had been widely 
reported that baker wanted the job and just as clear that he could 
have virtually any post that interested him in a new bush 
administration 
secretary of state george shultz predicted that his successor 
will hit the ground running and told reporters that bakers 
close warm and productive relationship with bush makes him 
just the guy to be the presidents chief foreign policy adviser 
and spokesman 
bush said in houston that baker has distinguished himself in 
every position he has held in the reagan administration 
the 58yearold baker served as white house chief of staff during 
the first reagan term and took over as treasury secretary in l985 
he resigned from the cabinet last august to be bushs presidential 
campaign chairman 
it was 18 years ago that baker took on a similar job for bush 
who was challenging democrat lloyd bentsen for a senate seat baker 
then a democrat was convinced by bush to turn republican and their 
long relationship began 
bush was soundly defeated by bentsen in 1970 ten years later 
baker again headed a bush campaign this time an unsuccessful effort 
against ronald reagan for the republican presidential nomination 
despite bushs help baker fared no better in his only try at 
elected office a l978 defeat in a race for texas attorney general 
nevertheless baker over the years developed a reputation as one 
of the republican partys craftiest political strategists 
in l976 he was credited for turning gerald fords presidential 
campaign around after five straight primary defeats baker helped 
garnering enough delegates to allow ford to narrowly win the gop 
nomination over ronald reagan as fords campaign manager baker saw 
a 30point lag in the polls cut to within one percentage point of 
democrat jimmy carter 
when named as bushs campaign manager last august one of bakers 
greatest assets was said to be his close relationship with the 
candidate the same relationship is expected to make him one of the 
most powerful and influential members of the cabinet with easy 
access to the oval office 
in his autobiography looking forward bush provides a hint 
of the depth of that relationship one in which baker is able to 
talk to bush with frankness 
describing the last days of his unsuccessful l980 campaign 
against reagan bush wrote that it was baker who one day brought 
home the reality of the situation saying the campaign is 
finished george youre the only one who doesnt know it 
bush later became reagans running mate and baker signed on as a 
special campaign assistant when reagan was elected he quickly 
named baker as his chief of staff 
baker is most frequently described as a moderate republican and 
like bush himself a pragmatist while often the target of 
criticism from the gops ultraconservatives he demonstrated an 
ability to get along with congressional democrats he has been 
credited with guiding reagans l981 tax cut proposal as well as the 
administrations l986 taxoverhaul bill through congress 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee has described him as an honest adversary with 
a first class political gut 
in l985 baker then white house chief of staff made clear he 
wanted a new challenge prompting a celebrated job swap with 
thentreasury secretary donald regan 
at treasury baker amassed an unusual amount of influence while 
described as a man who occasionally made mistakes he also was 
characterized as a quick learner who rapidly grew into the job 
he won plaudits internationally for persuading us allies to 
coordinate their economic policies and for negotiating a us 
canadian freetrade pact he was the architect of a plan which has 
yet to bear fruit to help ease the third world debt crisis through 
billions of dollars in loans from commercial banks 
on another international matter baker is said to favor 
development of a bipartisan consensus on central america policy 
while supporting aid to nicaraguas contra rebels he is said to 
lack some of the procontra passion evident among many of the other 
officials of the outgoing administration 
baker and bush who is six years his senior came from similar 
backgrounds 
both grew up in wealthy families went to prep schools in the 
east and then to ivy league colleges they share a love for sports 
and mexican foods 
along with the autographed picture of bush another baker memento 
is a newspaper clipping from the l930s that quotes his millionaire 
grandfathers formula for success 
work hard study and keep out of politics his grandfather 
was fond of saying baker embraced two out of three but the third 
one eluded him george bush was the reason why

rescuers are being forced to trek on foot through 
heavily wooded mountain regions to reach some villages devastated by 
an earthquake that killed more than 930 people in southern china 
beijing radio said wednesday 
the obstacles to rescue are much worse than experts at first 
believed it said it said the village of zhanmapo believed the 
worst hit with 297 dead was accessible only by a footpath and that 
this had been blocked by a landslide 
the victims can only be helped by air or on foot the radio 
said four planes are airdropping food clothing and other 
necessities to the hardest hit areas 
the quake that struck southwestern yunnan province sunday night 
was chinas worst since a 1976 earthquake that killed 242000 
people the yunnan quake measured 76 on the richter scale 
signifying a powerful quake capable of heavy damage and by 
wednesday morning had been followed by 184 aftershocks 
beijing radio said seismologists had met the day before the quake 
and decided to issue a warning of a coming tremor but they did not 
expect it to hit so soon or so strongly it was not immediately 
clear if they had issued any warning 
the ministry of civil affairs told un relief agencies that more 
than 100000 people were homeless and the official china news 
service said 1986 were injured most of them seriously the 
ministry did not change its count from tuesday of 938 dead 
the quake affected 14 counties with a total population of more 
than 1 million people scattered over 16000 square miles along the 
border with burma 
trevor page the un world food programs beijing 
representative quoted the ministry of civil affairs as saying 
relief workers still have not been able to reach many villages most 
of the casualties counted so far have been in just one county 
lancang 
the ministry also said it would welcome donations of food 
medical supplies and plastic sheeting for temporary shelters page 
said 
he said the chinese specified they were not appealing for help 
but would welcome any appropriate assistance by friendly countries 
or international organizations 
the ruling communist party and the state council chinas 
cabinet issued a statement expressing sympathy for quake victims 
and urging them to rebuild their homes and restore production soon 
in a spirit of selfreliance 
lancang is home to the lahu minority one of several farming 
ethnic minorities that live in the border region 
china is one of the most earthquake prone countries in the world 
its last major quake was in august 1985 when 71 people were killed 
and 125 injured by a temblor in far western xinjiang uygur 
autonomous region that quake registered 74 on the richter scale 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake 
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph a quake 
measuring 70 can cause heavy widespread damage in a populated area

for an electorate said to be disappointed in 
the candidates and disgusted with the process american voters 
delivered a ringing endorsement tuesday for the status quo 
enforcing a fresh balance of power on the nations two political 
parties 
nov 8 1988 it wasnt so much election day as reelection day 
nearly everyone in sight white house republicans and capitol 
hill democrats alike was routinely returned to office 
by electing george bush while strengtrats hand 
in congress voters hening the democeffectively put an end to the reagan 
revolution 
a bush era of pragmatic bipartisan governance will likely begin 
presidentelect bush clearly recognized the profound impact of 
tuesdays ticketsplitting asked whether he can work effectively 
with his acerbic fellow republican sen bob dole bush on wednesday 
expressed only casual deference to his partys senate leader and 
then emphasized weve got to get some good support from the 
democrats for some of these ideas 
look this campaign is over bush said when asked about 
working with lloyd bentsen the defeated democratic running mate who 
retains his chairmanship of the senate finance committee theres 
no hard feelings 
the democrats had n advantages of incumbency there is no 
mistaking voter comfort with this powersharing arrangement white 
house leadership from the republicans balanced by pursestring 
priorities set by congressional democrats for the first time in 28 
years the party losing the presidency actually increased its 
standing in congress 
during president reagans first term with a landslide a 
supplyside mandate and a republican senate the white house called 
the tune on capitol hill but in the second term winner of 49 
states but running behind no specific legislative program reagan 
was forced to compromise the budget was written by congressional 
collaboration and practically dumped on the white house door step 
bush said wednesday hed appoint a lean transition staff to 
set priorities and to fashion a strategy for legislative success he 
indicated that hell do a lot of jawboning to pass his programs 
and hes likely to take advantage of the fact that congress would 
welcome a flexible president with open arms 
i think therell be a honeymoon said senate judiciary 
chairman joseph biden most of us have known george bush for a 
long time even so he acknowledged that there will be a little 
fencemending needed after the nasty campaign 
bush reveled in the margin of his victory wednesday but he 
seemed to realize that the voters provided no mandate for change to 
him or anyone else half those eligible to vote didnt bother and 
those who did vote spoke in one voice which appeared to say dont 
make waves 
status quo i the presidency was returned to the republicans for 
the fifth time in the last six elections 
status quo ii the house of representatives was reelected en 
masse 99 percent of the members were returned to office many 
without opposition and all but a few without serious struggle it 
almost seemed that the only way for an incumbent to lose an election 
was to be brought up on charges 
status quo iii the house was securely in democratic hands for 
the 35th straight year 
status quo iv the senate stood still as well democrats 
increased their majority from eight to nine a few incumbents were 
forcibly removed from office but voters delivered no significant 
message to compete with the 1980 reagan rebellion which sent 12 
democrats to the sidelines 
aside from michael dukakis the voters most prominent victim 
was lowell weicker of connecticut a maverick lawmaker whose 
disappearance from the senate will do much to enhance party 
discipline in the chamber 
status quo v voters were so intent on making no waves that 
marylanders withstood a 4 million barrage from the national rifle 
association and declined to repeal an incumbent gun control law 
several house incumbents did not fare so well fernand st 
germain a power in the house for many years and chairman of the 
house banking committee barely survived a justice department 
investigation which cited evidence of serious and sustained 
misconduct for allegedly accepting favors from lobbyists he 
succumbed at the polls as did freshman pat swindall 
swindall rga was turned out of office following his 
indictment on perjury charges in a drug laundering case 
a few incumbents were actually turned out without a hint of 
scandal sens john melcher chic hecht david karnes and weicker 
along with rep mac sweeney rtexas were left to wonder why the 
voters singled them out as rare exceptions to the 1988 status quo

emperor hirohitos vital signs improved wednesday 
easing his worst crisis since he became seriously ill seven weeks 
ago palace officials said 
the worlds longest reigning monarch told imperial household 
grand steward shoichi fujimori that he was feeling better but 
fujimori later described hirohito as tired the officials said 
on tuesday the 87yearold emperors blood pressure plummeted 
and remained dangerously low for more than seven hours despite an 
emergency blood transfusion at the same time his temperature and 
pulse rate soared 
palace officials welcomed wednesdays improvement but said they 
viewed it as only temporary 
palace spokesman kenji maeda said hirohito did not discharge any 
more blood from his bowels wednesday and was not given any 
transfusions but he said doctors believed the emperor is continuing 
to bleed in the area of his upper intestine 
hirohito has received 4156 pints of blood more than four times 
the normal amount in his body since his condition deteriorated on 
sept 19 
his blood pressure which sank to 68 over 30 on tuesday was 108 
over 50 wednesday afternoon maeda said a normal reading is about

low blood pressure which reduces the flow of blood to the brain and 
other key organs 
we would like to endeavor to maintain the emperors current 
condition maeda quoted chief palace doctor akira takagi as saying 
but doctors say they fear the emperors internal bleeding may 
have spread to a larger area of his upper intestine where 
physicians performed a bypass operation in september 1987

backers of a 25cent increase in californias cigarette tax 
fought off a multimilliondollar campaign by the tobacco industry 
which helped snuff out an oregon measure that would have imposed the 
nations toughest antismoking law 
californias proposition 99 approved by nearly 58 percent 
tuesday will raise about 600 million a year for antismoking 
programs in the schools wildlife protection cancer research and 
health care for the uninsured 
the tax on a pack of cigarettes will go from 10 cents to 35 cents 
on jan 1 it is the states first tobacco tax hike in 22 years 
people want smokers to pay their own way and keep kids from 
getting hooked thats what 99 does in a big way said jack 
nicholl director of californias pro proposition 99 campaign 
jeff raimundo spokesman for the tobacco industrybacked 
californians against unfair tax increases said he believes voters 
approved the tax hike because of the legislatures failure to deal 
with the health care crisis 
i think because this years ballot is one of the longest and 
most complicated in the states history a lot of voters couldnt 
get past the clutter out there and mistook proposition 99 for a 
health initiative he said 
in oregon voters rejected the antismoking measure by a 6139 
percent margin the ordinance would have banned smoking in most 
public places and imposed fines up to 250 for violators 
proponents blamed their loss on heavy advertising financed by 
more than 2 million in contributions largely from tobacco 
companies 
frankly a contract was let on oregon and a hit was made 
said bob neely chairman of cleaner indoor air for oregonians the 
tobacco industry bought an election 
mark nelson who headed the opposition called that hogwash 
we had a difficult job of educating the public on what this 
measure did nelson said that took money

the moslem half of lebanons dual 
government named a new army commander wednesday even though the 
christian prime minister holds the post 
the appointment of maj gen sami khatib as acting commander of 
the army made by by adel osseiran defense minister in the moslem 
cabinet could divide lebanons army along religious lines 
osserin a shiite moslem stopped short of firing gen michel 
aoun as army commander but the appointment of khatib widened the 
split between christian and moslem units of the nations fractured 
42000man army 
the lebanese front an alliance of rightwing christians that 
recognizes aoun as prime minister and army commander rejected 
osseirans decision calling it illegitimate because it comes from 
an illegitimate authority 
grand mufti sheik hassan khaled spiritual leader of lebanons 
sunni moslems said we now have a state of complete partition 
alas we cannot even try to stop it 
lebanon has had no president since sept 23 when amin gemayels 
sixyear term expired and parliament failed to elect a successor 
that caused the countrys gravest constitutional crisis since 
independence from france in 1943 
aoun a maronite catholic was named prime minister of a 
caretaker military cabinet by gemayel minutes before he stepped 
down gemayel decreed that aoun would also remain army commander 
but syrianbacked moslem and leftist factions rejected aouns 
cabinet charging it violated an unwritten 1943 national covenant 
under which the premiership is held by the sunnis the presidency by 
the maronites and the parliament speakership by the shiites 
the syrianbacked moslem and leftist factions pledged allegiance 
to the government of acting prime minister salim hoss which was 
installed during gemayels term osseiran is a member of hoss 
cabinet 
in announcing khatibs appointment osseiran told reporters in 
moslem west beirut that the post of army commander is considered 
vacant because the original commander gen michel aoun has taken 
up other duties 
asked if the army now has two rival commanders osseiran said 
khatib has been appointed in an acting capacity gen aoun is the 
original commander he has the right to return to his post once his 
other duties are over 
the constitutional crisis deepened oct 18 when parliament failed 
to elect a new speaker to succeed hussein husseini a prosyrian 
shiite 
aoun who considers hoss cabinet and its decisions illegitimate 
made no immediate comment on osseirans decision 
khatib 55 a retired sunni officer accepted the post saying 
i shall excercise this job in a way that will serve the unity of 
the army and the country 
in reality however khatib will have authority over five 
predominantly moslem army brigades based in moslemcontrolled areas 
with only nominal control of some units affiliated to moslem 
militias 
five other brigades in the christian heartland north and 
northeast of beirut remain under aouns control they are better 
trained and have most of the armys 200 usmade m48 tanks and 
heavy artillery 
khatib served as figurehead commander of the allsyrian arab 
deterrant force which intervened in lebanon in 1976 with an arab 
lague mandate to quell the civil war

president reagan on wednesday vetoed 
legislation calling for a study of the nutritional quality of the 
food americans eat saying it would create an unnecessary and 
complex federal bureaucracy 
he said the bill would have established a comprehensive plan 
for the assessment of the nutritional and dietary status of the 
united states population and the nutritional quality of food 
consumed in the united states 
the administration strongly supports the principal goals of 
this legislation and reaffirms its commitment to use existing 
authority to achieve these ends reagan said in a statement 
however enactment of the bill would set up federal nutrition 
efforts on the wrong course 
the bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary and 
complex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of the 
bills goals he said 
the bill gave shared responsibility for the program to 
departments of agriculture and health and human services and would 
also have created an administrator of nutrition monitoring an 
interagency board and an advisory council 
the creation of so much new federal bureaucracy would hinder 
rather than aid performance of federal nutritionrelated 
functions reagan said 
the bill would also impose a substantial new burden on the 
american taxpayer in future years to pay for federal government 
grants by requiring that a grant program be established as a 
result of the study he said 
experience shows that once the federal government begins 
handing out money under a new grant program a political 
constituency develops that demands greater funding for that 
program the president said greater security should be given to 
the need for the proposed new grant programs before they are locked 
in as a future expansion of the federal budget

senate republican leader bob dole said 
wednesday he wants to help presidentelect george bush avoid new 
taxes and suggested changes in the deductibility of interest 
payments for loans used in corporate buyouts as a possible revenue 
source 
the kansas senator speaking to an american stock exchange 
conference for international investors said he doesnt think either 
democrats or republicans in congress are going to be looking for tax 
increases 
but he said corporate buyouts do not contribute to the economy 
and referred to tax deductions on buyout loans as loopholes in the 
tax code 
dole denied what he said are media assertions that he would make 
it difficult for bush to keep his notax pledge the pledge is 
fine with me dole said my suggestion is that hell have to 
work that out with the democrats 
he said bushs plan for a flexible freeze on expenditures 
makes some sense 
dole also praised bushs designation of his campaign chairman 
former treasury secretary james baker as secretary of state saying 
the appointment would be well received by the congress and well 
received by the people of the united states 
referring to concern over bushs selection of dan quayle who is 
to be the next vice president dole said i think today he 
indicated hes going to continue picking top people dole said of 
baker his reputation is solid 
dole said he probably would have agreed to be bushs running mate 
had he been asked 
responding to concerns abroad that quayle could become president 
dole said if some tragedy should happen i believe dan quayle 
could do it he said quayle would need a lot of help but so would 
anyone in that circumstance

democrats once again on the wrong end of a 
presidential election landslide took scant comfort wednesday from 
election victories everywhere but at the top of the ticket and were 
blaming michael dukakis for losing a race they once thought was 
theirs to win 
the dukakis campaign ran the worst campaign of this century 
said robert slagle chairman of the texas democratic party 
clearly the democratic party is alive and well said kathy 
vick of louisiana a former chairman of the association of state 
democratic party chairs were in this position where we can elect 
everybody but a president 
when asked if she thought dukakis would get a lot of criticism 
from party officials she replied yep 
we left atlanta site of the democratic national convention 
thinking we could win she said nobody thought it was going to 
be a leadpipe cinch it ended up not being close 
while many democrats were looking back on the 1988 campaign and 
expressing frustration and anger others were already looking ahead 
to 1992 
the morning television talk shows were a parade of potential 
democratic presidential candidates 
our next political season really does begin today said jesse 
jackson on the cbs show this morning 
there are bigcity elections in 1989 the census in 1990 
reapportionment in 1991 said jackson reeling off a list of what 
he considered important challenges facing the democrats even before 
attention is turned to the next presidential contest 
jackson who finished second to dukakis in the race for the 
presidential nomination and is considered a good bet to make another 
run in 1992 declined to discuss that prospect 
its much too early to talk about 1992 politics he said 
appearing on the same program gov bill clinton another 
potential 1992 contender said theres still a very vigorous 
national democratic party out there 
but the arkansas governor warned against the l word that 
plagued dukakis in his campaign against republican george bush 
he said democrats have to articulate a philosphy that is not 
perceived as too liberal the american people are deeply 
conservative in general and very progressive in particular what 
we have to do is make sure the american people know where the 
democratic party stands 
on the nbc today show georgia sen sam nunn said the party 
ought to shorten the overall primary season i think weve got to 
figure out a way to spend less money in the races and i think weve 
got to change the procedures substantially so that the primaries 
have a profile of voters much more like the general election 
in an interview on abc election night nunn said that bush was 
able to define mike dukakis as a liberal he was able to define 
what a liberal was until the last couple of weeks when dukakis 
really started defining his own philosophy 
its almost become a belief among people that were weak on 
defense said james ruvolo chairman of the ohio democratic party 
we have to change that 
this race was winnable he went on and we didnt win it 
but thats more a fault of the campaign that we ran mike 
dukakis will get a lot of blame deserved or not deserved but he 
will get it 
gun control just really killed us in rural texas said 
slagle it hurt us badly and he never adequately answered that 
and there was nothing wrong with his position but they didnt 
sell it at our insistence they finally ran one ad on that for all 
of a week and then they pulled it down and never would run it 
again 
they just ran a lousy campaign he said there were 101 
banks failed in texas did you ever see a single ad in texas talking 
about the instability of the financial situation from the dukakis 
campaign no there wasnt one

soldiers patrolled the northwestern town of 
sokoto on wednesday and the town was under a dawntodusk curfew 
after riots sparked by the selection of a new moslem sultan 
reportedly killed 10 people 
authorities described the town site of the sultans palace as 
calm but tense and government offices and businesses were closed 
the new sultan ibrahim dasuki called a news conference and 
urged people to remain calm 
dasuki a 65yearold millionaire and former civil servant was 
named sunday to succeed sadiq abubakar as sultan in kano province 
abubakar who was sultan for 50 years died last week at age 85 
traditionally the kano sultan is the spiritual leader of 
nigerias 50 million moslems and is revered by moslems in 
neighboring countries he is also frequently consulted by nigerian 
politicians including nonmoslems 
i know it was not possible to get the total support of all the 
people because other aspirants had their different sympathizers 
dasuki said 
he said he was confident moslems supported his appointment 
because of his experience as secretary of the supreme council of 
islamic affairs 
thousands of people who wanted abubakars elder son muhammadu 
maccido to succeed his father took to the streets and burned 
several buildings to protest dasukis appointment 
the protesters wore amulets and wielded daggers and chanted ba 
mu so which means we dont want in the hausa language

staterun rima radio and the local branch of the luxembourgbased 
bank of credit and commerce international

soldiers and policemen cordoned off the sultans palace and twice 
beat back crowds who tried to enter 
radio nigeria quoting police sources said 10 civilians were 
killed and five policemen were seriously injured it did not say how 
the civilians died 
reporters in lagos have said people believed the military 
government forced the committee of moslem elders that selected the 
new sultan to choose dasuki instead of maccido

central illinois voters narrowly rejected a proposal to build a 
50 million federal prison on pekins south side while residents of 
an ohio town overwhelmingly voted to allow a prison there 
the city of warren had agreed to pay for utility hookups to the 
prison by using as much as 900000 in city tax reserves tuesdays 
initiative would have prevented the city from providing the hookups 
city officials had acknowledged that the state couldnt have built 
the prison without the utilities 
in pekin supporters had billed the prison as an economic 
development resource that would provide jobs for the city of 33500 
while opponents argued the prison would mean more crime violence 
and drugs without bringing in significant new revenue or jobs 
they had hoped to match the success of east peoria residents who 
organized a similar campaign and defeated a prison referendum last

nevada gov richard bryans victory over an 
incumbent senator caps a political career that began when he was 
elected president of the student body in high school 
were ecstatic bryan exulted after he defeated gop sen chic 
hecht this has been a real tough campaign 
bryan has been a wellregarded governor and has demonstrated 
considerable media savvy hours after a rocket plant exploded in 
henderson earlier this year he appeared at las vegas television 
stations to explain what had gone wrong 
he is something of an independent among democrats he supports 
strong defense spending opposes the equal rights amendment and 
favors aid to the contras in nicaragua all of which put him outside 
the democratic mainstream 
he has opposed plans to locate a nuclear waste dump in nevada 
and he took a drubbing from hecht when gov michael dukakis said he 
stood by congresss decision to locate the dump there 
neither bryan nor hecht were shy about spending money bryans 
victory came after the most expensive race in nevada history in 
which the candidates spent an estimated 6 million

final 
figures the census bureau estimated there were about 182628000 
americans eligible to vote 
when the final figures are in gans expects the voter turnout to 
be right around 50 percent the lowest percentage of eligible 
voters to cast ballots since the 48 percent to 49 percent total in 
1924 
the turnout is down in every state of the union and the 
district of columbia with the exception of nevada and new 
hampshire gans said its conceivable that by the time final 
totals are in that nebraska and colorado may be up but if they are 
up they are up marginally 
gans said the turnout in 1948 was 511 percent and there was a 
steady decline thereafter until 1980 when 526 percent of the 
eligible electorate cast ballots in 1984 the number was 531 
percent 
the 1988 race was a horrible election in a variety of ways 
gans said and the people responded accordingly 
the low turnout was caused by a variety of factors but the 
primary reason was the conduct of the candidates the coverage of 
the campaign and the use of television advertising he said 
one candidate refused to say anything about anything but 
competence and good jobs for good wages and then refused to defend 
the core values of his party gans said the other candidate 
nominated dan quayle and then engaged in fairly low forms of 
demagogy without offering reasons for people to vote 
he blamed political and television consultants who ran the 
campaigns and reduced the flow of information to sevensecond 
sound bites and to television commercials substituting for 
debate 
the conduct of our campaigns has increasingly been put in the 
hands of irresponsible political consultants he said 
gans faulted the media for making polling a driving force in 
the campaign and then writing off whole regions of the country 
for one candidate this he said discouraged vast numbers of 
voters from going to the ballot box 
he also criticized television networks for projecting the 
eventual winner before polls close on the west coast 
right now the west coast states have by far and away the lowest 
turnout but final figures were not in said gans

washington ap president reagan met wednesday with the leader 
of the afghan resistance in an effort to dramatize us support for 
the rebels drive to topple the communist government in kabul and 
oust soviet troops 
the fight of the afghan people to regain and to preserve their 
freedom has provided a lesson for free people around the world 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
reagan meanwhile posed for pictures in the oval office with 
burhanuddin rabbani leader of the islamic society guerrilla group 
the afghan also met with secretary of state george p shultz 
in a statement fitzwater sharply criticized the soviets for 
conducting bombing raids against the mujahedeen guerrillas who are 
on the offensive against government forces he said the attacks 
call into question moscows commitment not to launch offensive 
operations in afghanistan 
fitzwater also indicated the rebels had us approval to maintain 
the pace of their offensive which the soviets cited last week in 
suspending the withdrawal of the red army from the country 
we have said we will continue to provide support for the 
mujahedeen as long as the soviet union is providing support for the 
kabul government fitzwater said and we would not intervene to 
direct their activities beyond that 
although the amount is secret the reagan administration has 
provided hundreds of millions of dollars of weapons to the rebels 
including shoulderfired stinger antiaircraft missiles delivered 
through pakistan 
there were reports rabbani would ask for additional arms but a 
us official who spoke earlier this week on condition of 
anonymity said they didnt come in pressing for more guns they 
are confident of their ability to see this war to its end 
fitzwater said the administration was disappointed by the 
soviet decision to suspend troop withdrawals but he said moscow was 
expected to honor its pledge to pull the last of its 100000 or more 
soldiers from afghanistan by feb 15 
the commitment of the american government and people to the 
afghan peoples cause is not new and it will not waiver he said 
it will continue as long as the afghan people require it to regain 
their freedom

residents who had to haul water from a 
faucet at the elementary school for three years because their 
shallow wells were contaminated say they have learned too well how 
precious is pure drinking water 
nearly a year after 250 families in the farming town of 1500 
people got together on their own time to build a 4 million water 
system they still show off to visitors their 500000gallon storage 
tank and basement meters 
and there are few complaints about the cost 3500 to 5000 
for a connection plus about 300 a year 
we get our water bill we pay it and we are happy said irene 
hoynoski 
about threequarters of the families signed up for the service in 
the town on the connecticut river in western massachusetts about 30 
miles north of springfield 
the cost its worth it just for the peace of mind said 
eileen haffey she was pregnant when the family discovered the house 
they had just bought had contaminated water 
she said her children got so used to bad water that they 
automatically asked if they could drink the water when out of town 
frank marchand chairman of the town water resource protection 
committee said cars lined up at the elementary school day and night 
for water from the outside tap 
i remember there was one poor woman with a station wagon who 
came every two days and filled up so many gallon milk jugs that they 
stretched from the front seat all the way to the back window he 
said she must have had to fill up 50 to 60 jugs every two days 
the two major contaminants in the residents wells were ethylene 
dibromide used on the tobacco fields and temik used on potatoes 
said john higgins regional engineer for the state department of 
environmental quality engineering 
but with such shallow wells most were six to eight feet deep 
we could find just about any agricultural chemical we tested 
for higgins said 
whately is a little unique he said there are small areas 
in towns all over the state where shallow wells have become 
contaminated but its not usual to find it affecting half the 
town 
the town actually had access to abundant water beneath a 
50footthick protective layer of clay but residents opted to try 
a municipal system with one 190footdeep well for fear that the 
deep aquifer would become contaminated as well if everyone drilled 
through the clay layer he said 
the town has no fulltime employees so the water system was all 
volunteer labor 
the most amazing thing about whately is how the community came 
and worked together higgins said everybody had other jobs and 
yet they got that system built as fast as a city that was paying 
people fulltime to work on the program 
money was hard to get paul fleuriel chairman of the town water 
commission boasts we bullied the state into helping 
after three years of negotiations he managed to wrest from the 
state nearly 15 million in grants the rest was covered by town 
borrowing and the connection fees 
marchand said he would never forget the april 1987 night the 
water district was approved by town meeting 
it needed a twothirds majority vote and it got that by one 
vote it was that close he said there were tears streaming out 
of peoples eyes

voters in five rock island county towns 
overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to merge into illinois 
fourthlargest city despite projected savings of 4 million and 
promises of increased political clout 
the proposal called on residents of rock island moline east 
moline coal valley and hampton to put aside their differences and 
link their populations and geographic areas in the fight for 
economic revitalization 
passage would have created a new community dubbed quad city 
rock island mayor robert millett revived the super city 
concept about two years ago in a bid to shake the rustbelt blues 
and get the attention of the nations business community 
a university study estimated taxpayers would save more than 4 
million by unifying police fire water and sewer snowremoval 
services and purchasing 
but community pride overcame the touted benefits and voters 
refused to give up their hometowns merger opponents played on those 
loyalties running newspaper ads showing the names of the five

air force secretary edward c pete aldridge 
jr announced his resignation on wednesday saying he would step 
down in december to assume a job in private industry 
aldridge 50 who has been praised widely for his work in helping 
the air force recover from the space shuttle challenger disaster 
said in a statement he had accepted an offer to become the president 
of a newly created subsidiary of the mcdonnell douglas corp a 
major space and military contractor 
presidentelect george bush has promised to bring a new team of 
officials into his administration and according to defense sources 
there never has been any doubt that the top civilian jobs heading 
the air force navy and army would change hands 
aldridge a native of houston who grew up in shreveport la 
said he would depart his job dec 16 air force undersecretary james 
mcgovern will assume the duties on a temporary basis the pentagon 
said 
in his letter of resignation to president reagan aldridge 
thanked reagan for providing him the most rewarding experience of 
my career adding the administration had built what is 
undoubtedly the greatest air force in the world 
aldridge said he would remain in the washington area to assume 
the presidency of the mcdonnell douglas electronic systems co 
mcdonnell douglas headquartered in st louis is the nations 
largest defense contractor it announced just a week ago plans to 
split its thirdlargest unit the mcdonnell douglas astronautics 
co into three new companies 
besides the electronic systems co the other companies created 
were the mcdonnell douglas space systems co and the mcdonnell 
douglas missile systems co the subsidiary that aldridge will head 
is responsible for the companys electronics work and command 
control communications and intelligence systems businesses 
aldridge who has served in the reagan administration for 7 
years and as the secretary of the air force since the summer of 
1986 held a number of management posts with mcdonnell douglas in 
the 1960s an aeronautical engineer by training he also has held 
private industry jobs with the ltv aerospace corp and the systems 
planning corp 
aldridge worked in a number of pentagon posts in the 1970s 
serving at one point as an advisor to the strategic arms limitation 
talks in helsinki and vienna 
his tenure as air force secretary has been marked by a largely 
successful effort to rebuild the services unmanned space program 
and nagging complaints about the services management of the b1b 
bomber program 
aldridge insisted and congress ultimately agreed the air 
force had to start building new unmanned rockets to ensure access to 
space in the wake of the challenger tragedy 
while aldridge and air force brass maintain the b1b is the best 
longrange bomber in the world the general accounting office has 
criticized the services management of the program the gao 
maintains the bomber may never meet contract specifications for 
radarjamming capability and is frequently grounded for maintenance

bush to victory registering a net gain of one governors office out 
of 12 races including the top spot in vice presidentelect dan 
quayles state 
twentyeight of the 50 governorships now are in democratic hands 
putting the party in good position to influence the congressional 
redistricting battles expected to be waged in state legislatures 
after the 1990 census 
historically the party that wins the white house has picked up 
some governors seats this year they had that loss of one 
charles h dolan jr executive director of the democratic 
governors association said wednesday i think there were

carolina and a new republican replaced an old one in new hampshire 
democratic incumbents were returned by wide margins in north dakota 
vermont and washington

association said she was just delighted by the outcome 
especially after we had the democrats out there crowing that they 
were going to get four seats in rhode island utah west virginia 
and indiana 
the republican victories in utah and montana were a clear sign 
that there was a positive coattail effect for george bush but

iran on wednesday accepted a red cross proposal to 
begin exchanging disabled war prisoners with iraq on nov 20 
irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati made the 
announcement after meeting with jan eliasson the un mediator in 
the iraniraq peace talks 
eliasson met earlier with the iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
who did not immediately announce his response 
the countries have a total of 1569 disabled prisoners captured 
during the iraniraq war which began in september 1980 red cross 
spokesman juerg bischof said the agency has registered 1158 in iran 
and 411 in iraq 
the geneva talks are aimed at consolidating a ceasefire that 
took effect aug 20 a new facetoface session is scheduled 
thursday 
bischof said technical talks on how to proceed with the prisoner 
exchange are under way he said the nov 20 date will give officials 
time to make preparations such as chartering a plane that may have 
to be specially equipped to transport the wounded 
iraq announced tuesday that it was ready to begin immediately 
with the repatriation of wounded iranians the red cross has 
identified in iraqi camps provided iran also agrees to send home 
disabled iraqi pows 
iran said oct 21 that it was prepared to release the wounded 
should iraq be willing to reciprocate 
in a note to both governments oct 4 the red cross encouraged 
repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners and the registration of 
all prisoners estimated to total more than 100000 as a matter 
of priority 
the red cross has registered 50182 iraqi pows in iran and 19284 
iranians in iraq but it estimates each side holds another 20000 to 
30000 it has urged both governments to supply complete lists and 
insists that all prisoners be interviewed by red cross delegates to 
make sure repatriation is voluntary 
in the unmediated peace talks that began aug 25 iraq has 
been pressing for the release and repatriation of all pows 
independent of negotiations on consolidating the truce 
iran insists that such global release be linked to other 
provisions in the un ceasefire resolution it urges that priority 
be given to the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognized 
borders 
that border is disputed since iraq a few days before the 
outbreak of the war repudiated a 1975 treaty delineating it the 
issue has stalled the peace talks since august

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen was flying 
back to washington from texas he won a new term in the senate and 
as chairman of the taxwriting senate finance committee will spend 
the next two years negotiating with the republican administration on 
issues such as taxes and trade 
bush and the new congress began warming up to each other 
although no one was underestimating the differences after a long and 
bruising campaign 
the question is whether there will be a honeymoon 
certainly there will be considerable confict between their agenda 
and our agenda said sen rudy boschwitz of minnesota who 
spearheaded the losing republican campaign to win control of the 
senate 
look theres no hard feelings said the presidentelect 
most of us have know george bush for a long time replied 
sen joseph biden of delaware chairman of the judiciary committee 
he said he spoke for all democratic chairmen in saying he was 
prepared to work with president bush and do that straight up no 
holds barred and find whether he means what he says when he says 
that he expects to have a close relationship with the senate and the 
house 
whatever else happened the senators knew that bush carried most 
of their states he won 40 of them and nine of the 11 largest 
inluding california ohio illinois michigan texas and florida 
dukakis carried new york massachusetts and eight other states as 
well as the district of columbia 
the race to pick a new senate power broker was under way in 
earnest senate majority leader robert byrd was giving up his 
leadership post in the new congress and j bennett johnston of 
louisiana george mitchell of maine and daniel inouye of hawaii were 
in a race to succeed him 
that figured to be a campaign as tough as any waged this year 
and with a tiny number of registered voters the ranks of 
democratic senators in the new congress 
speaker jim wright of texas was reelected without opposition and 
will lead the democrats in the new house 
all in all it was an election that treated incumbents kindly yet 
one that produced its fair share of fresh faces 
the new senators included joseph lieberman in connecticut a 
democrat who ended lowell weickers maverick career after three 
terms former govs charles robb in virginia and robert kerrey in 
nebraska turned republican senate seats into democratic ones gov

whom won open seats slade gorton of washington defeated in a 
reelection bid two years ago mounted a successful comeback 
one republican sen malcolm wallop of wyoming squeaked to a new 
term 
though a few house incumbents remained locked in tough races on 
the afternoon after the election that didnt change the overall 
picture incumbency was practically a guarantee of victory 
the few exceptions to the rule included rep fernand j st 
germain a 14term veteran and chairman of the house banking 
committee beset by charges of ethical lapses he fell to political 
newcomer ronald machtley 
three republican incumbents were turned out of office including 
pat swindall in georgia who was defeated by ben jones swindall 
faces perjury charges 
other gop incumbents who fell included freshman jack davis in 
illinois and mac sweeney in texas 
democrats picked up statehouse offices formerly held by 
republicans including indiana where 32yearold evan bayh wrested 
control from the republicans for the first time in 20 years gaston

republicans countered with one takeaway of their own when stan 
stephens won the montana statehouse for the gop for the first time 
in 16 years 
two republican incumbents survived close calls 
gov edward diprete overcame allegations of unethical conduct in 
rhode island to defeat a democratic businessman for the second time 
in two years while fellow republican norm bangerter was reelected

despite the defeat of michael dukakis 
democrats on wednesday expanded their majority in the house of 
representatives where 99 percent of incumbents seeking reelection 
were returned to office 
the day after the elections three house races were still too 
close to call but all three were led by democrats who would end up 
with a net gain of five seats if they held those leads 
democrats took 259 of the 435 house seats republicans held 173 
seats down from 178 in the last congress 
that the democrats kept their majority was no surprise to 
analysts in either party even republican incumbents fared well 
with 158 of 163 gop veterans returning for another two years 
overall 401 of the 408 house members who sought reelection got 
their wish thats a 99 percent success rate for incumbents 
surpassing the previous record of 98 percent in 1986 
surprises were few 
in rhode island democratic rep fernand st germain the chairman 
of the banking committee was upset by republican attorney ronald 
machtley ending st germains 14term career in the house next in 
seniority to become chairman of the committee is rep henry b 
gonzalez dtexas who won 72 percent of the vote to defeat his 
republican challenger 
st germain who had been the subject of an earlier ethics 
investigation suffered another blow just two weeks before the 
election when a fivemonthold justice department letter was 
unsealed the letter referred to substantial evidence of serious 
and sustained misconduct by st germain for allegedly accepting 
favors from lobbyists 
an ethics issue also helped bring down rep pat swindall rga 
who lost to ben jones a democrat who once played the role of cooter 
on televisions the dukes of hazzard the bitter campaign 
focused on swindalls electioneve perjury indictment in a drug 
money laundering case and on jones past arrests and alcohol 
problems 
there were these lingering undecided contests wednesday 
in floridas 4th district democratic rep william v chappell 
jr held about a 1000vote lead over republican craig t james 
with all but absentee ballots counted 
in new york state with 95 percent of ballots counted 
democratic challenger nita lowey was about 2000 votes ahead of 
incumbent republican joseph j dioguardi who was seeking a third 
term

republican denny smith by less than 1300 votes with some absentee 
ballots remaining

republican rep jack davis of illinois defeated by former state 
sen george sangmeister and republican rep mac sweeney of texas 
defeated by democrat greg laughlin 
when the 101st congress convenes in january it will mark the 
35th consecutive year of democratic control and with it control of 
more than two dozen committees and the speakers chair 
we knew we were going to have a tough row to hoe this year 
said rep guy vander jagt rmich chaieed for massive changes 
vander jagt said the fact that 99 percent of the incumbents 
seeking reelection won demonstrates the awesome power of 
incumbency 
vander jagts democratic counterpart rep beryl anthony dark 
chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee said 
voters preferred democratic policies in congress they gave us 
their vote of confidence anthony said 
house republican leader bob michel of illinois also cited the 
incredible amount of money available to incumbents 
according to campaign finance reports filed before election day 
house incumbents had collected 151 million in contributions 
compared to 32 million for their opponents 
the most expensive of the house contests was the battle for the 
19th district of california where republican rep robert 
lagomarsino held on to beat democratic state sen gary k hart no 
relation to former colorado sen gary hart to win by just over 
2000 votes 
between them lagomarsino and hart spent an estimated 23 
million to capture the district that will be president reagans home 
when he returns to california

vatican radio said american voters chose the more secure path

bushs selection of his friend and campaign manager james a 
baker iii as secretary of state came as no surprise and won general 
approval 
foreign officials particularly diplomats dislike commenting on 
the internal affairs of another country but a west german official 
called baker a good choice and a french diplomatic source 
described him as very professional both spoke on condtiion of 
anonymity 
a few discordant notes were found in the favorable chorus of 
comment about bush

states pursues suppression and plunder of the third world

state as he promised

interest of the whole southern africa region that a realist like mr 
bush was elected

against south africa which dukakis had pledged to do 
president corazon aquino of the philippines a dukakis friend of 
long standing said she hoped relations with washington would be 
strengthened rep ramon mitra speaker of the house of 
representatives said bush must dispel a view in the philippines 
that he is unsympathetic to mrs aquinos government

el nuevo diario as saying a bush administration could open the way 
to negotiations and improved relations with the united states 
president oscar arias of costa rica who won the 1987 nobel peace 
prize for his work on a central american peace agreement said i 
expect big support from bush for our plan because we do not believe

democrat joseph i lieberman who narrowly 
defeated incumbent sen lowell p weicker jr in connecticut says 
hes an independent who agrees with presidentelect george bush on 
some foreign policy and law enforcement issues 
weicker on the other hand has a record as a maverick liberal 
republican 
all of which led one newspaper headline writer to wonder about 
weicker arent he and rival in the wrong parties 
lieberman who defeated weicker by less than 5000 votes out of 
more than 13 million cast has managed to define himself as both a 
populist and a conservative in his five years as attorney general 
he has seized popular issues by taking legal action against 
polluters and fraudulent charities 
yet he remains a conservative on many of the issues he is likely 
to address as the states new senator 
certainly ill vote with the democrats but im an independent 
individual he said wednesday and on certain foreign policy 
issues law enforcement some tradition value issues im going to 
vote my conscience and if occasionally i vote with presidentelect 
bush dont be too surprised but im a democrat and im proud of 
it 
with 100 percent of precincts reporting tuesday lieberman edged 
weicker by 678191 votes or 498 percent to 669983 votes or 492 
percent a recount appears likely because of the closeness of the 
vote 
thats a question that the lawyers are working on lieberman 
said its an argument about state law we actually think that 
theres not a need for a recount but well see as the day goes on 
when the 46yearold yale law school graduate announced he would 
challenge weicker the threeterm incumbent and connecticuts senior 
senator many thought he had been given bad advice 
early polls seemed to confirm that showing weicker with a 
24point lead by midoctober lieberman had pulled even with 
weicker in the polls thanks in part to clever campaign ads 
depicting the burly weicker as a sleeping bear who missed key senate 
votes 
lieberman an orthodox jew who refused to campaign on the 
sabbath also gained the support of such wellknown conservatives as 
william f buckley jr by favoring hardline viewpoints that weicker 
opposed such as the reagan administrations invasion of grenada

house banking committee was beaten by gop attorney ronald machtley 
just two weeks before election day a 5monthold justice department 
letter had been unsealed referring to substantial evidence of

to all of a sudden spending a little time with my wife and my two 
daughters said st germain 60

votes with 5 percent of the vote outstanding absentee ballots 
delayed a final tally 
donald payne dnj elected to replace the retired rep peter 
rodino brought the number of blacks in the house to 23 one more 
than the previous record and the victory of democrat jolene unsoeld 
of washington state boosted the number of women in the chamber 
beyond the current alltime mark of 23 
democrats started the day with enormous advantages of 27 open 
seats where turnover usually occurs only 12 were previously 
democratic and of 81 lawmakers with no major party opposition only 
20 were republicans 
the last time a party winning the presidential race lost ground 
in the house was in 1960 when democrats lost 20 seats even though

composerconductor leonard bernstein has taken on 
william f buckley jr on the conservative columnists turf 
in the latest exchange between the two bernstein wrote an open 
letter to the columnist that ran wednesday in the daily news of new 
york which syndicates buckley your column bernstein told 
buckley is beneath your dignity 
the spat began when bernstein in an oct 30 opinion essay in the 
new york times decried efforts to besmirch the word liberalism 
liberal is a word soiled by the greedy reactionary 
backlooking impulse toward tyranny bernstein said 
buckley retaliated in a nov 2 colalistic twoterm president in times 
of peace and prosperity 
but a selective profile could just as easily fit the image of 
michael j dukakis van buren was a short liberal democrat a 
former northeast governor with strong ethnic roots and unlike bush 
he was not born to the privilege so ridiculed by his critics 
a dozen incumbent vice presidents have succeeded their bosses 
but only four by election john adams and thomas jefferson the 
nations second and third presidents were the first two 
some called the long drought which kept the second fiddles from 
moving to the first string the van buren jinx but most 
historians say that difficulty winning a presidential election 
simply goes with the vice presidential turf 
when youre vice president you dont stand on your own said 
bruce stewart superintendent of the martin van buren national 
historic site in van burens native kinderhook 130 miles north of 
new york city youre always associated with someone else youre 
linked more with the outgoing president than as your own man 
and voters typical desire for change has kept most incumbent 
deputies out of the white house noted stewart who oversees 
linderwald the mansion to which van buren in 1840 
van buren a dutchman helped found the democratic party and his 
behindthescenes dealing built the foundation for todays 
convention and electioneering process stewart said 
but van burens democratic liberalism of the 1830s would fit 
today at 
desk of ronald reagan said george berndt a historian at 
lindenwald which is run by the national park service to a large 
extent van buren believed in the policies of the present republican 
party he said 
for example van burens was a strong advocate of states rights 
feeling that the federal government should not intrude on social 
issues 
for van buren the charge that he had little regard for common 
people dug deep said donald cole a historian in exeter nh who 
specializes in the jackson era 
van buren was considered kind of feminine aristocratic said 
cole whose book martin van buren and the american political 
system was published by princeton university press his 
opponents liked to say he drank wine out of fancy cups 
that even became part of the opposing whig battle cry in 1840 
when van buren lost his reelection bid to william henry harrison 
said michael henderson assistant curator at lindenwald 
harrison forces used the slogan would you rather have a goblet 
of champagne or a glass of cider to imply that harrison born in 
a log cabin was closer to the electorate than the genteel van buren 
van buren was born a tavern keepers son among the dutch settlers 
in kinderhook he built his wealth from a law practice fashioned 
after long apprenticeships 
van buren was jacksons campaign manager in 1828 and the top 
adviser in the presidents kitchen cabinet through his two 
terms berndt said he was jacksons handpicked successor 
while bush exults in matching van burens accomplishment theres 
another jinx associated with the little dutchman he has yet to 
overcome van buren got beat by william henry harrison when he ran 
for reelection

in the last two days of the campaign deputy press 
secretary steve akey was given to answering the telephone with 
catch the wave half a joke half a prayer that some latehour 
surge of voter support would sweep democratic nominee michael 
dukakis into the white house 
it was that quiet hope that kept akey going tuesday talking 
about impossible combinations that could lead to election victory 
theres still a shot the arithmetic isnt blocked yet he 
said later he insisted by no means is it impossible 
but in the end he admitted his optimism was borne of love for 
his 20month job like petting an old dog that is going to die soon 
it didnt go our way he said as the tv networks numbers 
conspired against his dream but i still feel good about the 
effort its like nothing ive ever done and i wouldnt trade that 
experience for anything 
akey and his staffs last stand took place at 105 chauncy street 
a halfrenovated building on the edge of bostons combat zone of 
seedy bars topless joints and porn movie houses 
the press office of the dukakisbentsen committee occupying half 
the second floor consisted of 20 fulltime staffers 10 to 15 
volunteers and a clutter of computers television sets copying and 
fax machines newspaper clippings pictures and posters 
the boyishlooking akey a political veteran at 27 was working 
for the dukakis campaign before there was an official campaign he 
gave up a safe spot in the massachusetts governors press office and 
took the campaign job on april fools day 1987 nearly a month 
before dukakis announced his candidacy 
since then akey has traveled to 30 states he has endured the 
blazing heat and frigid cold of iowas summer and winter he has 
survived sleepless nights too much pizza and irritable reporters 
he fought off a 103degree fever and laryngitis during the 
democratic national convention in atlanta in july only to fall 
asleep sick and exhausted in the middle of dukakis acceptance 
speech 
i woke up and it was over he said 
arey lost touch with his beloved red sox and celtics but he 
found love he married joyce carrier the dukakis campaigns 
national advance director 
it was a complimentary relationship he said of their 
romance joyce had worked for mondale in 1984 and knew about 
presidential campaigns but not much about dukakis i knew everything 
about the candidate but not much about national politics 
he never lost his sense of humor in the waning hours of the 
campaign he taunted a pet fish named roger ailes after the 
republican media director he sent nodoz in an overnight letter to 
the bushquayle campaign he played at loud volume a tape submitted 
by a man who in the dulcet tones of a las vegas lounge lizard sang 
over and over again vote for dukaaakiiisss vote for 
dukaaakiiisss 
akey gave optimistic interviews to visiting reporters he 
answered a question from a college student newspaper about how much 
pizza the campaign workers consumed he wrote summaries of the 
network news programs and watched other staffers coordinate dukakis 
final blitz of satellite interviews with local television stations 
across the country 
he wrote talking points memos giving state campaign workers 
the optimistic line from national headquarters to relay to local 
media one read dukakis is on the verge of a historic upset 
when it was all over akey sat with his feet on his desk talking 
calmly on the phone to friends and colleagues around the country 
writing down numbers as the tv sets droned on 
catch the wave hed say and younger workers would take up 
the chant 
surge theyd yell and slap hands 
the surge never came the numbers didnt hold akey skipped a 
campaign celebration at bostons world trade center because joyce 
was sick in their charlestown apartment with a 100degree fever 
akey took her some juice a people magazine and a vase of roses 
from the dozens of flowers that filled campaign headquarters on the 
last day together they watched the campaigns death throes on 
television 
its a special thing to have a job youre excited about even 
when you get three hours sleep and drag yourself out of a motel in 
iowa not because you have to but because you want to akey said

michael dukakis said today i gave it my best 
shot in a losing run for the white house and said republican 
distortions were a key ingredient in george bushs victory 
at a valedictory campaign news conference in boston dukakis 
congratulated the presidentelect on a decisive victory but said 
he doubted the nations new leader could claim a mandate 
dukakis said the democratic party remains healthy nationally but 
sidestepped a question about whether he would once again seek the 
presidency 
he said he was now ready to return to his duties as governor of 
massachusetts i will be digging into that vigorously and fully 
he said 
he repeated his charges that republican media manipulators 
resorted to highly negative commercials to defeat him and said the 
ads took their toll he said he feared this would be a signal now 
at the national level that this kind of campaigning is effective 
asked whether he felt his record had defeated him dukakis 
swiftly interrupted his questioner and said the distortions of 
that record contributed a great deal 
he said he was disappointed but not bitter at the defeat but 
said republicans set a standard of negative campaigning that the 
nation may live to regret 
it was a scene reminiscent of the day following dukakis loss in 
the 1978 democratic gubernatorial primary in massachusetts 
this campaign has not been just about mike dukakis and lloyd 
bentsen its been about all of us and the values and ideals that we 
share the democratic nominee said tuesday night in a concession 
speech shortly after polls closed on the west coast 
flanked by his family dukakis acknowledged bushs victory and 
promised to work with the republican presidentelect 
but in a forceful restatement of the populist themes that 
animated his campaign in its closing weeks he said his is an 
unfinished agenda and he urged his followers to devote themselves 
to it 
weve got to fight for that young family in levitown on long 
island new york that wants to buy a home in the community in which 
they grew up and cant afford it dukakis said weve got to 
fight for that family in sioux city iowa that cant afford health 
insurance to pay the bills for its young son weve got to fight for 
those high school students in los angeles who are saying no to 
drugs and yes to their future 
weve got to open up that door of college opportunity to every 
young person in this country who is qualified to do college work 
weve got to fight to end the shame of homelessness in this country 
and this great and good nation ought to be able to do that he 
said 
were going to continue to fight with you and with the american 
people so that every citizen in this country can be a full 
shareholder in the american dream 
dukakis who had telephoned bush just before the speech to 
concede the race offered a brief salute to his rival 
i know i speak for all of you and all of the american people 
when i say he will be our president and we will work with him he 
said this nation faces major challenges and we must work 
together 
after conceding dukakis met privately with members of his 
campaign staff to thank them 
with the campaign over dukakis goes back full time to what he 
once called the greatest job in the world massachusetts 
governor he planned to be in his statehouse office this morning 
before holding a news conference 
well be working with the new administration and above all ill 
be working with the people of massachusetts said dukakis who 
during the campaign refused to say whether he would run for a fourth 
term in 1990 if his presidential bid failed 
he has been governor in absentia for much of the past year 
during which the state economy that brought him nationwide attention 
faltered somewhat causing subpar state revenue collections that 
forced massachusetts to borrow to pay its bills that undermined 
dukakis campaign theme of competent economic management 
during his concession speech he did not acknowledge chants of 
92 from his supporters some of whom wept as he spoke but the 
governor said he plans to remain an active democratic party 
spokesman 
for dukakis the end came after a furious finish to a campaign 
criticized for lacking a central message and coordinated management 
dukakis campaigned nonstop the final three days beginning 
saturday morning in colorado and ending 81 hours and 8500 air 
travel miles later with a series of lastminute appeals through 
satellite interviews with local television stations in several 
states 
dukakis had kind words for the thousands of volunteers who worked 
for his campaign and urged his young supporters to consider public 
service as a vocation 
there is nothing you can do in this world more fulfilling and 
more satisfying than giving of yourself to others and making a 
contribution to your community and your nation and your fellow 
citizens he said i dont want you to be discouraged i want 
you to be encouraged by what you have done in this campaign i want 
you to go into public service it is a noble profession 
and he revived the marathon metaphor he first used when he 
announced his candidacy in march 1987 with a reference to the most 
grueling portion of the annual boston marathon 
we reached heartbreak hill and overcame it and there we found 
the strength to reach that finish line dukakis said tonight my 
heart is filled with gratitude to everyone who has made this 
extraordinary experience possible

an audit of hospital bills nationwide has found 
that 98 percent contained overcharges or charges for treatment not 
delivered says a financial information company that conducted the 
study 
the average bill examined was 39000 and the average error was 
1488 said atlantabased equifax inc there were few instances of 
undercharging or nonbilling the company said 
the errors showed up in a yearlong audit of thousands of bills 
issued at more than 5000 public private and university hospitals 
said patrick swift equifax product manager in charge of auditing 
services 
he said one patient was handed a 150000 bill last year that 
contained an overcharge of about 39000 which came about because 
the hospitals pharmacy mislabeled the patients medication 
i think they put an extra zero on a price tag he said in an 
interview published in wednesdays editions of the atlanta 
constitution 
kee carlisle a spokeswoman for blue cross and blue shield of 
georgia said these kinds of errors drive the costs of health 
care up and the costs of insurance up for what corporations and the 
government have to pay 
american hospital association spokeswoman jan shulman said the 
study did not represent the total picture of medical billing 
were not trying to say that accidents dont happen that 
mistakesin billing dont happen she said but i do believe that 
hospitals make an effort to be accurate in their billing 
the equifax audit was conducted from january to december 1987 by 
registered nurses hired by equifax when errors were uncovered the 
individual insurance companies involved were contacted and the 
errors corrected swift said 
he said errors were most often found in intensive care or 
longerterm treatment programs or in hospital laboratories and 
pharmacies where there is more activity required to track and bill 
properly 
swift said the results of the audit are preliminary and final 
results will be released later this year

blacks and women eeked out slim gains in this 
years house races and held even in the senate but some supporters 
complained wednesday that it would take centuries at that pace to 
achieve political parity 
with blacks making up about 11 percent of the us population and 
women accounting for more than half just 5 percent of the 435 
members of the new house will be black and about the same share will 
be women 
the figures are even more lopsided in the 100member senate 
which will remain all white for another two years and continue to 
include just two women 
blacks and women were at their high water marks of 22 and 23 
members respectively in the expiring congress there will be one 
more black congressman in the new house and at least one possibly 
two more women 
feminist leader eleanor smeal said america is locking out women 
and blacks with a political system weighted toward those already 
in office 
weve got to do something about the rules she said these 
are incumbent protection clubs the way the rules are working 
jane danowitz executive director of the bipartisan womens 
campaign fund said that despite incremental gains for female 
candidates its still not enough 
at the rate were going its going to be 500 years until we 
achieve parity she said i dont think anybody wants to wait 
that long 
the chairman of the congressional black caucus rep mervyn 
dymally was equally pessimistic saying the reagan years and george 
bushs campaign had left the nation divided along race and class 
lines 
its bad enough to lose but when you lose on the basis of race 
and polarization it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth said 
dymally dcalif 
others found cause for optimism 
when you think of how we have just been trying to hold our 
numbers you can call 1988 a boom year even though there were only 
two women challengers who won said irene natividad who chairs 
the national womens political caucus 
the net gain for women came in washington state where state rep 
jolene unsoeld narrowly defeated republican bill wight in new york 
democrat nita lowey claimed victory over twoterm republican joseph 
dioguardi although the congressman refused to concede with several 
thousand absentee ballots yet to be counted 
blacks picked up their first house seat in new jersey where 
newark councilman donald payne will replace retiring democrat peter 
rodino 
rodino a 40year house veteran known for his strong civil rights 
record had been pressed to make way for a black successor in the 
majority black district jesse jackson two years ago called rodino a 
good man but said we can have a good man and black man from 
new jersey at the same time 
i believe this will make all of the people feel part of 
this great nation payne said following his victory over 
republican michael webb who also is black the house of 
representatives should be truly representative 
in senate races susan engeleiter republican leader of the 
wisconsin state senate was the more promising of two women 
challengers but she was unable to catch up to democrat herbert 
kohl a millionaire businessman republican maria hustace was no 
challenge to democratic sen spark matsunaga in hawaii 
the two incumbent women in the senate nancy l kassebaum 
rkan and barbara mikulski dmd were not up for reelection 
two black republicans ran for senate seats in virginia and 
maryland but lost by wide margins to popular democrats maurice 
dawkins a lobbyist and retired minister lost to former gov 
charles s robb in virginia and former assistant secretary of state 
alan l keyes was defeated by sen paul sarbanes dmd 
linda williams a political analyst at the joint center for 
political studies which focuses on black political affairs said 
both men were token candidates placed in nowin races 
she said the blacks probably wont win a senate seat until a 
moderate black house member who can attract white voters decides to 
run future gains in the house also will be hard to come by since 
most blackdominated districts now have black congressmen she said 
its going to be slow as a tortoise for a good while to come 
ms williams said it really comes down to blacks winning a lot 
of white votes 
the last black to serve in the senate was edward brooke a 
massachusetts republican who was defeated for reelection in 1978

thousands of cambodian refugees have 
been removed from a unaided camp by khmer rouge guerrillas and 
forced into a heavily mined malarial jungle western relief 
officials said wednesday 
since june the officials said the communist guerrillas have 
moved all but 1000 of 9500 refugees from the camp of ta luan in 
thailands eastern trat province to a new camp on the cambodian 
frontier several miles away 
several thousand other refugees were moved to the border from the 
otraonatrao camp in northeast surin province 
with aid officials watching guerrillas transferred everything 
from ta luan in chinesesupplied trucks entire houses even papaya 
trees they left behind a ghost village of the crippled the 
blind the amputees said one western official who like other 
sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
on aug 27 aid officials declared a medical emergency at ta luan 
upon finding one source said 160 patients 45 of them seriously 
ill and a 15yearold medic in charge the khmer rouge has barred 
relief officials from the new site saying it is too dangerous 
however one official said a thai military officer who visited it 
a few days ago was shocked conditions were desperate they had no 
medical facilities and it was in a very malarious area 
according to refugees who managed to flee the area is mined 
toward the thai border to prevent escape in recent days some 
refugees have been allowed back to ta luans medical clinic most 
have malaria 
aid officials say the movement of the refugees is aimed at 
strengthening the khmer rouges position as the world community 
tries to isolate it 
the khmer rouge with 40000 chinesearmed troops is the 
strongest of three guerrilla groups fighting vietnamese forces that 
invaded cambodia in late 1978 the invasion ended a threeyear khmer 
rouge dictatorship that killed hundreds of thousands of people in 
slave labor camps and torture chambers 
after fleeing to thailand the khmer rouge set up camps where 
reportedly they hold refugees from the war as virtual prisoners 
aid officials have reported nighttime executions of refugees and 
forced porter duty on battlefields 
we are regularly in receipt of firsthand reports of bizarre 
violations of human rights in these camps yy kim recently

donors in june

the official english message that 
florida colorado and arizona voters wrote on election day will be 
carried to congress the head of us english promised wednesday 
theres no question that the victories of florida and colorado 
and even the one in arizona were just stunning stanley 
diamond the acting chairman of us english said theyre just 
smashing victories for us 
voters in florida the countrys fourthlargest state approved 
amendment 11 by an 8416 percent margin the amendment changes the 
state constitution to make english the states official language and 
authorizes the legislature to write laws enforcing that status 
the victory was decried by arthur j kropp president of people 
for the american way a washingtonbased lobby describing itself as 
aconstitutional liberties organization 
amendment 11s victory will help the englishonly movement 
achieve its hidden agenda rights for some citizens not all 
kropp said sadly the citizens of florida may now have to share 
the bitter experience of california and other areas where 
englishonly laws have fostered bigotry and intolerance for those 
whose first language is not english 
diamond and other backers deny that the movement is based on 
bigotry 
coloradans endorsed a similar measure by a wide margin but the 
vote was closer in arizona where the official english amendment was 
approved 5149 percent 
arizonas proposition 106 requires state and county governments 
to conduct all business in english with certain exceptions in 
education public health and safety the justice system and federal 
election law 
the victory is truly the expression of the people diamond 
said in a telephone interview from his washington office 
seventeen states have now passed laws or amendments designating 
english their official language 
we want that message and particulary the vote to get to the 
congress diamond said a proposed amendment to the us 
constitution has been sitting before a house subcommittee for more 
than a year he said 
diamond said the official english campaign would likely turn its 
attention next to texas massachusetts and new jersey 
the campaign had been marked by lawsuits and the resignations of 
key proponents including former cbs anchorman walter cronkite who 
said he believed the arizona proposal could hurt minorities 
on oct 17 former reagan white house aide linda chavez resigned 
as president of us english citing a report that at least one 
major contributor to the group has advocated forced sterilization 
us english cofounder john tanton resigned the same day 
the us justice department had joined unsuccessful efforts to 
remove the measure from floridas ballot opponents had complained 
that petitions werent circulated in spanish in six of floridas 67 
counties

kentucky indiana idaho and minnesota voted to establish state 
lotteries while south dakota endorsed legalized gambling in 
deadwood the black hills town where wild bill hickok was gunned 
down playing poker 112 years ago 
voters in south dakota approved by nearly a twothirds margin 
tuesday a constitutional amendment giving the legislature authority 
to set regulations for gambling deadwood voters ultimately will 
have to approve the idea by 60 percent 
the plan would permit slot machines and card games with proceeds 
going toward historic preservation in the town 
in kentucky voters approved by 6139 percent an amendment 
allowing a lottery 
the vote was a victory for kentuckys children senior citizens 
and vietnam veterans gov wallace wilkinson said he asked the 
general assembly to enact lottery legislation during a special 
session beginning nov 28 
in indiana voters approved by a 53 margin a proposition to 
remove the state constitutions ban on lotteries and other forms of 
gambling 
the legislators still have to approve a lottery said paul r 
oakes chairman of an antigambling group legislators in january 
begin deciding how a lottery will be run and how its projected 150 
million in annual revenue will be spent 
in idaho prolottery forces overcame a media blitz by opponents 
and narrowly won support for a constitutional amendment authorizing 
a lottery 
in minnesota a state lottery measure was approved 59 percent to 
41 percent 
since approval of a constitutional amendment requires a majority 
of all voters casting ballots a 60 percent majority is generally 
considered the minimum needed to ensure passage because many voters 
skip the constitutional questions 
the minnesota legislature now must decide whether a lottery will 
actually be established

the 1988 corn crop is expected to total 467 
billion bushels up 3 percent from the forecast a month ago but down 
34 percent from the 1987 harvest the agriculture department said 
today 
according to the departments agricultural and statistics board 
an estimated 83 percent of this falls corn acreage was harvested as 
of nov 1 7 percent behind last year but 16 percent ahead of the 
198387 average 
farmers cut back to a little over 567 million acres for corn 
harvest from 591 million a year ago 
the corn harvest drastically reduced by the summer drought was 
the smallest since 1983 when similar searing heat and a shortage of 
rain hammered the nations farmlands and reduced output to 417 
billion bushels 
the record year was 1985 when farmers produced 888 billion 
bushels of corn 
the cotton harvest based on nov 1 indications was estimated at 
148 million bales 1 percent above both the 1987 crop and the oct 
1 forecast the record was 1895 million bales in 1937 
with the harvest of 1988 crops winding down no new production 
figures were included for many earlier commodities such as wheat 
oats and barley

here is the text of the news conference held 
wednesday by massachusetts gov michael dukakis following his defeat 
in the 1988 presidential race 
thank you very much thank you 
let me begin by saying thank you to the members of the press and 
especially those of you who travelled with us i know it wasnt easy 
particularly the last three days i apologize for that you all 
look a little better than you did yesterday and i hope its because 
you got yourselves a good night sleep 
but it was a pleasure working with you youre all professionals 
i wish i could have spent a little more time with you maybe there 
will be time for that later on 
but im just very grateful to all of you and it was a pleasure 
to get to know you and meet you and to admire the way you covered 
this campaign covered me and the professionalism with which you did 
that 
let me just briefly summarize some of the things i said 
yesterday and then ill be open to questions 
once again let me congratulate the vice president on a very 
decisive victory at the same time the democratic party is clearly 
alive and well and very strong weve added to our majority in the 
congress weve added to our majority in the senate and added to 
our majority of governors 
and what i think this says is that the american people want 
leadership in washington that will respond to the concerns of 
average american families that will fight battles which are 
important to fight for good jobs and decent housing and quality 
education and drugfree schools a clean and safe environment and 
health care for the american people all of the things that i tried 
very hard to emphasize in the campaign the kind of agenda which i 
believe most americans want their government to respond to want the 
president and the congress to respond to 
and i personally will continue to do whatever i can with my 
fellow governors with the congress with the new administration 
here in massachusetts to make sure that we respond and respond 
strongly and well to those concerns and those challenges which face 
the american people everyday face the people of my state everyday 
and for which those of us who are elected to public office are 
elected to do something about 
i spent the morning in my state house office getting reacclimated 
and going back to work on my job as governor of the commonwealth 
and obviously ill be digging into that vigorously and fully over 
the course of the next few days 
i think kitty and i will probably take the weekend off and maybe 
sometime down the road in several weeks take a little more time 
out 
but its good to be home and good to be back in this community 
in this commonwealth which has been so good to us and responded so 
strongly yesterday 
and im just very grateful to the people of massachusetts for 
their giving me the opportunity to be their governor to be the 
democratic nominee and to share the kinds of goals and values and 
ideals that the state and this country stand for 
and again my thanks to all of you for what youve done and let 
me again express my pleasure to you for the chance ive had to get 
to know you

here is the text of 
presidentelect george bushs remarks wednesday on his arrival at 
andrews air force base outside washington 
thank you all so very much thank you so very much what a 
wonderful please be seated what a wonderful welcome back to 
washington theres so much i want to say but ill keep it 
relatively brief 
were so moved that all of you would come out today and i expect 
weve kept you waiting but i have some thoughts i want to share 
about whats happened in the past 24 hours and earlier today we 
went to a church service in houston at the church that barbara and i 
have belonged to since in the early 60s i believe 1962 and some 
of my children were confirmed there our children and barbara 
taught and barbara taught sunday school there and i was a member 
of the vestry and we read from the psalms today gave thanks sang 
some of the old songs and the pastor prayed for a world of 
righteousness and kindness of liberty and peace and i guess that 
is probably the first moment when i realized the enormity of it all 
and we forget that the whole world is watching and how could it 
not have been impressed by the peaceful beginning of what will be a 
transfer of power as the worlds oldest greatest democracy quietly 
moves on and shifts and moves on again 
and many many leaders of the western alliance have very 
generously been communicating their good will and congratulations 
and i assured them that i will do my level best to see that the 
united states does its part in keeping the alliance strong and to 
our friends and allies in the world the good policies of the last 
eight years will continue the closeness and the consultations will 
continue and after eight years of strong leadership calm 
stability dramatic progress we are open now to new progress and to 
new challenges and to those who do not yet view themselves as our 
allies well well keep on trying but do not indulge in any hopes 
that our resolve will be weakened 
were going to continue to stay strong because we truly love 
peace and were willing to pay the price for it you know just 
before landing here at andrews i received a very thoughtful 
communication from general secretary gorbachev of the soviet union 
and i conveyed to his ambassador my determination to keep this new 
important bilateral relationship moving forward governor dukakis in 
his gracious remarks last night offered to work with us to build a 
better america and we forget but thats really what its all 
about and let me tell you what i intend to do to build a better 
america 
our country these days has a hunger for harmony and i felt it at 
so many moments i felt it strongly during the campaign and so im 
going to do everything i can to have good and open and friendly 
relationships with the united states congress and i dont want us 
to talk at each other i want us to talk to each other and ive 
said during and ive said that i want a kinder and a gentler 
nation and i think theres a hunger for that too in our country 
theres so much to do to help make life better for all 
and i want to say a few words about dan quayle and yes he has 
had a baptism by fire but steel is tougher harder when its been 
tempered by the flame and we both know that weve got a lot of work 
to do sudden national fame can be tough it can be tough on your 
family we all know that all of us but let me tell you about him 
hes going to be one of the great vice presidents you watch him 
closely america because youre going to respect what you see 
and now were going down to see the president in the white house 
have a chance to discuss the future of the country and any man is 
lucky to work with a good friend but i must be the luckiest man in 
the world to have as my close friend one of the great heroes of the 
modern era ronald wilson reagan he is he is the living 
embodiment of the word patriot no man ever loved his country 
more or served her better the president and his great first lady 
will be a tough act to follow 
i know its autumn getting on to late fall but i have a sense 
of blooming a kind of sense of spring and all these new 
beginnings and a wonderful new era rich with possibilities and full 
of hope its good news and im very very happy barbara and i are 
happy and blessed to be with you here today thank you and god 
bless you and god bless the united states of america thank you

in a vote heard all the way to wall street 
californians approved a ralph nadersponsored measure to slash auto 
and other liability insurance rates 
they also narrowly gave george bush their 47 electoral votes 
returned republican pete wilson to the us senate and decisively 
rejected the most expensive initiative campaign the nation has ever 
seen 
the rejected initiative was a nofault auto insurance proposal 
which lost despite a multimilliondollar effort by the insurance 
industry 
voters approved the insurancerate measure which was sponsored 
by ralph nader and other consumer advocates by 511 percent to 489 
percent 
the measure immediately cuts all auto and other liability 
insurance rates to 80 percent of their november 1987 levels and 
freezes them for two years it also mandates additional rate cuts 
for motorists with clean driving records 
major insurers immediately filed two suits challenging the 
measure and announced they will stop writing new auto insurance 
policies in california because of it 
wall street analysts attributed wednesday declines in some 
insurance stocks to the california vote 
voters also approved a 25centapack increase in the state 
cigarette tax and a limited aids reporting initiative sponsored by 
law enforcement groups 
but they rejected by a 21 margin a much broader and more 
controversial aids reporting measure it would have required doctors 
to report all positive aids tests to public health officials and 
public health officials to try to track down all known sexual 
partners of persons who tested positive 
bush took 51 percent of the presidential vote while wilson 
defeated democrat leo mccarthy with 526 percent of the senate vote 
californias 45 congressional races produced no change in the 
current 2718 democratic majority in the states house delegation 
as every congressional incumbent on the ballot was reelected 
however the delegation will have three new faces all republicans 
replacing two republicans who retired and one who was defeated in 
the june primary

theres lots to do and many challenges out there ahead and what 
happens in the future remains to be seen 
q governor 
q would you consider it though 
q governor some people believe that the state of peace and 
prosperity and the continuity of reaganism was so strong that any 
democratic nominee would have found it almost impossible to win this 
year but i suppose this morning a lot more people believe that 
this race was winnable and that in fact you blew it now what is 
your view do you think do you think it was practically winnable 
and if so could you precisely tell us 
a i think it was neither of the above 
q all right where do you think you went wrong 
a well theyll be plenty of time for analysis sam at this 
point i just inaudible activity of being governor of my 
state again but if you look at the results i think clearly had 
things gone differently maybe a different combination of factors 
it was winnable 
i think i lost states representing about 133 electoral votes by 
four percentage points or less had we won those states wed have 
had 250 electoral votes and wed have been very close to a winning 
majority 
but every campaign has its own dynamics its own ebbs and flows 
its high points and its low points and its obviously at least for 
me too early to try to go into a detailed analysis 
i gave it my best shot and we had our good days and our 
notsogood days the last two or three weeks i hope gave people a 
good sense of who mike dukakis is and what he believes in the kind 
of leadership that hes tried to provide in the course of his 
political career and wanted to provide as president of the united 
states and im going to go on now to work with my fellow governors 
and other elected officials to do everything i can to make good on 
those ideals and those values yeah 
q governor did you wait too long to answer the negative attacks 
against you and a second part to that question does your defeat 
mean that future campaigns are going to use negative ads more 
a oh i dont think theres any question that the negativism we 
had in this campaign is something that had an impact on me and i 
hope it doesnt happen but i fear that this will be a signal now at 
the national level that this kind of campaigning is effective 
campaigning i certainly hope not 
whether or not i waited too long is something which im not sure 
im really the person to judge as many of you have heard me say 
im basically a positive person who has tried all of his political 
career to provide positive leadership i think youre elected to 
political office to do positive things and to make a real difference 
in the lives of real people 
and it was important particularly to somebody who had not been 
on the national scene that i give people a sense of what my agenda 
was what i wanted to do what my priorities were and i tried very 
hard as you recall to lay those out in great detail and i think 
we did that

nbcs election coverage featured cartoons of a 
blue elephant and a pink donkey but it was abcs and cbs early 
projections that most repulsed west coast voters 
with polls still open in 11 states first cbs and then abc 
announced tuesday night that vice president george bush didnt need 
to change his zip code 
the reaction to this quick announcement was sharply critical 
i think any person with any amount of common sense would find 
this practice revolting said voter rip rense after hearing 
network projections 90 minutes before his los angeles poll closed 
i think it is a case of tv journalists being irresponsible because 
of ratings 
based on its exitpoll surveys cbs called the presidential race 
at 917 pm est with abc following three minutes later nbc didnt 
announce its projection until 1030 pm cable news network called 
it at 1042 based on counted votes 
polls in the far west didnt close until 11 pm est and in 
alaska until midnight 
one of our neighbors is not coming to vote tonight for the 
simple matter that she saw the results on tv and said her vote 
wouldnt count said howard friedland of the los angeles suburb of 
sherman oaks 
even election analysts on abcowned station kabctv went on 
camera to express outrage over their networks behavior 
i understand it when the networks want to report the news but 
this isnt the news said conservative commentator bruce 
herschensohn theyre making the news and then reporting the 
news that they made i think its terribly unfair to the western 
states 
kabc colleague john tunney a former us senator said he was 
furious over the abc and cbs projections once again we see the 
east coast networks treating us out here in the west as though we 
dont count we count a lot 
two of the three networks admitted that their muchvaunted exit 
polls had produced faulty projections abc wrongly gave maryland to 
gov michael dukakis and cbs erroneously awarded illinois to 
dukakis cbs anchorman dan rather apologized for the significant 
error wednesday morning 
were in the news business said robert siegenthaler vice 
president of news practices at abc when we have knowledge that we 
have confidence in we are supposed to tell people that we had 
an error were assessing the factors now that caused us to make 
it 
siegenthaler also disputed the allegation that early predictions 
reduce voter turnout in western states 
nbcs tom brokaw aware that the competition had already called 
the presidential race reported with caution tuesday night well 
george bush is on the front porch now brokaw said almost an hour 
after cbs had declared bush the victor but hes not through the 
front door of the white house 
we didnt want to make a bad call said michael gartner the 
new president of nbc news being first with news is competitive 
but was it news that bush was going to win the presidency we could 
have told you that at 5 pm 
i dont mind the fact that i was third last night at all 
gartner said we have policies and we live by them we dont go 
until were sure 
network projections based on exit polling interviews with 
voters who have already cast ballots have been a controversy since 
1980 when nbc called the race for ronald reagan at 815 pm est 
under congressional pressure the networks had agreed this year 
not to project any state results until a majority of its polls had 
closed all three networks gave kentucky and indiana to bush while 
more than 10 percent of their polls were still open 
because of differing time zones the networks were able to 
announce bush the winner even as millions of voters had yet to cast 
their ballots 
the biggest single news story every four years is the exchange 
of powers and the exit polls without question are the best 
source of information for telling people what happened said 
warren mitofsky elections and survey director for cbs news what 
were trying to do is tell a news story 
mitofsky who blamed the botched illinois call on the laws of 
probability said i have never been pressured to get out a 
projection faster than my competition 
abc was so quick on the draw that it caught at least one 
candidate by surprise informed on the air by abcs peter jennings 
that he had won a seat in the us senate virginia gov charles 
robb said well its a little early to make any real post mortems 
on the race since i havent seen any real votes 
barring government action the networks are likely to dwell on 
projections in the next election the nielsen families seem to 
prefer it that way 
according to an analysis released by abc news the network called 
68 us senate gubernatorial and state presidential races first 
cbs projected 11 such races first and nbc beat the competition six 
times not coincidentally abc also had the highest overnight 
television ratings 
the ratings sample of 17 cities showed that more than 20 million 
viewers were tuned to abc from election night signon to signoff 
nbcs coverage was seen by 14 million and cbs even though it called 
the presidential race first was watched by less than 12 million 
people

where hell hold great sway over what george bush can accomplish in 
the white house 
in his fourth term bentsen will return as chairman of the senate 
finance committee which oversees tax trade and public welfare

presidentelect george bush barely pausing to savor a smashing 
election triumph began building a brand new team for his 
incoming republican administration on wednesday disappointed 
democrats found solace in gains in both houses of the congress 
bush staged a splashy flagwaving return to washington and said 
he hoped to nourish a new era rich with possibility and full of 
hope he went with vice presidentelect dan quayle to the white 
house to accept president reagans congratulations and promise of a 
smooth transition 
time for us to go to work said the outgoing president and 
the new man did 
bush made his first cabinet appointment with unusual swiftness 
naming longtime confidante james a baker iii his secretary of 
state he appointed a slate of aides to guide the transition to 
power 
the people have spoken and the verdict was clear the 
nations duly chosen leader said he won 40 states and nearly 
complete returns gave him 54 percent of the vote to 46 percent for 
democrat michael dukakis 
bush and quayle take office on jan 20 
dukakis took his final bow on the 1988 campaign stage at a news 
conference in boston he congratulated bush on his victory but said 
it was based in large measure on campaign distortions 
nonetheless he said he was not resentful but rather disappointed 
i gave it my best shot said the massachusetts governor we 
had our good days and our not so good days 
on his first full day as presidentelect bush paused to praise 
his rival 
he said he would do his best to work with the new democratic 
congress i dont want us to talk at each other i want us to talk 
to each other he said democrats hold sway in both houses of the 
new congress and by margins slightly larger than the last two years 
with a close florida race still undecided democrats could count 
on at least 55 seats in the new senate a gain of at least one 
they strengthened their command of the house as well democrats 
had at least 259 seats a gain of two from the old 100th congress 
with three races still to be decided 
bushs first cabinet appointment was surprising only in its 
swiftness baker is bushs friend political mentor and hunting pal 
and a former chief of staff and treasury secretary under reagan to 
boot 
bush shied away from claiming a mandate but of the election that 
delivered him the oval office he said i dont think it was 
overly close 
there was no disputing that 
nearly complete totals showed the vice president receiving 54 
percent of the popular vote to 46 percent for democrat dukakis and 
bush winning by a margin of nearly 7 million ballots bush won 40 
states and 426 electoral votes his rival won 10 states and the 
district of columbia for 112 electoral votes 
the inevitable democratic secondguessing had begun and 
maneuvering was clearly visible for the next campaign the dukakis 
campaign ran the worst campaign of this century said robert 
slagle chairman of the democratic party in texas where voters 
overwhelmingly snubbed the dukakisbentsen ticket 
the election was a lowturnout model of ticketsplitting 
we knew we were going to have a tough row to hoe this year 
peace and prosperity make it difficult to demonstrate a need for 
massive changes was the postmortem offered by rep guy vander 
jagt of michigan chairman of the national republican congressional 
committee 
democrats also picked up a net gain of one governors office 
but the biggest winner of course was the presidentelect and 
bush moved speedily to place his stamp on the government before 
flying home to washington aboard air force two on thursday he 
begins a long weekend of fishing on the florida atlantic coast 
bush a man who has held diplomatic political and congressional 
jobs as well as headed the cia and served eight years as vice 
president was clearly anxious to get on with the business of taking 
charge 
he described his personal feelings as somewhere between total 
exhilaration and recognition that the challenge ahead is going to be 
awesome 
dukakis told massachusetts residents he was ready to resume 
duties as their governor to his national audience he said he was 
disappointed but not bitter in the outcome of the national campaign 
but he fired off a few last salvos at the bush organization 
asked whether he thought his own record as governor had 
contributed to his defeat he interrupted and said the 
distortions of that record contributed a great deal he mentioned 
bushs use of the massachusetts prison furlough program and polluted 
boston harbor in advertisements and said republicans set a standard 
for negative campaigning that the nation may live to regret 
bushs first appointments came as no surprise 
in addition to baker bush named chief of staff craig fuller and 
pollster and senior campaign adviser bob teeter as codirectors of 
the transition 
bush discussed few specifics on policy matters in a 30minute 
question and answer session with reporters in texas although he 
said he would be holding the line on taxes 
he made that a centerpiece of his campaign and said i dont 
plan to deviate and i think the american people must have understood 
that when they picked their new president 
he also said quayle would enjoy the same access to the papers 
access to the intelligence access to the information that bush 
has had in the no 2 slot bush did not cite specific duties for 
quayle but said his vice president would meet regularly with him

michael dukakis returned to work as governor of 
massachusetts on wednesday after losing his race for the presidency 
saying he was not bitter but concerned that the campaigns negative 
tone set a standard that we will live to regret 
i gave it my best shot the democratic nominee told a news 
conference the day after he lost the election to vice president 
george bush 
dukakis whose supporters had chanted 92 the next 
presidential year when his defeat became official tuesday night 
wouldnt say if he harbored hopes of mounting another try for the 
presidency in four years 
he congratulated his republican rival for a very decisive 
victory as he had in an electionnight phone call to busht 
but dukakis said the election had delivered no mandate to the new 
president whose electoral vote total was 426 to the governors 112 
votes 
i dont see a mandate not when the house of representatives 
has increased its democratic membership and the senate has increased 
its democratic membership dukakis said 
he voiced regrets and frustraion over the negative tone of his 
opponents campaign and said distortions of his record as governor 
had contributed to his defeat 
im not a bitter person dukakis said 
am i disappointed sure i am he said 
it was a distorted campaign it was a campaign that distorted 
my record it may well have set a standard that we will live to 
regret but im not personally bitter 
i hope it doesnt happen but i fear that this will be a signal 
now at the national level that this kind of campaigning is 
effective 
dukakis referred to republican media manipulators behind 
bushs campaign but he took no issue with bushs announcement that 
his campaign chairman james baker iii would be his secretary of 
state 
i believe in the redemption of souls dukakis said 
dukakis who has two years remaining in his third term as 
governor arose the morning after his election as usual and was in 
his office at the massachusetts statehouse before 930 am 
his secret service bodyguards who have accompanied him since he 
accepted protection in early may were leaving him at the end of the 
day he could have kept them for another week to 10 days but chose 
not to 
the everserious governor drew chuckles from his news conference 
audience when he said he and his wife kitty would probably take 
the weekend off 
he said he may take a vacation in a few weeks with that already 
in mind his wife presented him with a book on hawaii shortly before 
the election 
at his campaigns national headquarters in boston only a few 
tearyeyed workers had bothered to come by wednesday afternoon some 
television sets and furniture already were being removed and some 
staffers were making deals to buy the personal computers they had 
used during the campaign 
dukakis avoided any detailed analysis of the reasons behind his 
loss but he refused to accept a reporters suggestion that the 
democrats had been destined to lose because the public satisfaction 
with their general prosperity under a republican president 
i think clearly had things gone differently it was 
winnable dukakis said 
he acknowledged that democratic presidential candidates must do 
better in attracting support in the south and west which have 
become republican bastions even though they elect democrats at the 
state level

im not sure we got through as rapidly as i might have liked 
given the nature of the campaign that the republicans were 
conducting but as you recall i tried to lay out in great detail my 
plans for our economy for jobs for education for drugs for 
housing and health care for the environment all of the things 
that are important to the people of this country and that the next 
president of the united states must provide leadership on 
and i think had i failed to do that then the last two or three 
weeks when clearly we were making substantial progress would have 
been impossible because had i been saying to the american people 
at that time im on your side without having laid out a positive 
agenda which gave them a sense of what that meant then the last two 
or three weeks would not have been as effective as i think they 
were so thats what i tried to do and obviously the other guy 
won yes joe 
q governor to follow up on that youve called this the most 
negative campaign that you can recall full of lies the man who 
directed that campaign was named by mr bush today to be his 
secretary 
a i beg your pardon 
q the man who directed the campaign james baker that you 
called the sleaziest campaign that you can remember was named today 
by mr bush to be his secretary of state 
a uhhum 
q what does that say whats your reaction to that 
a i believe in the redemption of souls joe yes bill 
q even republican souls 
q if i could follow up on that youre very conciliatory today 
but during the campaign you made some very serious charges against 
the vice president you said that he was a liar distorted your 
record you said his campaign had elements of racism was that 
campaign rhetoric on your part or did you really mean it and if you 
really meant it what would you say now to your supporters about how 
they should regard the new president 
a well as a democrat obviously we have a responsibility to 
work with the administration after all mr bush will be our 
president and will be our president for four years 
on the other hand theres a responsible opposition we will have 
a responsibility to be constructively critical i hope we can keep 
it constructively critical this country faces major challenges over 
the course of the next four years debt deficits tough economic 
competition serious environmental problems that affect not only 
ourselves but the world major opportunities and challenges 
internationally and theyre too important to be lost in a lot of 
partisan bickering 
so i hope both sides will do everything they can to work together 
on a progressive agenda for this country certainly mr bush in 
the course of the campaign indicated that he was prepared to break 
with the outgoing administration on a number of areas id like to 
think that the campaign had something to do with that and that he 
recognizes that the education of our children the child care the 
quality of our environment that early childhood education these 
things which he began talking about in the campaign are very 
important to the future of our country and to its families and if 
that happens and we get a good constructive agenda in which both 
the administration and the congress are working together then the 
campaign will have been worth it 
i certainly hope thats the direction in which we move because 
theres just too much to do to let this opportunity be lost in a lot 
of partisan bickering yes 
q governor given the last three weeks when you were not in 
boston do you think maybe that its too difficult or you spent too 
much time back being governor its too difficult for a sitting 
governor to run an effective campaign against a sitting vice 
president 
a well i hope not tom ive been asked this in the past and 
ive often said that i think it would be a tragedy if one either had 
to be unemployed or hold an office and i dont mean this in any 
way to belittle the vice presidency but to hold an office which 
doesnt have any statutory responsibility and i mean that 
you know if thats the only way you can run for the presidency 
then i think our system is in deep trouble no question that as a 
sitting governor i could bring both strengths and some liabilities 
to this because as you all know certain things which i had not 
been a candidate for the presidency would not have been magnified 
anywhere near as much as they were 
it took on new dimensions and new life i consider it one of my 
greatest achievements one of my legislatures greatest 
achievements the cleanup of boston harbor which has been under way 
for four years and yet in the hands of some very skillful media 
manipulators if i may use that term it became a liability similar 
kinds of things and that goes with the territory if youre a 
sitting governor and you have ongoing responsibilities i certainly 
hope that it will be possible for sitting governors and sitting 
senators and sitting members of congress to run for this office and 
i think it would be a tragedy if they couldnt 
yes robin

corn production is expected to total 467 
billion bushels this year 3 percent above last months forecast but 
still a drop of 34 percent from the 1987 crop the agriculture 
department said wednesday 
as farmers struggled to bring the last of the corn out of the 
fields the falloff in production reflected last summers fierce 
drought 
the searing heat and lack of rain was reflected in an average 
yield per acre of 832 bushels for corn forecast by usdas 
agricultural statistics board that was down 371 bushels from last 
year but 21 bushels above the level contained in last months 
forecast 
the harvest was the smallest since 1983 when another drought 
lowered output to 417 billion bushels the record was 888 billion 
bushels in 1985 
as of nov 1 farmers had harvested an estimated 83 percent of 
this falls corn acreage 7 percent behind last year but still 16 
percent ahead of the 198387 average the agricultural statistics 
board said 
only 63 percent of the corn is normally harvested by now 
this year farmers cut back to a little over 567 million acres 
for corn harvest from 591 million in 1987 one reason is 
participation by farmers in government programs designed to take 
acreage out of production and thus prevent surpluses that drive down 
crop prices 
despite the drought the agriculture department is forecasting an 
adequate supply of corn next year largely because of an abundant 
existing stockpile 
according to usda economists the drought is likely to add 1 
percent to the consumer price index for food this year and 2 percent 
next year as the impact of the reduced crop is passed through to the 
market 
officials said the all crops production index as of nov 1 
averaged 87 percent of the base year of 1977 down dramatically from 
106 percent at the same time last year and the lowest level in 10 
years 
the index reached a record of 117 percent in 1981 and 1982 as 
well as 1985 before dropping to 88 percent in 1983 when drought and 
government acreage cutbacks lowered production it rose to 111 
percent the following year 
soybean production was forecast at 151 billion bushels up 1 
percent from last months level but 21 percent below last years 
harvest of 192 billion bushels the record was 226 billion bushels 
in 1979 
the cotton harvest was estimated at 148 million bales 1 percent 
above both the 1987 crop and the oct 1 forecast the record was 
1895 million bales in 1937 
with the harvest of 1988 crops winding down no new production 
figures were included for many earlier commodities such as wheat 
oats and barley 
other crops in the november production report included 
sorghum 5463 million bushels and 606 bushels per acre 
compared with 7408 million and 699 bushels per acre last year 
rice 1584 million hundredweight and 5547 pounds per acre 
against 1277 million and 5482 pounds last year 
peanuts 412 billion pounds and 2507 pounds per acre compared 
with 362 billion pounds and 2341 pounds per acre last year 
tobacco 133 billion pounds and 2114 pounds per acre against 
119 billion pounds and 2028 pounds per acre last year 
fall potatoes 309 million hundredweight and 292 hundredweight 
per acre compared with 119 million hundredweight and 2028 
hundredweight per acre

members of gov michael dukakiss own party are 
planning what could be a rude welcome home to massachusetts next 
week legislative oversight hearings on the state budget 
politicians of both parties agree dukakis will have to pay 
attention to the states worsening fiscal condition when he returns 
to work at the statehouse 
the slowdown in state tax collections which democrats were 
willing to overlook during the presidential campaign will take 
center stage next monday when the house ways and means committee 
begins examining the books on the states 116 billion budget 
mike dukakis will be crippled said state sen david locke 
the assistant leader of the 20 percent republican minority in the 
state senate 
most democrats however refused to go that far in assessing the 
damage inflicted on dukakis by his failed presidential campaign 
its going to be unpleasant state rep william galvin a 
boston democrat who is part of the house leadership said of 
dukakis return to the statehouse 
even before tuesdays voting speculation was rampant in the 
statehouse hallways about dukakis future in massachusetts two 
years remain in his gubernatorial term and dukakis said nothing 
wednesday at a press conference to clarify his plans out of production 
and thus prevent surpluses that drive down 
crop prices

george bush and dan quayle americas new white 
house team come january were reunited wednesday at a starspangled 
airport reception then were told by president reagan that their 
victory means our achievements are secure 
reagan in an emotional salute to his republican successor 
declared that to those who sometimes flatter me with talk of a 
reagan revolution today my hope is this you aint seen nothin 
yet 
bush earlier had revealed that he planned wholesale replacements 
of reagans government appointees starting with james a baker iii 
his campaign chairman as the new secretary of state but that has 
nothing to do with satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the way 
anybody currently is doing his job bush said it has a lot to 
do with reinvorating the process 
the presidentelect addressing a cheering crowd at andrews air 
force base upon his return to washington extended a conciliatory 
hand to congress and also vowed to build on reagans openings with 
the soviet union he disclosed he had received a congratulatory 
message from soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev and had 
returned an equally warm reply through the soviet ambassador in 
hopes that we can keep this new bilateral relationship moving 
ahead 
at the white house reagan told bush and quayle how proud i 
am of both of you for the extraordinary grit and character youve 
shown with george bush and dan quayle i feel our achievements 
are secure 
bush replied that all i will say in the shadow of the office 
that youve ennobled is that were very very grateful to you 
and nancy for going that extra mile i really believe the results 
would have been entirely different if we hadnt had that steadfast 
campaign support 
and i know they would if i hadnt learned from a giant said 
bush 
with more than 5000 people packed into a hangar at the air base 
in suburban maryland and another 3000 to 4000 outside a band 
struck up hail to the chief as the nose of air force two a 
boeing 707 poked into the open end of the hangar 
as the invited guests on the military base roared with cheers 
first bush and then his wife barbara emerged at the top of the 
stairs they were followed immediately by quayle and his wife 
marilyn who had been picked up on the tarmac for delivery to their 
admirers 
it was bushs first meeting with quayle since the pair in 
separate cities watched as americas voters gave them an 
overwhelming victory tuesday against their democratic opponents 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen 
bush said he hopes that americas adversaries do not indulge in 
any hopes that our resolve will be weakened because we will continue 
to be strong and we will pay the price for it 
bush also had kind words for the vanquished dukakis noting that 
in his gracious comments that dukakis had offered to help build 
a better america and thats what its all about 
he reiterated that he is determined to mend relations with the 
democraticcontrolled congress saying i dont want us to talk at 
each other i want to talk to each other 
turning in quayles direction he declared his controversial 
running mate is going to be one of the great vice presidents you 
watch him closely 
speaking with reporters on air force two on the way to washington 
from houston bush said he would make a series of cabinet 
appointments in a couple of weeks before leaving houston he 
named baker to replace george shultz at the state department and 
to get the whole process off on the right foot 
it will send a reassuring message people will wonder about 
change its nice to send a stabilizing signal around the world 
he said 
bush said that he wanted to name his cabinet sooner rather than 
way late and would think about some of the choices this weekend 
while fishing in florida 
the vice president said he had received congratulatory calls on 
wednesday from british prime minister margaret thatcher west german 
chancellor helmut kohl saudi arabias king fahd and from sen sam 
nunn the democratic chairman of the senate armed services committee 
on the subject of his transition bush said our job will be a 
lot easier than the 80 transition you dont have to send teams out 
to every agency im not going to do that i know enough about how 
the government works 
in houston bush told his first postelection news conference 
that his emotions were somewhere in between total exhilaration and a 
recognition that the challenge ahead is going to be awesome 
bush said he did not intend to underestimate the challenge and 
the seriousness that takes over right this minute 
bush said his selection of baker a houston lawyer whose 
friendship with bush dates back to the 1960s had been personally 
endorsed by shultz 
in other personnel announcements bush also said his current 
chiefofstaff craig fuller and campaign pollster and strategist 
robert teeter would head his transition team 
however bush said president reagan is still the president of 
the united states and i will not be using the transition to try to 
make or unduly influence decisions that are properly the 
presidents 
he also said 
he is confident the soviet union will not abandon its commitment 
to withdraw forces from afghanistan however he said that if moscow 
went back on its word that would throw a complicating factor over 
the whole relationship between the superpowers 
us aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua will have a high 
priority because freedom and democracy in this hemisphere has a high 
priority 
he will give dan quayle his incoming vice president the same 
access he enjoyed to intelligence documents and other papers that go 
to the oval office bush said i havent formulated in detail 
what quayles role will be but that it is essential that the vice 
president be up to speed on every sensitive matter involving the 
government lest something happen to the president

q governor 
a just members of the working class 
q what do you think is the first problem mr bush is going to 
have to deal with as president 
a the federal budget deficit clearly it pervades everything 
we do will have a crucial impact on our ability to build a strong 
economic future to turn that trade deficit around and turn it into 
a trade surplus to create economic opportunity on a very strong 
base in this country 
and that will take a very strong bipartisan effort because it is 
so important and is absolutely fundamental if we cant get that 
deficit down and keep borrowing 150 160 billion a year and that 
continues indefinitely then this countrys economic future is going 
to be seriously jeopardized yes ken 
q governor the democratic partys going to be selecting a new 
chairman to replace paul kirk who you supported four years ago do 
you know who youll support at this point 
a no i dont but i expect to be involved and participate along 
with many of the party leaders and to do the very best we can not 
only to build on the progress we made over the course of the past 
four years under pauls leadership and we made enormous progress 
but to continue to build a strong consensus within the party 
i said back at convention time ken that i thought we had a 
party which was more unified than it had ever been before and i 
believe thats the case its important that that continue 
there are some differences on issues but by and large i think 
there is a very broad consensus within the democratic party and i 
would hope that that would continue and ill do everything i can to 
try to provide whatever leadership i can to make that happen yes 
q you fared better than either of the last two democratic 
nominees but both candidates lost whole regions of the country the 
south and most of the west what lessons do you draw from this and 
what lessons should the party draw from this in the future 
a well obviously i didnt do as good a job as i should have 
done in reaching out to those regions we did better in the west as 
you know in the far west almost took colorado thats the first 
time thats happened in a long time 
and we did better in the western states obviously didnt do well 
in the south i think my values the things i care deeply about are 
things that people in the south care deeply about and theyve 
demonstrated that on many occasions by electing strong progressive 
democrats as governors and as members of the senate and the congress 
but i wasnt successful in getting my message through in the 
south and in some parts of the west the fact however that these 
regions continue to vote for progressive democratic governors and 
members of the congress and state and county and local officials 
tells me that these values and these hopes and aspirations for the 
country are felt as strongly in the south and the west as they are 
in other parts of the country 
now how the democratic nominee for president conveys that sense 
is something which obviously is going to require us to spend a lot 
more time working at obviously i didnt do it as well as i should 
have

presidentelect george bush picked james a baker 
iii a reagan administration stalwart as his secretary of state on 
wednesday but at the same time pledged a major turnover of 
personnel to reinvigorate the government 
moving with unusual speed barely 11 hours after claiming victory 
bush announced a handful of key appointments headed by the 
nomination of longtime ally baker at state secretary of state 
george p shultz enthusiastically endorsed bakers selection 
hes big shoes to fill bush said of shultz but well get 
the job done 
craig fuller bushs vice presidential chief of staff and 
campaign pollster robert teeter will share authority as cochairmen 
of the transition team that will plan the takeover of power from 
reagan 
in a declaration sure to send shudders through the ranks of the 
5000 political appointees happily at work in the reagan 
administration bush said i will for the most part bring in a 
brand new team of people from across the country 
and in my view that will reinvigorate the process bush said 
however he carefully left room for some reagan holdovers and 
veterans to join his administration there will be a major 
turnover but some people at various levels may be asked to remain 
returning to washington aboard air force two bush said he 
announced bakers appointment wednesday less than 12 hours after 
declaring victory to get the whole process off on the right foot 
it will send a reassuring message he said 
the presidentelect said he wanted to announce the rest of his 
cabinet sooner rather than way late and would think about the 
possible choices during a florida vacation this weekend 
it is widely assumed bush will ask treasury secretary nicholas 
brady attorney general dick thornburgh and education secretary 
lauro cavazos to stay on all three joined the reagan administration 
in recent months 
thornburgh said wednesday that he had been given no indication of 
whether bush wanted him to remain nor have i sought any 
information on the question 
the washington post reported that bush wanted to replace 
thornburgh with former environmental protection agency chief william 
ruckelshaus or illinois gov james thompson thompson said wednesday 
that he wasnt interested 
former sen john tower of texas an arms negotiator in the reagan 
administration who later advised bushs campaign on national 
security matters is expected to be in line for secretary of defense 
ann dore mclaughlin may keep her post as labor secretary or get 
another cabinet position possibly interior where she was 
undersecretary from 1984 to 1987 
others mentioned as possible nominees for the labor post include 
rep tom ridge rpa and constance horner now director of the 
office of personnel management 
former transportation secretary elizabeth dole wife of onetime 
bush rival bob dole also is mentioned as a candidate for another 
cabinet job 
for the powerful post of budget chief the odds on favorite is 
richard darman a onetime senior aide in the reagan white house and 
later deputy secretary of treasury 
darmans name also has been mentioned as the new white house 
chief of staff although fuller and new hampshire gov john sununu 
are more frequently discussed for that job sununu also is a 
candidate to be secretary of energy 
richard burt ambassador to west germany is known to be 
interested in the job of national security adviser at the white 
house brent scowcroft who served in that role for president ford 
is mentioned for it again 
bush has 73 days to fill his cabinet make other key appointments 
and determine the policy priorities to help him make a mark in the 
critical first 100 days of a new administration 
i will have a game plan bush promised part of what the 
transition is about is to spell out the priorities i spelled them 
out in broad terms in terms of keeping the economic expansion going 
and in terms of world peace but the election ended yesterday 
now he said he will have to get specific 
over the next 2 months power will begin to shift from reagan to 
bush as the federal bureaucracy and foreign governments look to the 
incoming president for a signal of his intentions 
however bush said president reagan is still the president of 
the united states and i will not be using the transition to try to 
make or unduly influence decisions that are properly the 
presidents 
policy matters aside bush indicated his management style will be 
different from reagans for example he said he will be briefed 
directly every day by the cia on intelligence matters instead of 
relying on the white house national security adviser for an update 
as reagan had 
bushs intention to put baker at state had been a poorly kept 
secret for months the two men have longstanding personal and 
political ties dating back to their years in texas more than two 
decades ago 
baker resigned his position at treasury this year to run bushs 
presidential campaign the same job he held eight years ago when 
bush ran unsuccessfully against reagan 
in addition to preparing to take over from shultz baker also 
will have a big hand in the transition decisions given the respect 
he commands with bush baker may be the key player 
bush also announced that boyden gray his legal adviser in the 
vice presidents office will serve the same role in the transition 
and then go on to the white house as his general counsel 
chase untermeyer former assistant secretary of the navy who has 
been a oneman transition planner for bush will be the transitions 
chief personnel headhunter and keep the same job in the white house 
come jan 20 sheila tate who has been the campaign press 
secretary will serve in the same capacity during the transition 
bush did not mention whether she would have that title in the white 
house and some gop sources close to the campaign indicate someone 
else may get the job 
altogether there are 5000 political appointments divided 
between presidential appointments and those made by cabinet 
secretaries and agency heads 
many of the 3000 or so presidential appointments do not really 
draw the attention of the chief executive and are handled by others 
even though bush put washington on notice to expect a house 
cleaning of personnel untermeyer described the transition as a 
friendly takeover 
on that basis bush said he anticipated a somewhat leaner 
transition organization than we had in 1980 when the reagan team 
including volunteers swelled to 1500

the united states has the bald eagle and 
the rose as national symbols tree lovers want a national tree 
the international society of arboriculture has launched a 
nationwide search for a tree lofty enough to represent the whole 
country and is open to suggestions says harry j banker chairman 
of the societys national tree committee 
banker doesnt expect the search to be easy i hope i havent 
bitten off more than i can chew says the 75yearold west orange 
resident you know how many suggestions i might get i think 
plenty 
it took 75 years and 70 bills before the rose was adopted as the 
national flower in 1986 he said 
fortunately the bird emblem was approved way back in 1782 
he said but since that time youd be surprised some have even 
come up with the wild turkey as a more appropriate emblem 
banker said the tree would have to be one that is found around 
the country to gain national acceptance adding the oak may meet 
such a qualification but he expects regional entries like the new 
england sugar maple and the california redwood and sequoia 
a move like this will focus the attention of mr and mrs 
america on the importance of conserving this very important national 
resource he said

an african ground hornbill is back in 
captivity and the louisville zoo believes that luck not love 
ended his freedom 
the 5yearold bird flew the coop on monday morning leaving his 
mate violet he returned tuesday after spending the night in some 
nearby woods 
zoo curator john keeley said he didnt know if he came back 
because of violet whether he was familiar with the area and wanted 
to get back to the exhibit or if our catching him was just dumb 
luck 
keeler and his staff cornered the bird valued at 1500 in the 
tall weeds along the zoo fence 
about two feet tall with black wings trimmed in white a bright 
orange face and a beak thats eight inches long the hornbill had 
nested at the zoo since last june 
keeley said violet didnt seem to mind her mates absence she 
didnt pace the yard or seem upset that he left at all 
he said the zoo had noted some courtship activity with the bird 
making ostentatious displays and carrying twigs to violet 
theres even been some rudimentary nestbuilding keeley 
said so we dont know exactly what their problem is

two former lawmen acquitted on civil 
rights violations in the death of a black jail inmate have filed a 
6 million lawsuit claiming two trial witnesses and two lawyers 
concocted the case against them 
in a maliciousprosecution lawsuit former sabine county 
sheriffs deputies james bo hyden and william horton accuse 
attorneys morris dees and j richard cohen of the alabamabased 
southern poverty law center of embarking on a scheme to prosecute 
the men to amass a larger fortune by destroying the mens lives 
and reputation 
they also contend two former jail inmates who testified at the 
deputies trial last summer joined in the alleged scheme 
it is the latest round of litigation stemming from the dec 27 
death of loyal garner jr a truck driver from florien la the law 
center will represent garners family in a federal civil lawsuit 
scheduled to go to trial in april dees said 
dees denied the accusations in the deputies action 
its a frivolous suit he said wednesday its the craziest 
suit ive ever seen 
hyden horton and thomas ladner former hemphill police chief 
were acquitted of civil rights violations charges last july in 
garners death 
during the trial ladner admitted striking garner jailed 
christmas night on suspicion of drunken driving on the head with a 
slapstick 
the deputies lawsuit which seeks 2 million in actual damages 
and 1 million in punitive damages for each plaintiff was filed 
late last month in the state court in sabine county 
dees and cohen represented garners family and helped press for 
prosecution in the case 
the deputies suit claims dees and cohen wrested control from 
the lawfully elected district attorney of sabine county and 
appointed their own agent and servant john hannah to not only 
prosecute the sabine county criminal action but to use his position 
to publicly destroy the plaintiffs 
hannah is a former us attorney who was appointed special 
prosecutor for the trial 
dees said the law center had nothing to do with the criminal 
prosecution it was garners family who wanted hannah and his 
appointment was approved by the presiding judge he said 
the suit also alleges that dees and cohen are continuing to 
pressure the smith county district attorney to pursue murder charges 
against the three men although a state appeals court ruled earlier 
this fall that the trial would represent double jeopardy garner 
died in a hospital in smith county 
the lawsuit also accuses the defendants of inexcusable 
conduct that ended in a fundraising letter the law center mailed 
to many people in texas 
in only slightly veiled language the mailing compared hyden 
and horton to the ku klux klan and implied that all southern white 
people were racist and based on this hate mail they requested the 
recipient to send in money to the southern poverty law center

yes 
q governor when you ran inaudible a number of the issues that 
you put out in front were in the campaign for some time on balance 
now do you believe that your record is what contributed heavily to 
your defeat 
a i think the distortion of my record contributed a great deal 
to the defeat sure i mean you know the use of the willie horton 
case which i have described i think correctly as being a very 
cynical and hypocritical use of that particular case was one 
the attempt to turn what ive called one of our great 
achievements and that is the cleanup of boston harbor into a 
liability is another and i could go on but that goes with the 
territory 
and i dont think theres any question that the fact that i am a 
sitting governor of a state that has been successful and that all 
my political career ive stood for the kinds of things that ive 
talked about in the course of the campaign i think was a plus 
some 40 million plus people voted for that record and voted for 
that agenda and i think thats more than has voted for a democratic 
candidate in a long time 
q governor 
a so in that sense we did get through but almost doesnt 
count in politics either you win 
q governor 
a or you dont yes 
q governor could you just take a minute to describe what you 
see as george bushs mandate 
a i dont see a mandate not when the house of representatives 
has increased its democratic membership and the senate has increased 
its democratic membership 
i think what the american people are saying is that they want 
continuity but they also want a government in washington that will 
be an activist government will respond to their concerns about 
jobs about the quality of the education of their children about 
child care about drugs about the environment about the things 
that the american people care very deeply about and while they may 
have expressed a desire to have some continuity in the presidency i 
dont think you can look at those results on the congressional side 
and not conclude that theyre also expressing some very strong 
progressive feelings about what this country has to do and that 
they want a government in washington which is on their side when it 
comes to dealing with these problems 
the challenge will be for the new president and the 
administration and the congress to work together to meet that 
agenda and i hope they will do so and obviously i will do whatever 
i can to help move that agenda along yes 
q governor jesse jackson has said that he wants the party 
that the lesson of the election is that the party has to move to the 
left and reach for the liberal agenda and embrace it there are a 
number of southerners particularly who are saying the party has to 
move to the right has to move to the center where do you fit with 
this and do you believe well do you believe sir that a liberal 
democrat can win the white house at this point 
a i dont believe its a matter of right or left i think its a 
question of a democratic party thats responding strongly and 
forcefully and effectively to the concerns of average americans

diplomats said wednesday they were not surprised by 
presidentelect george bushs choice of james a baker iii as 
secretary of state in the next administration and welcomed baker as 
a hardworking professional 
foreign officials and especially diplomats rarely like to comment 
publicly on the internal affairs of another country but in 
offtherecord remarks diplomatic sources gave good marks to baker 
he has contacts and experience and i think he is a good 
choice said a west german diplomatic source in bonn who spoke on 
condition his name not be used 
a spokesman for west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher said the minister had no comment however genscher earlier 
expressed confidence in bushs abilities in foreign affairs and 
expressed hope that the united states would continue its 
rapproachment and disarmament efforts with the soviet union 
its not a surprise a french diplomat said of bakers 
appointment it was launched during the campaign i think he is 
part of a group of people in washington who are very 
professional 
israel expressed a similar attitude in a statement from its 
foreign ministry we believe that the new president together with 
the future secretary of state will play an active role in the 
middle east and we are looking forward to working with the new 
american leadership in full cooperation 
baker a former treasury secretary is perhaps better known in 
the worlds finance ministries than in the foreign ministries and a 
common view among those interviewed was wait and see 
we dont know the state of his knowledge said the french 
source noting that many foreign affairs professionals have not met 
baker 
baker 58 spent the first four years of the reagan 
administration as white house chief of staff before switching to the 
treasury department in august he took over as chairman of bushs 
presidential campaign 
we look forward to working with the new administration said 
a british foreign office official who by custom is not identified 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe knows mr baker well he 
is a wellrespected and wellknown figure 
the soviet union had no immediate comment the official soviet 
news agency tass announced the news in a dispatch from washington 
noting that bush said at a news conference that one of bakers first 
tasks will be to meet with his nato colleagues and then with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
in asia thai government spokesman suvit yodmani said of baker 
we welcome him to the new republican administration and believe he 
will continue a foreign policy inherited from president reagan 
on the other hand yodmani said the bush government will be 
facing tremendous pressure from the democratdominated congress to 
push protectionist legislation which the thais and other asian 
countries fear 
mexican writer carlos fuentes in an otherwise unflattering 
analysis of the american election described baker as the 
strongman of american politics 
this man extremely able with a clear intelligence manipulator 
and machiavellian surrounded by a brilliant group of young 
politicians is james baker fuentes wrote

voter turnout in tuesdays election was the 
lowest since 1924 because the electorate felt little enthusiasm for 
either presidential candidate and decided the rational choice 
was to stay home a political researcher said wednesday 
the american people will vote if they have something to vote 
about curtis gans director of the committee for the study of the 
american electorate a nonpartisan research and public policy 
organization said 
but in george bush and michael dukakis the us electorate found 
nothing to motivate them toward the polls gans said 
we had an unprecedented number of voters who said they didnt 
like either candidate not voting he said became a rational 
act 
by the time the counting ended for the day wednesday the 
unofficial total presidential vote was 88962851 with 487 of 
184660 precincts yet to report final figures the census bureau 
estimated there were about 182628000 americans of voting age 
which would mean a turnout of about 48 percent 
i think the final voter turnout will end up right about at 50 
percent when uncounted and absentee ballots are included gans 
said that would be lowest turnout since 1924 when between 48 
percent and 49 percent of the eligible voters went to the polls 
the turnout is down in every state of the union and the 
district of columbia with the exception of nevada and new 
hampshire gans said its conceivable that by the time final 
totals are in that nebraska and colorado may be up but if they are 
up they are up marginally 
gans said the turnout in 1948 was 511 percent and there was a 
steady decline thereafter until 1980 when 526 percent of the 
eligible electorate cast ballots in 1984 the number was 531 
percent 
theres been a decline of some 20 percent since the 1960 
election gans said there was a sharp slide between this year 
and 1984 and there was also a slide between 1968 and 1972 
the 1988 race was a horrible election in a variety of ways 
gans said and the people responded accordingly 
the low turnout was caused by a variety of factors but the 
primary reason was the conduct of the candidates the coverage of 
the campaign and the use of television advertising he said 
one candidate refused to say anything about anything but 
competence and good jobs for good wages and then refused to defend 
the core values of his party gans said the other candidate 
nominated dan quayle and then engaged in fairly low forms of 
demagogy without offering reasons for people to vote 
he blamed political and television consultants who ran the 
campaigns and reduced the flow of information to sevensecond 
sound bites and to television commercials substituting for 
debate 
the conduct of our campaigns has increasingly been put in the 
hands of irresponsible political consultants he said 
gans faulted the media for making polling a driving force in 
the campaign and then writing off whole regions of the country 
for one candidate this he said discouraged vast numbers of 
voters from going to the ballot box 
he also criticized television networks for projecting the 
eventual winner before polls close on the west coast 
right now the west coast states have by far and away the lowest 
turnout but final figures were not in said gans

the government by itself cant do it alone but i think the 
american people want a government in washington which does respond 
to their concerns that works with communities that works with 
states but that above all deals with some fundamental fiscal 
problems that we face in this country and that are not going to go 
away and some very fundamental concerns that average americans 
their families their communities have and will continue to have 
and ive laid those out in some detail 
the democratic leadership council for example proposed a rather 
creative plan for youth service in this country something that i 
think ought to be explored is that liberal or conservative is it 
right or left i dont know but its a very ambitious proposal to 
involve young people in public service in this country something 
which i talked about yesterday and which i think is extremely 
important to the future of this country 
i suppose if you asked them theyd say that they are more 
moderate than some others but thats a very ambitious very 
creative a very important proposal those are the kinds of things i 
think our party ought to stand for that well stand for and i see 
a lot of agreement within the party yes 
q governor if another democratic politician who was trying to 
run in 1992 came to you for advice what advice would you give him 
that if you had understood it when you started out it might have 
been different 
a what do i say to that young man outside of philadelphia smile 
a lot and respond somewhat more quickly to attacks against you 
look theres no question of the negative campaigning first and 
i had hoped that it would be possible to run a good strong 
positive campaign without having to take up a lot of time 
responding to those kinds of attacks but one of the lessons of 
this campaign is that you have to respond you have to respond 
quickly that may mean that you have greater difficulty defining 
yourself and why youre running the kind of positive agenda that 
you want to put forth but certainly given my experience this time 
i think it means that you do have to deal with those kinds of 
attacks and have to call them for what they are which in this 
case were distorted and oftentimes absolutely false yes 
q governor some of your staffers have said if only you had had 
more time you could have pulled yourself out do you believe that 
and if so why didnt you start campaigning the way you did at the 
end a little earlier 
a if i had more time youd all be in the hospital and i 
certainly wasnt going to do that

a you know there has to be a conclusion to every race and 
theres a pace to it and theres a bell lap and that bell lap is a 
lap but i wouldnt have done that to you guys i mean i think too 
much of you to do that yes ed 
q governor once again the democrats have carried the vast 
majority of black and other minority votes but lost the election 
rather decisively why do you think that is and what do you think 
it is the party has to do the party and its next nominee has to do 
to reach out to those white people who seem to have abandoned it 
permanently 
a well i tried very hard myself to do that and i dont think 
its a matter of race a good job at a good wage is something that 
is important to every family in this country 
good schools for our children in every community drugfree 
schools theyre important to every family i think these are 
unifying issues now for whatever reason i think in part because 
of the nature of the republican campaign i wasnt able to do that 
as effectively as i should have but i think its important to 
remember that all over this country yesterday democratic candidates 
for the united states senate democratic candidates for governor 
democratic candidates for the congress did that and did it in a way 
which has now produced even greater democratic majorities in the 
face of a very decisive republican victory for the presidency what 
does that tell you 
well i think it tells you two things that if you are able to 
get that agenda and deliver your message directly to the people that 
youre seeking to represent that they will respond in a very broad 
and very strong way ive had that experience here in this state 
its obviously a lot more difficult when youre running as a 
national candidate and that may be one of the reasons why we 
continue to win and win solidly at the state level all over the 
country and yet have had such a difficult time winning nationally 
now the fact that i did get the vote that i did the fact that the 
margin of defeat was a lot smaller this time than the last time 
all of those things i think are signs of hope for the future but 
it is clear i think that in these national campaigns well have 
to do a better job of making the point that these are issues which 
bring us together as a country and do the kind of job that 
candidates for the senate and governor are doing in states all over 
america yes bob 
q can you compare your thoughts today governor with 1978 the 
result yesterday may have been a little less surprising than in 78 
on the other hand there was more riding on it 
a its a very different i have very different feelings bob 
and a very different reaction am i disappointed of course i am 
this is the most important political office in the world ive 
just spent 20 months of my life with my family and with hundreds of 
thousands of terrific people working hard to win and im 
disappointed theyre disappointed a lot of people in this country 
are disappointed 
but as youll recall because you were there at the beginning i 
said this was a very very long shot im proud of what weve done 
and im proud of the nomination we won im proud of the support 
that we developed proud of this grassroots organization which in 
many cases is going to be a lasting legacy of this campaign 
the fact that we were able in a remarkable way to raise the 
financial resources we had to raise by a broadbased effort which i 
think at last count involves some 325000 individual contributors 
and these are all going to be things that will stand our party in 
very good stead in the future but this is a very different 
experience from 1978 let me take let me take one last question 
yeah 
q governor in light of the outcome do you feel any sense of 
personal bitterness about the negative tone of the campaign and 
what you call the lies and distortions 
a im not a bitter person i look forward im fundamentally an 
optimist and somebody who believes deeply in this country and in its 
people 
am i disappointed sure i am it was a distorted campaign it was 
a campaign that distorted my record and i think did not set high 
standards for the kind of campaign we wanted for the presidency and 
may well set a standard that we live to regret 
but im not personally bitter the election was yesterday we 
have much to do i believe in this country i had we had wonderful 
experiences all over the country we met terrific people who are 
making a contribution to their communities and states and country 
every day and after we catch our breath a little bit and get back 
in the routine of living at home and in our community and going to 
work every day as governor of massachusetts ill be in the thick of 
the fight and doing everything i can to make sure that we respond to 
the real concerns of the people of this country 
and i will do that as i generally do with optimism with 
enthusiasm and with great faith in this country and in its people 
thank you all very much

kasdi merbah the new premier formed a 
government wednesday as part of a shakeup prompted by rioting last 
month that killed at least 176 people 
in a referendum nov 3 algerians overwhelmingly approved 
constitutional changes designed to reduce the power of the national 
liberation front the only legal political party in this north 
african nation of 25 million people since independendence from 
france in 1962 
some of those changes give the premier expanded powers and make 
him responsible to parliament rather than president chadli 
bendjedid who appointed merbah after the referendum 
his cabinet includes 12 new ministers and 10 from the previous 
government four holdover ministers keep the same jobs 
the new governments tasks will be to implement reforms approved 
in the referendum and find solutions to economic problems caused 
largely by the dramatic decline in the price of oil algerias 
principal export 
merbahs new ministers are university professors technocrats and 
businessmen apparently chosen for their skills rather than political 
reasons 
boualem bessaieh a career diplomat and former culture minister 
becomes foreign minister in place of ahmed taleb ibrahimi who is 
not in the new government 
aboubakr belkaid a professor who had been minister for higher 
education is the new interior minister replacing hedi khediri who 
moves to transportation 
algerians went into the streets last month to protest a declining 
standard of living inflation unemployment and food shortages 
demonstrations in algiers and provincial cities turned violent and 
soldiers moved in 
officials said 176 people were killed in six days but unofficial 
counts put the toll at 400 or more 
bendjedid promised economic and political reforms which began 
with the referendum

president reagan pledged on wednesday a smooth 
transition to the administration of presidentelect george bush and 
urged americans to put behind us the divisions and controversies 
of the election campaign 
at a rose garden welcome for bush and his running mate dan quayle 
and their wives reagan complimented the two men and their defeated 
opponents democrats michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen on their 
campaigns 
i want to congratulate both of you as well as governor dukakis 
and senator bentsen in taking on the great challenge and your 
sense of public duty in seeing it through to the end he said 
he added his compliments to bush and quayle for going to the 
people on the issues and asking for a mandate on critical matters 
like the taxing and spending power the nature of judicial 
appointments the strength of our defenses and the firmness of our 
foreign policy 
i think that mandate has been unmistakably delivered he 
said 
i feel our achievements are secure our change now a permanent 
feature of american government the president said 
even as we accept the verdict of the majority and pledge to 
protect always the rights of the minority we put behind us the 
divisions and controversies of the immediate past and begin anew 
he said so its a day for congratulations yes but its also a 
day for remembering that whatever may temporarily divide is far 
outweighed by that which unites us 
in return bush thanked reagan for his help in the campaign and 
said i dont believe theres a case in modern presidential 
politics of a president whos worked so hard to help someone else 
achieve this office i really believe the results would have been 
entirely different if we hadnt had this loyal steadfast campaign 
support

duberstein to head his transition team and said we will work 
closely with presidentelect bush and his team to ensure that the

opponents of an aids reporting initiative 
cheered its overwhelming defeat wednesday but said they anticipated 
new battles against what one expert called the forces of fear and 
ignorance 
dr laurens white president of the california medical 
association said the rejection by voters tuesday of a state ballot 
measure requiring health professionals to report aids patients to 
state authorities was encouraging 
by defeating this misguided scheme the voters of california 
have once again demonstrated their common sense in dealing with 
aids said white 
but others said the downfall of proposition 102 will provide only 
a short respite from more initiatives and legislative proposals 
dealing with the epidemic 
and their triumph was tempered by disappointment at approval of 
proposition 96 a law enforcement aids initiative permitting forced 
testing of people charged with certain crimes 
my fear is that when the legislature reconvenes we will see 
son of 102 introduced we will do this all over again said

a computer virus that infected software at the 
university of houstons business school has destroyed some data but 
officials say it poses no real danger 
the virus is more a nusiance than a threat said michael walters 
director of research and instructional computing services 
it probably hasnt cost us much except a few days of 
peopletime to clean up these disks but it probably cost the 
students a good bit of frustration walter said last week 
a computer virus is a string of coded commands hidden in 
programs like a biological virus it uses its host to reproduce 
replicating itself into other programs used on the same computer or 
into computers to which it is connected 
the affected university computers were isolated and the virus 
spread was limited walters said 
last week a sophisticated virus spread throughout a computer 
network used by universities and defense contractors and eventually 
affected an estimated 6000 computers nationwide 
the texas virus appeared to be a version of the socalled 
brain computer virus that was traced to a computer store in 
lahore pakistan

children of victims will preserve 
the memory of the orgy of genocide launched 50 years ago with a 
night of horror the nazis called kristallnacht a jewish leader said 
wednesday 
heinz galinski leader of west germanys 32000 jews later went 
to a ceremony in east germany whose jewish population is only 
450600 he urged east and west germany to make the anniversary a 
joint day of rememberance of the nazi past 
some jews objected to chancellor helmut kohls presence in the 
frankfurt synagogue where galinksi spoke and he was heckled from 
the balcony they cite his 1985 visit with president reagan to the 
bitburg cemetery where 49 nazi ss officers are buried and an 
alleged insensitivity to jewish concerns 
on tuesday someone spraypainted swastikas and pronazi slogans 
on a synagogue in the bavarian village of binswangen police 
reported 
adolf hitler sent gangs of nazi thugs into the streets the night 
of nov 910 1938 they killed scores of jews burned hundreds of 
synagogues ransacked 7500 jewish businesses destroyed thousands 
of jewish homes and rounded up 30000 jews for shipment to 
concentration camps 
a similar rampage occurred in austria hitlers homeland which 
he had annexed to the third reich eight months earlier about 
200000 jews lived in austria then there are 7000 now 
shattered glass covered the streets after the terrible night and 
the nazis in a boastful mood named it kristallnacht which in 
english is crystal night 
the responsibility cannot be divided said galinski a 
75yearold survivor of the auschwitz death damp specifically it 
is the joint responsibility of both german nations for the past they 
have in common 
in vienna the austrian parliament observed a minute of silence 
for the victims 
rabbi avi weiss of new york and two other activisits from his 
coalition of concern symbolically reenacted the nazi practice of 
forcing jews to wash the streets of vienna with toothbrushes 
at an evening ceremony in the community center adjacent to 
viennas only synagogue jewish leader paul grosz said millions of 
austrians ignored the fate of the jews half a century ago 
not the blind hate not the lust to get ones hands on jewish 
money but indifference led to all those unmentionable things that 
we still have not overcome he said 
roman catholic layman paul schulmeister apologized for the 
failure of austrias predominantly catholic population to help the 
jews about 100 young austrians marched to the synagogue behind a 
banner saying austria when will you forgive your victims 
felix schrott who helped carry the banner said they were 
protesting a tendency to suppress austrias past 
east germany continued to dwell on support communists gave the 
jews during the holocaust that took 6 million jewish lives 
erich honecker president and communist party chief said in a 
message to the small jewish community that communists and jews had 
been friends and allies in the antifascist struggle 
horst sindermann president of the east german parliament made a 
speech tuesday rejecting responsibility for nazi atrocities he 
repeated the east german argument that german communists stood by 
the jews 
west germany has paid more than 45 billion to victims and their 
families east germany has not paid reparations 
wednesdays ceremonies in frankfurt and east berlin were among 
hundreds of events in towns and cities throughout the two countries 
historians agree kristallnacht was the start of the nazi attempt to 
exterminate european jews 
ernst breit leader of west germanys dgb labor federation said 
a national holocaust memorial should be created as a clearly 
visible sign that we germans are aware of our historical guilt and 
responsibility he spoke at the site of the former dachau 
concentration camp outside munich 
in israel president chaim herzog urged israelis to reconcile 
their internal differences and declared lets not forget that to 
our enemies these differences are nonexistent 
galinski delivered the main address in a service televised live 
from west end synagogue the only one in frankfurt that survived 
kristallnacht during a national day of atonement 
before entering the synagogue us ambassador richard burt told 
reporters this commemoration is important so that we never forget 
what occurred here so that it never happens again 
in his address galinski called the holocaust the past that is 
not finished and cannot be overcome and denounced attempts to 
diminish the nazi horror 
you may deceive yourselves with the hope that one day there 
wont be any more witnesses no one who from personal experience can 
raise a veto to the distortion of history he said but you are 
forgetting that our children the children of the victims will 
take our task upon themselves 
the younger generation just as we ourselves are always on 
guard against a return of the indescribable and the children 
will never forget he said 
west end synagogue was badly damaged on kristallnacht and has 
been refurbished its stone walls majestic pillars and sweeping 
arches returned to their original splendor police surrounded it 
wednesday in case of attacks on the dignitaries inside 
one of two hecklers shouted from the balcony during kohls 
speech mr chancellor what about bitburg then both called 
out mr chancellor why are you lying we want our rights 
let me finish kohl responded 
his address also took up the theme of coming generations he said 
the death of the last eyewitness cannot be permitted to mean the 
end of recollection

jesse jackson saying george bush in no 
ways got a mandate from the american people on wednesday called 
on the presidentelect to turn away from hackneyed campaign rhetoric 
and address the more substantive issues he must face as president 
willie horton will not be on the presidents desk on jan 21 
the flag passion contest is behind us jackson said in a speech to 
international investors here 
horton a convicted murderer who escaped while on furlough from a 
massachusetts prison and raped a woman became one of the 
republicans political weapons against democrat michael dukakis as 
they accused him of being soft on crime 
bush also criticized dukakis for vetoing a massachusetts law that 
would have required teachers to lead their students in the pledge of 
allegiance and even made one appearance at a flag factory 
jackson said that while bush won 54 percent of the popular vote 
it was in no ways a mandate 
his coattails did not carry with it the governors and 
congresspeople and senators so what it does mean is that more 
cooperation is required between the president and the congress and 
the senate jackson said 
bush cannot just run legislation through based on popular will 
he cannot whip the congress or senate in line 
the congress and senate need the president the president needs 
the congress and senate and maybe thats just the way it ought to 
be shared power and shared responsibility 
he said bushs pledge to build a kinder gentler nation could 
only be translated into a real commitment to fight poverty and help 
disadvantaged children and families he said the nations burgeoning 
deficit was another issue that must be faced by the new 
administration and bushs pledge not to raise taxes would just make 
the problem worse 
what we cant afford is more supply side campaign rhetoric as 
national policy what we need today is to wrestle with 
presidentialsized questions not just the flag not just a criminal 
set loose to move beyond inciting fears to grapple with the 
great questions of our day on a national and global scale jackson 
said 
jackson said dukakis had conducted a gallant campaign and 
done his best against the odds and he declined to make any 
specific criticism of his campaign 
well continue to work together he said 
although the democrats had failed once again to capture the white 
house jackson said the essential democratic message is a strong 
message 
i am heartened by the fact that in the last days of the dukakis 
campaign he took his case to the people and showed more of his 
truer self the people began to respond jackson said 
asked by reporters whether he would run for president again in 
1992 jackson said he had not yet made that decision not even 
given it serious consideration

a newspaper that supports nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government announced george bushs victory 
wednesday with a proverb a oneeyed man is king in a country of 
the blind 
el nuevo diario used the phrase in a headline to point out the 
low turnout among us voters which allowed the republican 
candidate to win the us presidency with a minority of the voting 
population 
the same newspaper quoted president daniel ortega as saying a new 
administration could pave the way for bilateral talks and improved 
relations with the united states 
but bushs victory also may mean a renewed request to congress 
for military aid to the rebels known as contras which have been 
strongly supported by president reagan since 1981 
ortega at a news conference tuesday night said it wouldnt be 
strange if bush requested military aid which ended feb 29 but 
termed it a very serious error 
bush said wednesday that aid would have a high priority because 
freedom and democracy in this hemisphere have a high priority 
the staunchly antisandinista newspaper la prensa praised bushs 
call for renewed contra aid with a banner headline saying bush 
promises to maintain pressure for liberty in nicaragua 
the paper also ran an editorial calling on the sandinista 
government to grant the requests of nicaraguans for liberty 
peace democracy and progress as a start towards normalizing 
relations with the united states 
a member of the contra leadership wilfredo montalvan said in a 
telephone interview from miami that his organization would demand a 
clearly defined policy from the bush administration 
and rebel commander enrique bermudez in a clandestine radio 
liberacion broadcast wednesday said the contras would turn over 
their arms only in exchange for democracy and liberty 
the reagan administration claiming nicaragua is a communist 
beachhead cut off aid to managua in 1981 and began funding the 
rebels a trade embargo was imposed in 1985 and the sandinistas 
blame the united states for their nations disastrous economy 
the majority of the contras have moved out of nicaragua in the 
past few months since us military aid stopped they are now in 
base camps in honduras where they are receiving nonlethal aid such 
as food medicine and uniforms 
a fragile truce between the sandinistas and contras signed march 
23 ended most of the fighting but failed to bring a final resolution 
to the war 
reliable sources in the region quoted several rebels recently as 
saying they had received up to 3000 new ak47 rifles from an 
undisclosed source the sandinistas claim the contras are preparing 
to reinfiltrate 
the official sandinista newspaper barricada ran a story about 
bushs victory under the headline exdirector of the cia in the 
white house 
for the first time a former director of the central 
intelligence agency hated organization of the underworld of 
espionage and clandestine american intervention in varied parts of 
the word will assume the presidency of the united states said 
one of its stories 
political parties opposed to the sandinista government expressed 
their pleasure at the bush victory bush said wednesday he would 
press sandinista leaders to adhere to their pledge made to the 
organization of american states to maintain freedom and democracy 
ramiro gurdian vice president of the antigovernment superior 
council of private enterprise smiled tuesday night at an election 
party thrown by the us embassy 
the republicans are on our side gurdian said he was 
surrounded by nicaraguans mostly opposition figures chomping on 
hot dogs sipping american beer and casting straw ballots for a mock 
us presidential election

the transportation department on wednesday 
denied a request that it investigate the economic fitness of trans 
world airlines inc in connection with the recent privatization of 
the carrier 
twa was taken private on oct 24 by its owner and chairman 
financier carl icahn the move has been criticized by the unions 
representing pilots and flight attendants at twa who argued that it 
will drain the airline of cash and weaken its financial condition 
the unions and the consumer federation of america petitioned the 
dot to investigate the privatization to determine whether it affects 
the financial fitness of twa 
representatives of the two unions the independent federation of 
flight attendants and the air line pilots association were 
unavailable for comment wednesday on the dot decision 
the department said in an opinion issued wednesday that twa 
continues to be fit willing and able to perform its certificated 
operations it said the petitioners had failed to present a 
convincing prima facie case that implementation of twas 
privatization will prevent the carrier from remaining fit 
the dot said it was therefore dismissing the petition without 
further action 
the dot opinion is further confirmation that the privatization 
of twa will not in any way impact on our operations or our ability 
to serve the needs of the traveling public twa general counsel 
mark buckstein said in a statement issued in new york

a rabbi said wednesday the state of iowa 
violated his constitutional rights when he was denied permission to 
erect a 20foot menorah at the state capitol 
state attorneys however said the display amounted to 
excessive freedom of religion 
rabbi moishe kasowitz was given permission in december 1986 to 
erect the menorah but the authorization was rescinded shortly 
thereafter when officials learned that the candelabrum the 
traditional symbol of judaism was 16 feet wide at the base and 9 
feet across at the top 
kasowitz sought an injunction and was refused first by a district 
judge and again by a federal judge 
following the appeal the parties agreed that kasowitz could 
erect the menorah for one religious ceremony on dec 28 1986 
kasowitz lawyer paul zoss argued before the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals on wednesday that kasowitz first amendment freedom 
of expression rights were violated by the denial during the 198687 
hanukkah holidays 
zoss is seeking a ruling that what kasowitz wanted to do was 
within the realm of his constitutional rights 
the menorah was to stand in a public place on the statehouse 
grounds designated for such holiday displays zoss said 
the state should remain neutral if it be a cross a milk cow 
as long as its recognized as a public place he said the state 
shouldnt get into the business of evaluating what is in a public 
forum 
zoss said the public isnt so naive as to believe the 
erection of a menorah implied state endorsement of judaism 
iowa deputy attorney general gordon allen said the menorah was so 
big a flatbed truck was necessary to bring it to the site 
the state has determined that this is excessive freedom of 
religion allen said 
allen said the menorah would be visible for miles and would 
amount to an endorsement of judaism 
that would cross the line on the separation of church and 
state said allen 
chief judge donald p lay of minnesota asked allen if a christmas 
tree were located on the state grounds 
allen said yes 
do you decorate it with angels asked lay 
we did in 1986 but didnt in 1987 responded allen 
a ruling is not expected for at least a month

the last vice president who won a 
succeeding presidential election had been branded by his critics as 
sort of a wimp a northeastern dandy out of touch with the common 
folks and who drank wine out of fancy cups 
but martin van buren prevailed and george bush the target of 
nearly identical snickering 152 years later was very much aware of 
that precedent and the huge interval it took for any other vice 
president to match it 
in houston wednesday presidentelect bush expressed his 
gratitude to his family his campaigners and the american voters 
then took an extra moment to thank martin van buren for paving the 
way its been a long time marty 
like bush van buren had spent much of his adult life in public 
service he was a new york state legislator then governor senator 
and us secretary of state in andrew jacksons first term vice 
president in the second like bush he served a popular 
nationalistic twoterm president in times of peace and prosperity 
but a selective profile could just as easily fit the image of 
michael j dukakis van buren was a short liberal democrat a 
former northeast governor with strong ethnic roots and unlike bush 
he was not born to the privilege so ridiculed by his critics 
a dozen incumbent vice presidents have succeeded their bosses 
but only four by election john adams and thomas jefferson the 
nations second and third presidents were the first two 
some called the long drought which kept the second fiddles from 
moving to the first string the van buren jinx but most 
historians say that difficulty winning a presidential election 
simply goes with the vice presidential turf 
when youre vice president you dont stand on your own said 
bruce stewart superintendent of the martin van buren national 
historic site in van burens native kinderhook 130 miles north of 
new york city youre always associated with someone else youre 
linked more with the outgoing president than as your own man 
and voters typical desire for change has kept most incumbent 
deputies out of the white house noted stewart who oversees 
lindenwald the mansion to which van buren in 1840 
van buren a dutchman helped found the democratic party and his 
behindthescenes dealing built the foundation for todays 
convention and electioneering process stewart said 
but van burens democratic liberalism of the 1830s would fit 
today republican platform and could have come straight from the desk 
of ronald reagan said george berndt a historian at lindenwald 
which is run by the national park service to a large extent van 
buren believed in the policies of the present republican party he 
said 
for example van burens was a strong advocate of states rights 
feeling that the federal government should not intrude on social 
issues 
for van buren the charge that he had little regard for common 
people dug deep said donald cole a historian in exeter nh who 
specializes in the jackson era 
van buren was considered kind of feminine aristocratic said 
cole whose book martin van buren and the american political 
system was published by princeton university press his 
opponents liked to say he drank wine out of fancy cups 
that even became part of the opposing whig battle cry in 1840 
when van buren lost his reelection bid to william henry harrison 
said michael henderson assistant curator at lindenwald 
harrison forces used the slogan would you rather have a goblet 
of champagne or a glass of cider to imply that harrison born in 
a log cabin was closer to the electorate than the genteel van buren 
van buren was born a tavern keepers son among the dutch settlers 
in kinderhook he built his wealth from a law practice fashioned 
after long apprenticeships 
van buren was jacksons campaign manager in 1828 and the top 
adviser in the presidents kitchen cabinet through his two 
terms berndt said he was jacksons handpicked successor 
while bush exults in matching van burens accomplishment theres 
another jinx associated with the little dutchman he has yet to 
overcome van buren got beat by william henry harrison when he ran 
for reelection

church of england leaders called on the british 
government wednesday to apply moral principles to arms sales and 
deplored the countrys massive weapons trading 
the policymaking general synod of the anglican state church urged 
prime minister margaret thatcher to use her influence with us 
presidentelect george bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to persuade them to abandon research on weapons in space 
in a series of showofhands votes that appeared to be almost 
unanimous the synod also called on mrs thatcher to work for a 
comprehensive ban on nuclear tests and to renew efforts for a 
worldwide ban on chemical weapons including international 
agreement on effective measures against those countries which use 
them 
the resolutions on the third day of the fiveday meeting ended a 
lengthy debate on a synod working party report called peacemaking 
in a nuclear age 
the report did not oppose all arms deals saying what is evil 
is not the weaponry as such not even nuclear weapons the evil or 
good resides in the action of governments that is of human 
beings 
bishop of oxford richard harries who chaired the working party 
said clearly if a friend is being oppressed and you cannot or 
feel it would not be right to come to his aid physically you can 
at least give him the means to defend himself 
harries said nuclear weapons had overshadowed the role of 
conventional weapons 
thirty million people have been killed by conventional weapons 
in conflicts since world war ii he said 
harries cited reports that britain has overtaken the soviet union 
to become the worlds second largest arms supplier after the united 
states 
we reject the notion that arms are a product to be sold 
commercially as vigorously as possible like any other he said 
british arms sales last year topped a record 64 billion and are 
expected to account for onefifth of all world arms sales this year 
britain recently won its largest ever overseas order a 24 billion 
contract from saudi arabia for military and civil aircraft 
helicopters minesweepers and avionics 
antinuclear protesters demonstrated quietly at the entrance to 
church house westminster before the debate 
the rev clive barrett chairman of the anglican pacifist 
fellowship said the protesters rejected peacemaking in a nuclear 
age because it was based on acceptability of the concept of 
nuclear deterrence 
i do not believe that to dissuade by fear is acceptable 
christian behaviour when one is considering the ultimate fear of 
complete destruction barrett said 
but bishop of salisbury john baker who was responsible for a 
church report in 1983 which favored unilateral nuclear disarmament 
said effective deterrents cannot act on bluff it cannot be a 
charade those in charge of nuclear weapons have to be prepared to 
use them and there is the anguish

john n mitchell was a political innocent when 
he piloted richard m nixons 1968 political campaign to victory and 
was rewarded with a cabinet post as attorney general 
in the early days of the administration political observers 
began calling mitchell the cabinet officer closest to nixon the 
quiet pipesmoking mitchell agreed with the political observers 
i guess i see him once a day or more when i go over to the 
white house he said during the early nixon years and during 
the course of the day we usually talk on the telephone several more 
times in the evening he frequently calls me at home i think he 
hears my views on most important questions and i think he values my 
judgment 
nixon and mitchell first met after nixon defeated both for the 
presidency in 1960 and for the governorship of california in 1962 
moved to new york in 1963 and became a partner in the law firm of 
nixon mudge rose guthrie and alexander 
mitchell an expert in municipal bond law was the top man in the 
firm of caldwell trimble and mitchell frequently the two men 
teamed with nixon representing the underwriters of bonds and 
mitchell the users 
from these encounters came the idea of merging the two firms a 
close friendship developed betwen the two lawyers 
when nixon decided to seek the 1968 republican presidential 
nomination mitchell did field work for him making use of his 
friendships with politicians formed during his years in municipal 
bond law practice later mitchell ran nixons successful campaigns 
for the nomination and for the presidency 
when a group of republican congressmen grumbled about having an 
unknown in that role mitchell replied 
ive made more money in the practice of law than nixon brought 
more clients into the firm can hold my own in argument with him 
and as far as i am concerned i can deal with him as an equal 
throughout the 1968 campaign mitchell said he would not take a 
high federal post if nixon were elected but on dec 11 1968 nixon 
introduced mitchell on television as his choice for attorney general 
mitchell nixon said was as devoted as he was to waging an 
effective war against crime in this country 
mitchell said that although he preferred a quieter life of 
practicing law and playing golf he accepted the appointment 
because nixon insisted upon it 
he soon made his imprint on the justice department contending 
that his conception of the department was as an institution for 
law enforcement not social improvement 
mitchell soon became known as a strong advocate of law and order 
an aide who stood beside mitchell on a justice department balcony 
during an antivietnam war march on washington overheard him mutter 
as he watched the young people in the street below looks like the 
bolshevik revolution to me 
mitchells detractors called him cold distant and irascible 
while his supporters during the early days called him a pragmatist 
who never loses his cool 
during his tenure as attorney general mitchell was often 
embarrassed by his wife martha she had the disconcerting habit of 
telephoning reporters in the middle of the night to complain about 
how nixon was mistreating her husband at one point she claimed she 
was drugged to keep her quiet 
but mitchell at least in public laughed it all off and was 
solicitous toward her 
mitchell resigned as attorney general to run nixons reelection 
campaign in 1972 and it was from that post that he became embroiled 
in the watergate scandal 
he was indicted march 1 1974 and was convicted of one count of 
conspiracy obstruction of justice two counts false statements to a 
grand jury and one count of perjury he served 19 months of a 
2to8year term at maxwell air force base in alabama he was 
released in january 1979 and was disbarred 
throughout the scandal and afterward mitchell and nixon remained 
friends mitchell never publicly uttered a harsh word about nixon 
and never permitted his defense lawyers to do so during the lengthy 
investigation and his own trial 
mitchell kept a low profile following his release from prison 
avoiding most interviews and refusing to discuss the scandal with 
reporters he had frequently accused of blowing the case out of 
proportion 
mitchell was born in detroit sept 15 1913 he was raised on 
suburban long island attending public schools he attended fordham 
university because it had an accelerated law program after two 
years as an undergraduate he went directly into law school 
attending night classes and working during the day 
mitchells career was set during his second year in law school 
when he secured a clerks job at the firm of caldwell amp raymond 
which had a specialty in bonds 
he became a junior partner in the firm and quickly set out to 
become a specialist in municipal bond law he became so expert that 
he was named a partner before he was 30 
world war ii interrupted his career for three years during which 
he was commander of the pt squadron in which john f kennedy served 
as a lieutenant

leaders of a oneday strike were fired 
wednesday for organizing the walkout to protest a government 
decision to close lenin shipyard the birthplace of solidarity 
state media reported 
the announcement came hours after strikers at two shipyards ended 
their protests at the request of solidarity leader lech walesa who 
argued that there was no other path than reconciliation 
the staterun pap news agency said the director of the repair 
shipyard in gdansk sacked the inspirators of the strike action 
at the 4500worker yard 
it did not mention firings at the other yard that was struck the 
1000worker wisla shipyard 
on thursday all employees will be admitted to work with the 
exception of those who have been given notice pap said it did 
not say how may workers were dismissed 
the immediate publicity given the firings seemed to signal that 
authorities are taking a tough line against strikers the move also 
seemed likely to undercut walesa who had urged strikers to moderate 
their actions 
hundreds of mainly young workers went on strike tuesday without 
walesas approval demanding reversal of a government order to begin 
liquidation of the lenin shipyard on dec 1 they ended the strikes 
after repeated appeals from walesa and a threat of dismissals from 
management 
i would like to thank very much all the striking people the 
youth for subordinating to my request walesa said at st 
brygidas church a headquarters of the banned trade union soon 
after hearing of the end of the second strike 
solidarity was crushed in 1981 with the imposition of martial law 
and outlawed the following year 
i hope in the future if there is such a necessity we will 
fight together walesa said 
walesa argued that striking was counterproductive at the moment 
and attention should be focused on starting blocked talks with 
authorities and the opposition on polands future 
for poland there is no other path than reconciliation meeting 
halfway to solve our problems including social political and 
economic pluralism he told reporters 
but he added we will fight for the shipyard sooner or later 
and we will regain it 
an undetermined number of workers gave up a strike wednesday 
morning at wisla shipyard which makes yachts and small river craft 
after being promised that those who took part in the strike would 
not be fired the yards strike leader jan stanecki said he said 
several hundred workers supported the strike 
at the repair shipyard 200 workers who rallied wednesday morning 
ended their strike at around 1 pm one hour after management said 
they must leave or be fired said krzysztof kamolak one of the 
strike committee members 
we decided to leave because it made no sense to fight he 
said 
walesa said he continues to face resistance from young workers 
who are impatient for promised roundtable talks to begin the talks 
were offered by the government in august in exchange for which 
walesa ended polands worst labor unrest in seven years 
i cant complain about the youth who are fed up with the 
conditions in which they live walesa said 
preparations for the talks broke down when walesa refused to 
purge from solidaritys proposed delegation two people whom the 
government has deemed extremist solidarity also says it will not 
talk until authorities hire back about 100 coal miners fired for 
striking in august 
walesa said tuesday he was not as concerned about an immediate 
reversal of the closure decision as before and that he might talk 
to authorities even without a guarantee of the yards future 
the government announced tuesday that the lenin shipyards 
director czeslaw tolwinski who previously protested the closure 
has been put in charge of the liquidation solidarity activists said 
tolwinski assured walesa that the closure will not be abrupt 
but walesa complained he still has had no reply to a letter he 
sent interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak last week calling on 
kiszczak to remove the obstacles to the talks 
the government also claims it wants the talks to begin but it 
says it would be useless to talk to extremists officials object to 
longtime solidarity advisers adam michnik and jacek kuron

the 50th anniversary of kristallnacht when nazi thugs attacked 
jews and their property throughout germany and austria brought 
together on wednesday children still learning their history and 
adults who lived through the worst of it 
kristallnacht is known among jews as the beginning of the 
end rabbi mitchell smith of the hillel foundation in tucson ariz 
persecution of jews in germany had begun in the early 1930s but 
the night of nov 9 1938 marked the beginning of largescale 
violence and murder of jews 
it also meant that many jews woke up to the realization that 
they could no longer hope to live in germany even if their family 
had been there for 500 years smith said 
the violence that ushered in the holocaust the nazi slaughter of 
6 million jews was remembered wednesday at candlelight vigils 
memorial services and panel discussions many jews planned to burn 
memorial candles at their homes 
kristallnacht is german for crystal night evoking the shards 
of glass from windows smashed by the nazis 
my parents finally came to the realization after that night 
that we had to get out of germany or we would never survive said 
gerda wilchfort who was to talk about kristallnacht in tucson 
in new york city a service at the union of american hebrew 
congregations included a procession of worshipers bearing torahs 
into the chapel and the ark where the torah the first five books 
of the bible that contain the basic tenets of jewish law is kept 
organizers said this symbolizes the hope for the future of the 
jewish people 
nighttime events in new york included the ringing of bells at 
catholic and protestant churches throughout the city and an 
ecumenical service attended by mayor edward i koch and roman 
catholic cardinal john oconnor 
an eightblock candlelight vigil was scheduled by children from 
the ramaz school in manhattan to the congregation kehilath jeshurun 
by carrying a candle symbol of the flames that burned that 
night in every city and village each child is a link from the 
horror of the past to the hope of a different future organizers 
said in a statement 
los angeles mayor tom bradley and the los angeles city council 
proclaimed wednesday a remembrance of kristallnacht 
let us hope that never again will the civilized world sit idly 
by while this kind of barbarism takes place said bradley who 
presented the proclamation to concentration camp survivor fred 
diamond 
i do this in the names of the hundreds of thousands who 
suffered on this night and also of the millions who later were 
murdered said diamond as he accepted the proclamation he spent 
five years in nazi concentration camps and said most of his family 
perished in the holocaust 
at the jewish community center on mercer island a seattle 
suburb a ceremony was to include the lighting of 191 candles to 
represent each synagogue destroyed in germany that night joseph 
frankel 72 a witness to kristallnacht in frankfurt was to speak 
the gestapo came to the door and told us we had just five 
minutes to line up said frankel who was 21 at the time 
we lined up in an arena near the railroad station with the red 
and yellow glow in the sky from the synagogues burning and the 
sirens and the police young people old people all just waiting 
there not knowing our fate he said 
frankel who said he and other jews were forced to stand still 
for 19 hours said the memory of that night never wears off 
gretel oppenheimer of chicago found her dog dead on the doorstep 
of her stuttgart home shot by nazis on kristallnacht 
for me its impossible to think kristallnacht happened half a 
century ago said ms oppenheimer 80 every day since ive 
lived like it was only last night 
it could have been called the night of shattered illusions ms 
oppenheimer said 
my twin brother had already emigrated to america as i wanted 
to she said but right up to 38 my father kept saying it 
will pass dont worry these nazi thugs are not the real germany

the air force on wednesday grounded the 
nations fleet of b1b longrange bombers for a precautionary safety 
inspection following a crash of one of the new planes in texas 
the strategic air command which is responsible for landbased 
nuclear bomber and missile forces said the order to suspend flying 
was a normal precaution in the wake of a major accident 
the flight suspension order will be followed within the next day 
or two by specific instructions to b1b mechanics on what aircraft 
systems they must inspect said lt col george h peck a spokesman 
at sac headquarters in omaha neb 
those instructions will probably reflect the suspicions of the 
official board of inquiry that is investigating tuesdays crash of a 
b1b near dyess air force base texas 
peck said he did not know which systems would be checked and 
would not speculate on the cause of the crash 
but the inspection is expected to require two to four hours per 
aircraft he said this is a onetime special inspection 
at dyess training flights continued throughout the day 
wednesday officials there said the planes had passed the inspection 
ordered by the strategic air command 
eyewitnesses to tuesdays crash have said they saw smoke and fire 
trailing an engine on the plane all four crewmen managed to eject 
safely from the stricken bomber which then crashed in a field 
outside abilene texas 
the headquarters of sac has ordered a onetime safety 
inspection as a normal precaution peck said once the 
inspection is completed the aircraft will return to flying status 
the spokesman said the flight suspension order would not affect 
the b1bs currently standing alert ready for immediate takeoff in 
the event of nuclear war 
in texas the air force set up a roadblock to seal off the crash 
site wednesday and sent in military investigators who spent the day 
mapping the area and searching through debris 
the wreckage was scattered over an area seven miles by two miles 
said al dostal an air force spokesman 
tuesdays crash was the second involving a productionmodel b1b 
in 14 months leaving the air force with 98 of its original 100 
planes 
the bombers have been deployed at four bases dyess ellsworth 
afb sd grand forks afb nd and mcconnell afb kan 
in omaha peck said the vice commander of the 28th bombardment 
wing at ellsworth col david c dill has been named to head the 
crash investigation 
the spokesman added the board of inquiry already had begun 
interviewing the crewmen at dyess 
the air force has said the planes pilot capt michael e 
waters elected to stay with the burning bomber after his three 
crewmen ejected to ensure the plane came down in an unpopulated area 
the fourengine swingwing b1b is the first new addition to 
americas manned bomber force in more than 25 years the plane is 
designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of b52 bombers and 
the new b2 stealth bomber which is to be publicly unveiled 
later this month 
the air force lost the first of the b1bs on sept 28 1987 when 
a plane based at dyess ran into a flock of migrating pelicans during 
a lowlevel bomb run at a colorado flight range three crew members 
were killed 
earlier before productionmodel planes entered the inventory 
the air force lost a b1a prototype in august 1984 during a test 
flight at edwards air force base calif one crewman died and two 
were injured 
the bomber built by the rockwell international corp has a 
maximum speed of about 1000 mph and a range of more than 7000 
miles it is smaller than the older b52 but capable of carrying 
more bombs and already holds a number of world aviation speed 
records for a plane of its size 
the b1b is designated as a lowaltitude penetrator meaning 
it is expected to fly at almost the speed of sound at altitudes of 
only 200 feet during a nuclear war the b1b would be the bomber 
expected to actually fly missions inside the soviet union 
the air force has been criticized over the past two years for its 
handling of the b1b program primarily because of acknowledged 
problems in developing the bombers radarjamming gear however the 
service insists the plane is still the best longrange bomber in the 
world

had no reason to call for a recount in the contest 
it appears to me that we have had an election that has been 
carried out with regularity and with legality karpan said 
there are mistakes in these things and thats why they call them 
the results unofficial 
deputy secretary of state margy white said was contacted 
wednesday by a dscc attorney who said the committee had obtained 
its information through an election night telephone poll of county 
clerks 
hes charging that there are irregularities in the ballot 
process she said that absentee ballots were mailed to parking 
lots duplicate ballots were sent out on the basis of a single 
application that the ballots were delivered after a phone request 
as opposed to written application that the counties are saying that 
they would not give them the exact number of absentee ballots that 
were sent out 
karpan said the problems with ballot numbers may have arisen when 
dscc telephone pollers failed to explain when they called county 
clerks that they needed specific information 
wallops margin of 1310 votes was just enough to avoid an 
automatic recall under wyoming law 
karpan said state law requires a recount if the difference 
between the two candidates votes is less than 1 percent of those 
cast for the winner in the case of the senate race the difference 
would have to have been less than 911 votes 
however a candidate may request a recount if he agrees to pay 
for it recounting the votes would cost a maximum of 11500 karpan 
said 
vinich a state senator said wednesday his campaign was still 
considering whether to ask for a recount 
the vote totals provided by county clerks offices were not 
known until midmorning wednesday more than 12 hours after the 
polls closed tuesday night part of that was due to confusion over 
counting of some 1600 absentee ballots in vinichs home county of 
fremont early wednesday the clerks office reported tallies of the 
absentee ballots would be delayed because they were being counted by 
hand 
the office later said figures it had reported from county polling 
places actually had included absentee ballots as well

the plo said wednesday it has requested a 
us visa for chairman yasser arafat so he can address the general 
assembly after his organization decides whether to declare an 
independent palestinian state 
secretary of state george p shultz said in a letter made public 
wednesday that arafat is not welcome in the united states a 
spokeswoman for the us mission indicated however that arafat and 
two other officials of the palestine liberation organization were 
likely to be granted limited visas for un business 
we do have an obligation to grant a visa to arafat under the 
usun headquarters agreement said the spokeswoman anne 
stoddard she said visas also had been requested for two other plo 
officials who were not immediately identified 
under the headquarters agreement the united states agrees not to 
obstruct transit of people invited to the united nations on official 
business but reserves the right to deny visas to people it considers 
security threats 
washington views the plo as a terrorist organization and has no 
direct relations with it 
arafat has a standing invitation to address the national press 
club in washington a state department official indicated that 
while the united states may grant arafat a limited visa confining 
him to new york city a visit to washington is something else 
the official kuwaiti news agency quoted unidentified sources 
wednesday as saying arafat wants to address the general assembly 
nov 30 to declare formation of a separate palestinian state the 
palestine national council meets in algiers this weekend to consider 
such a move 
riyad h mansour the plos deputy permanent observer at the 
un said wednesday of the upcoming meeting in algiers there is 
a very good chance that in this emergency session independence will 
be announced the birth of an independent palestinian state 
as a result it is very possible that chairman arafat will 
come to the un to announce this decision and to seek additional 
support for this state at an international level mansour said 
he predicted arafat might arrive at the united nations around 
nov 22 or 23 
us legislation overruled in a federal court sought earlier 
this year to expel the plo and close its un observer mission 
arafat last visited the united nations in 1974 when he received 
headofstate treatment 
but shultz in a nov 1 letter to 51 senators who oppose a visa 
for arafat said i have no desire whatever to see arafat in the 
united states should we receive such an application i will 
apply severe scrutiny to it 
the letter was addressed to sen dennis deconcini dariz and 
released by the us mission 
the plos alternate permanent un observer m nasser kidwa 
said he hoped the united states would not deny arafat the visa 
because such a visit would be an attempt towards peace in the 
region 
us officials and un diplomats said the outcome of the 
palestine national council meeting this weekend will effect arafats 
visa application 
they said a council decision to renounce terrorism and recognize 
israels right to exist could improve his chances 
before adjourning in december the general assembly will consider 
the middle east situation and the palestinian problem as it does 
every year

former attorney general john n mitchell who 
authorized the watergate breakin and then went to prison for 
conspiring to cover up the burglary died wednesday evening of a 
heart attack he was 75 
mitchell collapsed on a sidewalk in georgetown and died at 627 
pm said claudia dominitz a spokeswoman for george washington 
university hospital 
an ambulance crew alerted by a 10yearold boy who was 
skateboarding found mitchell unconscious but breathing he stopped 
breathing as he was being taken to the hospital and died despite 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
i was coming back from getting my skateboard and i saw him 
walking i just heard this fall this big boom said 
octavius prince who lives near where mitchell fell i started 
pounding on my door and my mom got mad at me but i just ran to the 
phone and called the paramedics 
mitchell the first former attorney general to be convicted of a 
crime served a 19month prison term for his role in the watergate 
coverup he was convicted along with nixons chief of staff hr 
haldeman and the presidents domestic counselor john d ehrlichman 
who also served 1 years in prison 
the beefy mitchell who was known for his credo that when the 
going gets tough the tough get going was nixons closest 
adviser he was nixons law partner and mentor then ran his 1968 
and 1972 election campaigns 
nixon who was a year older looked up to mitchell as a father 
figure and yet when the heat of watergate made it obvious in march 
1973 that the coverup would unravel nixon appeared ready to allow 
mitchell to be the scapegoat 
g gordon liddy who conceived the plan that involved 
burglarizing the watergate office building headquarters of the 
democratic national committee twice presented the scheme to 
mitchell and maintained that the attorney general approved it 
mitchell always denied giving the authorization 
the former attorney generals wife the flamboyant and peppery 
martha mitchell gained a measure of fame for her latenight 
telephone calls to reporters in which she offered shrill 
shootfromthehip opinions on controversial issues of all sorts 
including her husbands problems 
after he was sentenced for conspiracy mitchell remarked 
bitterly it could have been a hell of a lot worse they could 
have sentenced me to spend the rest of my life with martha 
mitchell 
mrs mitchell died alone in a new york city hospital on may 31 
1976 she had cancer of the bone marrow the two were estranged and 
had lived apart since 1973 
mitchell was indicted march 1 1974 and was convicted of one 
count of conspiracy obstruction of justice two counts false 
statements to a grand jury and one count of perjury he began a 
2to8year term at maxwell air force base in alabama on june 22 
1977 
from the white house president reagan and his wife nancy issued 
a statement that said they are deeply saddened by the news of john 
mitchells death and extend their sympathies and prayers to his 
family 
elliot richardson the former nixon attorney general who resigned 
during the saturday night massacre in october 1973 rather than carry 
out nixons order to fire special watergate prosecutor archibald 
cox described mitchell as a staunch civil rights advocate and 
said he liked him 
while ive not seen him through the years i think he deserves 
to be remembered for some of the good things he achieved and thats 
the way i will remember him richardson said in an interview from 
his home in mclean va 
jeb stuart magruder a nixon reelection committee official who 
served eight months in prison in connection with watergate crimes 
recalled mitchell on wednesday evening as a great mentor and 
friend of mine and i just loved that man magruder is now a 
minister at the first community church in columbus ohio 
james f neal the chief trial counsel in the watergate case 
recalled mitchell as an easy man to know and associate with 
he committed offenses and i prosecuted him said neal in an 
interview in nashville tenn but he added that john mitchell 
and i got along very pleasantly during that time there never 
was any bitterness 
mitchell was the oldest and last of the 25 watergate defendants 
to go to prison and he spent 19 months in the federal prison in 
alabama of those 19 months five were spent on medical furlough for 
two operations one to replace a section of abdominal artery and 
the other to have a plastic hip socket inserted 
he was released from prison in january 1979 
mitchell formerly a leading municipal bond specialist and senior 
partner in nixons old manhattan law firm was chairman of nixons 
election campaign in 1968 he resigned as attorney general to run 
nixons reelection campaign in 1972 but quit that post as the 
watergate scandal began unfolding 
after his release from prison he was disbarred and unable to 
practice law 
nixon was named as an unindicted coconspirator in the watergate 
case by a federal grand jury investigating the scandal soon after 
nixon resigned the presidency in august 1974 his successor gerald 
r ford pardoned nixon for any crimes he may have committed in 
office 
mitchell and nixon remained good friends throughout the scandal 
and afterward mitchell never uttered a harsh word about nixon and 
never permitted his defense lawyers to do so during the lengthy 
investigation and his own trial 
retired marine corps col john jack brennan who was nixons 
staff director in san clemente calif after nixon resigned the 
presidency said late wednesday that he and mitchell were business 
partners in an international consulting firm global research 
international inc 
mitchell was walking from the office to his home when he died 
brennan said 
he has been even at my age my inspiration and has taught me 
how to forgive how to be caring and how to not hold grudges said 
brennan 51 i never heard him be really cross about any of 
the things that happened to him or any of the people who had hurt 
him intentionally or not 
the late sen sam ervin dnc who presided at the 
congressional watergate hearings once said i really feel sorry 
for john mitchell he was very loyal to the president and the 
president was very loyal to him 
mitchell and maurice stans a former secretary of commerce who 
was the nixon reelection committees 1972 finance chairman were 
acquitted in 1974 in a trial in new york of conspiracy and 
obstruction of justice charges relating to a campaign contribution 
made by fugitive financier robert vesco 
mitchells release from prison in january 1979 was widely 
described as the final page in the long watergate saga 
thenattorney general griffin bell declared upon mitchells 
release that watergate is now a closed issue 
mitchell kept a low profile following his release from prison 
avoiding most interviews and refusing to discuss the scandal with 
reporters he had frequently accused of blowing the case out of 
proportion 
as he left the military base where he had been imprisoned 
mitchell gave a curt goodbye to the press covering the event 
henceforth dont call me ill call you he said 
brennan said mitchell whose son john mitchell jr died several 
years ago is survived by two daughters jill reed of coldspring 
harbor new york and marti mitchell of washington he also is 
survived by five grandchildren john m mitchell jr james 
mitchell joseph mitchell john reed and corp reed 
funeral plans were incomplete late wednesday but the funeral 
will be held saturday in washington brennan said

george bush is coming off tuesdays convincing 
victory with a promise to slay the budget deficit dragon but the 
lance under his arm is made of overcooked fettuccine 
bushs flexible freeze plan for reducing the deficit was soft 
even by standards of a political campaign now that he has been 
elected and reality is setting in it looks downright pastalike 
economists of all political stripes agree that to make a serious 
dent in the budget deficit bush will have to cut spending more 
severely than anticipated raise taxes or both 
the point here is not to heap criticism on the presidentelect 
michael dukakis did not propose a detailed workable deficit 
reduction plan either 
the real point is that bush and dukakis as well knew 
throughout the campaign that to present a realistic plan for 
balancing the budget was to commit political harakiri 
when a candidate talks too much about belttightening and 
tradeoffs voters just say no 
thats the old news though the question for the next four years 
is will bush have the political strength to shave the deficit when 
he has neither asked for nor received a mandate to make hard 
choices on spending and taxation 
maybe the most likely outcome though is that bush will stick 
with his flexible freeze it will not work and the federal 
government will continue to run massive budget deficits 
whats wrong with that in some ways not much the stimulation 
of excess government spending is one of the factors that has kept 
the momentum behind president reagans record 6yearlong economic 
expansion 
unfortunately deficit spending means borrowing since there 
arent enough private savings in this country the united states 
must borrow from overseas to cover the gap that means future 
generations are falling into debt to foreign nations 
the united states became a net debtor during the reagan 
administration for the first time since world war i and the 
situation is getting worse 
which brings us back to the flexible freeze the freeze 
economists say is based on such unrealistic assumptions that it is 
like a golfer asking for a gimme on a 50foot putt 
bush proposes that by freezing overall outlays with an allowance 
for inflation he will be able to save 55 billion to 60 billion by 
1993 
the plan exempts mandatory payments of interest as it must it 
also cautiously keeps its hands off social security payments which 
would grow according to current law defense spending would rise at 
the rate of inflation 
those conditions mean the remainder of the budget the 40 
percent that represents everything from education to medicare to 
national parks would have to absorb budget increases of less than 
the rate of inflation 
faced with a democratic house and senate bush is likely to have 
a hard time achieving the cuts he promises in those areas 
but here is where the plan really falls down it assumes an 
unlikely combination of real economic growth of more than 3 percent 
through 1993 and a gradual decline in the inflation rate to just 
above 2 percent 
according to this wishful scenario the strong growth would 
produce more tax revenue while the low inflation would reduce the 
governments interest expenses the economic expansion already a 
record 6 years old would reach its 11th birthday without a 
recession 
in reality strong growth tends to produce higher inflation not 
lower even if bush manages to get the vigorous growth he wants 
itself unlikely he almost certainly will not get the low inflation 
and interest rates he predicts 
the flexible freeze program is neither credible nor workable 
allen sinai chief economist of the boston co concluded in a 
recent paper 
the federal budget deficit is undoubtedly the most difficult 
economic problem bush will face requiring tough and unpopular 
political choices judging from the campaign it is not clear that 
bush is prepared to make them

its not over yet for producerdirector dan 
curtis and despite nine years spent on the abc miniseries the 
winds of war and its sequel war and remembrance hes not 
ready to give it up 
the first half of war and remembrance begins sunday he 
hasnt even started editing the second half which probably wont 
air until may in all the miniseries is expected to run 30 hours 
im lucky this time said curtis with winds of war it 
went on the air and then it became yesterdays news if you miss 
it thats it its not like a movie in a theater that keeps 
running but this time the other parts still coming 
curtis spent more time recreating world war ii in the two 
miniseries than the six years the real war lasted 193945 the 
winds of war ran in 1983 at 18 hours and cost 40 million war 
and remembrance cost 110 million making it not only the longest 
but the most expensive film project ever 
the first 18 hours of war and remembrance will be aired in 
seven parts over a span of 11 nights 
i dont like skipping all those days but theres nothing i can 
do about it said curtis i understand abcs problem but i 
still dont like it id rather see it run every night ive cut it 
after 18 hours at the only possible breaking point any other break 
would be a disaster 
the long break between the first and second parts bothers me 
abc would like it earlier and id love to give it to them but 
theres no way to get it ready before may 
a big if is the ratings the winds of war got a 386 
rating and 53 share making it the third highestrated miniseries 
after roots and the thorn birds although the television 
audience has grown in the past five years the networks share of 
the audience has shrunk due to increased competition from cable 
independent stations and videocassettes 
i think people will stick with it curtis said each show 
seems to get better than the one that precedes it when i shoot the 
look is almost more important than the dialogue or equally 
important you focus on the reaction of people to whats being said 
television gives it an intimacy 
most people dont know the difference between good shooting and 
bad shooting in fact most directors dont understand it either 
but if you shoot it the right way and your camera angles are right 
it will heighten it because youre telling the story visually i 
think with war and remembrance people will actually feel theyre 
inside the picture rather than just being an outside observer 
the two miniseries adapted from wouks two novels follow naval 
officer pug henry robert mitchum and show how the war affects him 
his wife daughter two sons and other members of the family 
pug participates in the battle of midway his son byron hart 
bochner is a submarine commander in the pacific byrons jewish 
wife natalie jane seymour is trapped in europe with their child 
and her uncle author aaron jastrow sir john gielgud 
the sea battles look authentic when natalie and her uncle 
finally end up at auschwitz curtis filmed at the former nazi death 
camp and many of the extras were survivors of the holocaust in one 
scene reichsfuehrerss heinrich himmler visits auschwitz to watch a 
demonstration of a new method to kill large numbers of jews 
i told the extras i didnt know how they would react curtis 
said you probably dont expect to die but you know 
subconsciously something is going to happen what a tough thing to 
put them through the people began to cling to each other i was 
destroyed by what i was watching when they came running out with no 
clothes on it was so real 
you can sense what it must have been like if the audience can 
feel that then i will have accomplished what i set out to 
accomplish if we can do that it will all have been worth it

imagine this a restaurant trying to solicit 
business mails you a sample menu that leaves out prices and doesnt 
describe its dishes 
or how about a car dealership pitching its latest model that 
keeps the sticker price inside the trunk instead of on the side 
windows 
would either establishment be likely to get your business hardly 
yet many american consumers have had credit cards issued to them 
over the years without knowing beforehand all the exact terms such 
as the interest rates fees or grace periods involved 
last week president reagan signed longawaited legislation that 
changes all that the new law which goes into effect early next 
year forces all banks department stores and other credit card 
issuers to supply these details on applications and solicitations 
under current law creditors are not required to disclose the 
information until the card is issued 
now the sticker is on the window instead of hidden in the 
trunk so to speak noted robert k heady publisher of the north 
palm beach fla newsletter 100 highest yields which tracks the 
credit card industry but if the buyer shops around he can find a 
cheaper model 
thats good news for the more than 100 million us consumers who 
hold more than 800 million credit cards and have outstanding 
balances approaching 150 billion 
consumer groups had strongly backed the standardsetting 
legislation because it would allow people to shop for the best 
deals and banking groups liked the fact that the measure would 
prevent states from imposing differing disclosure requirements on 
their interstate industry 
from a consumer standpoint the main reason why we needed the 
disclosure law was because the whole creditcard industry since the 
early 1980s has taken a very sophisticated marketing approach 
said peggy miller a lobbyist with the consumer federation of 
america 
she said that while computers have made it easier for creditors 
to solicit business through the mail the nittygritty financial 
terms have remained too complicated and easily misinterpreted 
for the average person 
ms miller cited a poll conducted by credit card giant mastercard 
international four years ago it found among other things that of 
373 cardholders surveyed nationwide only 27 percent were aware they 
had an annual fee and a scant 17 percent knew the rate of interest 
they were paying 
consumer groups say more legislation is needed to give 
plastichappy consumers a fairer shake in the expanding credit 
world particularly in the area of interest rates which have 
remained historically high 
were pushing for an outright rate cap tied to the prime 
rate said ms miller 
heady said 100 highest yields latest weekly survey of the 
nations 100 largest banks and thrifts found the average rate on 
cards such as mastercard or visa was 1819 percent compared with an 
average 1881 percent three years ago the prime now stands at 10 
percent 
financial institutions have defended their rates as necessary to 
cover high operating costs and fraud 
but heady said theres a possibility the new disclosure law might 
make credit card rates more competitive especially if banks and 
thrifts now have to advertise them 
100 highest yields latest survey of large institutions found 
glendale federal savings and loan in glendale calif had the 
highest rate of 2090 percent last week while dime savings bank in

bush faces big problems with the budget and trade deficit 
which a popular reagan could avoid addressing a milanbased 
trader said 
if the dollar continues to weaken on such worries us interest 
rates could have to move higher to prop up the currency and that 
would depress stock prices they said 
foreign exchange dealers in italy said the dollar was depressed 
because dealers believed bushs narrowerthanexpected victory 
underlined what they saw as voters lack of enthusiasm for the new 
president 
however bush was expected to bring continued economic prosperity 
to the united states and a victory by his challenger michael 
dukakis would have been more bearish for the markets dealers have 
said 
equities dealers in london said bushs win had already been 
discounted by the market on tuesday when shares rallied strongly on 
londons stock exchange

a computer virus that appears to be a version of 
one created in pakistan has infected programs used by university of 
houston business students causing a nuisance but posing no real 
danger officials say 
the original socalled brain computer virus was traced to a 
computer store in lahore pakistan 
it probably hasnt cost us much except a few days of 
peopletime to clean up these disks but it probably cost the 
students a good bit of frustration said michael walters director 
of research and instructional computing services at the universitys 
main campus 
some students have reported losing data but walters said he 
knows of no one who has lost an entire term paper or other large 
quantity of work reports of the virus were still coming in from 
students late tuesday 
the virus first announced itself at the university early last 
week on the screen of one of the 150 personal computers the business 
department has for students and faculty walters said it has not 
spread to larger computers at the school he said 
a computer virus is a string of coded commands hidden in useful 
programs or software like a biological virus it uses its host to 
reproduce replicating itself into other programs used on the same 
computer or into computers to which it is connected 
since the affected university computers were isolated from each 
other and the outside world the virus spread was limited walters 
said last week a sophisticated virus spread along a computer 
network used by universities and defense contractors and eventually 
affected an estimated 6000 computers nationwide 
a virus can do damage in several ways by keeping a computer so 
busy with commands so that its operation becomes sluggish as 
happened with last weeks virus by using up memory or by erasing 
data 
walters said the virus at the houston school flashed this 
message with misspellings to students who tried to use infected 
programs welcome to the dungeon copyright 1968 brain amp amjads 
pvt ltd virus shoe record v90 dedicated to the dynamic memory of 
millions of virus who are no longer with us today thank goodness 
beware of the virus this program is catching program follows after 
these messeges 
the original brain virus appeared in may at colleges and 
businesses along the east coast it flashed the welcome to the 
dungeon message but added contact us for vaccination and 
gave the names address and phone number of two brothers who run a 
computer store in lahore pakistan 
walters said the houston version of the virus says nothing about 
any vaccine and the v90 in its message suggests it may be a 
modified version

the dollar weakened and stock and bond prices headed lower today 
in a cautious reaction to george bushs decisive victory over 
michael dukakis in the presidential election 
economists said several factors depressed the us currency 
including nervousness overseas over how the presidentelect would 
deal with crucial problems such as the budget and trade deficits and 
with the democaticcontrolled congress 
i think the markets already thought bush would win and are 
viewing the election as a nonevent but some uncertainty 
remains explained edward yardeni chief economist for prudential 
bache securities inc 
whats depressing the bonds and stocks is that the dollar is 
down pretty hard 
the dollar initially rallied overseas after bushs victory 
tuesday but it later eased in japan and europe largely on 
profittaking and it was down in early domestic trading despite 
reports of centralbank intervention 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 
178 to 212571 as of 11 am est after losing about 6 points in 
the first 30 minutes of trading the closely watched indicator had 
advanced 285 points in election day trading

on the treasurys bellwether 30year issue rose to 9 percent for the 
first time in more than a month by late morning while its price 
fell about 750 per 1000 face amount shortterm rates were up 
slightly 
stock and bond prices had edged higher and the dollar rose 
against major foreign currencies on tuesday partly because of 
confidence that republican bush would defeat democrat dukakis and 
that the victory would mean continuation of the reagan 
administrations economic policies

a former top economic advisor to president 
reagan warned presidentelect george bush wednesday against the 
danger of a trade war between the united states and western europe 
which could spill over into the far east 
martin feldstein former head of reagans council of economic 
advisors also called for a drop of at least 20 percent in the value 
of the dollar over the next three years to help reduce the us 
trade deficit 
the dollar should be worth 100 japanese yen or less instead of 
the current 125 yen he said 
a cheaper dollar makes us exports more attractive in foreign 
markets 
feldstein now a professor at harvard university was speaking to 
a conference of international investors sponsored by the american 
stock exchange 
he attacked the new trade bill signed by reagan calling it a 
terrible bill 
its no exaggeration to say that any american company with a 
trade problem can now start a case against any country in the 
world feldstein said 
he also warned against future efforts to protect trade among the 
12 countries of the european economic community which plans to 
abolish remaining trade barriers within the group by 1992 
if more competitive us exports are combined with irritating 
litigation in the united states to restrict imports the europeans 
will turn to their own markets and try to exclude other countries 
from them feldstein predicted he said the result would be a trade 
war between the united states and europe that could spread to the 
pacific 
a reduced us trade deficit would help avoid that problem 
feldstein said

the check is in the mail 
in fact 348 million of them have been mailed in the last few 
days by the eastman kodak co which is trying to wind up the 
courtapproved settlement with owners of kodak instant cameras 
kodak agreed to pay more than 106 million in cash and 89 
million in certificates for rebates on purchases of kodak products 
almost everyones check should arrive by the end of the week 
kodak spokesman paul allen said tuesday 
the minimum payout on such basic models as the handle it had a 
crank to advance the film is 50 a check for 1950 and three 
certificates totaling 3050 in rebates the maximum is 70 for 
topoftheline models 52 in cash and 18 in rebates 
the certificates are valid through 1989 so total cost of the 
settlement to kodak wont be known until sometime in 1990 allen 
said the company has estimated that the whole package will cost 
close to 150 million 
still unresolved is compensation of the lawyers who handled the 
classaction suit against kodak on behalf of the camera owners the 
courtapproved settlement allowed 6 million but required the 
lawyers to submit claims and supporting documents 
the whole case is an expensive offshoot of the suit polaroid 
corp filed against kodak in april 1976 when kodak introduced its 
own instant cameras and film polaroid said kodak infringed on its 
patents 
after losing several rounds in courts kodak withdrew from 
instant photography in january 1986

george bushs honeymoon in european financial 
circles proved brief wednesday as concerns about his ability to 
tackle the us twin deficits quickly overshadowed relief at the 
election of a republican president who would carry on the legacy of 
ronald reagan 
foreign officials immediately began to apply pressure on the 
newly elected president to reduce the deficits which are viewed in 
europe as the united states biggest economic problem and a danger 
to economies worldwide 
stock prices declined in european markets in reaction to the 
election results and the dollars value fell against major foreign 
currencies after a brief rally wednesday morning 
many europeans are skeptical that bush will be able reduce the 
deficits because of his pledge to avoid tax increases they said the 
task would be complicated further by the continuation of a 
democratic majority in the american congress 
the fact that bush hasnt outlined any specific plans for 
addressing the budget deficit also added to the unease in europe 
european economists predicted that the us currency will decline 
further and the worlds stock markets will remain depressed over the 
next three months because of deficit fears 
despite the uncertainties european investors still appeared to 
favor bush over his defeated democratic challenger michael dukakis 
certainly there was a sigh of relief that it was bush said 
keith skeoch chief economist at the london investment firm james 
capel and co 
we believe we will not see a major or dramatic change in the 
economic development in the coming months said peter pietsch a 
senior economist at commerzbank in frankfurt hes against 
experiments even that alone is a help 
what is particularly important to europe which exports its 
products to the united states is that bush has a good record as a 
freetrader the economists said 
hes supposed to be against protectionism and thats important 
for the markets pietsch said 
but skeoch added i dont think that you will see the usual 
honeymoon period we appear to have a budget impasse and there 
doesnt appear to be any resolution in the cards 
in addition the us trade deficit is expected to remain at its 
high levels skeoch said 
the budget and trade deficits curb us economic growth and push 
up interests rates which hurt the worlds other economies 
although the economists expect the us economy to keep growing 
they said lack of action on the deficits poses grave risks of 
precipitating a major world recession 
the rest of the worlds major industrial powers linked 
informally to the united states in the socalled group of seven 
will be eager for bush to make some statement about how he intends 
to manage these problems skeoch said the other g7 nations are 
germany japan france britain canada and italy 
during the campaign many countries played down their concerns 
about the deficits in order to avoid meddling in the us 
presidential election skeoch said 
i think the kid gloves are coming off he said 
in tokyo earlier wednesday after bushs victory the bank of 
japan reportedly said it wasnt optimistic about the chances of 
narrowing the us budget deficit 
also wednesday willy de clercq a leading west european trade 
official called on bush to reduce the deficits to ease 
protectionist pressures in congress 
on monday british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
warned in a british broadcasting corp television interview that he 
feared a loss of confidence in the dollar unless the new 
administration took early steps to get to grips with the deficit 
problems 
the g7 cooperation and diplomacy are starting to come away at 
the edges skeoch said 
the confederation of british industry saying it cautiously 
welcomed bushs victory expressed concern that the democratic 
control of capitol hill would lead to a continuation of a conflict 
on the key issues like protectionism

stock prices closed lower after flipflopping most 
of the day pressured by a weaker dollar and concerns about the 
economy under a new administration 
some analysts said they were surprised by the selling activity 
that erupted at the opening bell they said the weaker dollar was 
only partly to blame 
i guess the market is saying its worried more about the 
economy than about the election said carter randall money 
manager for the randall co in florida 
other observers said the bearish sentiment was to be expected as 
investors put the election behind them and began to question life 
under a george bush administration 
the market is back to thinking about fundamental questions 
about the economy said alfred e goldman vice president of ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis the big question is how is he 
going to handle the federal budget deficit particularly since he 
painted himself into a corner by saying there wouldnt be any tax 
increases 
the market reversed its slide before midday but continued its 
decline in afternoon trading influenced by the continued slide in 
the dollar despite several attempts by the federal reserve to 
support the currency 
the dollar weakened further at one point in the day after remarks 
by economist martin feldstein a bush adviser that the dollar had 
to go lower to extend the economic recovery and help the us trade 
deficit the fall in the dollar sent bond prices tumbling 
the bond and dollar have combined to put pressure on the 
market goldman said the softer dollar conjures up fears that 
the fed will have to come in and support the dollar by raising 
interest rates 
a weaker currency also erodes the value of dollardenominated 
securities

investors on wednesday gave george bush a warning 
to fix the us trade and budget deficits in a surprisingly cool 
postelection reception that battered the dollar and forced stocks 
and bonds lower 
although a bush win in the presidential race had been anticipated 
and welcomed by the markets economists said investors grew worried 
over how the new republican president and democraticcontrolled 
congress would work together to trim the deficits among other 
things 
i look at it as basic economic reality vs political 
constraints said robert a brusca chief financial economist for 
nikko securities co international bush has said there would be 
no tax increase so that will mean budget cuts the impasse will 
be over where to cut 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials dropped 
925 to 211824 recovering some lost ground in the final 90 
an election that treated incumbents kindly yet 
one that produced its fair share of fresh faces 
the new senators included joseph lieberman in connecticut a 
democrat who ended lowell weickers maverick career after three 
terms former govs charles robb in virginia and robert kerrey in 
nebraska turned republican senate seats into democratic ones gov 
richard bryan of nevada ousted freshman gop sen chic hecht in 
nevada 
herbert kohl was elected wisconsins new democratic senator 
conrad burns in montana was the only republican to defeat a 
senate democratic incumbent he beat john melcher seeking a third 
term 
other newly elected republicans in the senate included rep trent 
lott from mississippi and rep james jeffords from vermont both of 
whom won open seats slade gorton of washington defeated in a 
reelection bid two years ago mounted a successful comeback 
one republican sen malcolm wallop of wyoming squeaked to a new 
term 
though a few house incumbents remained locked in tough races on 
the afternoon after the election that didnt change the overall 
picture incumbency was practically a guarantee of victory 
the few exceptions to the rule included rep fernand j st 
germain a 14term veteran and chairman of the house banking 
committee beset by charges of ethical lapses he fell to political 
newcomer ronald machtley 
three republican incumbents were turned out of office including 
pat swindall in georgia who was defeated by ben jones swindall 
faces perjury charges 
other gop incumbents who fell included freshman jack davis in 
illinois and mac sweeney in texas 
democrats picked up statehouse offices formerly held by 
republicans including indiana where 32yearold evan bayh wrested 
control from the republicans for the first time in 20 years gaston 
caperton ousted gop gov arch moore in west virginia 
republicans countered with one takeaway of their own when stan 
stephens won the montana statehouse for the gop for the first time 
in 16 years 
two republican incumbents survived close calls 
gov edward diprete overcame allegations of unethical conduct in 
rhode island to defeat a democratic businessman for the second time 
in two years while fellow republican norm bangerter was reelected 
in utah 
republican rep judd gregg stepped up to the new hampshire

of bostons new york office 
dealers said the dollars selloff intensified after economist 
martin feldstein called for a 10 percent to 20 percent decline in 
the dollar over the next three years 
feldstein the former head of president reagans council of 
economic advisors and now a professor at harvard university told a 
conference of international investors sponsored by the american 
stock exchange that the dollar must fall if the united states is to 
reduce its trade imbalance and continue its economic recovery 
dealers said they expect the dollar to test lower ranges as 
bushs narrowerthanexpected victory underlined what they saw as 
voters lack of enthusiasm for the president elect in addition 
traders also focused on the difficulties bush is likely to 
experience in trying to plow legislation through a 
democratcontrolled congress

yen later in london it dropped to 12420 yen in new york the

stock prices fell in moderate trading wednesday 
as the market skipped a presidential victory celebration and moved 
instead to a postelection hangover 
a victory by george bush failed to rally the market which 
dwelled instead on the economic problems facing the new 
administration specifically the trade and budget deficits 
a falling dollar and weaker bond prices also pressured the stock 
market along with a suggestion by senate republican leader bob dole 
that the new president consider eliminating interest payment 
deductions for loans used in corporate buyouts 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials closed down 925 points 
at 211824 after an erratic session in which the bluechip

election it looked like an ordinary day with all the predictable 
things like the dollar 
but with the election there were more serious questions than 
answers what kind of president is george bush going to be hes not 
going to be reagan 
analysts said investors were mostly worried about the twin 
deficits which if allowed to swell could pressure interest rates 
higher and possibly precipitate a recession

prices of frozen porkbelly futures plummeted wednesday on the 
chicago mercantile exchange in reaction to a report indicating the 
meat industry was cramming the raw unsliced bacon meat into 
freezers at a record pace 
on other markets livestock futures also fell precious metals 
and copper futures rose sharply grains and soybeans were mixed 
energy futures advanced and stockindex futures retreated 
speculators have bid prices of porkbelly futures so high 
relative to the cash market that it has become more profitable for 
the meat industry to store bellies for sale at some future date than 
to sell them fresh analysts said 
one consequence of this situation was revealed on tuesday when 
the chicago mercantile exchange issued a weekly report showing that 
the amount of frozen pork bellies in exchangeapproved warehouses 
outside of chicago increased last week by 85 million pounds 
that increase plus a 13millionpound rise in chicago warehouse 
stocks and a probable 1millionpound increase in warehouses that do 
not report to the chicago merc brought the total movement into 
warehouses for last week to nearly 11 million pounds estimated 
charles levitt senior livestock analyst with shearson lehman hutton 
inc in chicago 
the biggest increase in storage accumulation for any single 
month occurred in december of 1970 when we stored 344 million 
pounds nationally levitt said we are storing at a rate thats 
faster than that 
the report sparked a dramatic selloff in the futures market 
wednesday frozen pork bellies futures settled 150 cents to 165 
cents lower with the contract for delivery in february at 4430 
cents a pound 
the spread between the cash and futures is still about 11 
cents even with todays futures break levitt said all you 
need to cover all your costs of storing bellies from now into 
february when theyre deliverable is eight to 10 cents anything 
on top of that is gravy for the industry 
the vast buildup in supplies of pork bellies forced prices to 
8year lows in july and prices of both cash and futures remain 
sharply below their averages of the past seven years 
but the aggressive storing of bellies likely will continue until 
futures prices fall far enough to remove the profit incentive for 
stashing bellies in freezers analysts said 
most livestock futures retreated in sympathy with the sharp drop 
in porkbelly futures analysts said 
live cattle were 80 cent lower to 05 cent higher with december 
at 7302 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 68 cent 
lower with november at 8110 cents a pound live hogs were 10 cent 
to 138 cents lower with december at 4062 cents a pound 
preciousmetals futures surged as the dollar weakened 
substantially against other currencies encouraging buying from all 
directions 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 340 to 4 higher 
with december at 42470 a troy ounce silver was 155 cents to 164 
cents higher with december at 658 a troy ounce platinum settled 
1550 to 1760 higher on the new york mercantile exchange with 
january at 59060 a troy ounce 
copper posted strong gains on the comex on news of further supply 
tightness caused by the 3weekold miners strike in peru 
copper settled 2 cents to 33 cents higher with december at 
1456 a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago 
board of trade in light cautious trading ahead of the agriculture 
departments crop production report 
the usda projected a corn harvest of 467 billion bushels down 
34 percent from last year and a soybean harvest of 151 billion 
bushels 21 percent below last years level 
the new corn production estimate was higher than expected so 
analysts predicted lower corn futures prices on thursday the 
soybean number fell within the range of analysts expectations 
wheat settled 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with december at 
425 a bushel corn was cent lower to cent higher with 
december at 279 a bushel oats were cent lower to cent higher 
with december at 223 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent lower to 
cent higher with november at 796 a bushel 
concerns about tight gasoline supplies propelled energy prices 
higher on the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 9 cents 
higher with december at 1386 a barrel heating oil was 35 cent to 
99 cent higher with december at 4452 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was unchanged to 86 cent higher with december at 4726 
cents a gallon 
stockindex futures fell modestly on the chicago mercantile

a large insurance company filed a lawsuit 
wednesday and threatened to abandon the california market after 
voters narrowly approved a measure sharply cutting the cost of auto 
insurance 
in new york stocks of several companies handling large amounts 
of insurance in california dropped in early trading with the news 
that the ralph naderbacked initiative had passed but they 
recovered by the end of the day to end narrowly mixed 
the approval of the initiative was a heavy blow to the insurance 
industry which spent at least 60 million backing its own measures 
and battling the nader initiative and another ratecutting proposal 
by consumers and trial lawyers the measures by the industry and 
attorneys were defeated 
i think its a significant victory for the voters in 
california that they were able to withstand the incredible barrage 
of misleading advertising by the insurance industry said carmen 
gonzales spokeswoman for voter revolt which sponsored proposition 
103 
under the proposition insurers must lower almost all insurance 
rates including auto home and business coverage by an immediate 
20 percent below november 1987 rates it would require an additional 
20 percent cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers 
the measure also puts control over future rate increases in the 
hands of an elected insurance commissioner strictly limits use of 
territorial rating to set auto insurance premiums and subjects the 
industry to state antitrust and unfair business practice laws 
insurers had argued that proposition 103 was unconstitutional on 
the grounds it would force corporations to operate at a loss some 
companies have said the rate cuts would force them out of business 
in california 
in filing a lawsuit seeking to block the cuts firemans fund 
chairman william mccormick said we have no choice but to 
immediately take action to protect our business and our rights we 
hope that this situation will be corrected so that we can maintain 
our strong presence in the state of california 
firemans fund also said it will advise its agents and auto 
policyholders that it plans to withdraw from the california personal 
car insurance market 
firemans fund which has 78000 personal auto policies and 
138000 homeowners policies in california said proposition 103 
could drain more than 100 million from the company in its most 
important market 
bill zimmerman campaign manager for proposition 103 said 
earlier that his organization hoped to avoid a lawsuit with the 
industry 
the first thing well do he said is appeal to the 
insurance industry not to be sore losers but he added we have 
a team of lawyers ready to follow them to the courthouse doors 
proposition 103 passed by 511 percent yes votes to 489 percent 
against 
the four other insurancerelated measures that were defeated 
included the industrys nofault insurance proposal proposition 
104 and the insurers companion measure proposition 106 which 
would have cut fees charged by trial lawyers representing people 
suing insurers 
the fact the insurance and trial lawyers measures failed is an 
indication that people are sick and tired of special interests 
meddling with the initiative process said proposition 103 author 
harvey rosenfield 
voters also rejected proposition 100 by consumer groups and trial 
lawyers which would have granted good drivers a 20 percent rate 
cut and proposition 101 sponsored by a state assemblyman and an 
independent insurance company to cut insurance costs for bodily 
injury coverage

the navy making good on a recent pledge by its 
top admiral has awarded an 895 million contract to the general 
electric co to build and test an electricdrive propulsion system 
for future warships 
the service said in a brieadministration and the us department of 
defense this morning we 
were able to negotiate a longterm contract with certain aerospace 
industry companies that will allow avtex fibersfront royal to 
return to full production of its fiber products avtex chairman 
john n gregg said in a statement 
gregg announced oct 31 he was closing the 49yearold mill 
citing foreign competition and stiff environmental regulations the 
announcement sent nasa the department of defense and an array of 
government contractors scrambling to figure out what the impact 
would be on the space shuttle program and other projects that depend 
on a carbonizable rayon fiber 
nasa has said it has enough of the material on hand for another 
10 shuttle flights 
aerospace industry officials met with gregg last week in salt 
lake city 
avtex still faces problems stemming from environmental and safety

the chubb corp agreed wednesday to a 48 
million settlement covering farmers in 10 midwestern states who sued 
the company when their applications for 1988 drought insurance were 
denied 
the settlement must be approved by us district judge carl rubin 
in cincinnati chubb said it would deposit 48125 million with the 
court early next eek as part of the agreement 
a lawsuit potentially representing 8000 farmers in 10 states was 
filed in federal court in cincinnati and was scheduled for trial 
jan 3 before rubin 
the farmers alleged that chubb which is based in warren nj 
unfairly denied them insurance against crop damage caused by this 
years severe summer drought 
attorneys spent much of tuesday negotiating the settlement which 
was announced wednesday evening 
im very pleased said stanley m chesley a cincinnati 
lawyer representing the farmers i think this is going to work 
the key is farmers are going to get 100 cents on a dollar throughout 
all 10 states 
chubb said the 48 million should be enough to cover anticipated 
payments to farmers who didnt receive policies as well as 
expenses attorneys fees and other distributions determined by 
rubin 
the farmers will receive amounts equal to the losses that would 
have been paid if they had been policy holders minus what premiums 
would have cost and any goodwill payments already made to them 
chubb said in a statement 
chubb said it decided to settle for a number of reasons it noted 
that last october when the case was being prepared for trial there 
was evidence which substantially affected chubbs ability to 
pursue the defense of this litigation 
chubb said that included testimony of witnesses indicating that 
officials of good weather international which served as an agent 
for chubb in selling the insurance had acted contrary to chubbs 
specific instructions in several material respects this newly 
discovered evidence dictated that chubb pursue a settlement rather 
than protracted and costly litigation 
the lawsuit potentially represents 8000 farmers in ohio 
kentucky indiana tennessee illinois minnesota michigan 
missouri iowa and wisconsin 
chubb last week offered 437 million in coverage to some farmers 
whose insurance applications it had rejected this year some states 
including ohio have been reviewing the manner in which chubb 
through its federal insurance co subsidiary marketed the drought 
insurance and denied some applications for it 
chesley had told rubin that chubb was trying to settle with some 
but not all of the farmers represented in the classaction suit 
chubb began rejecting payments in the middle of the year when it 
said brokers sold more coverage than planned chubb lawyers said the 
company was prepared to sell about 40 million in coverage but 
brokers sold more than 300 million 
chubb spokeswoman gail devlin said last week that the company had 
made 11 million in goodwill payments to drought insurance 
applicants and planned no additional payments 
the company said on oct 17 that its federal insurance subsidiary 
issued 1176 policies in seven midwestern states in the 1988 drought 
insurance program with those policies extending a total of 43 
million in coverage chubb said federal insurance suffered 20 
million in losses on those policies and has paid virtually all of 
the losses to the policyholders

gte corp said wednesday that it will cut 
nearly 7000 jobs over the next four years as a result of a 
restructuring of its telephone operations 
an unspecified number of additional jobs will be lost over the 
next five years in staff reductions unrelated to the companys 
restructuring said gte chairman james rocky johnson in a 
statement 
the cuts will come mostly from the middle management ranks 
although some hourly employees will be let go gte employs roughly 
160000 people worldwide some 85000 people are employed in the 
companys domestic telephone operations of which 28000 are middle 
managers 
the job reductions are expected to generate substantial annual 
cost savings which will be reflected over time in rate reductions 
to gte customers and in improved earnings for gte shareholders 
johnson said 
the company which will lay off people only as a last resort 
said a fair portion of the cuts come from employees opting for early 
retirement 
we expect as many as 2000 people may take advantage of this 
early retirement option said kent b foster group vice 
president of gte telephone operating group gte already has begun 
informing employees about early retirement benefits 
in addition foster said the company has had a virtual hiring 
freeze in place throughout most of this year so a number of 
alreadyvacant positions simply will go unfilled 
he said that some employees will be reassigned to positions in 
other gte businesses 
some layoffs are inevitable however and will be used only as 
a last resort foster said the majority of these will come from 
our management ranks and will occur over time 
the company would not project the number that will be laid off 
gte announced plans to streamline its telephone operations in 
march to continue improving service quality and to become faster 
more flexible and responsive to customer requirements 
geoff johnson telecommunications analyst with argus research in 
new york said the job cuts are needed 
they definitely have too many people relative to other 
telephone companies he said its also part of a broader trend 
in the industry everyone has been trying to cut costs and 
reducing through attrition or early retirement 
arguss johnson projected that gtes plan could save about 93 
million a year for three years that does not include severance 
costs 
this is obviously positive for the bottom line johnson said 
gte had combined revenues and sales totaling 154 billion in 
1987 its three core businesses telecommunications lighting and 
precision materials employ about 161000 people in 44 states and 
38 other countries

federal regulators are growing increasingly 
concerned about the vulnerability of banks participating in 
corporate takeovers through leveraged buyouts 
a spokeswoman for the office of the comptroller of the currency 
which regulates 4450 nationally chartered banks said tuesday that 
the agencys examiners will receive new guidelines within the next 
several weeks requiring them to evaluate institutions risk from 
making loans in leveraged buyouts or lbos 
we want to make sure banks are doing a very careful analysis of 
exactly what the risks are spokeswoman lee cross said 
the issue has taken on greater significance recently as an 
unprecedented wave of multibilliondollar lbo proposals financed 
partly by billions in bank loans swept over wall street 
two weeks ago federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
whose agency regulates bank holding companies told the senate 
banking committee that he has warned banks making leveraged buyout 
loans to consider borrowers prospects in a range of economic and 
financial circumstances 
l william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp which insures commercial bank deposits has said the 
proliferation of lbos is increasing the risk to the financial system 
in a leveraged buyout such as kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos 
206 billion bid for rjr nabisco inc an investment group borrows 
heavily in order to purchase stock and take over the company 
the debt is repaid either with the acquired companys cash flow 
or with mopney raised by the sale of its assets 
the popularity of such deals and the resulting mushrooming of 
debt has raised concern about the ability of debtburdened companies 
to withstand an economic downturn 
critics say most of the deals have been assembled since 1982 
when the economy began expanding and have not been tested by a 
recession 
if a highly capitalized company suffers a downturn the value of 
its stock falls however a highly leveraged company could be forced 
into bankruptcy if a bad economy makes it unable to meet its debt 
payments 
according to loan pricing corp a new york company which 
monitors large bank loans to corporations banks have lent 70 
billion to highlyleveraged transactions since mid1987 lbo and 
takeover lending comprised 59 percent of the banks big corporate 
loans in the julyseptember quarter 
ms cross said the comptrollers office began revising its lbo 
guidelines after surveying the practices of 11 large money center 
banks and five regional institutions in late spring and early summer 
we found that so far the banks that have been involved seem to 
have taken a pretty reasonable approach no bank was 
perfectbut we did not see any really substantial problems ms 
cross said 
but she said our concern now is going forward as competition 
in this area heats up she said banks with less experience in lbos 
are likely to enter the lucrative area 
also so far most lbos have been put together for large 
wellestablished companies in stable industries in the future more 
lbos may be undertaken of riskier companies 
the new comptrollers guidelines will not impose limits on lbo 
lending but will direct examiners to determine if a banks policies 
include limits on lbo lending as a whole and limits for single 
deals ms cross said 
she said examiners also will be checking to see if banks are 
establishing adequate reserves against expected losses and whether 
they have systems in place to properly track the performance of the 
loans 
one problem in developing the guidelines is that banks have 
widely varying definitions for what they consider highly leveraged 
lending she said 
the federal reserve bank of new york is working on a definition 
of highly leveraged debt which will be ready in several months 
said spokesman peter bakstansky

the trade and industry ministry is 
projecting that south koreas trade surplus will shrink by 2 
billion to 25 billion to 5 billion next year due to a slowdown in 
exports caused by a strengthening korean won currency 
under the projection officials said korean exports next year 
likely will rise 118 percent to 129 percent from this year and 
imports are expected to soar 173 percent to 61 billion 
the ministry predicted a trade surplus of 7 billion to 75 
billion for this year 
korean exports in the first 10 months of this year increased 28 
percent from a year ago to 481 billion and imports increased by 
283 percent to 422 billion according to the ministry 
under pressure from the united states the won so far this year 
has gone up 137 percent against the dollar and is generally 
expected to strengthen further for a possible annual appreciation of 
up to 183 percent 
the dollar was valued at 69760 won tuesday in new york 
some korean businessmen have said that at the present pace the 
won may rise to about 600 won to the dollar by the end of next year 
a stronger won would make korean goods more expensive abroad 
reducing their export competitiveness there has been some us 
government criticism that south korean has been supporting its 
exports by keeping the wons value too low against the dollar

grand metropolitan plc on wednesday extended 
until midnight monday its 523 billion offer to buy pillsbury co 
a move that one analyst said keeps the pressure on pillsburys board 
meanwhile grand met said pillsbury shareholders had tendered 
nearly threequarters of their shares to the british spirits 
restaurant and consumer products company 
it is time for pillsburys management and board to act in 
accordance with the wishes of their shareholders said ian a 
martin chief executive of us operations for the british 
conglomerate 
grand mets 60pershare cash offer to buy all outstanding 
shares of pillsbury common stock had been scheduled to expire 
tuesday night but grand met said before trading opened wednesday on 
the new york stock exchange that it was extending the offer until 
midnight monday nov 14 
in trading on the new york stock exchange pillsbury fell 25 
cents a share to 5850 
analysts had speculated that grand met would extend the offer 
because it wants to demonstrate to pillsbury a strong showing among 
shareholders who have agreed to sell their shares 
grand met had to say how many shares were offered for sale or 
tendered if it was to extend the buyout offer with the offer 
extended however shareholders can take back their shares until the 
next grand met deadline 
grand met said that as the tuesday night deadline neared 634 
million shares of pillsbury common stock representing about 743 
percent of the outstanding shares had been tendered 
i think the ball is back in pillsburys court said craig 
carver securities analyst with dain bosworth inc in minneapolis 
i think grand met is continuing to apply pressure to 
pillsburys board grand met is obviously dealing from strength 
here 
carver said he expects the two companies will sit down and 
negotiate at the table 
pillsbury announced monday that it plans to spin off burger king 
corp to shareholders and possibly to pay onetime cash and 
securities dividends through burger king as part of an overall plan 
that the company says will reap greater longerterm value for 
shareholders 
grand mets martin noted that his companys offer is conditioned 
upon redemption of pillsburys poison pill defense plan 
because pillsbury has not redeemed its poison pill we have not 
purchased the tendered pillsbury shares even though a large 
majority of the outstanding shares has been tendered to us martin 
said 
on monday justice william duffy of the delaware chancery court 
denied grand mets motion to invalidate pillsburys poison pill 
defense he ruled that as of oct 17 pillsburys directors had not 
abdicated their responsibility to shareholders in rejecting grand 
mets offer 
after pillsbury announced that it was spinning off burger king 
grand met renewed its motion before the delaware chancery court for 
a preliminary injunction directing pillsbury to redeem the poison 
pill 
on wednesday duffy denied grand mets request for a rehearing 
but he said he could still consider scheduling another hearing on 
the issue if grand met files new evidence in the future 
pillsbury also is protected by several other state antitakeover 
laws and liquor laws that bar a distiller from also owning 
restaurants 
grand met is challenging those defenses in various courts and 
negotiating with state liquor authorities grand met has said it 
would sell the affected pillsbury restaurants

polaroid corp chairman i macallister 
booth testified wednesday that the company long had considered an 
employee stock ownsership plan and did not slap one together to 
block a takeover by shamrock holdings inc 
booth making his first appearance on the stand in the delaware 
chancery court trial of shamrocks suit to block the plan portrayed 
polaroid as a company that is concerned about its workers and was 
surprised by shamrocks takeover assault last summer 
this was a jolt wow booth said of a june letter from 
shamrock president stanley p gold indicating interest in polaroid 
someone was saying you are vulnerable 
after two to three years of rumorssomeone was sending a 
message and we needed to demonstrate that we are doing something to 
improve the profitability of the company 
shamrock the disney familycontrolled concern based in burbank 
calif is asking vice chancellor carolyn berger to overturn the 
10millionshare 300 million stock plan that polaroid uneveiled 
july 12 just one day before a scheduled meeting with shamrock 
the plan would all but block a takeover because it puts 14 
percent of polaroid stock in the hands of employees under delaware 
takeover law a hostile bidder must acquire more than 85 percent of 
a targets outstanding shares for control polaroid which is based 
in cambridge mass is incorporated in delaware 
shamrock on july 19 made a friendly 40ashare bid for polaroid 
it later made a hostile 42ashare offer that polaroid has urged 
its stockholders to reject the takeover hinges on the outcome of 
the trial 
polaroids board envisioned a 5 percent esop on march 29 before 
increasing it to 14 percent at its july meeting booth in more than 
five hours of testimony said the plan was undertaken to increase 
worker motivation and that polaroid had talked about an employee 
stock plan as long as 15 years ago 
this was the thing to do booth said we were tying 
together our employees and shareholders in a tight way it seemed to 
be a winwin situation 
booth admitted that low profits the possibility of a large 
damage award in a patent infringement case against eastman kodak 
co undervalued real estate assets and high research spending made 
the company an attractive target 
in fact he said polaroid had the investment banking firm 
shearson lehman hutton inc develop a vulnerability profile of 
the company last march the same time booth asked polaroids board 
for permission to study an esop 
booth said he supported an esop as a way to align the company 
with the board and the shareholders at a 1985 board meeting 
there was a real separation between shareholders and the 
employees he said the employees did not relate to the 
shareholders i tried to explain that bonding between employees and 
owners was vital 
under questioning from polaroid attorney frederick ao schwartz 
booth denied that polaroid deceived shamrock by abruptly canceling 
the scheduled july 13 meeting he said he couldnt meet with 
shamrock because i needed that time to talk to employees 
booth also denied the esop was designed to entrench management 
saying that he is forfeiting 200000 to 300000 in bonus 
compensation next year because of a stipulation in the plan 
booth is not scheduled for crossexamination until next monday

a washington utility said late wednesday it 
would not join 14 other utilities in a 226 million settlement that 
would remove it from the washington public power supply system 
securities fraud trial 
however commissioners for the snohomish county public utility 
district said they were not ruling out any chance of reaching a 
settlement agreement 
the commissioners disclosed the decision which came less than 24 
hours before the deadline for joining the settlement after an 
evening meeting with a courtappointed settlement master 
the three commissioners took no action after their meeting with 
settlement master junius hoffman and no further talks were 
scheduled commission president matt dillon said in a statement 
we have a great deal of confidence in the judicial system and 
the jurys good judgment and common sense he said 
the trial stems from lawsuits brought after wppss defaulted in 
1983 on 225 billion in municipal bonds used to finance 
construction of two nuclear power plants that never were completed 
dillon did not reveal details of the meeting but called the 
discussion a frank exchange of views 
hoffman summoned the commissioners by a special court order in an 
attempt to persuade them to accept the proposed settlement 
snohomish had until 5 pm local time thursday to decide whether 
to join 14 former utility defendants which agreed on oct 31 to the 
settlement with buyers of wppss municipal bonds 
the settlement called for snohomish to pay 486 million for its 
13percent share of the project that amount would have been in 
addition to the 226 million which includes contributions of 35 
million from the federal bonneville power administration and 10 
million from washington state 
under the settlement provisions the plaintiffs now cannot settle 
out of court with snohomish for less than 58 million 
chuck shigley the utilitys commissioner administrator said the 
failure to reach a settlement now does not close the door the 
commission has always said it is interested in a fair settlement 
snohomish is the sole utility remaining in the case stemming from 
the 1983 default the largest muncipal bond default in us history 
bonneville the federal power broker for the pacific northwest 
had insisted on the deadline for snohomish plaintiffs attorney mel 
weiss has said 
snohomish engineering firms ebasco services inc and united 
engineers and contractors inc and financial adviser blyth eastman 
paine webber inc are the only defendants remaining in the trial 
chemical bank of new york a trustee for bondholders and a class 
of more than 24000 bondbuyers accuse the defendants of conspiring 
to lie and hide information that might have discouraged potential 
bond investorsthe plants a joint project of wppss and 88 
utilities were scrapped unfinished in 1982

at least 47 insurance companies refused 
wednesday to write auto insurance policies in california under the 
20percent rate rollback provisions of a state proposition question 
the ballot question aimed at skyrocketing insurance rates 
narrowly passed in tuesdays election and was immediately challenged 
wednesday in state supreme court by insurers 
don stewart executive director of the american agents alliance 
insurance organization said at least 47 companies stopped writing 
policies except those assignedrisk plans mandated by california 
law 
its chaos for the companies stewart said we foresaw 
proposition 103 being a disaster but we simply didnt get the 
message over to the public 
stewart said companies that have stopped issuing new polices 
include transamerica insurance group the travelers cos allstate 
hartford insurance group 20th century and safeco insurance co of 
america 
in a related move a los angeles superior court judge ruled 
wednesday that two los angeles surety bond companies be temporarily 
exempted from reducing rates as required opening the door for other 
challenges 
in new york stocks of several companies handling large amounts 
of insurance in california dropped in early trading with the news 
that the ralph naderbacked initiative had passed 
the approval of the initiative was a heavy blow to the insurance 
industry which spent at least 60 million backing its own measures 
and battling the nader initiative and another ratecutting proposal 
by consumers and trial lawyers the measures by the industry and 
attorneys were defeated 
i think its a significant victory for the voters in 
california that they were able to withstand the incredible barrage 
of misleading advertising by the insurance industry said carmen 
gonzales spokeswoman for voter revolt which sponsored proposition 
103 
under the proposition insurers must lower almost all insurance 
rates including auto home and business coverage by an immediate 
20 percent below november 1987 rates it would require an additional 
20 percent cut in auto insurance rates for good drivers 
the measure also puts control over future rate increases in the 
hands of an elected insurance commissioner strictly limits use of 
territorial rating to set auto insurance premiums and subjects the 
industry to state antitrust and unfair business practice laws 
insurers had argued that proposition 103 was unconstitutional on 
the grounds it would force corporations to operate at a loss some 
companies have said the rate cuts would force them out of business 
in california 
in filing a lawsuit seeking to block the cuts firemans fund 
chairman william mccormick said we have no choice but to 
immediately take action to protect our business and our rights we 
hope that this situation will be corrected so that we can maintain 
our strong presence in the state of california 
firemans fund also said it will advise its agents and auto 
policyholders that it plans to withdraw from the california personal 
car insurance market 
firemans fund which has 78000 personal auto policies and 
138000 homeowners policies in california said proposition 103 
could drain more than 100 million from the company in its most 
important market 
bill zimmerman campaign manager for proposition 103 said 
earlier that his organization hoped to avoid a lawsuit with the 
industry 
the first thing well do he said is appeal to the 
insurance industry not to be sore losers but he added we have 
a team of lawyers ready to follow them to the courthouse doors 
proposition 103 passed by 511 percent yes votes to 489 percent 
against 
the four other insurancerelated measures that were defeated 
included the industrys nofault insurance proposal proposition 
104 and the insurers companion measure proposition 106 which 
would have cut fees charged by trial lawyers representing people 
suing insurers 
the fact the insurance and trial lawyers measures failed is an 
indication that people are sick and tired of special interests 
meddling with the initiative process said proposition 103 author 
harvey rosenfield 
voters also rejected proposition 100 by consumer groups and trial 
lawyers which would have granted good drivers a 20 percent rate 
cut and proposition 101 sponsored by a state assemblyman and an 
independent insurance company to cut insurance costs for bodily 
injury coverage
