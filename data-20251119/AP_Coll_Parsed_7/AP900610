2 live crew took xrated pokes at local 
law officials but performed without incident just hours after a 
record store owner was arrested for selling the rap groups as 
nasty as they wanna be 
this city has a lot greater problems to deal with than who is 
performing at club nu city commissioner bruce singer said before 
friday nights show 
the miami rappers played for 45 minutes to a packed house at 
club nu which holds about 1500 they took profanitylaced verbal 
jabs at broward county sheriff nick navarro and gov bob martinez 
who have attacked the groups sexually explicit lyrics 
on saturday about 150 anticensorship activists staged a brief 
protest at the coral gables home of jack thompson an attorney who 
has campaigned to get 2 live crews records removed from area music 
stores 
the protestors left after about 15 minutes when police 
responding to neighbors complaints told the group they lacked a 
permit for the demonstration said police sgt dennis koronkiewicz 
coral gables is a suburb of miami 
about 15 police officers and a small crowd of several hundred 
people were on hand as the rappers performed an early clean show 
for patrons of all ages saturday night at hollywoods club futura 
band members expected a larger audience and a livelier show during 
an adultsonly set later saturday at the club 
were gonna do 2 live nasty as they wanna be band leader 
luther campbell vowed speaking of the second show 
a spokesman for hollywood police said that would be fine at 
least in the short run 
we are not going to jump up and stop the show and run the risk 
of having some kind of wild riot and have to take a lot of people 
to jail ed cunningham said saturday if something happens that 
appears it does violate the judges order well document it and 
were going to forward it to the judge or the state attorneys 
office for broward county 
us district judge jose gonzalez ruled wednesday that the 
millionselling album released more than a year ago is obscene by 
community standards in broward dade and palm beach counties 
that cleared the way for fridays arrest of charles freeman 
owner of ec records who sold copies of the recording to an 
undercover deputy he faces a firstdegree misdemeanor charge and 
is free on 100 bond 
if convicted he could be jailed for a year and fined 1000 
both freeman and campbell said they had gotten supportive phone 
calls friday from rock star frank zappa a vocal opponent of 
censorship 
campbell also pledged his financial legal and moral support to 
retailers who have problems after selling the record he is owner 
and president of 2 live crews record label now called lukes 
because of copyright problems with the former name luke skyywalker 
the obscenity ruling brought new interest in the group a 
promoter said 
until this trial we never could have booked this group on 
such short notice with no time to advertise and still expect a 
full house said club nu promoter bob slade theyre more 
popular than ever now 
campbell was enjoying all the free publicity 
i cant pay for this advertising he said at a friday news 
conference held in the twostory building he recently purchased to 
house his recording empire 
as nasty as they wanna be a double album has sold more 
than 17 million copies 
the machines are running right now campbell he said

a supertanker continued to burn out of 
control sunday morning in the gulf of mexico after being hit by 
more small explosions overnight authorities said 
the us coast guards atlantic strike team from mobile ala 
and other spill response groups were bringing a highseas barrier 
boom and other supplies including foam in an effort to quench 
flames from the blast andfire saturday that killed at least two 
crewmen 
the fire has been burning steadily out of control all night 
but is still confined to aft section of the ship at the deck house 
area said petty officer richard miles in galveston 
fireboats are still cooling its decks it had a few minor 
explosions last night including a couple of explosions around 
midnight with no debris but a lot of smoke and a couple of them in 
the earlymorning hours today 
although authorities said the 853footlong tanker was not in 
immediate danger of spilling its 38 million gallon cargo of light 
crude oil crews were making a push sunday to extinguish the blaze 
and begin salvaging the petroleum the ship is 57 miles southeast 
of galveston 
the mega borgs owners have dispatched 10 firefighting vessels 
to spray foam on the vessel in an effort to bring the fire under 
control and contracted for an airplane to spread dispersants over 
about 7000 gallons of oil spilled so far said todd nelson of the 
coast guard 
an oil sheen trailed about 11 miles in a quartermile wide path 
from the tanker the coast guard said 
flames shot hundreds of feet high from the ships air vents and 
thick black smoke could be seen from 40 miles away after the 1 
am engine room explosion 
in addition to the two confirmed dead two crewmen remained 
missing sunday and were presumed dead after a search for them was 
called off seventeen other crew members were injured two were 
hospitalized in fair condition and the others were treated and 
released the ship had a crew of 41 
the coast guards strike team arrived about 10 pm saturday and 
were beginning to assess the situation said miles 
chief warrant officer mike shoul also in galveston said it 
remained uncertain if the fire had reached the mega borgs oil 
cargo or was still consuming fuel from the ships engines 
the blast occurred as part of its cargo was being transferred to 
a smaller tanker although oil booms were available if needed 
authorities said the tanker was in no immediate danger of breaking 
up or sinking 
the houstongalveston area is home to several major refineries 
but the coast guard said it didnt know the refinery or refineries 
that were the mega borgs destination the tanker is operated by 
mosvolds shipping of farsund norway

two members of the rap group 2 live crew 
were arrested on obscenity charges early sunday after leaving an 
adultsonly concert at a local nightclub

gang violence in prime minister 
benazir bhuttos home province has taken 400 lives in a month and 
many pakistanis fear it endangers their countrys brief experiment 
with democracy 
ms bhutto who campaigned for a decade to free pakistan from 
military rule has been forced to call out the army in sindh her 
native province in southern pakistan 
no one knows who is killing whom private armies drug gangs and 
ethnic militias operate at will kidnappings indiscriminate 
shootings and armed robbery are commonplace 
police have arrested more than 3300 people in a weeklong sweep 
of sindh province the heart of the countrys financial and 
industrial base 
critics and supporters agree a lasting solution depends on ms 
bhuttos ability to make peace with an ethnic political movement 
that nearly brought down her government last year by withdrawing 
its support 
her long years of trials have conditioned her to think 
invariably in terms of them and us a government official 
said on condition of anonymity 
she has to stop playing party politics she has to stop acting 
merely as the leader of the pakistan peoples party and start being 
the prime minister of pakistan if she cant shell be lucky to 
last six months 
if ms bhutto fails observers say more than her 18monthold 
civilian government will be in danger 
pakistan has spent more than half its 43 years under military 
rule and concern is growing that the army will feel it necessary to 
take over again 
at center stage in the bloody drama are the mohajirs moslem 
indians who moved into pakistan during the 1947 partition that 
ended british colonial rule of the subcontinent and made two 
nations 
most of the mohajirs settled in karachi and hyderabad the two 
largest cities of sindh province they were poor and landless but 
welleducated and soon got the best jobs 
although they make up only 6 percent of sindhs 20 million 
people they dominate the cities and control the labor unions of 
the highly industrialized region 
native sindhis were increasingly shut out politically and 
economically and their resentment led to street fighting 
violence increased in the early 1980s because of the 
kalashnikov and heroin culture a reference to the automatic 
rifles that entered the country during the war in afghanistan and 
the growth of the drug trade 
on may 27 now called black sunday police tried to flush 
out mohajir militants holed up in the old walled section of 
hyderabad the operation turned into a bloodbath that cost 180 
lives and set off a fiveday wave of terror in karachi that took 
nearly 200 more 
ms bhutto faced accusations from all quarters that she had done 
too little to stop the bloodshed and called out the army 
military officers agreed to arrest the troublemakers and seize 
their weapons regardless of ethnic or political affiliations they 
insisted there be no interference from the provincial government 
which is led by the prime ministers party 
sources said the army also was pressing for military not 
civilian courts to decide punishment 
in 1958 and 1977 the military justified coups on grounds 
politicians were corrupt and more interested in outmaneuvering each 
other than serving pakistan 
most observers agree a coup against ms bhutto is unlikely 
since taking office in december 1988 she has built good relations 
with the army and its chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg 
many officers also believe ruling the country corrupted the army 
and led to the involvement of some officers in the narcotics trade 
people are asking me why doesnt the army take over and save 
us from slaughter but i say that is the job of the present 
government beg said we can control the situation in three 
days but that may not be a lasting solution martial law is not a 
permanent solution 
if the violence does not abate in a few months however many 
fear the army will have no choice 
even talking about martial law given the abysmal track record 
of military rule in pakistan is a poor reflection of the 
disappointing performance of ms bhuttos party a disappointment 
that seems to have shaken the confidence of even its most ardent 
supporters said political analyst mushahid hussain 
ms bhutto and the pakistan peoples party blame the current 
violence on the mohajir qami movement a small party that formerly 
supported her government 
its leaders said her party treated them shabbily during the 
10month alliance and withdrew support last november forcing a 
noconfidence vote in parliament that ms bhutto barely defeated 
analysts critics and supporters agree an understanding between 
ms bhutto and the mohajir qami is the only way to resolve the 
crisis 
that does not appear likely for the moment the mohajir qami 
which is believed to have armed up to 30000 members and sent them 
underground has shown no desire to talk

animal rights protesters who attack farms or 
research labs could spend up to three years in federal prison under 
a bill being considered this week by the house agriculture 
committee 
i want to emphasize that this bill deals only with terrorist 
acts said rep charles stenholm dtexas sponsor of the 
measure it brings the full weight of our laws against the 
extremists who have gotten out of control 
the farm animal and research facilities protection act is 
scheduled for a committee vote thursday stenholm wants it included 
in the 1990 farm bill 
the measure applies to facilities or premises where an animal is 
kept for food agriculture research testing or education 
it makes it a federal crime to 
disrupt the activities of the premises 
steal or damage property or animals 
enter a facility with the intent to commit a violation 
remain in a facility despite notice that entry was forbidden 
violators could be fined up to 10000 and jailed for up to 
three years or both 
any person harmed by a violation may recover damages and court 
costs 
stenholms office released a list of 91 incidents between 1981 
and last january ranging from bomb threats and trespassing to 
breakins and arson that were linked to groups associated with the 
animal rights movement 
most were associated with the animal liberation front also 
known as band of mercy or animal liberators which often announces 
its responsibility after various protest actions 
no matter how good and righteous you think your cause is you 
do not have the right to take the law into your own hands said 
stenholm those who choose to disrupt lawful agricultural and 
scientific research activities through violent means should face 
legal sanctions that are commensurate with their actions 
rep charles rose dnc another member of the house 
agriculture committee has proposed an amendment to the animal 
welfare act that would set fines but no jail time for damage to 
research facilities or farms 
it also includes a provision that allows for temporary removal 
of an animal from a research facility to document whether the 
animal is being treated properly according to existing law 
if a person who has broken into a facility proves animals are 
being mistreated then the facility would have to reimburse the 
person who committed the offenses for any court costs 
roses bill also allows people to file lawsuits on behalf of 
animals 
legislation similar to stenholms was approved by the senate 
last november under that bill violators could be fined up to 
5000 and jailed for up to one year or both unless a person is 
harmed by the protest 
in that case the penalty would be up to a 10000 fine and 10 
years in jail if someones life is put in jeopardy those 
responsible could be fined 25000 and jailed for 20 years those 
convicted would have to pay for any damages caused by the protest

former ku klux klan leader david duke is 
claiming credit for shifting debate to the right in the us senate 
campaign here 
duke often lashes out at the media for focusing on his past as a 
klansman and a neonazi but the publicity is helping him win 
points in conservative louisiana as he works to unseat threeterm 
democratic sen j bennett johnston 
the overzealousness to attack me what theyve done is theyve 
made people aware of my issues said duke who is running as a 
republican without the blessing of the state partys leadership 
an april survey commissioned by gannett news service found 
johnston was supported by 44 percent of those questioned duke by 
21 percent and state sen ben bagert the gops official candidate 
8 percent the survey which had a 35 percentage point margin of 
error found 27 percent undecided 
democrat willie singleton a black state representative from 
shreveport is considering joining the race but has until july to 
make up his mind 
louisianas oct 6 open primary is a candidate freeforall 
without regard to party if johnson does not get 50 percent of the 
vote he could be forced into a runoff with the secondplace 
finisher in november 
johnston has urged bagert to drop out of the senate race to 
reduce the likelihood of a runoff between himself and duke but 
bagert rejected that suggestion and told johnson to stop 
whining 
bagert maintains duke cant win because of the tremendous 
negative image created by his past ties to neonazis such as ralph 
forbes now a candidate for lieutenant governor in arkansas 
as recently as a year ago duke was selling nazi literature out 
of his legislative office clearing out his inventory he said at 
the time 
duke now runs an organization called the national organization 
for the advancement of white people he repeatedly says he has 
broken ties with the klan and the nazis and is now focusing on 
equal rights for all 
duke was elected to the state house last year by campaigning 
against taxes against affirmative action against minority 
setasides in government contracts and for welfare reform 
now he hopes to unseat johnston by portraying the senator as too 
liberal for louisiana tastes a tack also taken by bagert 
johnston accuses bagert and duke of running a 
johnnyonenote campaign that harps on johnstons role in 
helping defeat former president reagans nomination of robert bork 
to the supreme court 
johnston said dukes rightwing rhetoric has not affected my 
issue orientation but that it certainly appears to have 
affected mr bagerts 
johnston and duke both point to a recent bagert campaign 
commercial in which bagert pounds fist in hand and demands reforms 
that would make the poor work for their welfare 
people all over the state are greeting me saying that every 
time they see his commercial it makes them think of me a 
grinning duke said last week 
bagert bristles at the notion that hes copying duke or that he 
is a newcomer on the welfare reform bandwagon he first introduced 
welfare overhaul legislation as a house member in 1976 he said 
his latest proposals have been overshadowed by a brouhaha 
stirred up when duke gained house passage of a bill last month to 
outlaw affirmative action programs that award jobs promotions and 
scholarships on the basis of race 
the vote enraged the legislative black caucus and gov buddy 
roemer quickly promised to veto the bill if it got through the 
senate 
still house passage brought more publicity to duke and a 
complaint from bagert that the exklansman is getting free 
publicity from the media

a murderous land dispute among ethnic 
cousins in central asia has shaken loose a word that generations of 
soviet leaders have rejected out of hand decolonization 
since the 1920s when stalin redrew borders and declared moslems 
freed of backwardness moscow has considered the five central asian 
republics as much a part of the union as mother russia 
it was heresy to call them colonies and outright blasphemy to 
suggest that they might leave the union 
but now encouraged by new freedoms asians are returning to 
their mosques reviving long dormant traditions and in their own 
languages speaking of themselves as colonized people 
more and more the question is arising whether a soviet union 
fraught with crises elsewhere can satisfy and pacify an 
increasingly restive region where a slight spark ignites explosion 
officially little has changed local communist party 
governments still firmly in control insist that central asias 
future lies within the soviet union the kremlin agrees 
apart from strategic minerals and rich agricultural land 
political imperatives suggest no soviet government would lightly 
relinquish its own territory 
pragmatic asians realize that separating themselves from the 
soviet union would be as complex as unweaving a bukhara carpet but 
in a turbulent situation no one controls and few understand 
soviet leaders face hard choices they would rather not confront 
ethnic rioting between uzbeks and kirghizis set off by a 
dispute over land brought thousands of troops into the fergana 
valley the most densely populated part of the country soldiers 
sprayed gunfire at crowds 
moscow does not have enough troops and it will not be able to 
manage if anything really blows said a respected soviet 
ethnographer who agreed to speak his mind if assured of anonymity 
central asia stretches from the caspian sea to china an area 
half as big as the united states uzbekistan with 19 million 
inhabitants is the thirdmost populous soviet republic 
michael rywkin a new york professor raised in the ancient city 
of samarkand and author of moscows muslim challenge put it 
bluntly in a recent interview 
there are pogroms against russians theyve left villages and 
now theyre leaving the cities soviet leaders face the same 
dilemma as charles de gaulle in algeria whether to just get out 
russians began settling in tashkent a century ago when czarist 
troops secured most of the region after the revolution soviet 
professionals brought education industry and health care 
despite official rhetoric about a single people europeans and 
asians have remained largely separate a few asian men have 
european wives but almost no moslem women marry outsiders 
most asians say their hostility is not toward the outsiders 
themselves but rather the stifling system that condemns them to an 
alien style of life with few choices 
economists and sociologists acknowledge that unless perestroika 
brings significant and rapid improvement a rising tide of jobless 
youth will wash over the governments barriers against desperation 
as more russians leave analysts say industry and services will 
suffer making the problem worse 
young asians long silent in fear of reprisal are speaking out 
with growing vehemence 
we dont want communists or their damned system said a 
youth in samarkand distraught over impending military service 
they should go peacefully orderly but ukbekistan must be free 
even party officials worry that the growing tension threatens 
their traditional values 
in moscow bakhtiyur khamidov a senior member of the uzbek 
mission to the central government shook his head sadly at the 
riots pitting his people against kirghizis 
we have always been such a hospitable people it is in our 
blood he said you can imagine how bad conditions have gotten 
for this to have happened 
khamidov assures that the communist party is in control and has 
an economic plan to overcome the crisis but others speaking 
privately are far less confident many see a widening gulf between 
moscows vision of a seamless state and the realities of central 
asia 
the issue is less about politics than a choice between two 
diametrically opposed ways of life 
since the days of the silk road central asian moslems have 
lived as traders and farmers shaping their lives around the koran 
and the rigors of life at the edge of a fiercely hot desert 
the mosque outranks party headquarters lack of meat for guests 
at a sons wedding feast is cause for lasting shame diluting their 
language means turning their backs on 10 centuries of tradition 
as uzbeks and kirghizis fought soviet interior minister vadim 
bakatin denounced both sides as cave dwellers to many moslems 
that was yet another example of uncomprehending imperial hauteur 
when russians huddled in the forests any asian scholar will 
remind visitors samarkand beamed civilization to the world 
rywkin argues that the asian republics historically ruled by 
conquerors and local emirs do not have the democratic traditions 
to seek independence in the manner of the baltic states 
rather than a process of negotiation there will likely be 
bubbling ferment that will boil over regularly 
edward allworth also a new york professor who writes on central 
asia agrees if any charismatic figure emerges waving a green 
islamic flag people will rally behind him he said 
his friend anvar khadyrov an uzbek professor of philosophy at 
tashkent university opposes any such nationalist fervor but he is 
a scholar who knows his people 
yes he said when asked whether allworth was right i am 
afraid they would follow

democrats had made the point before but at a 
testy moment in last weeks budget talks democratic sen wyche 
fowler let the bush administration hear it again this time from a 
different source 
the problem is that the public is hearing one thing and seeing 
another the georgia lawmaker read from a piece of paper as 
administration officials listened 
he is being told that all is well and happy but you must pay 
more taxes you must sacrifice yet he sees his government failing 
to sacrifice he simply does not believe his government it is 
the failure of the administration to tell the people the truth 
fowler was quoting george bush who as a texas congressman took 
to the house floor in 1968 to complain about a proposal by 
democratic president lyndon b johnson to boost taxes and cut 
spending 
its come to that in this springs budget summit between the 
white house and congressional leaders four weeks into the talks 
democrats are still complaining it is bush himself who must 
convince a skeptical public that harsh steps are needed to battle 
the gargantuan federal deficit 
a lot of technical ground has been covered but there is at 
least another week to go of nuts and bolts descriptions of the 
governments fiscal health chart before hard bargaining begins 
so far the animals have been snorting and pawing the earth 
taking stock of each other and the situation said rep bill 
frenzel rminn one of the negotiators i dont know how much 
more this war dance needs to go on but obviously we need something 
to precipitate decisionmaking 
one problem is nobody seems to know just what it will take to 
get democrats and republicans trading offers about tax increases 
and spending cuts in this election year 
its a political year and some degree of paranoia exists over 
whos going to move on what issues says house budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif 
according to one pessimistic school of thought the political 
pressures are so great that nothing will be agreed to until 
december after the elections 
a lack of a budget deal by then will trigger crippling spending 
cuts under the grammrudman deficit reduction law forcing bush and 
lawmakers to deal with the problem 
it may well be that in order for congress to get serious about 
this problem were going to have to have the grammrudman cuts 
said sen phil gramm rtexas another bargainer 
few negotiators say they agree with that scenario 
you have available the option of waiting for some form of 
crisis said richard darman the white houses budget director 
the trouble with that is its irresponsible 
there is no certainty however about how to avoid that crisis 
darman and another gop negotiator sen pete domenici of new 
mexico want bargaining to commence in about a week frenzel wants 
negotiators to set a deadline for completing the talks preferably 
by the end of june they believe that with congress in a short 
electionyear session lawmakers will need a head start to enact 
whatever package emerges from the talks 
democrats talk less about deadlines and more about the need to 
lay the political groundwork for what could be 45 billion to 60 
billion worth of spending cuts and tax increases 
they insist that bush has to prepare the public to make 
sacrifices and persuade members of congress to vote for unpopular 
measures 
and they say the president must present a new deficitreduction 
plan of his own now that the administration says the budget he 
introduced in january is outdated 
there is certainly a consensus that no matter how slowly were 
moving were ahead of most of our colleagues and certainly the 
public in realizing the size of this problem said fowler

trees and other foliage should have the right 
of way over highway billboards the bush administration is telling 
states in a reversal of a 13yearold federal policy 
its a message the advertising industry doesnt want to hear 
environmentalists on the other hand are delighted 
since 1977 government policy has been to allow states or 
advertisers themselves to chop down vegetation from public land to 
improve the visibility of outdoor advertising 
but the federal highway administration in a may 18 memo told 
its regional administrators that the agency needed to conform with 
the bush administrations new national transportation policy of 
minimizing the negative side effects of transportation on the 
environment 
it is federal highway administration policy to be sensitive to 
environmental concerns therefore such vegetation clearance can no 
longer be endorsed the agency said 
since states maintain highway rights of way the fhwa cant 
impose policy on billboards 
barbara orski director of the fhwa rightofway office said in 
an interview last week that regional administrators would work with 
each state to change laws or rescind any agreements with the 
industry 
the federal highway administration likes to do things in 
cooperation with the states orski said but she added where 
federal funds are used to procure rights of way it is inconsistent 
to allow people to cut trees were sending them a forceful 
message consistent with the presidents policy 
she said no highway departments had indicated opposition to the 
new policy but it is possible not all have had time to consider it 
the advertising industry reacted swiftly 
to allow the vegetation to grow to where it covers billboards 
is the taking of property and cannot be done without 
compensation said roland mcelroy of the outdoor advertisers 
association of america 
we oppose illegal cutting and are not opposed to control over 
the cutting of vegetation he said but added that allowing 
vegetation to grow indiscriminately could pose a distraction to 
drivers straining to read ads or other signs 
he said some billboard companies put up sprinkling systems to 
help vegetation along highways and plant trees behind billboards 
the association says minnesota north dakota pennsylvania and 
tennessee have laws that allow clearance of trees and plants from 
in front of billboards 
fourteen other states have agreements with the industry to allow 
it alabama california connecticut georgia kentucky louisiana 
michigan mississippi new jersey new mexico north carolina 
south carolina virginia and wisconsin 
most other states prohibit the cutting or poisoning of trees to 
help advertisers and some outlaw highway billboards altogether 
environmentalists have called the treeclearing practice 
legalized vandalism 
were delighted that fhwa has reversed its 13yearold policy 
of permitting states to develop programs that favor billboards over 
trees said edward t mcmahon president of scenic america a 
group that supports highway beautification and other environmental 
causes 
he said trees that could be saved by the new federal policy 
range from 100yearold eucalyptus in california to crabtrees in 
north carolina that have been the subject of public protests 
bills calling for a moratorium on new billboards on federal 
interstates and other major highways have been introduced in the 
senate and house

in an odd mix of commercial boosterism 
and islamic solidarity iran staged a huge trade fair here sunday 
to show its support for moslems fighting the christians in 
lebanons 15yearold civil war 
among the wares on display were racy underwear to be worn under 
womens allconcealing chadors and childrens books praising bloody 
islamic martyrdom 
an iranian deputy minister of commerce identified only as 
zaferian said the event was designed to indicate the special 
concern that officials in iran feel for the moslems of lebanon 
lebanon is the only country outside iran where the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis brand of shiite moslem fundamentalism 
has taken root although lebanons 12 million shiites make up the 
countrys largest single sect they have long languished at the 
bottom of the social ladder 
iran backs hezbollah or party of god an extremist faction that 
advocates the establishment of an iranstyle islamic state in 
lebanon 
the trade fair was staged in this ancient romanbuilt city in 
east lebanons bekaa valley which is hezbollahs main stronghold 
some 2500 iranian islamic revolutionary guards are based here 
the sprawling exhibition took up a sevenstory building plus 
surrounding empty lots zaferian said 180 companies took part 
the event had many of the trappings of a standard commercial 
gathering we do export the best try us read one companys 
englishlanguage banner 
other items werent quite the usual tradefair fare however 
the display by the islamic republics cultural department which 
took up a whole floor featured offerings such as a childrens book 
called the footprints of blood 
the books narrator is a slain martyrs soul who invites 
youngsters to take the glorious path of martyrdom for the 
preservation of islam 
other goods included silk carpets with price tags in the 
thousands of dollars and caviar at upwards of 100 a pound 
despite the strict islamic dress code there was a selection of 
wedding gowns featured plunging necklines and offtheshoulder 
party dresses with prices from 200 to 600 
were not backward a chadorclad hezbollah woman said we 
also wear such dresses but under the chador 
a nearby stand diplayed lacy womens underwear in shocking pink 
and purple 
under islamic code woman in the company of men other than their 
husbands brothers and fathers are to cover their hair and wear a 
loose smock that fully covers the arms and legs 
irans ambassador to syria mohammad hussein akhtari said 
moslem nations should trade among themselves so that we will not 
have to extend our hands to the colonialists and the enemies of 
islam a refernce to western powers 
iranian radicals oppose iranian president hashemi rafsanjanis 
efforts to mend ties with the west to attract badly needed foreign 
investment and technology 
in his speech however zaferian praised rafsanjanis 112 
billion fiveyear reconstruction plan he said the merchandise on 
display was a sample of the enormous success of this economic 
policy

the most precious gems among britains crown 
jewels were hidden in a lake at windsor castle during world war ii 
to keep them out of german hands if the country was invaded a 
newspaper reported sunday 
the sunday telegraph said the only people who knew of the hiding 
place were king george vi who chose it and sir owen morshead his 
librarian 
the king father of queen elizabeth ii died in 1952 and 
morshead in 1977 
the newspaper said that in 1940 when a german invasion was 
anticipated the king ordered the royal jewelers to take the gems 
from the tower of london to windsor castle about 20 miles west of 
london 
the king and morshead then wrenched the most important gems out 
of their settings with pliers and other tools provided by a 
chauffeur according to the newspaper 
the gems including the kohinoor diamond were then wrapped 
in cotton wool placed in a tin and submerged in one of the lakes 
at windsor there they remained until the defeat of germany and for 
a long time only the king and sir owen knew wrote the 
newspapers anonymous columnist mandrake 
the kohinoor is an indian diamond of 108 carats presented to 
queen victoria in 1849 its name means mountain of light 
the wartime hiding place of the jewels which today are on 
public display at the tower of london has always been a mystery in 
britain 
but the sunday telegraph said it had discovered that the facts 
were revealed in 1972 in a book that was never translated from 
french a biography of the military leader jeanmarie lattre de 
tassigny by his widow simonne 
the newspaper said it was told of the story by lattre de 
tassignys british aide john saintclair smallwood who said he 
accompanied the general and his wife on a visit to windsor in 1949 
at morsheads invitation smallwood said morshead related the 
secret to them as they gazed out of the castle windows onto the 
grounds where there was a round pond 
according to the newspaper smallwood related that morshead said 
the king told him the crown jewels represented the honors and the 
kingdom of england and must not fall into german hands 
the report did not say where the crown jewel settings were kept 
during the war 
most of the crown jewels date from the restoration of the 
monarchy after the death of oliver cromwell who overthrew king 
charles i and died in 1658 cromwell had the original crown jewels 
sold or melted

a resounding box office bonanza helped 
the 14th annual spoleto festival usa reassure the world that 
this historic seaport battered by hurricane hugo less than a year 
ago is back on its feet 
its been a difficult festival but absolutely worth the 
effort general manager nigel redden said i think people will 
be taking a message back home that charleston is fine and it is 
wonderful 
a sunday night concert and fireworks display at middleton place 
plantation was to formally close the annual festival which 
included 110 performances ranging from grand opera to jazz to 
avantgarde mutimedia events 
more than 16 million in tickets had been sold as spoleto 
entered its final weekend that topped the record of 146 million 
set last year 
the spector of hurricane hugo which inflicted 59 billion 
damage in september helped promote the arts festival 
the hurricane certainly did bring some people here redden 
said there were people who heard about charleston and wanted to 
find out how it was doing to express some solidarity in a way 
the hurricane damaged festival offices and the auditorium where 
major spoleto events are staged the citys historic district has 
been largely renovated but recovery in outlying areas has taken 
longer 
highlights of the 17day festival included performances of the 
fivehour wagner opera parsifal 
it was directed by festival founder gian carlo menotti the 
pulitzerprize winning composer also directed a reprise of last 
years hit the marriage of figaro 
another highlight was the premier of the hydrogen jukebox 
a collaboration between composer philip glass poet allen ginsberg 
and visual artist jerome sirlin 
spoleto also featured jazz and classical concerts ballet and 
drama 
glitches included conductor leonard bernstein canceling his 
appearance at an opening concert gala because of a bout with 
pneumonia actress kitty carlise hart chairman of the new york 
state arts council also took ill and could not deliver a speech 
during opening ceremonies 
the hype bolstered by hugo helped draw record numbers of 
reporters and critics organizers said 
typically critics disagreed about spoletos hits and misses 
for example the new york times termed the hydrogen jukebox 
if nothing else a triumph of stage technology but called 
glass music bland and the ginsbergs text so much verbal 
sludge 
usa today called it the festivals greatest hit and the 
state newspaper in columbia suggested it was a stunning work 
powered by the words of ginsberg more than anything else 
with the socalled hurricane festival behind them spoleto 
organizers are looking to next season the year menotti turns 80 
we are absolutely planning to celebrate his 80th birthday and 
planning to do one of his operas if not more than one of his 
operas redden said 
menotti best known for his opera amahl and the night 
visitors founded the south carolina festival in 1977 two 
decades after founding the festival of two worlds in spoleto 
italy in an effort to merge european and us culture

dianne feinstein had just hours to 
savor her victory in californias democratic primary for governor 
before republican pete wilson had his first ad of the general 
election campaign on tv 
in the fight for the top prize of the 1990 elections wilsons 
opening shot was a goodnatured spot designed to leave voters 
laughing by putting feinsteins own words to work for her new rival 
youre wonderful feinstein tells wilson in a quote dredged 
up from 1985 
feinstein found the commercial sort of amusing although the 
quotation was taken out of context said her spokeswoman dee dee 
myers 
most observers expect the tenor of the campaign to turn meaner 
quickly as feinstein and wilson who differ little on major issues 
try to draw distinctions between one another 
the battle for the california governors mansion is at the top 
of both parties 1990 priority lists each wants to be holding the 
power of the governors office when the states congressional 
districts are redrawn next year california could pick up six more 
congressional seats as a result of the 1990 census 
wilson a twoterm us senator faced only token opposition in 
the gop primary and emerged from last weeks elections with 35 
million in the bank feinstein the former san francisco mayor 
spent every dollar she raised plus 3 million she and her husband 
loaned to her campaign in a hardfought primary 
she doesnt have any money now to counter wilsons commercials 
but even wilson acknowledges feinstein has the undisputed advantage 
in charisma 
feinsteins primary election campaign generated excitement in 
part because she was bidding to become the first woman to win a 
majorparty nomination for governor in california 
but she also was a more accomplished and dynamic speaker than 
her primary opponent state attorney general john van de kamp who 
closely resembles wilson in both appearance and personal mannerisms 
feinstein said she plans to make wilsons fundraising an issue 
describing him as the favorite candidate of the republican big 
cigars and specialinterest political action committees she 
claims gop fat cats pressured a reluctant wilson to run for 
governor just a few weeks after he won reelection to a second 
senate term in 1988 
wilson brushed off his opponents criticisms 
yes i confess i enjoy an occasional cigar but i dont think 
it should become a campaign issue he quipped he added that none 
of his supporters could compare with feinsteins wealthy investment 
banker husband richard blum whom he described as the biggest 
cigar in the race 
similarly wilson brushed off feinsteins assertion that he was 
a reluctant candidate persuaded to run because he was the only one 
who could keep the governors office in gop hands when gov george 
deukmejian retires 
what hurts my feelings is that she doesnt remember my prior 
efforts and how long ive wanted to be governor said wilson who 
finished fourth in a 1978 gop gubernatorial primary 
my campaign that year was a haven for people who hate 
crowds he joked 
california has had few races in recent years in which the 
majorparty candidates started the race as close together on the 
issues 
wilson is a moderate republican with high ratings from 
environmentalists and who is prochoice on abortion feinstein is a 
moderate democrat who supports the death penalty and is viewed by 
liberals as being too close to big business interests 
although wilson is prochoice feinstein has been criticizing 
his senate votes on abortion funding she effectively used the 
abortion issue in the primary against van de kamp who also was 
prochoice declaring that only a prochoice woman can be trusted 
by women to never compromise on abortion rights 
the only independent poll so far on the race taken before the 
primary last tuesday gave wilson a lead of 7 percentage points 
but that was conducted while feinstein and van de kamp were 
pounding each other and wilson was coasting to a primaryelection 
victory over three political unknowns

the action in frenchspeaking quebecs fight for 
special status shifted sunday to the province of newfoundland 
which ultimately will decide the fate of an accord recognizing 
quebecs special character 
canadas provincial leaders on saturday night signed a 
constitutional accord on the issue a clear victory for quebec 
premier robert bourassa 
but newfoundland premier clyde wells said he was angry both 
about the secretive nature of the seven days of grueling 
negotiations in ottawa and the outcome he said he signed the 
agreement against his convictions because he did not want to be 
solely responsible for killing it 
wells said he would submit the accord to his cabinet and 
majority party in newfoundland and they will decide whether to 
submit it directly to the legislature or call a referendum 
the proposed constitutional amendment is aimed at winning 
quebecs endorsement of the 1982 canadian constitution quebec 
which is home to a quarter of canadas 26 million people said the 
1982 document did not take into account the provinces special 
french nature 
when first signed in 1987 the leaders imposed a threeyear 
deadline for ratification of the meech lake agreement by the 
legislatures of all 10 provinces that was accomplished in eight 
provinces 
but elections brought new governments to manitoba and new 
brunswick which subsequently did not ratify the accord and 
newfoundland which withdrew its ratification 
those three provinces have until june 23 to push the accord 
through their legislatures or the deal dies 
premier frank mckenna of new brunswick promised his provinces 
endorsement premier gary filmon of manitoba and the opposition 
party leaders with whom his minority government must deal have said 
they will rush the proposal through mandatory public hearings and 
on to the legislature 
that leaves newfoundland as the main potential stumbling block 
on saturday night wells urged newfoundlanders if they vote on 
the agreement to be generous in their consideration of quebecs 
position 
but dont give up your right to make the decision on the basis 
of conscience he said 
he also had a word of admonition for quebec 
having recognized that quebec is a distinct society i say to 
my friends in quebec i believe it is the responsibility of all the 
citizens of quebec to place canada first and recognize that like 
all of the other provinces quebec is second he said 
the constitutional amendment would have no immediate practical 
effect but would oblige the supreme court to consider the 
provinces distinctiveness when considering specific laws under 
challenge it is also a symbol of enormous significance to 
frenchspeaking quebecers 
bourassa had steadfastly resisted efforts to change the clause 
in the agreement declaring quebec a distinct society 
english canada has finally recognized and accepted us for what 
we are he said saturday night it was a great battle but the 
stakes were worth it 
quebec leaders did not specifically say the province would 
secede if the accord is not approved but nationalism is on the 
rise in quebec and there is a growing sentiment for separation of 
some sort 
the accord is the same as the one signed by prime minister brian 
mulroney and the 10 provincial premiers at meech lake near ottawa 
in 1987 this time however the document is accompanied by a 
nonbinding letter of understanding covering several contentious 
issues 
this is a happy day for canada a beaming mulroney said 
saturday evening the agreement before us will reintegrate quebec 
into the canadian constitutional family 
the accord also includes a new constitutional amending formula 
closely tied to a widespread desire for reform of the national 
senate in addition it expands the provinces powers to opt out of 
some federalprovincial spending programs and covers supreme court 
nominations immigration and constitutional conferences

the economy minister said the 
government might impose new austerity measures following a supreme 
court decision suspending a presidential decree that would have 
blocked wage increases 
the court ruling last wednesday was a sharp blow to the 
governments antiinflation program begun in march to bring down 
annual inflation of almost 5000 percent 
a cornerstone of that plan was a presidential decree restricting 
the power of regional labor courts to award large wage increases in 
workermanagement disputes 
congress which must approve presidential decrees voted down 
the measure on may 31 but last week president fernando collor de 
mello reintroduced the decree 
the supreme court then voted 90 to suspend the measure for 30 
days in a month the court will rule on whether according to the 
constitution the government can reissue a decree already rejected 
by congress 
however the suspension vote was seen as a sign the court would 
rule against the government 
as a result of the suspension local labor courts can award wage 
settlements as they see fit 
on thursday the labor court in sao paulo granted 10500 port 
workers a 30 percent wage increase in the same city brazils 
largest 12500 metal workers are striking for a 166 percent raise 
but economy minister zelia cardoso de mello told the folha de 
sao paulo newspaper saturday the government will have to implement 
recessionary measures if high salary increases are granted and then 
passed on in higher prices 
she did not say what those measures might include 
also in the article cardoso de mello admitted for the first 
time that the cost of living had increased but denied workers had 
suffered substantial wage losses to inflation 
there is a slight inflationary tendency but it is dropping 
she said 
the economy minister told businessmen to resist resist 
resist demands for pay raises from workers saying increases 
would start a new inflationary spiral 
inflation has dropped sharply since collor de mello launched his 
package of emergency economic measures on march 16 the day after 
he took office the measures included freezing all bank deposits of 
more than 1200 for 18 months 
in recent weeks however there have been signs of renewed 
inflation 
the institute foundation of economic research reported last week 
that the cost of living in sao paulo a city of 14 million rose by 
85 percent in may a survey published saturday by the folha de sao 
paulo daily showed food prices rose by 64 percent in the first 
week of june alone 
thousands of workers have gone on strike in recent weeks 
seeking to make up losses to inflation 
alexandre barros a political consultant said sunday that 
inflation would probably be 10 percent to 13 percent in june he 
said several major banks were working with projections of 20 
percent inflation for august

civil war buffs may soon have clearer pictures 
of the union ship monitor which sank in a gale off the north 
carolina coast 128 years ago after its celebrated battle with the 
confederate ship merrimack 
for the first time in 11 years the government is allowing an 
undersea photographer to dive to the wreck 16 miles off cape 
hatteras 
photographer and author rod farb of cedar grove nc arrived 
at the site with a film crew last week beating out a philadelphia 
rival seeking to become the first to dive to wreck since french 
explorer jacques cousteau did it in 1979 
cousteaus expedition was hampered by bad weather and poor 
visibility and little or no usable footage was produced 
government scientists disclosed in interviews last week that 
portions of the ships hull have collapsed but that the wreck is 
stable some scuba divers had expressed fears that the wreck 
was in danger of collapsing 
the wreck of the monitor was discovered by researchers in 1973 
the merrimack renamed the virginia was destroyed by its crew to 
keep it from being captured by the union 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which is 
responsible for safeguarding the wreckage said farb was blessed 
with good conditions when he and his crew made their first dive 
noaa refused to allow private monitor expeditions after 
cousteaus dive saying the 220foot depth posed a serious and 
unreasonable risk that its own divers would not take the 
concerns were based on tricky currents and the knowledge that at 
certain depths nitrogen in the breathing air can impede divers 
motor skills 
the agency reversed its position after one of its administrative 
law judges ruled last november that it had exaggerated the nitrogen 
problem a significant number of trained scuba divers 
frequently penetrate to 220 feet the law judge said 
before permitting farbs dive noaa researchers disclosed friday 
that they descended to the wreck in a submarine on june 1 and 2 to 
make a visual record to ensure that artifacts are not tampered 
with 
tim keeney noaa director of ocean and coastal resources said a 
10foot tiger shark was patrolling the wreck 
the best word to describe the condition is that we believe 
its stable keeney said of the ship the hull of the vessel is 
not made of thick metal and there are parts that have caved in 
however there is armor plating surrounding the vessel and that is 
almost totally intact on the port side 
irv garrison an noaa marine archaeologist who was on the 
submarine said the monitor is pretty beat up even for the 128 
years it has spent at the bottom of the sea 
time is one thing garrison said but shes also right in 
the area of a shipping lane and every destroyer that went by may 
have dropped a load on her she might have been depthcharged 
which would be an ironic fate for an old civil war boat 
in the race to photograph the wreck farb beat out gary gentile 
a philadelphia scuba diver who filed 11 permit applications and 
wrote more than 50 letters to noaa since 1984 
gentile actually won a permit first from the agency but decided 
to wait until the weather improved at the end of june to make the 
dives peter hess gentiles attorney said his client thought he 
had assurance from farb that gentile could go first 
gentile still plans to photograph the site in several weeks but 
hess said it wont be the same do you remember the second guy to 
cross the atlantic i feel like hes robbed us of the fruits of our 
victory hess said

us jewish leaders who met with nelson mandela on 
sunday praised the black nationalist for recognizing israels right 
to exist and said he should be warmly welcomed when he visits the 
united states 
the jewish leaders said their meeting with mandela exceeded 
their fondest expectations even though they said he called for 
direct talks between israel and the plo and urged israel to 
surrender the occupied territories 
henry siegman executive director of the american jewish 
congress told journalists after the 2 hour meeting that mandela 
said his african national congress accepts unequivocally the 
existence of the state of israel not only de facto but also its 
legal right to exist within secure borders 
there was no immediate comment from mandela officials said he 
left on a swissair flight for frankfurt west germany 
several us jewish groups recently said they would protest 
mandelas visit to the united states because he compared the 
struggle of palestinians to that of black south africans and 
publicly embraced plo chairman yasser arafat 
the jewish delegation made a special trip to geneva to seek 
clarification of mandelas position on israel before his visit to 
the united states 
siegman said the meeting which lasted 90 minutes longer than 
expected put an end to the concern over mandelas positions even 
though the jewish delegation disagreed with his views on talks 
between israel and the plo 
siegman said the anc deputy president criticized the israeli 
governments treatment of palestinians and called on jeruslaem to 
hold direct talks with the palestinian liberation organization to 
settle the 30monthold palestinian uprising in the territories 
occupied by israel 
speaking at a news conference siegman quoted mandela as saying 
that israels borders should not encompass the golan heights the 
gaza strip and the west bank which were captured by israel in the 
1967 middle east war 
mandelas views are certain to be unpopular with the new 
rightwing government now being formed in israel it opposes any 
territorial concessions to the palestinians and favors pursuing a 
peace plan that would give only limited autonomy to the 17 million 
palestinians in the occupied lands 
nevertheless siegman who coordinated the visit of the jewish 
leaders to geneva said the jewish community should join actively 
and vigorously in extending a warm welcome to mandela during his 
10day us visit 
he said mandela who arrives in the united states on june 20 
said he would welcome an opportunity to visit israel if invited 
by the government 
siegman said mandela was extraordinarily forthcoming and 
enthusiastic at the private meeting held at a secret location 
anc representatives could not immediately be contacted for comment 
i will probably raise my voice and proclaim he mandela is a 
friend said abraham foxman national director of the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith the meeting exceeded our 
fondest expectations no jewish organization should have any 
reservations about the visit 
al vorspan senior vice president of the union of american 
hebrew congregations said mandelas visit should be a real 
celebration of his freedom after 27 years in prison mandela was 
freed from prison as part of south african president fw de 
klerks reform program 
the 71yearold anc leader was in switzerland as part of a 
sixweek tour of europe and north america to press the west to 
maintain sanctions against south africa and its system of racial 
segregation 
the american jewish congress national jewish community 
relations advisory council american jewish committee 
antidefamation league of bnai brith and union of american hebrew 
congregations were represented at the meeting

crowds of armenians broke through 
police lines and surrounded british prime minister margaret 
thatcher when she arrived sunday to open a new britishbuilt school 
in this earthquakedevastated city 
tens of thousands of people lined the route of the british prime 
ministers motorcade to the school in a section of leninakan wiped 
out in the december 1988 disaster that claimed an estimated 25000 
lives in northern armenia 
some people stood on piles of rubble to see her 
mrs thatcher returned to london late sunday evening after a 
fourday visit to the soviet union largely intended as a gesture of 
support for president mikhail s gorbachev with whom she met 
friday in moscow 
plans for an afternoon walking tour and a wreathlaying ceremony 
in leninakan were canceled after worried officials said they could 
not guarantee they could control an ebullient crowd estimated at 
100000 packed into the main square 
as a compromise she rode in the front seat of a bus to see 
shanties rubble and halffinished buildings in the city apartment 
blocks ripped apart in the earthquake gaped open and piles of 
shattered concrete and twisted metal pushed back by boulders 
surrounded the shanties 
the metalframe singlestory lord byron school built to 
accommodate 800 children is on the site where the earthquake 
virtually flattened a previous school of the citys 37 schools 31 
were destroyed by the quake 
local officials said that some people who left the city after 
the earthquake are moving back to leninakan to enroll their 
children in the new school 
mrs thatcher stepped from her limousine when she reached the 
school but was forced back into the car as the crowd broke through 
shaky police lines and surged around her the limousine then edged 
to the deserted back of the 7 million school named after the 18th 
century english poet 
once inside mrs thatcher talked to a group of 4 and 
5yearolds orphaned by the quake never forget what you learn 
here it will last you all your life she told them 
in opening the school mrs thatcher saidpeople all over the 
world joined in relief work moved by the belief that what you were 
suffering was more than you could bear 
the horror has made a very deep impression on people through 
the world television brought into our homes pictures of 
devastation and suffering almost beyond comprehension she said 
children gathered outside the school tossed red orange and 
white carnations at her and shouted we love you 
mrs thatchers husband denis and kenneth baker britians 
education secretary at the time of the quake had to leave their 
cars and struggle through crowds for more than 500 yards to reach 
the school 
in the blazing transcaucasian sun people stood on roofs of 
surrounding shanties holding banners demanding control of the 
nagornokarabakh region center of the bloody dispute between 
armenia and neighboring azerbaijan 
nagornokarabakh is predominantly ethnic armenian but belongs 
to azerbaijan several hundred people have been killed in the 
dispute over the area and thousands have been forced to flee their 
homes in violence that erupted in february 1988 
leninakan a city in northwestern armenia near the 
sovietturkish border was severely damaged by the earthquake an 
estimated 16000 people died and all but about 300 of its buildings 
were destroyed 
the city had a population of about 226000 before the 
earthquake about 108000 people now live here but local officials 
said former residents are slowing drifting back 
efforts to rebuild leninakan have been slowed by a sporadic 
economic blockade from azerbaijan materials for the lord byron 
school were sent through soviet georgia to the north of armenia 
we may stay homeless but we will not leave karabakh alone 
said one banner displayed for mrs thatcher red army hands off 
karabakh read another 
hundreds of people hung out the windows of partly built four or 
fivestory apartment buildings near the school 
as mrs thatchers motorcade tried to leave the school at one 
point it was forced to halt completely but the prime minister 
appeared unconcerned

a cia tip to south african intelligence agents 
led to the 1962 arrest of antiapartheid leader nelson mandela who 
remained imprisoned until this year according to a report 
published sunday 
the cia had a deep cover agent in the durban south africa 
branch of mandelas african national congress cox news service 
reported mandela who had gone underground was arrested on aug 
5 1962 while trying to leave durban after secretly attending a 
dinner party there 
mark mansfield a cia spokesman in washington said sunday that 
agency policy ruled out any official comment on the allegations 
edward ndlovo a member of the anc delegation in geneva 
switzerland dismissed the report noting that cia ties to the 
mandela arrest have been rumored for years 
thats an old old story im sure the press must have dug it 
up from newspaper cuttings from about five years ago ndlovo said 
the report quoted an unidentified former us official as saying 
that paul eckel then a senior cia operative had told him within 
hours of mandelas arrest that the capture was one of our 
greatest coups 
the former official said eckel told him we have turned 
mandela over to the south african security branch we gave them 
every detail what he would be wearing the time of day just where 
he would be they have picked him up 
eckel who retired about 10 years ago died in 1986 
ndlovo said that when the allegations first surfaced the anc 
did not pay any attention to them we just disregarded it its 
neither here nor there 
the anc had been a legal peaceful organization for 48 years 
when it was outlawed in 1960 mandela went into hiding and helped 
launch a sabotage campaign a year later 
he was convicted of leaving south africa illegally then tried 
in 1964 along with other anc leaders and convicted of sabotage and 
plotting to overthrow the government he was freed in february 
the report said the cias concern over mandela arose from the 
belief that his activities against the south african government 
could harm us interests the two nations had signed a military 
agreement and south africa also was providing uranium to the 
united states 
the late cia director william casey in 1986 denied published 
reports that the united states has given south africa intelligence 
on black nationalist groups

kuwaitis on sunday elected 50 members of a 
transitional parliament in voting boycotted by opposition leaders 
who are challenging the governments claim that the new body will 
advance democracy 
no results were available late sunday and it was unclear when 
results would be announced 
unofficial estimates after the polls closed at 8 pm put the 
turnout at about 55 percent in this small oilrich state on the 
persian gulf 
kuwait used to pride itself on having the only westernstyle 
parliament among the conservative arab countries of the persian 
gulf but the government dissolved it in 1986 after strong 
parliamentary criticism of the government 
the opposition boycotting the elections led by about 30 
deputies from the dissolved parliament insist on the restoration 
of the original 50member legislature instead of the 75member 
transitional chamber which includes 25 members appointed by 
kuwaits emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
diplomats had said anything more than 40 percent at the polls 
should be considered a success for the governments plan to set up 
the interim 75member national council given the boycott and the 
abstention of many kuwaitis on summer vacation 
the diplomats said it would be difficult to determine how many 
abstentions could be attributed to the opposition boycott 
the emir decreed the new interim chamber to pave the way for the 
restoration of a fully elected parliament 
however opposition figures had argued the national council 
would be unconstitutional and ineffective 
the vote results were expected to produce a progovernment 
chamber that fosters cooperation between the executive and 
legislative branches of government 
the allmale electorate estimated at about 62000 was choosing 
50 deputies from among 348 candidates kuwaits population is 17 
million 
only those over 21 who can trace their kuwaiti citizenship back 
at least 30 years can vote women have not been enfranchised in 
this conservative islamic society 
within four years the interim chamber is charged with 
suggesting controls to prevent the kind of strong criticism of 
ministers that prompted the government to dissolve the parliament 
in 1976 and 1986 
the 1986 suspension came at the height of the eightyear 
iraqiran war when kuwait was almost dragged into the hostilities 
but a unmediated ceasefire end the conflict in 1988 
then with the democratic revolutions in eastern europe over the 
past year activists in kuwait began pressing for the restoration 
of parliament the interim chamber was a compromise solution by the 
emir 
throughout its campaigns the opposition has insisted that its 
allegiance to the emir remains firm 
before sundays election the opposition held a series of 
meetings in defiance of laws banning public gatherings authorities 
arrested 15 opposition leaders but they were later released later 
meetings were allowed to take place 
the candidates are mostly new to politics they overwhelmingly 
belong to progovernment tribes in outlying areas 
but they include 20 onetime deputies who were members of 
parliaments elected since kuwaits 1962 postindependence 
constitution 
only arab reporters were allowed into kuwait to cover the 
elections

the coast guard noting a rise in the practice of 
transferring oil between ships in the gulf of mexico in recent 
years said they have been bracing for a disaster 
but the disaster officials feared was a collision not the 
series of explosions that rocked the 853foot supertanker mega borg 
on saturday killing two crewmen and leaving two others missing and 
presumed dead 
as oil imports to the united states rise the coast guard said 
the delicate art of lightering or transferring oil from a 
larger ship to a smaller one has been practiced more frequently in 
the gulf 
shippers say the transfers are necessary because the deepwater 
crude oil carriers are too large when fully loaded to navigate the 
relatively shallow texas ship channels 
as the norwegian supertanker was transferring crude oil to the 
smaller tanker framura on saturday an explosion set fire to the 
larger vessel the blast occurred after the mega borg had unloaded 
29 million of its 412 million gallons of oil authorities said 
the coast guard estimates that lightering operations off the 
texas coast increased 200 percent between 1986 and 1988 the last 
year for which figures were available from about 20 a month in 
1986 transfers had jumped to an average of 77 a month by august 
1988 
more than a dozen oil transfer operations may be under way 
simultaneously off the coast of galveston on some days officials 
said although no major problems with lightering have been reported 
in the gulf they said the disaster potential is increasing 
as the number of transfer operations continues to rise so does 
the possibility of a major oil spill along the gulf coast lt 
cmdr frank whipple of the coast guards galveston marine safety 
office said earlier this year 
it just takes one slip to cause a catastrophic accident he 
said 
concern however has focused on the possibility of a collision 
between the two ships that must maneuver close to each other during 
the transfer 
officials worried a collision could pierce the hull of one of 
the tankers causing a massive oil spill 
coast guard officials aware of the increasing risks said they 
recently began closely watching the number and frequency of 
lightering operations off the texas coast 
following the 109 milliongallon exxon valdez oil spill in 
alaska last march the coast guard ordered its marine safety 
offices throughout the nation to review disaster prevention and 
response plans 
the agency requires a days notice of arriving vessels and 
lightering schedules must be filed coast guard inspectors said 
they visit the ships at owners expense for safety inspections 
coast guard officials met in january with lightering workers to 
discuss procedures safety and the risk of a spill off the texas 
coast 
industry officials estimate that 16 billion to 21 billion 
gallons of oil are lightered along the louisiana and texas coasts 
every year with at least half that amount off galveston

crewmen from the mega borg 
recounting their escape from the burning supertanker told of 
feeling their way through darkened corridors amid acrid smoke and 
explosions

explained lolla manibusan who gave birth to all six boys and to 
two girls 
plagued by miscarriages seven in all lolla manibusan was 
told that babies werent in her future 
but after three miscarriages she gave birth to a healthy boy 
the couple both from guam named him after the father figuring 
he was a special and only child 
but they were blessed again with another boy 
we couldnt have him feeling bad said lolla manibusan 
reflecting on her frank decision so he too was equipped with the

members of the house agriculture committee 
plan to finish their work on the 1990 farm bill this week while 
their counterparts in the senate engage in open warfare over 
commodity prices 
the last big issue in the house committee is the conservation 
section of the bill which chairman kika de la garza dtexas said 
would be completed tuesday 
thats the day the senate committee is to go public with its 
arguments over price supports something the members have avoided 
in all their other work on the bill that sets agriculture policy 
for the next five years 
most problems with other sections have been resolved in closed 
meetings between the democratic and republican staffs 
when the staffs couldnt resolve the commodity price support 
problems committee chairman patrick leahy dvt appointed a 
working group of himself sens bob kerrey dneb david 
pryor dark richard lugar rind bob dole rkan and thad 
cochran rmiss 
when the group couldnt resolve the problems the chairman 
decided to go to open session and settle the matter through voting 
i think we will end up getting a bill reported out kerrey 
said last friday it wont be what lugar wants it wont be 
exactly what i want 
kerrey took the lead among the democrats in the committee who 
proposed increasing price supports 1 percent in 1991 and allowing 
other increases in the four subsequent years based on inflation 
rates 
lugars proposal represented the bush administrations position 
that price supports should be frozen at 1990 levels 
kerrey said his proposal would cost 13 billion in 1991 we 
only got 106 billion from the budget committee he said 
he said however that leahy had told him he wouldnt take a 
bill to the full committee unless it had support of all the 
democrats on the panel was within the budget and could bring in 
some of the republicans 
i think we have every disagreement settled except for the loan 
rates said kerrey 
lugar told reporters early last week that he would not accept 
anything other than a freeze in target prices and loan rates he 
said if democrats wanted to make an issue of it they would find 
themselves in a floor battle that could lead to a oneyear 
extension of current law 
the administration wants a oneyear extension said kerrey 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has said repeatedly that 
an extension would be acceptable because international trade talks 
known as gatt to be completed in december could create a need for 
a change in support policies anyway 
in a session with reporters last friday rep charles stenholm 
dtexas a subcommittee chairman on the house agriculture 
committee pointed out the some problems with an extension 
why would you want to go through the same debate twice within 
a 12month period he said theres no such thing as a simple 
oneyear extension when you are dealing with the quirks in the law 
and the budget summit 
congress and the white house have been talking for weeks about 
ways to reduce the federal deficit in what is being referred to as 
a budget summit 
you have to have certainty in the agriculture program said 
stenholm in a oneyear extension theres no certainty

vandals desecrated 80 tombstones in the 
american section of the more than 2500yearold cemetery on the 
biblical mount of olives police said sunday 
police took the cemeterys arab guard in for questioning after 
the desecration was discovered early sunday a police spokesman 
said there were no suspects 
israel television said however that police suspected 
palestinian nationalists were behind the attack 
jewish tradition holds that the mount of olives is where the 
messiah will appear and the prophet ezekiel will blow the trumpet 
of resurrection many prominent rabbis are buried in the cemetery 
the largest and oldest jewish graveyard in the world 
rockhewn tombs at the foot of the mountain date back to the 
time of king solomons temple which was destroyed by the 
babylonians in 586 bc 
some 80 tombstones or raised limestone graves were smashed 
crushed or toppled in two sections of the graveyard located on the 
side of the biblical mount in annexed east jerusalem overlooking 
the walls of the old city 
flowers and memorial candles were strewn over the site and the 
names of many of the deceased could not be read because of the 
damage 
the must have come here with 12pound hammers i dont know 
how they didnt hear this yonatan shamai said pointing to arab 
homes some 50 yards away 
i heard the report on the radio it sent chills down my spine 
i had to come and see for myself said shamai a 43yearold 
diamond worker 
he said his father is buried in the graveyard but his tomb was 
not among the damaged 
jerusalem mayor teddy kollek denounced the desecration and 
warned that it may further disrupt jewisharab relations in the 
city already severely harmed by the 30month palestinian uprising 
an attack on such a sensitive site is destructive for efforts 
to encourage understanding and tranquility that we are trying to 
establish between jews and arabs in the city kollek said in a 
statement 
the incident follows a wave of similar desecrations including 
one in southern france and one in the northern israeli port of 
haifa 
after the desecration of 34 graves in the french town of 
carpentras last month two members of a jewish messianic cult 
desecrated more than 300 jewish graves in haifa with spraypainted 
slogans calling on arabs to kill jews 
the two confessed and said they had hoped that arabs would be 
blamed for the destruction one was sentenced to three years in 
prison and the other was found psychologically unfit to stand 
trial 
although suspects were questioned in the french case no one was 
charged

cruising thrived for one special night in 
the town that styles itself the cruising capital and inspired the 
film american graffiti 
its pure hysteria ray brooks 48 said as he pulled his 
1928 ford truck onto mchenry avenue for its first pass of the night 
saturday in this central california citys annual grafitti night 
no matter that it took as long as three hours to negotiate the 
fivemile mchenry cruising strip among some 25000 vintage and late 
model cars on graffiti night speed takes a back seat to showing 
off cars and meeting dates 
i think whats special about the night is all the people 
said tom greco 45 
passersby flocked like moths to the flashing purple and blue 
neon sparkplug wires on grecos 1929 ford not to be deprived of 
cruisings rites just because they were on foot a pair of 
pedestrians answered the wail of a tractortrailer horn with blares 
from fog horns they carried 
people came from miles around to join the revelry an estimated 
70000 to 80000 pedestrians made the sidewalks as prone to 
gridlock as the avenue still the crowds parted easily for larry 
wooldridge who had a 14foot python around his neck 
more than 200 police officers patrolled in cars and on foot 
police lt dennis puthuff said 85 people were arrested mostly for 
drinking in public though one person was held for felony assault 
with a deadly weapon 
following the plot of the 1973 film american graffiti 
directed by modesto native george lucas high school seniors 15 
years ago established graffiti night on the first saturday after 
graduation 
many regard the film as a documentary of sorts on the cruising 
tradition and say it established this city of 130000 as the 
cruising capital 
as longtime cruiser bill miller of phoenix puts it cruisers 
revere modesto 
modestos primacy as the cruising mecca was threatened by the 
approval in march of two ordinances to limit the gasolineguzzling 
pastime the rules impose fines for loitering on foot and for 
passing on wheels checkpoints more than twice supporters said 
the cruising tradition popularized in the 1950s is no longer good 
natured when influenced by 1990sstyle vandalism drugs and gangs 
graffiti night however is the one time each year the fines 
dont apply and revelers took full advantage 
we are the original graffiti people said pam vieira 
turlock high school class of 1962 
vieira and her companions spent much of the evening watching the 
parade from the back of their 1954 chevy pickup truck after it 
overheated in the crawling traffic 
they werent alone parking lots became impromptu vintage 
automobile shows while late model cars dominated the strip 
diluting what many identify as the true cruising experience 
thats not what cruisings about its about talking to the 
guy in the car next to you or the girl in the car next to you if 
the stereos blaring how are you going to get to know them and 
marry them said charlotte mallory 44 with her husband in a 
1960 morris minor 
they met while cruising in san leandro and reared two teenage 
daughters in the back seat of a car cruising she said

polls which closed at 6 pm observers said voting for the 3774 
seats took place in an atmosphere of calm 
officials said preliminary figures on voter turnout would 
probably not be available until monday official results might take 
longer 
rightwing and leftwing parties announced a boycott of the 
elections while islamic fundamentalists were banned from the 
balloting 
in the last legislative elections held in 1988 the ruling 
party won every seat in the national assembly opposition parties 
later accused the party of abusing its control of state funds 
transport and mass media 
the constitutional democratic party has held power since french 
colonial rule ended decades ago 
municipal and regional elections will be held tuesday in 
neighboring algeria the first time that nations ruling national 
salvation front has faced a challenge from opposition parties 
the officially recognized fundamentalist islamic salvation front 
is expected to pose the strongest challenge to the front which has

the nations healthcare system for the elderly has 
been bilked of huge sums perhaps billions of dollars by private 
insurance companies that refuse to pay their share according to a 
series of legal actions 
in lawsuits by federal officials and a miami law firm a 
chattanooga tennbased insurer provident life and accident 
insurance co is accused of circumventing an 8yearold revision 
in medicare policy designed to make insurers pay 80 percent of 
medical costs for working people 65 and older 
previously the socalled working aged had 80 percent of 
their medical bills paid by medicare 
the lawsuits were filed quietly 14 months ago but are just now 
moving into the courtroom 
the attorneys from the miami law firm said their lawsuit accuses 
four other private insurers of such tactics while the us justice 
department has become involved only in the provident action 
the lawsuits allege that the insurance company knowingly paid 
only 20 percent of the bill and counted on medicare to cover the 
rest the 1982 revisions were made to ease financial pressure on 
the 97 billionayear program 
this is fraud pure and simple said miami attorney luis 
bustamante who says he uncovered the medicare losses while 
representing a client in 1983 
its a monster bustamante said in an interview last week 
the senate governmental affairs committees permanent 
subcommittee on investigations is scheduled to begin hearings next 
month on the allegations 
but there is discord among the accusers bustamante and 
colleagues in the stinson lyons gerlin amp bustamante law firm of 
miami claim the justice department merely copied their action 
against provident after reviewing piles of documents and 
depositions the miami law firm gathered 
justice department officials did not answer numerous calls to 
their washington office last week seeking comment 
the whole medicare system is based on trust its so open for 
abuse said bustamante 
bustamante said he first learned of the medicare problem while 
representing miami trucking executive armlon leonard leonard 67 
was severely injured in a 1983 car crash and spent 15 months 
including a year in intensive care at miamis jackson memorial 
hospital before he died 
his medical bill 800000 
while reviewing leonards medical bills bustamante said he 
learned that provident life and accident ins co did not uphold 
its 1 million policy claiming it was reduced to 50000 of 
coverage after leonard turned 65 and became eligible for federal 
coverage 
bustamante says his probe indicated that some companies never 
started picking up the increased tab for the working aged 
required under the amended law the companies allegedly would allow 
medicare to pick up 80 percent then send only 20 percent instead 
of sending 80 percent themselves and allowing medicare to get a 
refund 
bustamante filed a false claims act lawsuit in miami in march 
1989 alleging provident was failing to pay its required 80 pecent 
of leonards bill 
the 127yearold federal false claims act broadened in recent 
years allows private citizens to file fraud allegations against 
the government or act as whistle blowers when federal programs are 
abused 
the justice department reviewed bustamantes claim and the 
accompanying mass of documents and eventually filed its own action 
everything was there and more said leon weinstein a former 
special agent for the office of inspector general of the department 
of health and human services assigned to the bustamante case 
both lawsuits have been transferred to chattanooga tenn 
providents home base but a judge stayed bustamantes suit in 
favor of the federal action 
bustamante said his investigation has turned up stacks of 
evidence of medicare fraud including depositions and internal 
documents at provident 
provident says its not going to talk about the legal action 
for now 
the companys position is that were not discussing this while 
its in litigation said provident spokeswoman jennie storey 
but the company has denied wrongdoing in court documents and is 
vigorously fighting the action 
on monday provident is scheduled to appear at a hearing in 
chattanooga on its request to block the author of a memo from 
testifying in court in the justice department case 
medicare officials have said that underpayments by private 
companies could run into the billions of dollars

conservative communists critical of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms organized sunday to fight 
for control of a new party for the largest soviet republic a 
spokesman said 
if they succeed they will be heading on a collision course with 
the russian republics government whose new president is radical 
reformer boris n yeltsin 
the unofficial northwest news service of leningrad reported 
that radical reformers picketed the entrance to the house of 
political education in that city where sundays meeting took place 
the session of almost 600 party members was called to prepare 
for a conference of all russian communists scheduled for tuesday in 
moscow they picked a slate of candidates for that meeting and 
drafted a proposed platform criticizing national policies 
organizers say there are more than 15 million national party 
members in the soviet unions largest republic most republics also 
have their own parties within the national organization 
as the giant russian republic seeks its place in a rapidly 
changing union it is founding its own party too russians say they 
need the party because their interests have long been secondary to 
national concerns and they have lost their identity 
however as in most other republics the russians are expected 
to form a party under the umbrella of the soviet communist party 
in the secessionminded baltics the communist parties have 
broken with the kremlin 
if the conservatives gain control of the new russian party they 
would exercise broad power over policies and party apparatus in the 
republic that includes 52 percent of the soviet population and 
threequarters of its land 
vladimir komarov a spokesman for the conservatives said their 
proposed platform is consistent with resolutions approved in april 
at an initial gathering in leningrad 
those resolutions accused gorbachevs economic advisers of 
orienting reforms toward a small group of people 
the path they propose leads to a full break with socialism 
the document said 
the leningrad group proposes to push the soviet union out of its 
economic crisis in party by relying on scientific and technological 
advancements komarov said 
the gathering also agreed on a list of more than 100 candidates 
it is promoting for the central committee of the new russian 
communist party komarov said about 80 percent of them are workers 
or peasants 
it is unclear how much support the leningrad group has among 
russian communists but their meeting represented a minority of 
rankandfile party members

a woman who used a controversial machine 
to commit suicide rather than live through the mental destruction 
of alzheimers disease became a pioneer in the battle for death 
with dignity her minister said sunday 
friends and relatives gathered at the first unitarian church 
here for a memorial service for janet elaine adkins 54 who died 
last monday in michigan 
an exceptional woman in life janet would become famous in 
death said the rev alan g deale 
the public attention that her death has received is an 
indication of the level of interest in this phenomenon he said 
i have supported janets right to decide when she would end 
her life deale said adding that the unitarian church supports 
death with dignity 
the unitarian universalist association in 1988 adopted a 
resolution that acknowledging circumstances in which the inherent 
dignity of life may be compromised supported the right to die in 
accordance with ones own choice 
she desired control over her own decision in this matter 
deale said 
to die a little later or a little sooner does not matter 
he said what matters is to live bravely to love wisely to see 
how beautiful the trees are and even the sea to enjoy the world 
 
mrs adkins had planned the joyful hourlong ceremony before 
traveling to michigan where dr jack kevorkian hooked her up to 
the suicide machine he invented she touched a button releasing an 
anasthetic followed by a lethal injection seconds later she was 
dead 
janet loved life but she didnt fear death said her 
friend judy humiston a spiritual person mrs adkins saw death as 
a passing into the next phase of her search for the ultimate truth 
humiston said 
she did not fear death because we understand that life and 
death are necessary to reach heaven deale said 
humiston was one of three friends who spoke of their 
relationships with mrs adkins remembering her passion for life 
and her love of good conversation challenge philosophy music 
travel teaching and tennis 
janet loved to win carol rehmke recalled with a smile 
janet taught me to play chess and we played by mail she won the 
first game and i won the second and we never played the third 
game 
humiston who knew mrs adkins for 28 years recalled how they 
had been young mothers together 
they discussed their roles as wives and mothers and later 
their roles as women as well humiston said noting how mrs adkins 
always challenged others to ask questions and to grow 
i admired her ability to show life with such an optimistic 
and determined viewpoint humiston said 
according to mrs adkins wishes a quartet played a movement 
from string quartet no 2 in d by the 19th century russian composer 
alexander borodin 
mona warner and ryc williamson on guitar and bass 
respectively performed the popular song when i need you 
deale urged everyone to sing joyfully the closing hymn 
beethovens hymn to joy as mrs adkins had asked

thirtysix hours after an explosion 
ripped through a supertanker and set it ablaze more blasts rocked 
the mega borg sending burning debris into the sky like roman 
candles and leaving oil pools burning on the gulf of mexico 
the entire superstructure about the rear onefifth of the ship 
was engulfed in flames the fires intensity had buckled the 
castlelike structures steel walls and partially collapsed the 
ships stack the superstructure blackened by fire saturday was a 
grayish white sunday 
two thick columns of dark gray smoke changing to deep black 
after a ball of flame would erupt from the blaze rose more than 
2000 feet into the sky 
the stern was no more than 5 feet above the waters surface 
where pools of brown oil burned the ship apparently at anchor 
listed slightly to port 
at midday sunday two fireboats occasionally joined by a third 
vessel appeared to be focusing more on keeping the burning oil 
from spreading and keeping the cargo tanks cool than on 
extinguishing the flames which licked from the front of the 
wheelhouse toward the cargo tanks 
one fireboat with rescue one emblazoned on its side shot 
two large streams of water to the starboard side concentrating on 
the cargo decks 
the other fireboat the carolyn chouest kept its two streams on 
the burning sea around the stern a third boat helped when the fire 
on the water surface flared or when oil debris from an explosion 
flew beyond the immediate area 
water from hoses poured from the decks and over the gunwales 
the tattered remains of the ships flag clearly visible on the 
stern saturday were lost in the smoke and flames sunday 
four coast guard boats patrolled a perimeter several hundred 
yards around the ship sunday with several supply boats standing by 
trails of brown oil lingered hundreds of yards away from the 
ship and slicks of light crude oil were visible as far as 16 miles 
away 
smoke from the fire could be seen 35 miles away

president bush dined privately with mexican 
president carlos salinas de gortari at the white house sunday night 
and laid the groundwork for formal negotiations to lift trade 
barriers between the two countries 
a white house spokesman said both presidents believe their 
countries would derive substantial and longterm benefits from 
a trade pact 
the statement by white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
stopped short of announcing the start of formal negotiations to 
forge a free trade pact but administration officials said they 
expect that announcement to come monday 
both presidents declined to answer reporters questions about 
free trade as they posed for photographers on the mansions north 
portico facing pennsylvania avenue 
they went inside for a reception with top us and mexican 
economic officials including on the us side treasury secretary 
nicholas brady commerce secretary robert mosbacher trade 
representative carla hills national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and vice president dan quayle 
later they dined alone in their second white house meeting in 
less than nine months 
salinas who is in the united states on a private visit to 
address the business roundtable will meet with secretary of state 
james baker iii and members of congress on monday and will resume 
consultations on the free trade issue in those meetings 
fitzwater said 
summing up the presidents private meeting fitzwater said 
both leaders believe that the united states and mexico would 
derive substantial and longterm benefits from a comprehensive 
bilateral trade agreement they agreed that bilateral efforts to 
maximize trade and investment opportunities can and should 
complement the trade liberalization achieved in the uruguay round 
of the gatt general agreement on tariffs and trade 
they also discussed the recent superpower summit the fight 
against drug trafficking and other issues bush reiterated the us 
desire for close cooperation with mexican authorities in the 
drug fight said fitzwater 
administration officials said beforehand that the bushsalinas 
meeting would be followed by a formal announcement on monday of 
negotiations to create a free trade pact the officials asked not 
to be identified 
bush earlier sunday declined to predict how long it might take 
to achieve a free trade agreement with mexico 
i want to talk to him first before i can say on that bush 
told reporters as he walked off the golf course at andrews afb in 
suburban maryland earlier sunday but he called the meeting with 
salinas very important 
if successful the trade negotiations could bring all of north 
america 335 million people into a single market free of tariffs 
and other barriers to trade the united states and canada entered a 
free trade agreement two years ago 
bush has close ties with salinas who paid a formal state visit 
to the white house last oct 3 this time their gettogether was 
an informal one with the two presidents dining without aides 
present 
preparatory trade discussions are expected to begin shortly with 
an eye toward launching the formal negotiations before bush and 
salinas next meet in monterrey in december twoway usmexican 
trade now totals about 52 billion a year but experts say it has 
the potential to go much higher 
the reformminded salinas 42 a harvardeducated economist is 
seeking to invigorate mexicos economy a free trade agreement 
could spur job creation south of the border and ease pressures that 
lead mexicans to look for work in the united states illegally 
but it would require dismantling tariffs and other barriers 
erected decades ago to protect mexican industry from competition 
from its rich american neighbor 
usmexican ties have been strained by the recent jailing in 
california of a mexican physician humberto alvarez machain who is 
accused of complicity in the murder of a us drug enforcement 
administration agent in 1985 
bush said last month the united states played no role in 
abducting the doctor but a dea agent subsequently testified in los 
angeles that the agency had authorized a plan for mexican police to 
kidnap the physician and deliver him across the border 
salinas and bush both were elected in 1988 they met as 
presidentselect in november that year in houston and then again 
last october as heads of state 
on monday bush will welcome east german prime minister lothar 
de maiziere to the white house for talks on the new germany and 
europe it will be the first meeting between a us president and 
the head of east germany which until a few months ago was a 
hardline communist state bush had dinner at the white house 
friday night with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
bush and his family held a christening in the rose garden on 
sunday for walker bush the presidents 12th grandchild

a rap group kept its promise to 
sing lyrics from an album ruled obscene and authorities kept their 
word arresting two members of 2 live crew on sunday after an 
adultsonly concert 
the earlymorning arrests came four days after a federal judge 
declared obscene the miami groups album as nasty as they wanna 
be and two days after a local record dealer was arrested for 
selling the popular recording 
broward county sheriffs deputies arrested 2 live crew leader 
luther campbell 29 and singer chris wongwon 26 shortly after 
the show at a hollywood nightclub 
we didnt want to create any commotion in there so i told 
them to let them get out of there and arrest them away from the 
premises said sheriff nick navarro who has led a campaign to 
ban sales of the groups records 
deputies pulled over the rappers limousine a couple of blocks 
away from the club said sheriffs spokesman al gordon 
only campbell and wongwon were taken because the group split up 
after the performance heading in different directions in three 
vehicles gordon said 
we didnt have enough deputies to cover them he explained 
adding that arrest warrants for members mark ross and david hobbs 
would be issued monday 
campbell and wongwon were booked at the broward county jail on 
the misdemeanor charge of violating a prohibition against obscene 
performances the charges were based on the groups performance of 
material from the album which has sold more than 17 million 
copies 
they were freed without bond no court appearance was set if 
convicted they could face up to a year in jail and a 1000 fine 
bruce rogow 2 live crews lawyer said the arrests amounted to 
police harassment the rappers themselves had left for a concert in 
phoenix and could not immediately be reached for comment 
to have a dozen sheriffs officers spending all this time over 
some dirty lyrics seems to me to be obscene rogow said 
plainclothes deputies were inside the club early sunday as the 
rap group led the crowd in chanting repeated insults aimed at 
navarro but gordon said the arrests were not meant as retaliation 
they announced on tv newscasts they were going to do the songs 
which the judge has ruled obscene gordon said thats pretty 
much the same reason we arrested the shopkeeper 
ec records owner charles freeman sold a record and a tape 
version of the album to an undercover deputy friday in front of 
news photographers he faces a firstdegree misdemeanor charge and 
is free on 100 bond 
gordon said the arrests were in keeping with navarros 
contention that if you break the law in broward county youre 
going to jail 
deputies had been checking area record stores since the 
wednesday ruling by us district judge jose gonzalez gordon said 
the only copies of the double album they located were those 
confiscated in fridays arrest he said 
about 15 police officers and 300 fans were on hand saturday 
night as the rappers performed an early show for patrons of all 
ages at hollywoods club futura at that show the group performed 
what it calls the clean version of the albums songs omitting 
the controversial lyrics many of the young concertgoers shouted 
the nasty lyrics themselves 
about 400 people showed up for the later adultsonly nasty 
set early sunday 
in nearby miami beach on friday night 2 live crew performed the 
nasty lyrics at another adultsonly nightclub show that 
performance went off without incident or arrest despite the fact 
that the club was in dade county and therefore covered by the 
judges ruling the ruling declared the recording obscene in 
broward dade and palm beach counties

a bomb exploded in a military barracks rented for 
a birthday party injuring 17 people and police said sunday the 
attack had all the hallmarks of the ira 
the explosion came just before midnight saturday at the 
honorable artillery company barracks a turreted victorian building 
near londons financial district all of those injured were 
civilians 
in northern ireland an offduty member of the ulster defense 
regiment was seriously injured sunday when a bomb exploded beneath 
his car the royal ulster constabulary said no group claimed 
responsibility but members of the locally raised british army 
regiment have been targets of frequent irish repubican army attacks 
there also was no claim of responsibility for the bombing in 
london but police said it was similar to previous attacks by the 
ira which targets british soldiers and military installations 
this should invoke abject contempt for the ira throughout the 
whole of the united kingdom and the republic of ireland prime 
minister margaret thatcher told reporters on a flight back from a 
fourday visit to the soviet union 
scotland yard said london blast was caused by a bomb of some 
sort detective chief superintendent derek willison deputy head 
of the police forces antiterrorist squad said the device had 
been planted on the roof of the building in the previous 24 hours 
the explosion ripped through the ceiling of the thirdfloor bar 
below showering shattered glass and debris on the 30 guests 
attending the blacktie party 
twelve women and five men were treated for cuts and shock at 
nearby st bartholomews hospital and released hospital spokesman 
david dalton said two women were kept overnight for observation of 
possible concussions 
if the explosion was the work of the ira it would be the latest 
in a series of attacks that have been aimed at military targets but 
have killed or injured civilians 
in the last two weeks the ira has killed six people including 
two australian lawyers who were shot to death in the netherlands 
the ira later said it mistook them for british soldiers 
it also has killed a british army recruit who was standing on a 
train platform a british army major in west germany and a retired 
reserve policeman and his wife in belfast 
the ira wants to end british rule over northern ireland and 
unite the predominantly protestant province with the mainly roman 
catholic republic of ireland 
police said the only connection between saturdays party and the 
military was that the hosts father was a member of the army 
reserves it was a 21st birthday party for a cambridge university 
law student mark venn 
capt david venn said his sons party had been held in another 
part of the building and guests decided to have a nightcap at the 
bar before going home 
i was standing by the bar getting some drinks when there was 
an explosion and a flash of light i looked at the floor pieces 
of glass bits of plaster he said 
the barracks bar was not open to the general public and on 
most saturday nights it is full of reserve soldiers 
there was no warning and there has been no claim so it is 
hard to say but it has all the hallmarks of the ira said 
willison the detective 
the honorable artillery company is part of britains volunteer 
reserve force which can be called on in time of national emergency 
to reinforce the fulltime army

eastern europes first free 
elections in decades have largely silenced the communists but not 
old strains of nationalism and other familiar songs of a more 
distant past 
during the past last months elections have been held in east 
germany hungary romania czechoslovakia and bulgaria with much 
of the balloting coming on the heels of revolution 
in czechoslovakia official results sunday showed civic forum 
and its sister organization public against violence won free 
elections on friday and saturday the two paries spearheaded 
novembers prodemocracy revolution 
to many people in prague civic forums founder vaclav havel 
a prominent playwright and former dissident evokes memories of 
tomas garrigue masaryk who founded an independent czechoslovakia 
in 1918 
in bulgaria reform communists who recast themselves as 
socialist party members took a commanding lead over the opposition 
in initial projections of sundays vote it was bulgarias first 
free elections in 58 years 
a socialist victory in bulgaria would be a return to the prewar 
past bulgarias communist party was even older than its soviet 
counterpart and was a strong political presence in bulgaria for 
nearly 100 years 
in poland as elsewhere popular pressure forced the communists 
to loosen their grip on power after partially free elections last 
year polands government fell to control by solidarity the 
broadbased movement born of labor unrest in 1980 
after being suppressed along with solidarity the roman catholic 
church as it was in the past is again a powerful political 
force 
the picture is clouded in romania although the communist party 
formally collapsed in the wake of the bloody december uprising that 
toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu former communist officials 
dominate the freely elected national front government 
but other aspects of the romanian political scene are 
reminiscient of earlier times 
supporters of president ion iliescu paid him the kind of the 
homage normally accorded to past dictators one slogan displayed by 
supporters was iliescu when you appear the sun shines 
hungarys first postcommunist government is that of prime 
minister jozsef antalls democratic forum which won the march 25 
elections on a platform of democracy 
antall placed heavy emphais on hungarian pride in national 
traditions and customs shared by no other people that was reminder 
of leaders past including miklos horthy who came to power in the 
1930s and also played on nationalist concerns 
the transition back to the future is perhaps most palpable for 
east germans 
after a popular movement forced out longtime communist 
authorities they are readying for union with west germany 
creating one germany for the first time since world war ii

a hightechnology module intended to help produce 
semiconductors docked sunday with the soviet space station mir 
the tass news agency said 
the kristall module was launched from the baikonur site in 
soviet central asia on may 31 but problems with its docking 
engines had prevented previous attempts to attach it to the mir 
complex manned by cosmonauts anatoly solovyov and alexander 
balandin 
the launch also had been delayed a few times in recent days 
because of computer problems tass said 
approach and docking were controled by scientists on the ground 
and was completed sunday afternoon 
kristall is intended for the production of highquality 
semiconductors in conditions of weightlessness for the radio 
electronic industry tass said 
it also contains equipment to conduct astrophysical 
geophysical biological and biotechnological experiments tass said 
semiconductors produced in zero gravity can be used in solar 
batteries aboard mir tass said the kristall module reportedly 
contains enough material to produce several solar battery elements 
scientists want to compare the quality of the material produced 
in orbit with that manufactured on earth tass said

a series of powerful explosions sunday 
aboard a blazing supertanker that was carrying 38 million gallons 
of oil sent burning crude spilling into the water officials said 
this is a real big one coast guard chief petty officer todd 
nelson said weve got burning crude oil rolling off the stern 
into the water authorities also said they were concerned that 
the ships stern appeared to be listing 
the five explosions hit nearly 1 days after a blast and fire 
killed at least two crew members and forced evacuation of the 
853footlong norwegian tanker mega borg in the gulf of mexico 
they were the latest in a series of smaller explosions that began 
saturday afternoon 
the ships stern where the fire was concentrated has dropped 
by 58 feet since the first explosion saturday indicating either 
that the cargo had shifted or the mega borg was taking on water 
coast guard lt cmdr frank whipple told a sunday evening news 
conference 
were uncertain what that means whipple said earlier 
its not good said nelson we dont know the possibility 
of it sinking 
there certainly is a larger chance of the ship sinking than 
before the explosions he said were still optimistic that the 
ship and cargo can be saved if there is an effective firefighting 
operation 
by 9 pm the stern had stablized at 5 feet above the 
waterline said coast guard petty officer howard j holmes 
the latest blasts which began late in the morning and ended 
around 1230 pm came shortly after members of a salvage team 
boarded the crippled ship to begin a fullscale assault on the 
blaze they were off the ship before the blasts began and there 
were no reports of injuries 
members of the smit america galveston bay salvage team hired by 
the ships owners were able to shut off some valves to the ships 
tanks whipple told an earlier briefing 
a spill about one mile long north of the vessel and one about 20 
miles long to the south were visible sunday evening prevailing 
currents and winds were expected to push the oil towards a 150 to 
200mile stretch of texas coast between freeport and corpus christi 
thousands of feet of containment booms were being brought in as 
a precaution in case a larger spill developed the tanker 57 miles 
southeast of galveston held 38 million gallons of light crude oil 
a commercial c130 airplane dropped dispersant over parts of the 
spill within a fivemile radius of the tanker late sunday holmes 
said dispersants are used to make oil break up more quickly 
elf a houstonbased oil distributor that was going to market 
the mega borgs cargo is paying for the cleanup holmes said 
seventeen of the 41 crew members rescued were injured none 
seriously in saturdays explosion two remained hospitalized 
sunday in good condition 
the coast guards atlantic strike team from mobile ala and 
other spill response groups brought a highseas barrier boom and 
other supplies including foam to the ship 
four coast guard cutters were in place around the supertanker 
sunday whipple said two smit america ships were spraying water on 
the mega borgs deck to keep the ship as cool as possible while 
two other salvage team ships were in position 
whipple said a fullfledged assault on the fire was scheduled 
for early monday morning when two other smit america ships were 
expected to arrive at the scene the full complement of salvage 
ships was expected to blanket the aft section with 
fireextinguishing foam 
the mega borgs owners also have contracted for an airplane to 
spread dispersants over about 7000 gallons of oil spilled so far 
nelson said 
fireboats worked through saturday night spraying water to cool 
the decks of the supertanker said petty officer richard miled in 
galveston there were several minor explosions overnight he said 
flames shot hundreds of feet high from the ships air vents and 
thick black smoke could be seen from 40 miles away after the 
engine room explosion at 1 am saturday 
in addition to the two confirmed dead two other crewmen 
remained missing sunday and were presumed dead after a search for 
them was called off coast guard chief petty officer rich muller 
said the missing men from the crew of 41 were probably still aboard 
the ship 
the blast occurred as part of its cargo was being transferred to 
a smaller tanker 
the tanker operated by mosvolds shipping of farsund norway 
was bound from palanca angola it was scheduled to travel to aruba 
after its galveston port of call 
a telephone message left sunday seeking comment from the mega

over military and police repression as the best way to fight both 
leftist subversion and cocaine trafficking 
he did not indicate where the money would come from for economic 
development the treasury is running a 100 million current 
deficit and the nation has a 20 billion foreign debt 
before 1000 supporters outside his campaign headquarters

it a protest vote 
it has not been a vote for a political program but a vote to 
stop mario vargas llosa barnechea said after the televised

food subsidies and price controls and attacked vargas llosas 
proposal for an economic shock program 
support for vargas llosa and fujimori was deeply divided along 
class and geographical lines polls indicated 
vargas llosa was favored to win the april 8 first round but 
fujimoris popularity surged fujimori took a close second in the 
field of nine candidates and forced a runoff by denying vargas 
llosa a majority 
some pollsters said voters were inclined to cast a vote based on 
their opposition to one of the candidates 
im voting for a peruvian not a japanese said norma 
olivas a nurse referring to fujimoris japanese roots 
but edith vargas who runs a curbside sandwich stand cast her 
vote for fujimori saying vargas llosa is in debt to the people 
with money the capitalists

requirement that voters dip their index fingers into indelible ink 
after casting ballots 
in past elections rebels have sometimes cut off the fingers of

the ruling socialist party formerly the 
communist party held a commanding lead over the opposition in 
initial projections of sundays voting in bulgarias first free 
elections in 58 years 
the winner in the balloting will set the tone for what is 
expected to be a coalition government 
the ruling socialist party formerly the communist party and 
once moscows most loyal follower favors slow economic reforms 
the main opposition alliance the union of democratic forces wants 
a swift move to a westernstyle market economy 
reform communist leaders such as president petar mladenov and 
defense minister dobri dzhurov enjoy considerable popularity after 
ousting longtime dictator todor zhivkov in november 
in bulgaria unlike other east bloc countries where street 
demonstrations brought down communist regimes reform communists 
engineered the nations drive to democracy 
the communist party also has a long and successful tradition in 
bulgaria the party predates its soviet counterpart and captured 20 
percent of the vote in the nations last free elections in 1932 
political observers said the union of democratic forces lost 
potential supporters because of its poor leadership 
in one instance coalition leeder zhelyu zhelev refused on 
nationwide television to sign an agreement with the socialists for 
a peaceful campaign the pact had previously been initialed by 
other leaders of the democratic forces 
the association for free and fair elections a bulgarian 
monitoring group gave the socialists 483 percent of the ballots 
against 349 percent for the union of democratic forces and 83 
percent for the agrarian party the association has 1000 people 
monitoring the elections 
its projection was based on results from 377 percent of the 
vote cast in the 200 races that will be decided by a proportional 
vote the forecast was supported by the us national democratic 
institute for international affairs 
half of parliaments 400 seats are allocated on the basis of 
proportional representation while the other 200 go to candidates 
who receive more than 50 percent of the vote in direct balloting 
the west german polling organization infas also said the 
socialists were leading the opposition coalition in the elections 
state media reported 
in areas heavily populated by the 15 million ethnic turk 
minority the movement for rights and freedoms led by ahmed dogan 
apparently received about 80 percent of the vote the state bta 
news agency reported 
bta said final official results were expected to be released by 
late monday 
the main task of the unicameral parliament the grand national 
assembly will be to write a new constitution to usher in 
democratic and economic reforms 
the central electoral commission said late sunday that at least 
84 percent of bulgarias 64million eligible voters cast ballots 
bulgaria a country of nearly 9 million last held multiparty 
elections in 1932 
there were scattered reports of irregularities including 
allegations of stolen ballot papers and lastminute campaigning 
banned under electoral law in some polling stations voting was 
suspended because of a shortage of ballot papers officials said 
electoral commission president zhivko stalev said voting was 
only delayed to put new ballot papers in booths 
given the fact that these are the first free elections and 
against the background of the elections as a whole i would say 
that those minor infractions could not be regarded as something 
discrediting the elections as a whole he said 
in the race 3143 candidates from 38 parties vied for seats in 
the grand national assembly 
sofia residents began voting as soon as polls opened at 7 am 
the voting stations officially closed at 6 pm but remained open 
in some areas so all those on line could cast ballots 
thousands of bulgarian and foreign observers monitored the 
voting 
a runoff is set for june 17 in constituencies where no candidate 
wins a majority 
the assemblys goals will be to deal with growing inflation a 
10 billion foreign debt and acute shortages of basic consumer 
items including sugar and cheese 
with sundays election bulgaria becomes the fifth soviet bloc 
nation to hold multiparty balloting in the last four months after 
decades of oneparty communist rule

east german prime minister lothar de maiziere 
said sunday he understands jewish concerns about a unified germany 
but said they are unfounded in this new era 
against the background of the past i have full understanding 
for many jewish citizens anxieties for a united germany de 
maiziere said in a speech to members of the world jewish congress 
nevertheless i wish to emphasize no one needs to have 
misgivings or even fears of a united germany he said germany 
today is totally different from germany between 1933 and 1945 
national socialism as all dictatorships could flourish only 
behind curtains of whatever kind there can be no torture chamber 
in a common european home with all its doors and windows widely 
opened to all sides de maiziere said 
the world jewish congress which represents jewish organizations 
in 70 countries released de maizieres speech translated into 
english 
before the dinner de maiziere met privately with congress 
president edgar bronfman and the two held a joint news conference 
bronfman said he was not overly concerned a united germany might 
theaten the jewish people 
but being a jew he added and having lived through the 
nazi era im never going to be totally relaxed about the 
situation 
through a translator de maiziere said nazitype atrocities 
are possible only under a totalitarian system and i suppose as 
far as totalitarian regimes are concerned we have thoroughly 
learned our lesson 
de maiziere was in new york to meet with representatives of the 
conference on jewish material claims set up in 1951 to negotiate 
reparations to israel for the deaths of 6 million jews at nazi 
hands 
to us attention to our jewish fellow citizens is not an issue 
of social services or budgeting it is a matter near to our 
heart de maiziere said in his speech we shall as soon as 
possible provide the general conditions for specific negotiations 
on indemnification 
the east german compensation could reach into the billions of 
dollars but might be limited by the countrys financial problems 
east germany ended nearly 45 years of communist rule with its 
first free elections in march and is uniting with west 
germanyeconomic union is scheduled for completion by july and 
west germany is expected to assume many of its financially strapped 
neighbors liabilities 
under a 1952 agreement west germany has paid more than 40 
billion in reparations to israel jewish groups and individual 
claimants 
the luxembourg agreement called for west germany to pay

but east germanys communist leaders citing nazi persecution of 
communists refused to accept responsibility or pay the remaining 
third of the claims after world war ii east germany was dominated

one of the first acts of the new democratic east german 
parliament was to concede a share of the blame for the nazis deeds 
all we can do is to try to learn our lesson from that period 
in german history and to keep alive memory of the victims and to 
fight passionately even the slightest manifestation of 
antisemitism racism in general and xenophobia wherever they may 
crop up said de maiziere 
on monday he was to head to washington for the first white

to be ferried ashore sunday after the ship ran aground in heavy fog 
and began taking on water but no injuries were reported 
the 617foot bermuda stars hull was holed in two places when it 
slammed into submerged rocks about two miles from this village 
seaport on the southwestern tip of cape cod coast guard officials 
said 
none of the 680 passengers or 380 crew members was ever in 
danger said coast guard lt peter keane there was no panic on 
board keane said 
passengers luggage and much of the crew were taken by 
commercial ferries across buzzards bay to new bedford the first 
crowded passenger ferry docked in a heavy downpour shortly before 7 
pm where buses waited to whisk people to hotels in the boston 
area 
we were standing at the information desk on the boat when we 
heard this crunch said passenger wilfred smith 65 of colorado 
as he stepped onto the new bedford pier i said to my wife we 
hit something 
scot graham a coast guard marine safety officer in providence 
ri said the ship was three hours ahead of schedule and off 
course when it ran aground in the morning 
im sure they didnt want to be where they were graham 
said they should have been more south 
tugboats freed the ship from the rocks at 910 pm and it was 
anchored in buzzards bay where divers patched up the hull holes 
said coast guard petty officer 1st class dan vineski 
earlier efforts to free the ship had been given up to await the 
high tide 
vineski said moving the ship did not appear to worsen a fuel 
spill graham said earlier that booms were used to contain an 
estimated 1000 to 1500 gallons of fuel that spilled from the 
ships engine area and workers used absorbent material to soak it 
up 
leakage was stabilized by the vessel holding steady on the 
rocks said coast guard petty officer greg creedon flooding aboard 
the ship was under control by midday 
the accident canceled the cruise but was considered relatively 
minor this is a kind of fenderbender for the marine world 
creedon said 
vineski said the ships captain whom he declined to identify 
and other crew members took blood and alcohol tests routinely 
required after accidents he said results were expected monday 
the accident occurred as the ship waited in the dense fog for 
permission from the army corps of engineers to enter the cape cod 
canal leading to cape cod bay vineski said it apparently strayed 
too close to shore and ran aground in water less than 30 feet deep 
possibly on a rocky ledge 
the coast guard got a distress call shortly after 8 am 
vineski said 
fog had cut visibility to about one quartermile when the 
accident occurred officials said 
the ship was en route from new york to halifax nova scotia a 
stop had been planned for sunday in provincetown on the north tip 
of cape cod

the archbishop of san salvador 
on sunday accused police of torture and appealed for prosecution of 
those who abuse human rights 
there is a great clamor against the impunity that by the 
design tolerance and perhaps maliciousness of military and 
judicial authorities reigns in the country archbishop arturo 
rivera damas said in his sunday homily at the sacred heart basilica 
rivera damas the countrys highest roman catholic authority 
also condemned the destruction of evidence in the case of six 
jesuit priests their housekeeper and her daughter who were 
murdered by soldiers last november the supreme court said last 
week that a lieutenant one of nine soldiers charged with the 
murders burned pertinent military log books on orders from his 
superior 
this is a manifest abuse of power because arms are not in the 
hands of the military to impede the functioning of justice but 
rather to assure the application of justice the archbishop said 
in comments to journalists following the mass 
rivera damas denounced what he said was the torture last week of 
carlos gonzalez perez by members of the national guard one of 
three police forces 
gonzalez a spaniard was arrested june 4 and held at national 
guard headquarters until he was released into the custody of the 
spanish embassy on thursday no charges were filed against 
gonzalez who reportedly was a social worker employed by the san 
salvador archdiocese 
rivera damas used the word torture in describing the 
treatment of gonzalez but gave no further details spanish 
diplomatic sources said gonzalez was in bad physical and 
psychological shape when handed over to embassy personnel 
gonzalez was flown to costa rica where he was hospitalized 
rivera damas also condemned murders carried out by rightwing 
and leftists hit squads at least 71000 people have died in the
