relatives of those killed by the bomb that 
destroyed pan am flight 103 should direct their anger at the airline 
and the us government not britain a legislator of the governing 
party said friday 
pan am confirmed it had been warned by the west german government 
nov 10 about the kind of radiocassette player bomb involved 
in washington bush administration officials said investigators 
believe they found bits of the suitcase that contained the plastic 
explosive that destroyed the pan am jumbo jet in december the new 
york times reported saturday 
the officials who spoke anonymously said experts are analyzing 
the chemical makeup of the shards to determine the suitcase brand 
and trace the owner the times reported 
politicians of the opposition labor party charged transport 
secretary paul channon with bungling a warning dated two days before 
the disaster but not mailed until several days later 
john prescott the labor transportation spokesman accused the 
government of planting stories in several london newspapers friday 
that said the bomber was identified or even arrested 
scottish and west german authorities denied the reports of an 
arrest 
investigators have said a bomb in a radiocassette player brought 
the boeing 747 down dec 21 killing all 259 people aboard and 11 
residents of the market town of lockerbie scotland 
david wilshire of the conservative party who specializes in 
transportation issues said some relatives of victims have been 
blaming the british government blaming heathrow blaming anybody 
except the people i think they ought to be complaining about namely 
the american government and pan am 
west germany had warned pan am which also received a warning 
from the us federal aviation administration on nov 18 wilshire 
said so what has it got to do with the british government are 
pan am deaf or not 
in new york pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon confirmed friday 
that the west german governments warning was received nov 10 
responding to wilshires charge that the airline forgot to tell 
anybody about earlier warnings she said frankly i dont think 
its for the company to disclose that 
ms hanlon said pan am tightened security after receiving the 
warning and those precautions remained in effect 
the west german warning followed the arrest oct 26 of 13 alleged 
members of a radical palestinian group the popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command authorities reported 
seizing a radiocassette player bomb with a detonator rigged to go 
off at high altitude 
west german officials briefed representatives of the united 
states britain and other nations in november about the discovery 
alexander prechtel spokesman for west germanys chief prosecutor 
said friday in karlsruhe 
there were pictures and an explanation of how the bomb 
functioned he said this was about three weeks after it was 
found because it took time to analyze the device 
prechtel said the west germans told their colleagues such a 
device could blow up a jetliner but did not name a specific threat 
the faa notified us flag carriers including pan am on nov 
18 and britain notified its national carriers nov 22 
criticism of channon arose this week with the disclosure that the 
transport department prepared a warning dated dec 19 two days 
before the disaster that included photographs of a mock 
radiocassette bomb and sent it by mail 
channon told the times of london the warning was not mailed until 
after the disaster but he insisted it contained no information not 
already gven to pan am 
at issue are two warnings the november alert from west germany 
and an anonymous telephone call received dec 5 by the us embassy 
in helsinki finland claiming a palestinian group would attack a 
usbound pan am flight originating in frankfurt within two weeks 
elizabeth deludedix an american whose irish husband was killed 
on flight 103 said thursday she was bewildered and also very 
angry 
now we know that the government had information which told them 
the carrier that would be affected pan american the origin of the 
flight frankfurt that the threatened period was during the month 
of december and now weve learned that they also had information 
about the exact kind of bomb that was used 
lord fraser scotlands senior law enforcement officer said 
friday the helsinki warning was bogus 
police officers went to helsinki and made inquiries into that 
particular warning which was made anonymously and the conclusion 
reached now is that that phone call has not got any relevance to the 
lockerbie disaster or the subsequent inquiry he said 
finnish authorities said in december they knew the man who made 
the threat and several previous ones and the man who allegedly was 
to plant the bomb fe they concluded the caller was pursuing a 
grudge and the man he accused was harmless

with us soldiers watching from guard 
towers on the other side of the border maj kang sung nam of the 
north korean army launched a verbal assault on the americans 
blaming them for dividing the korean people 
panmunjom is just a military demarcation line which the 
imperialist americans drew to divide the korean people kang told 
tourists from hong kong during a visit to the snowdusted truce 
village on the border of north and south korea 
we hope you can go back and tell your people that we koreans 
are longing for reunification 
kang then presented each tourist with a lapel pin depicting two 
hands shaking across the korean peninsula set on a background of the 
north korean flag 
although hundreds of thousands of troops from north and south man 
the tense 155milelong demilitarized zone panmunjom is a tourist 
attraction for both sides 
the official north korean tour of panmunjom includes the use of a 
largescale model to explain the demilitarized zone that was set up 
after the korean war it also includes as a visit to one of the 
large huts that straddle the demarcation line where the two sides 
have negotiated since the armistice in 1953 
the north koreans offer a version of the 195053 korean war 
markedly different from that of the south koreans and americans who 
fought under the banner of the united nations command 
visitors are shown a 20minute documentary accusing the united 
states of invading the communist north using chemical weapons and 
bearing sole responsibility for the peninsulas division the film 
features closeups of wounded korean civilians and surrendering us 
soldiers 
the documentary does not mention however that it was north 
koreas invasion of the south on june 25 1950 that set off the war 
nor does it refer to the chinese who entered the conflict to help 
north korea recover from severe military setbacks 
kang repeatedly maintained that at the 1953 truce signing in 
panmunjom the south korean representative was unable to speak for 
his people because he said the negotiations were dominated by the 
united states 
the north and south remain technically at war with each 
government claiming to be the legitimate ruler of all korea 
but in recent months the two sides have been exchanging 
proposals on ending the confrontation and panmunjom the site of the 
latest round of political talks once again has been the focus of 
attention 
panmunjom became neutral after the war but has been a symbol of 
the division and tension on the peninsula to both north and south 
the heavily militarized korean peninsula includes an estimated 
850000 military regulars in north korean and 650000 soldiers in 
south korea supported by a 42000member us military contingent 
but north korean officials talk as though any hostilities would 
come from the south 
the peoples army is here to protect you tour guide yoon mu 
ho reassured the tourists as eight north korean soldiers stood 
stiffly at attention at the truce village huts

in a town where a mortuary is a top tourist draw 
and the curious pay to visit sites of celebrity suicides a new 
themepark ride celebrating a catastrophic california earthquake 
fits right in 
never mind that the earthquake simulated in the big one 
which opens saturday at universal studios hollywood could kill 
14000 people seriously injure up to 55000 others and cause 17 
billion in property damage 
its an entertainment attraction not a sociology experiment 
said sidney sheinberg president and chief operating officer of mca 
inc the theme parks parent company i think this is fun we 
dont think this is in bad taste or we wouldnt have done it 
like the popular tours at forest lawn memorial park and the 
celebrity suicide and murder junket run by the local grave line 
tours the universal studios earthquake attraction is inherently 
married to the loss of life 
the ride has been touted as the scariest thing to hit 
california since 1906 when a quake struck san francisco and killed 
2000 mother natures fiercest demonstration of her power 
another promotional teaser read 
advertising for the disaster attraction includes a billboard in 
whittier just a few blocks from several buildings leveled by a 
59magnitude quake and a 53magnitude aftershock in october 1987 
eight deaths were blamed on that quake as were 200 injuries and 
358 million in damage 
named after the huge temblor seismologists say will hit 
california within the next 30 years universals big one was 
built in an enclosed set at a cost of 14 million its original 
opening date in november was delayed because of design problems 
set in a san francisco subway station the big one features a 
violently shaking platform on which universal studios tram cars sit 
a runaway subway car littered with bodies erupting sidewalks a 
burst propane tank a 60000gallon wall of water collapsing 
ceilings sparking transformers and several other disasterrelated 
effects 
it is threatening youre never sure whats going to happen 
said show designer larry lester 
theres a thing in our business called the safe scare where 
you go to the point where entertainment value is maximized without 
having tour guests be afraid said barry upson mcas executive 
vice president for planning and development having bodies in the 
attractions runaway subway car he said is simply show 
business 
the 145second simulation staged as many as 200 times a day is 
designed to mimic an earthquake measuring 83 on the openended 
richter scale estimated by seismologists to be about the same 
magnitude as the 1906 san francisco shock that leveled 500 square 
blocks 
an 83 quake centered on californias san andreas fault is 
expected to be the worst calamity to strike the united states since 
the civil war dams may burst huge landslides could be triggered 
and entire cities might be devastated the federal emergency 
management agency estimates that such a quake would kill 14000 an 
equally strong quake on a fault closer to downtown los angeles could 
kill many more 
despite the attractions macabre implications the big one 
was designed to lure instate visitors to universals theme park 
mca executives said where else can a southern californian come 
and enjoy an earthquake sheinberg asked 
with 42 million visitors in 1988 the universal studios tour 
home of the king kong and jaws attractions was the 
nations fourth most popular theme park adult admission is 1895 
a similar universal studios tour is scheduled to open in florida 
later this year making the california parks need for local 
visitors more pressing 
along with entertainment this is going to be a learning 
experience said show designer lester im well aware of 
earthquakes and ive been shaken up quite a bit but im far more 
frightened by tornadoes 
charlton heston who starred in universals 1974 box office hit 
earthquake and has experienced universals big one said the 
ride can serve as a dress rehearsal for the killer quake many people 
acknowledge is coming 
ive been through a couple of real ones but not the big one 
said heston a california native this is good training

scientists are digging up the centuryold 
remains of five prospectors caught in a snowstorm and eaten by one 
of their companions and residents hope to cash in on the notoriety 
surrounding the case 
not everyone is pleased with the fuss being made over alferd 
packers cannibalism during the winter of 1874 
i run into some people who wonder if we ought to give so much 
attention to alferd packer said grant houston president of the 
hinsdale county historical society 
there are a lot more worthy people who have passed through 
here but they didnt commit cannibalism so theyre boring 
compared with packer and his hold on the popular imagination 
packer was the sole survivor in a party of six prospectors who 
got caught in snows near slumgullion pass and he later admitted 
eating the flesh of his five companions 
he insisted he killed only one in selfdefense and told 
conflicting tales about the other deaths 
while scientists this summer begin exhuming the victims bones to 
determine how they died residents of the tourismdependent county 
plan a number of special events celebrating packers notoriety 
the county museum which will open in june will display packer 
relics including shackles that held him and a model gallows 
intended to hang him in april 1883 packer was convicted of 
manslaughter served a brief sentence and was pardoned in 1901 he 
died a free man 
in july a drama based on the packer trial will be performed in 
the secondfloor courtroom where packer was tried members of the 
audience will site as jury at each performance 
a full line of packer souvenirs for tourists is expected as well 
the lead researcher of the exhumation is not amused 
if this all gets out of hand well just pack up and leave

former national security adviser robert 
mcfarlanes equivocal and confusing testimony could help oliver 
north in defending himself against charges that he lied to congress 
the prosecution at norths irancontra trial tried to pin 
mcfarlane down thursday on the question of who wrote two misleading 
letters to congress 
the letters in september 1985 carried mcfarlanes signature but 
north is accused of helping to prepare them three of the 12 
criminal charges against north are that he obstructed congress and 
made false statements in connection with the two letters 
last monday mcfarlane testified that he assumed it was north who 
prepared a draft of a letter to thenus rep michael barnes 
denying national security council staffers solicited funds for the 
contras or offered tactical advice at the time of the letter north 
an nsc aide was helping raise contributions and overseeing a 
secret military supply operation 
but on tuesday afternoon responding to questions from north 
lawyer brendan sullivan mcfarlane acknowledged he wasnt sure north 
had prepared the draft 
i assume the prosecutors wouldnt show me something that wasnt 
true he added 
is there anything to show that north had anything to do with 
it asked sullivan 
no responded mcfarlane 
on wednesday morning us district judge gerhard a gesell 
declared that mcfarlane had given equivocal and confusing 
testimony the question said gesell is whether mcfarlane or 
his subordinate north was officially and knowingly responsible for 
specific activities attributed to north in the indictment 
on thursday afternoon prosecutor john keker pressed mcfarlane 
who responded that north was the only person who could have 
written the draft of the letter to barnes mcfarlane said that he 
had gotten a draft back and that i started from something 
in connection with the other letter to thenhouse intelligence 
committee chairman lee hamilton mcfarlane didnt dispute the 
suggestion by sullivan that just two paragraphs written by north 
for which he was not charged with a crime ended up in the final 
version 
however keker brought out that north had reviewed a draft 
prepared by mcfarlane and made some changes but left untouched the 
denials regarding soliciting funds and offering tactical advice 
you both knew you were doing something wrong keker told 
mcfarlane in reference to the two letters 
i knew i was withholding information responded mcfarlane 
he north was clearly concerned about how to answer them 
i made a judgment and i went ahead with it said the former 
national security adviser 
it was the last in a string of comments over five days of 
testimony by mcfarlane one of the prosecutions central witnesses 
that appeared to be an attempt to take the burden off north 
mcfarlane repeatedly testified that he as national security 
adviser was responsible for the letters 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of 
withholding information from congress in connection with the 
letters and to two additional misdemeanor counts he was fined 
20000 the charges north faces are felonies each carrying a 
maximum fiveyear prison term on conviction

verdis rigoletto when played and sung well 
can reach inside a listener and stir up the emotions 
the metropolitan opera in its first performance of rigoletto 
this season did just that 
leo nucci whos singing in four operas at the met this season 
sang the title role beautifully when nucci was singing before 
entering his house in act 1 we feared he was just walking through 
the part but when events became emotional for rigoletto nucci 
became emotional he greeted his daughter with love later after 
she has been raped he is moving in his distress and tenderness for 
her feelings rigoletto has been a callous man before but nucci 
melts a listeners heart when singing a fathers anguish 
heikyung hong sang gilda the daughter her voice is honey sweet 
and so clear that it conveys purity and even a spiritual quality 
she sang caro nome slowly instead of making a dazzling display 
of fast coloratura that such a girl is in love then harmed then 
decides to die to save the unworthy man she loves makes her story 
more moving than usual 
taro ichihara sang the duke in act 1 his voice sounded grainy 
tense on top and too mellow for a tenor in the low register 
however after he warmed up his voice sounded more unified and made 
a strongly favorable impression 
timothy noble was good as monterone who puts a curse on 
rigoletto when he does that the lighting is dramatic nucci takes 
his jesters cap off making rigoletto look like a person not a 
clown the only strong light is on his horrified face monterone is 
dimly seen otherwise only lighted candles held by chorus members 
are seen 
bass janhendrik rootering also was vocally strong as the 
assassin sparafucile 
the orchestra and chorus were secure under conducting by nello 
santi he has conducted the opera at the met before only four 
singers of the 13 principals had sung their roles in the house 
before 
this production which has a revolving round center structure 
looking like a big wedding cake was new in 1977 we havent liked 
it but it does provide a round balcony one flight up where 
characters can sing and observe next season the met will have a 
new rigoletto production with nucci again in the title role and 
luciano pavarotti as the duke

the pace is picking up the analysts are 
marshaling their arguments the specialists are checking their 
figures the prognosticators are peering into their crystal balls 
this is the chance for defense and foreign affairs experts to 
make their mark in the nearly brand new bush administration it is 
their chance to influence policy 
some of them have come out of the think tanks for just this 
purpose others are grizzled veterans of the pentagon the state 
department and the arms control and disarmament agency 
what they are busily working on is a fourpart policy report due 
april 21 that is bound to have a heavy impact on how the united 
states deals with the soviet union not to mention other adversaries 
and allies 
for instance president bush will not set a date for a resumption 
of strategic weapons reduction negotiations with the soviets until 
the report is in and digested 
the four parts are an overall review of existing us defense 
forces policy needs for the 1990s whether changes are needed in 
conventional and nuclear forces arms control policy 
the four parts are to be completed in sequence at this stage 
the first is going through revisions the second is about to be put 
down in draft form the third and fourth parts depend on the results 
of the first two studies 
with the final deadline more than a month away the bush 
administration is likely to feel continuing heat from critics who 
complain of footdragging 
us policy is taking shape at a very slow pace 
congress is demanding an early answer to what kind of mobile 
missile the united states will add to its nuclear arsenal the 
choices are a singlewarhead midgetman on trucks or the huge 
10warhead mx launched from railroad cars 
then there is the question of how hard the bush administration 
wants to pursue a spacebased antimissile program known popularly 
as star wars it was dear to the heart of president reagan but not 
to most members of congress there is a suspicion bush and national 
security adviser brent scowcroft are skeptical about developing a 
reliable scheme to shoot down soviet ballistic missiles in space 
the soviets meanwhile with a touch of impatience want to know 
when strategic weapons reductions talks will be resumed a treaty to 
cut longrange bombers missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 
percent to 50 percent depending on the system of counting was 
about 90 percent done when talks in geneva were suspended last 
december 
there was a tentative agreement to resume in midfebruary but 
bush ordered an indefinite postponement for the policy review the 
10 percent of the treaty that isnt finished is a very tough 10 
percent among the unsettled problems are whether to try to limit 
mobile missiles and how to verify compliance with negotiated 
cutbacks 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze tried to get 
secretary of state james a baker iii to set a date for a resumption 
when they met in vienna march 7 but baker said the review had to be 
completed first however they decided to meet in moscow sometime in 
the first half of may to begin preparations for a superpower summit 
meeting 
with winter just receding from washington the april 21 deadline 
and the bakershevardnadze meeting in may seem far away but the 
clock is ticking and all those experts and analysts want to polish 
their assessments in the most convincing way

round two in the impeachment trial of judge 
alcee l hastings begins today following senate refusal to dismiss 
charges that he plotted to get a 150000 bribe and lied about it at 
his trial 
senate leaders named a 12member committee thursday to hear 
evidence after the lawmakers firmly refused to drop 16 of the 17 
impeachment articles against the 52yearold hastings the first 
black federal judge in florida history 
earlier the senate deliberated for 2 hours behind closed doors 
and then voted 930 against dismissal of an article accusing 
hastings of perjury at the 1983 trial that ended in his acquittal of 
charges that he conspired to obtain the payoff 
the senate voted 921 against dismissal of the first 15 articles 
which accused him of plotting with a washington attorney to take the 
bribe 
hastings did not seek dismissal of an unrelated article accusing 
him of disclosing information obtained from a wiretap and thus 
wrecking a federal investigation of miamiarea corruption 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio was the only senator to vote 
for dismissal of the first 15 articles 
metzenbaum press secretary nancy coffey said the senator believed 
it might be unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial on the 
conspiracy charges when hastings already had been acquitted of them 
by a jury 
the senator had constitutional concerns about double 
jeopardy coffey said 
the double jeopardy argument was the spearhead of hastings 
defense when he took the senate floor in a personal appeal to the 
lawmakers for dismissal of the charges 
i proclaimed my innocence then as i have from the outset and as 
i do now hastings declared 
rep john bryant dtexas one of several prosecutors from the 
house of representatives scoffed at the judges claim that double 
jeopardy protection applies to an impeachment trial he urged the 
senators to remove hastings from the bench and shut off his 89500 
annual salary because of his inexcusable breaches of the public 
trust 
evidence now is to be presented to the 12member committee and 
videotaped for the benefit of senators too busy to attend the weeks 
of sessions that are expected in the case majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine scheduled an organizational meeting for the panel 
today 
once the evidence has been heard the matter then will be 
returned to the senate floor for a final decision 
members of the panel are sens jeff bingaman dnm patrick j 
leahy dvt joe lieberman dconn david pryor dark bob 
kerrey dneb richard h bryan dnev arlen specter rpa 
david durenberger rminn warren rudman rnh slade gorton 
rwash christopher s bond rmo and conrad burns rmont 
it appeared clear that the committee would have to slog through 
weeks of testimony and tactical maneuvering before coming up with 
its final report 
the articles of impeachment say hastings conspired with 
washington attorney william borders in 1981 to reduce the punishment 
of two brothers frank and tom romano of miami from threeyear 
prison sentences to probation they had been convicted in hastings 
court of skimming from a teamsters pension fund loan 
in return hastings and borders allegedly were to receive 
150000 
the romano brothers both of whom have since died refused to pay 
any bribe but the fbi mounted a stingtype operation and arrested 
borders pulling out of a suburban virginia motel with a garment bag 
containing 125000 handed to him by an undercover agent 
masquerading as frank romano 
borders was convicted in a separate trial of conspiracy and went 
to prison the house voted the articles of impeachment against 
hastings on a 4133 vote aug 3

cambodias provietnamese government has 
freed 167 thai fishermen caught poaching in its waters officials 
said 
as a result of years of uncontrolled exploitation most of thais 
marine resources have been depleted so its huge fleet often fishes

a bill to shield federal employees who expose 
waste fraud and abuse is moving again toward enactment with 
presidential backing after an earlier version was vetoed in the 
final days of the reagan administration 
there is no more effective way for us to fight waste and 
mismanagement in the federal government sen carl levin dmich 
the chief sponsor said thursday before the senate approved the 
measure 970 
the bill backed by the bush administration appears to have 
excellent prospects in the house where action could come as early 
as tuesday 
under the bill an independent special counsels office would be 
set up to protect federal employees including whistleblowers the 
office is now part of the merit systems protection board which 
enforces the civil service laws 
under the measure it would be easier for federal employees to 
prove that their firing or demotion came in retaliation for 
whistleblowing and there would be additional guarantees of 
confidentiality 
the measure would permit employees to take their cases directly 
to the merit systems protection board if the special counsel did not 
do so within 120 days the board could issue orders protecting the 
employees from harassment during an investigation 
the bill passed both houses unanimously last year and lawmakers 
assumed that it was assured of thenpresident reagans signature 
but in october reagan killed it with a pocket veto setting off 
what levin called a torrent of displeasure on a bipartisan basis 
among lawmakers 
when congress is out of session the president can kill a measure 
by simply refusing to sign it 
the reagan administration said last fall that the bill could have 
resulted in government agencies filing suit against each other and 
that it weighted the system too heavily in favor of the employees 
a compromise was reached between the bush administration and 
senators last week under which the lawmakers agreed to drop a 
provision enabling the special counsel to go to court on behalf of 
whistleblowers 
under the compromise new safeguards were built into the bill 
for example the special counsel would be barred from intervening 
against an employee in a whistleblower case 
sen william cohen rmaine told the senate that rankandfile 
federal workers are the ones who can best tell us that there is 
waste fraud mismanagement and abuse and yet they are perhaps 
the least protected of the federal employees 
our bureaucracy has a very peculiar way of rewarding 
whistleblowers said sen charles grassley riowa they are 
harassed they are demoted they are even fired for doing what they 
believe is right 
this bill when it becomes law will help restore the confidence 
of the american people in their government said sen joe 
lieberman dconn 
the whistleblower issue came into the spotlight in 1969 with the 
dismissal of defense department aide a ernest fitzgerald for 
exposing 2 billion in cost overruns in the c5a cargo plane 
program he was reinstated after a 13year court fight 
about 2000 more obscure cases have been handled by the special 
counsels office over the last decade there are indications that 
most federal employees aware of waste fraud and abuse are silent 
because of a fear that blowing the whistle would cost them their 
jobs 
twentyfive percent of federal employees surveyed by the merit 
systems protection board in 1983 said they knew of waste fraud and 
abuse but 70 percent of those said they were unwilling to discuss it 
levins office also said that at most 5 percent of whistleblower 
cases reported to the special counsels office currently make it 
past the initial screening process 
levin cited a remark that often has been attributed to former 
special counsel william oconnor in reply to prospective 
whistleblowers id say that unless youre in a position to 
retire or are independently wealthy dont do it dont put your 
head up because it will get blown off 
federal employee whistleblowers deserve better levin said

a nicaraguan contra leader is shunning stated 
rebel policy by announcing he will return to his homeland and join 
the internal opposition to the sandinista government 
the announcement thursday by alfredo cesar one of seven members 
of the rebel directorate was assailed by contra spokesman bosco 
matamoros who accused cesar of undercutting resistance policies 
exile politics is over said cesar a political moderate who 
has been a member of the directorate since 1987 and once served the 
sandinistas as president of the central bank 
rebel leaders have not been inside nicaragua since their peace 
talks with the sandinistas broke down last june cesar is believed 
to be the first contra leader to announce an intention to return 
permanently to nicaragua since the rebels were formed almost seven 
years ago 
there was no immediate state department reaction to cesars 
disclosure he said however the department officials left the 
impression at a tuesday meeting with the rebels that any decision on 
returning home was theirs to make and no one elses 
cesar 37 told a small gathering of reporters he supports the 
bush administrations view that the contras should be maintained as 
a cohesive but nonbelligerent force until it is clear that the 
sandinistas plan to carry out their promise to hold a fair election 
next february 
if the process goes smoothly cesar said he expects that some of 
the more than 10000 contra fighters stationed in camps in southern 
honduras may return in peace to their homeland by next fall 
if we reach the month of october we may well be into an 
irreversible democratic process in nicaragua cesar said 
he said he tentatively plans to return to nicaragua during the 
second part of may assuming that preliminary discussions between 
the sandinistas and the internal opposition provide strong evidence 
of sandinista intentions to create a genuinely pluralistic system 
matamoros said that the contra position calls for tripartite 
discussions among the sandinistas the internal opposition and the 
contras on the ground rules governing the election process 
by deciding unilaterally to return cesar is undercutting 
resistance policy matamoros said 
the contra leadership has long been plagued by factional strife 
and thursdays statements suggest that will be a continuing problem 
for the rebels 
cesar said he has no intention of seeking the presidency himself 
he said he would recommend that all segments of the opposition rally 
around a single national figure preferably someone who is above 
partisan politics 
as cesar described it conditions for a democratic outcome in 
nicaragua are riper than they have been in years 
he said the emergence of a bipartisan policy toward nicaragua 
under president bush has been a major plus and there is a stronger 
consensus on the issue between the united states and latin america 
than there was under the previous administration 
a common thread in the consensus is the need for the sandinistas 
to adopt westernstyle democracy he said 
cesar added that growing economic deprivation in nicaragua also 
has contributed to sandinista flexibility on political questions 
he expressed confidence that congress will approve a forthcoming 
administration request for additional humanitarian aid for the 
rebels officials have said the figure will be in the 40 million to 
50 million range enough to sustain the rebels until election time 
some democratic lawmakers want to use some of the money to 
reintegrate the contras back into nicaragua over the short term but 
cesar said a majority opinion in congress holds that the money 
should be used solely for food and other humanitarian items

politburo member yegor k ligachev denies reports 
that he opposes the pace and scope of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs reforms and says the soviet leader splendidly fulfills 
his duties 
ligachev peppered with questions about the reputed rift told 
reporters thursday that reports he has deep differences with 
gorbachev are meant to turn the soviet leader against him 
youve said im cast as the leader of moderate forces in the 
soviet union he said at his first moscow news conference some 
people come up with even more outspoken characterizations like the 
leader of conservative forces etc 
well i view those assertions as the indication of a desire to 
pit gorbachev against ligachev and to introduce division in our 
ranks 
ligachev 68 is widely rumored among soviets to be a 
conservative counterweight to gorbachev in their countrys 
leadership last year gorbachev stripped ligachev of the ideology 
portfolio that customarily goes with being the kremlins no 2 
since then soviet officials have said the kremlin has no no 2 
ligachev named chief of the communist partys new commission on 
agriculture in september appeared to confirm that when he told 
reporters i cannot say that i am the head of the leading path or 
direction 
ligachev also indicated he no longer presides over meetings of 
the ruling politburo when gorbachev is away as soviet sources had 
previously reported 
so far mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev splendidly fulfills his 
duties he goes abroad he goes to other regions and he presides 
over other politburo members and we are very satisfied with that 
he said 
ligachev and other highranking party officials met journalists 
at the end of the central committee plenum that decreed major 
changes in agricultural policy to ease and ultimately eliminate 
protracted soviet food shortages 
it was an extraordinarily highpowered news conference by moscow 
standards ligachev vadim a medvedev his successor as party 
ideologue and viktor p nikonov sat together on the stage at the 
foreign ministrys press center 
despite gorbachevs drive for glasnost or greater openness 
the workings of the partys top bodies are still wreathed in 
secrecy the news conference was the first opportunity for 
moscowbased journalists to quiz ligachev 
often joking ligachev fielded questions about the party 
leaderships decision to permit lifetime leasing of farmland and 
other agrarian reforms and about his political views and relations 
with gorbachev 
i can tell you we see eye to eye and on major issues we are 
quite unanimous the whitehaired ligachev said at one point we 
have good comradely relations which are very characteristic of 
relations inside our party 
he acknowledged differences of approach may exist between himself 
and gorbachev but said he discussed them with gorbachev behind 
closed doors and that he always backed decisions of the politburo 
which by tradition are unanimous 
if we do have differing views on practical methods and forms of 
implementing this or that reform we take it up before sessions of 
the politburo and have a wideranging discussion on the issue 
said ligachev elevated to the politburo in april 1985 a month 
after gorbachev became leader

a federal grand jury has indicted a us army 
colonel who supervised military sales to el salvador on charges of 
taking 70000 in bribes and a 4722 watch from the head of an 
armaments company 
col juan lopez de la cruz who stationed at the us embassy in 
san salvador between 1982 and 1984 was named in a sevencount 
indictment charging conspiracy bribery making false statements and 
aiding and abetting the filing of false claims 
the indictment returned thursday by a federal grand jury in 
alexandria va accused lopez of conspiring with dennis j reese 
president of springfield armory inc to defraud the foreign 
military sales program operated by the pentagon 
lopez is accused of soliciting and taking bribes totaling 70000 
from reese in return for helping springfield armory complete the 
sale of 37 million worth of firearms to the salvadoran government 
efforts to reach lopez for comment on the charges were 
unsuccessful 
as an advisor to the salvadoran military group lopez recommended 
to the salvadoran government what types of weapons and supplies to 
purchase from us manufacturers under the program 
after they were introduced in 1983 lopez told reese that he was 
in a position to influence the type of weapons the salvadorans would 
purchase and could help get us certification to complete the 
transactions the indictment said 
reese who pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy and filing 
false statements also bought lopez a 4722 rolex watch at the 
colonels request 
in return for the bribes lopez is accused of signing documents 
falsely stating that commissions were paid on the weapon sales in 
according with regulations of the program 
he is also accused of aiding and abetting reeses filing with the 
government of false claims to be reimbursed 94600 for sales 
commissions that were never actually paid 
according to the indictment lopez and reese arranged for false 
commissions to be paid to two salvadorans they designated as agents 
lopez told reese to make out checks to the salvadorans who 
cashed them and returned the money to reese minus their fee 
if found guilty of all seven counts lopez could be sentenced up 
to 15 years for each of the two bribery charges and five years for 
each of the five remaining counts 
the bribery charges together would carry a fine of 210000 while 
the other charges carry fines of 250000 apiece

bob michael threw back another shot of 
jamesons whiskey wiped the excess from his stubbly chin with the 
back of his hand and gazed at the rest of the illegals crowded 
into the shannon lounge 
michael a 40yearold carpenter from county waterford in the 
republic of ireland was too busy working today to partake in the 
st patricks day festivities a 10minute train ride away in new 
york city 
the irish are workers michael said thats all we want to 
do work and have a few drinks at the end of the day 
but michael is an illegal alien one of the new irish who hit 
us shores every year and never leave even when their visas expire 
the irish government last year reported that high taxes and 17 
percent unemployment had prompted an exodus of as many as 30000 
residents a year 
thats the one reason all the way down the line said the 
rev michael walsh pastor of holy angels church in trenton and a 
native of irelands county clare many parts of ireland have had 
over 20 percent unemployment the irish economy bottomed out 1 
years ago 
the number of illegal irish in the united states is estimated at 
150000 with about half of them living on the east coast 
the irish immigration reform movement an advocacy group for 
undocumented irish estimates that 15000 illegal irish came here 
just last year settling mainly around new york and boston 
most of them are enjoying themselves said pat sloyan 
president of the new jersey chapter of the irish advocacy group 
its not that theyre having a hard time some of them are buying 
new houses and trucks but its the uncertainty of it 
in barroom talk most say they make good wages but add that they 
have to pay their bills in cash and are afraid to return home 
because the trip out of the united states could be one way 
obviously i would love to take a trip home and see the folks 
but theres a fear michael said i got a phone call tonight for 
a 12000 job but do i give up that opportunity for folks and 
family no i dont 
so many of them continue working off the books as domestics 
or in hotels and motels others find jobs in construction and are 
attracted to the northeastern united states because of the 
availability of work for skilled labor 
michael arrived here two years ago quickly found a job and has 
been working since 
down the bar a ruddy 29yearold construction worker said he 
arrived from county carlow three years ago he too found work 
right away and earns 20 an hour 
construction is nothing over there he said of his homeland 
both michael and his countryman say they are hounded daily by a 
fear of discovery 
were not scared of paying our taxes but we live with the fear 
of walking outside and a cop saying lets see your license he 
said 
cardinal john oconnor of new york city ended a pilgrimage across 
ireland last summer by calling for the us government to grant 
amnesty for irish and other illegal aliens in the united states 
william tillman deputy director of the us immigration and 
naturalization services newark office said that compared with the 
roster of illegal immigrants in new jersey the irish are a small 
problem 
of the 31000 people granted immigrant visas in new jersey in 
1987 only 274 were irish he said 
and in boston where the population of illegal irish immigrants 
is estimated at 15000 to 25000 people about 4700 of the 10000 
visas issued since 1986 went to people from ireland 
until march 31 the ins is accepting visa applications for a 
lottery that will distribute 20000 immigrant visas over two years 
to people from 162 countries including ireland

authorities added extra guards and searched 
more than 1600 aliens denied political asylum for weapons following 
a disturbance at a detention center where detainees threw rocks and 
ripped up a fence 
border patrol sector chief silvestre reyes said 70 additional 
border patrol agents were brought in bringing the border patrol 
force to about 130 and 15 to 20 uniformed immigration officers also 
were called to the scene thursday 
were concerned about the possibility that this may reoccur 
reyes said 
ins officials said 1621 detainees were in the outdoor recreation 
area thursday afternoon when about 200 central american immigrants 
demanded their freedom 
they were throwing rocks shaking the fence and some of them 
ripped part of the fence up said omer sewell immigration and 
naturalization service dicstric director 
riot police formed a line 20 feet outside the row of double 
fencing as the detainees chanted in spanish we want freedom 
and the people united will never be defeated 
there was no attempt at any hostages no injuries no leaders 
no demands said mario ortiz ins regional public affairs director 
in dallas they just became agitated we were able to push them 
back and to get them back from the fence 
reyes said nine potential ringleaders were being questioned 
civilian workers were sent out of the port isabel service 
processing center located about 20 miles northeast of the border 
city of brownsville 
i think theyre trying to get the ins attention and i know 
this is about the third time theyve been trying to do this because 
they have more than 2000 people in there said brownsville 
immigration attorney linda yanez 
the detainee population thursday was 2248 including some 
staying in tents because dormitories have filled to capacity 
us rep solomon ortiz whose district includes the center said 
the unrest will continue as more people are detained 
as they increase and the more that they stay in detention the 
more problems they will have ortiz said 
us rep bruce a morrison dconn chairman of the house 
subcommittee on immigration refugees and international law said 
the demonstration was probably a minor incident but could become 
more volatile 
people should be skeptical that merely detaining these people 
is solving the problem morrison said 
detainees awaiting immigrationcourt hearings have complained 
of high deportation bonds set by immigration officials as well as 
lack of food showers and medical attention 
sewell said none of the complaints are justified 
the detention centers population has increased more than 
fivefold since feb 21 when the government began immediate 
detention of politicalasylum applicants whose cases are denied 
the ins since that date also has stepped up enforcement on the 
border and stopped releasing on their own recognizance undocumented 
aliens who are apprehended at the southern tip of the state 
more than 40000 central americans have applied for political 
asylum since last spring in southern texas the closest crossing 
point from central america

president bush says any 
restrictions on rapidfire assault weapons must protect the rights 
of the legitimate sportsman as well as the lives of the nations 
police officers 
this problem isnt a problem just for the federal government 
bush said in a speech thursday 
his remarks reinforced the impression bush has left in recent 
weeks that he is opposed to a total ban on semiautomatic weapons and 
will insist that any curbs are carefully defined 
the assault weapons have become closely identified with drug 
traffickers and the rash of violence and death in some of the 
nations biggest cities 
a member of the national rifle association bush was outspoken 
against tighter gun controls during last years presidential 
campaign 
after a 28hour trip to texas and colorado bush was returning 
today to washington where his wife barbara was awaiting the birth 
of puppies by their springer spaniel millie 
explaining the first ladys absence during a brief stop in his 
adopted home state bush told a houston audience i think her 
priorities may be slightly askew but she doesnt 
in a shift of position the administration announced tuesday it 
was banning at least temporarily imports of five models of 
semiautomatic weapons however the decision did not affect the sale 
of such weapons made in the united states 
i do want to find a solution to the socalled ak47 assault 
weapon problem one that protects the rights of the legitimate 
sportsman but also protects the lives of our police officers who 
are laying their lives on the line for us every single day bush 
said in an address in houston before flying here for another speech 
the audience of upwards of 1000 people applauded his remark 
the nra says the military assault rifles affected by the federal 
import ban are no different intrinsically from semiautomatic arms 
that are used for selfdefense or legitimate sport the nra opposes 
all gun control 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater accompanying bush 
on the overnight trip said the administration welcomed the move by 
colt industries to suspend sales of its ar15 a civilian version of 
the m16 infantry rifle 
he said bush thinks its a reasonable move on their part 
asked if the president wanted other gunmakers to take similar 
steps fitzwater said well leave it where it stands 
after his brief remark on assault weapons bush quickly moved on 
to other subjects prodding congress for fast action on his proposal 
to rescue the savings and loan industry and saying that his 
administration is not bogged down or adrift 
in this kind of work more is going on than meets the eye or 
makes the headlines bush said saying he was trying to lay the 
groundwork for the next century bush said the proof will come 
when we look back from the year 2000 
in a brief question and answer session bush said that profound 
changes are underway both in the soviet union and china 
speaking about reforms championed by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev bush said weve got a challenge facing the united 
states weve got to figure it out weve got to measure soviet 
intentions and then move then come forward with proposals that 
will enhance the peace for our kids and our grandkids 
in remarks in colorado springs bush focused on the theme of 
education and discussed steps he has proposed to improve the 
nations school system 
when it comes to our nations future bush said education 
is the key its the best investment we can make

with a record murder rate and its two top local 
officials under federal investigation the nations capital has had 
its share of unwanted publicity lately now senators have begun 
talking openly about what local politicians fear most the 
possibility that congress will take control of city government 
citing the citys inability to stem drugrelated killings two 
senators suggested thursday that the district of columbias police 
department be replaced with a federally controlled police force 
sen warren rudman rnh blamed the citys crime wave on 
inept local government that doesnt understand what its doing 
we cant have people killed and blood running on the streets 
like some third world capital rudman said adding that if the 
killing continues he would consider taking a look at home rule 
at least the law enforcement aspect 
those remarks supported by sen ernest hollings dsc troubled 
city officials who are worried that home rule the right to 
selfgovernance city residents obtained in 1973 may be more 
vulnerable now than ever before 
if the federal government thinks it can do a better job of 
stopping drugs from coming into the city why cant they do a better 
job of stopping drugs from entering the country asked mayor 
marion barry jr 
city council chairman david clarke said that while the drug 
problem may require additional federal involvement home rule should 
not be violated 
what problems there are in this city will be dealt with by the 
people in 1990 the next scheduled mayoral and council election 
clarke said they ought to let the democratic process run its 
course 
another council member who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
went to what many consider the heart of the citys battles with 
congress 
the problem is barry and they dont have the guts to go after 
him so they hit us on these other issues 
barry currently under federal investigation for his ties to a 
drug suspect has seen his and the citys support in congress 
plummet over the past several years 
last year lawmakers forced the city to abolish or change 
existing laws governing aids insurance the rights of gay groups to 
gather at georgetown university and the citys residency requirement 
for city workers had the city failed to change these laws all or 
part of its 28 billion budget would have been frozen 
to make matters worse del walter fauntroy a civil rights 
colleague of barrys who is washingtons nonvoting representative 
in the house is under federal investigation for his alleged 
involvement in a payroll padding scheme in his capitol hill office 
attorney general dick thornburgh is currently deciding whether to 
appoint a special prosecutor to expand an fbi probe into allegations 
that fauntroy paid the son of a congressional colleague to work in 
washington even though the employee thomas john savage son of 
rep gus savage dill swore on illinois election documents that 
he was living in chicago the entire time he was supposedly working 
for fauntroy 
while the battles with capitol hill and the legal problems of 
fauntroy and barry have preoccupied local leaders the citys 
spiraling crime rate has given the city another pressing problem 
through thursday 112 persons had been killed in the nations 
capital so far in 1989 more than twice the total at the same time 
last year for all of 1988 a record 372 persons were killed in the 
streets of washington 
barry police chief maurice t turner and other city leaders have 
blamed the upsurge in murders on the arrival of crack a highly 
potent and addictive form of cocaine a statistical study of city 
homicides shows that about 60 percent are drugrelated and about 80 
percent of those appear to be assassinations 
the district of columbia received limited selfgovernance from 
congress in 1973 but still must have its annual budget and all 
legislation reviewed and approved by congress 
in addition fauntroy cannot vote on the house floor and the 
district has no representation in the senate district residents can 
only elect a nonvoting house delegate their mayor city council 
and school board members 
under city law congress reserves the right to repeal any local 
law or act including part or all of the charter enacted by congress 
for the city 
thats the clause of the charter most local politicians know best 
and fear most particularly when senators start talking about having 
the federal government intervene in city affairs

major us jewish groups are calling on jews to 
boycott meetings with pope john paul ii because the vatican has 
failed to remove a convent from the site of the nazi death camp at 
auschwitz 
the us section of the world jewish congress which represents 
34 american groups announced thursday that it has adopted a 
resolution that calls for wjc members in 70 countries to refrain 
from meetings with the pope during his frequent travels 
the resolution adopted at a meeting of organization leaders in 
new york will be introduced at the may 7 meeting of the wjcs 
international executive in montreal 
the resolution said the convent controversy is symptomatic of 
a clear pattern by the vatican to revise the history of the 
holocaust and the role of the church during that terrible period 
pope pius xii has been widely criticized for failing to act or speak 
out against the nazis murder of 6 million jews during world war ii

a controversial art exhibit in chicago prompted 
the senate to approve a bill to bar placing the american flag on the 
floor or on the ground 
i dont know much about art but i know desecration when i see 
it senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said after the 
bill he introduced was approved 970 on thursday 
the move was a response to an exhibit by a student at the school 
of the art institute of chicago in which an american flag was 
displayed on the floor in a fashion that resulted in spectators 
standing on it 
doles bill would expand existing law against flag desecration to 
include the words knowingly displayed on the floor or ground

the government made a 3887 million profit on 
timber sales in national forests during fiscal 1988 even though more 
than twothirds of the nations 120 forests lost money on the sales 
the forest service said thursday that 74 national forests lost a 
total of 537 million in the timber sales while the other 46 
forests logged 4422 million in profits 
peter m emerson chief economist and vice president for resource 
planning and economics for the wilderness society said the report 
reinforces the societys view that the forest services timber sales 
program is an environmentally destructive federal boondoggle 
the wilderness society has been urging the forest service for 
several years to halt timber sales in national forests where 
expenses exceed revenue

the rightist arena party has 
managed to bury its dark links to death squads beneath a slick 
public relations campaign that promises peace and prosperity 
whether coffee millionaire alfredo cristiani will face a runoff 
with the secondplace finisher in sundays presidential election 
remains to be seen but few doubt the arena standardbearer will end 
up the next president 
arena has moved to the front of a sevenparty pack with a flashy 
tightly organized campaign that projects a moderate cando image 
and capitalizes on what may be the partys biggest advantage it is 
not the incumbent 
many people will not vote so much for arena as against the 
christian democrats said the rev ignacio martin baro head of 
the public opinion institute at the central american university 
the christian democratic contender fidel chavez mena has been 
hurt by public perception of president jose napoleon duartes 
administration despite five years in power and more than 3 billion 
in us aid living standards deteriorated 
the party is seen as inept and corrupt and has been unable to 
solve the nineyear civil war with the leftist farabundo marti 
national liberation front which has left 70000 dead most of them 
civilians 
the third main contender is guillermo ungo 57 who returned from 
eight years of political exile to lead a coalition of leftist 
parties called the democratic convergence 
when arena known formally as the republican nationalist 
alliance was born in 1981 it was closely identified with the 
interests of the rich and conservative 
but it has broadened its appeal and mastered the art of electoral 
politics 
arena is promising warweary salvadorans the peace and prosperity 
they so desperately want and is doing it with a style and 
organization even skeptics find impressive 
in times of crisis people turn to parties that show a great 
deal of self assurance martin baro said i think arena has been 
successful in selling that kind of image 
cristiani 41 is the moderate face of arena 
the other side is party founder and maximum leader roberto 
daubuisson the charismatic former army major persistently accused 
of sponsoring death squads daubuisson denies the charges 
the two faces of arena are most evident at rallies daubuisson 
who always accompanies cristiani is the one who stirs the crowd 
who lights the spark 
an arena rally is a tightly organized highenergy affair it has 
the intensity of an evangelical tent revival or a high school pep 
rally infused with conservative political fervor 
amid the bunting bands and pompom girls muscular young toughs 
raise clenched fists their voices rising to this refrain from the 
party song 
el salvador will be the tomb where the reds meet their end 
arena has deftly applied the flashy gimmicks of successful us 
campaigns in a country where half the people cannot read and 40 
percent are out of work radio and television are the staples 
there are catchy party jingles there are buttons balloons and 
funny hats there are tshirts and pompom girls party pencils and 
miles of red white and blue bunting 
candidates and party workers appear in public like a winning ball 
club wearing sporty windbreakers and duckbilled party caps 
arena is going to win because people have confidence in it 
construction worker genaro herrera predicted during a rally 
arena is promising jobs houses hospitals and schools through 
what it calls capitalism for the masses it wants to reduce the 
governments role in the economy 
we may be conservative but we are the only party that has 
defined the social problems of the country and offers a solution 
cristiani maintained in a recent interview 
he said he will give the leftist rebels a choice join the 
political process or face an efficient professional use of the 
armed forces 
some fear an arena victory could mean more violence and deeper 
polarization others are more optimistic 
i think that as long as arena can obtain their goals 
peacefully they will not resort to violence martin baro said 
i think they would be much more dangerous at present in the 
opposition losing the election

journalist terry anderson in his fifth year as a prisoner of the 
politics he once reported is tired of being caged like an 
animal his sister said 
enough is enough this cannot continue peggy say said

congress andersons colleagues and relatives of the hostages in 
beirut lebanon

the hostages and a statement from president bush expressing his 
sympathy

all forms of hostage taking for whatever purposes by individuals 
groups or governments

act which serves no cause 
the president certainly is concerned about the hostages said 
marlin fitzwater bushs spokesman who was in houston with the 
president 
the administration pledged to continue working for the release of 
anderson but officials repeated their policy of not cutting deals 
with the group believed to be holding the hostages 
marking these anniversaries is difficult for the families 
but they serve to remind all americans that their countrymen are 
held in lebanon fitzwater said 
in lorain ohio andersons boyhood home about 500 people wore 
yellow ribbons heard music written in andersons honor and sent 
aloft hundreds of balloons to symbolize their hope that anderson 
will be freed soon 
about 200 children from irving middle school released the 
balloons as jack lavriha chairman of the free terry anderson 
committee played a tape recording of we want you home again

listen to our plea and send him home 
in cadiz ky an estimated 75 people attended a service at mrs 
says church she moved there from batavia ny where her brother 
also grew up 
as long as one citizen is held hostage our nation is held 
hostage said the rev harold skaggs paster of cadiz baptist 
church all freedom is diminished when one is held hostage 
skaggs asked participants to keep wearing the yellow ribbons they 
were given and to burn candles in their windows at home to express 
hope that the hostages would be freed 
in belleview fla andersons brother john anderson organized 
a candlelight vigil we want to raise public awareness so that 
people know they can use their voice and let government know what 
they want anderson said 
andersons cousin rusty ruth organized a vigil in san jose 
calif that about 100 people attended 
i cry a lot she said i dont cry publicly but i do cry a 
lot i wonder why we have such a hard time communicating with our 
government 
at the washington ceremony fellow journalists joined in the 
demand for andersons release 
our hearts cry out in protest over andersons plight said 
louis d boccardi president of the ap 
its time for those holding terry anderson to release him and 
to end the unconscionable suffering of an innocent man each of us 
in our own special way should mark this day with contemplation and 
prayer for terrys release boccardi said in a statement sent to 
the aps staff 
the committee to protect journalists a new yorkbased group 
called on bush to use every means at his disposal to bring terry 
anderson home 
colleagues who knew and worked with anderson talked of his 
dedication to his job his desire to tell the story of the wartorn 
nation and his willingness to take risks 
he has paid an awful price these last four years said david 
ignatius an associate editor of the washington post 
the rev lawrence martin jenco a former hostage held for a time 
with anderson said that before his own release on july 26 1986 he 
promised the journalist that i would never forget him that others

a doctor used pioneering laser surgery to 
remove an orangesized tumor that disfigured the face of a british 
toddler almost covering her left eye 
shes dressed up like an egyptian mummy said brian watling 
who sat by his daughter faye after the operation thursday at 
stanford university hospital but the growth is gone theres no 
growth there anymore 
faye who turns 2 on march 24 had one of the most severe 
cases of the growth called a hemangioma that physicians had seen 
said dr david apfelberg who used a laser to cut away the bulk of 
the tumor 
she was in stable condition thursday evening wrapped in a 
bandage covering her face 
apfelberg could not be reached for comment at the hospital early 
today 
the toddler will return to england within two weeks but will 
have to come back to the united states for reconstructive surgery on 
her face watling said 
i dont think she understands too well watling said all 
she knows is that any time someone in white comes near her it 
hurts 
the tumor began as a small birthmark on fayes left cheek and 
grew so large so fast that watling and the childs mother jayne 
feared they would wake her in the morning and find the deformity 
covering her entire face 
the watlings said doctors in the skelmersdale england area 
where they live said surgery would have to wait until faye turned 7 
a delay that put faye in danger of losing the sight in her left eye 
when the family learned the unusual surgery was being performed 
in similar cases with children at the famed palo alto medical 
clinic they found hope for their daughter 
a series of heartwarming albeit wacky fundraising stunts on 
fayes behalf provided the 425000 needed for the operation 
british sailors in the atlantic chipped in women shaved their 
heads in exchange for donations and inmates in a local prison played 
24hour badminton games 
if people hadnt been so generous said watling there was 
no possibility of us coming here 
about one in every 500 to 800 children have some form of 
birthmark apfelberg said although 90 percent of the birthmarks 
disappear by the age of 6 to 8 the cause is unknown he said 
although it probably occurs during the first three months of 
pregancy when a fetus develops its facial features

the majority of accidental poisoning deaths in the 
united states do not involve children eating drain cleaner or floor 
wax those dying are older people young adults for the most part 
and the cause of death is drugs 
the national centers for disease control said thursday that 5740 
unintentional poisoning deaths were reported in 1986 the latest 
year for which statistics are available a jump of more than 1000 
from the 4331 reported in 1980 
the cdc said the trend is apparently due to an increase in the 
rate of deaths from drug poisoning 
while 2492 or 58 percent of 1980s 4331 accidental poisoning 
deaths were because of drugs by 1986 that figure had jumped to 73 
percent or 4187 out of 5740 
over the same period other poisoning deaths went down the 
number of accidental poisoning deaths from nondrug solids and 
liquids fell from 597 to 544 and fatal accidental gas poisonings 
fell from 1242 to 1009 
the types of drugs most commonly involved in poisoning deaths are 
opiates such as heroin and related narcotics accounting for 930 
accidental deaths in 1986 and cocaine and similar drugs which 
accounted for 624 
this places in perspective the role of unintentional drug 
poisonings relative to other types of poisonings said dr daniel 
pollock a researcher with the cdc 
unintentional poisoning deaths affect males more than twice as 
often as females 4105 to 1605 in 1986 with the highest rates 
in the 2039 age group 
while antidrug programs remain appropriate for groups of young 
people the recent increase in unintentional drug poisoning deaths 
among young adults underscores the need for drug education and 
treatment programs that focus on illicit drug users who are 
2039 the cdc said 
people may not think of drugs when they think of poisoning 
pollock said poison control efforts traditionally have focused on 
childhood poisonings particularly children under 5 the need for 
safe packaging the need for safe placement of dangerous items 
thats still extremely important 
but what the mortality data indicate is that poison deaths 
among children have decreased while deaths among young adults have 
increased 
for example in 1986 93 children under 5 were killed in the 
united states by unintentional poisonings the cdc said that was 
down from 105 in 1980 but among people 2029 the number rose from 
1222 in 1980 to 1381 in 1986

the number of drugrelated aids cases reported in 
the united states nearly doubled last year according to federal 
health officials 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
10747 or 333 percent of the 32311 aids cases reported in the 
united states and its territories in 1988 were drugrelated 
occurring among intravenous drug users their sex partners or 
children born to women in either of those groups 
thats up from 269 percent a year earlier when drugrelated 
cases accounted for 5747 of the 21356 us aids cases reported 
said dr james buehler a cdc aids specialist 
the atlantabased cdc noted that aids reporting including the 
drugrelated cases surged after mid1987 when the agency adopted 
a new definition for aids which counts more cases in their early 
stages 
that statistical adjustment is probably responsible for some of 
the increase but there apparently was also an actual increase in 
drugrelated cases buehler said 
the number of drugrelated cases increased 87 percent from 1987 
to 1988 while the total number of aids cases increased by 513 
percent both increases reflect in part the new definition and 
reporting standards 
the rate of drugrelated aids cases continues to be higher for 
blacks and hispanics than for whites the cdc said in its weekly 
report and although rates varied widely by area 55 percent of 
the nations drugrelated aids cases last year occurred in the 
northeast new england and the middle atlantic states where only 
20 percent of the us population lives 
drugrelated aids cases made up 16 percent of all cases in 
whites 52 percent in blacks and 56 percent in hispanics the cdc 
said for all three of those racialethnic groups the drugrelated 
aids rate was highest in the northeast 
overall homosexual and bisexual males continue to make up the 
largest group of aids victims in the united states through feb 20 
a total of 87188 cases had been reported including 52758 among 
gay or bisexual men 17226 among intravenous drug abusers and 
another 6140 among gay males who were also intravenous drug abusers

the secret will be safe with restaurant 
owners who have stocked up on corned beef and cabbage for st 
patricks day today the dish isnt very irish at all 
louise gunning a native of dublin who works in the registrars 
office at trinity college said shes mystified by the fixation on 
corned beef 
ive been here two years and when i came here i was very 
surprised on st patricks day seeing all the places selling corned 
beef and cabbage she said what i would regard as the national 
dish is irish stew or bacon and cabbage 
kathleen mcgrory president of hartford college for women and a 
specialist in irish studies suggested that a shrewd 
irishamerican in a country that eats a lot of beef concocted the 
corned beef tradition 
both my parents were from ireland and they told us when we 
were very young if we wished to be authentic we would have boiled 
ham and cabbage on st patricks day 
mcgrory said she has generally honored that advice but couldnt 
resist the 99cent special of corned beef cabbage and green beer in 
a vermont pub last year

the ancient egyptian pharaoh ramses ii was 
neither black nor white says egypts cultural emissary to the 
united states who is wondering how his country even got involved in 
an american dispute over the question 
ramses ii was strictly egyptian said abdellatif aboulela who 
made the declaration on thursday while bemoaning the need to do so 
i wish people would not involve us in this kind of mess which 
we have nothing to do with said aboulela the director of 
cultural office at egypts embassy 
he was responding to complaints by black activists in dallas who 
are demanding a greater emphasis on the pharaohs african roots in a 
ramses the great exhibit on display at the texas state 
fairgrounds 
this perplexes aboulela who frankly wants no part of us 
racial disputes 
they should not use us involve us in this racial problem 
that i thought was solved and buried a long time ago the egyptian 
official said we are not in any way related to the original black 
africans of the deep south 
ramses ii who ruled ancient egypt for 68 years in the 12th 
century bc was neither black nor white but egyptian he said 
egypt of course is a country in africa but this doesnt mean it 
belongs to africa at large this is an egyptian heritage not an 
african heritage 
his comments came after a group called the blacology speaking 
committee maintained at a dallas news conference wednesday that 
ramses ii was black and threatened a boycott of the exhibit unless 
organizers change their portrayal of the ancient ruler they also 
want more black involvement in the fairgrounds operation 
we are tired of people using our culture and history to make 
money off us said dallas jackson a cofounder of the group 
city councilman al lipscomb said more blacks should be involved 
in decisionmaking at the fairgrounds as well as running concessions 
there 
what were saying is that the state fairgrounds are in the womb 
of the ghetto in the heart of south dallas and it the exhibit is 
making megamillions of dollars lipscomb said were saying 
leave something behind other than being a vacuum cleaner and sucking 
it all up 
lipscomb said its not as though were dealing with something 
from scandinavia or ireland were dealing with something from 
africa 
aboulela doesnt quite see it that way and offers two analogies 
although the united states constitution has its roots in 
england it isnt english and although the statue of liberty was 
made in france it isnt french he said 
this is an egyptian heritage and an egyptian civilization 100 
percent we are part of the african continent we cannot say by any 
means we are black or white we are egyptian with our culture and 
traditions and religions he said 
it is really amazing to claim something like that he said 
it is just baseless 
the ramses exhibit of art and artifacts sponsored by the dallas 
museum of natural history association is expected to draw more than 
700000 visitors before it closes aug 27

communist rebels have seized 
thousands of acres of land and are distributing them to poor farmers 
in what the military says is a bid to discredit the governments 
fledgling land reform program 
defense secretary fidel ramos told the cabinet in december that 
the new peoples army had seized 76500 acres nationwide and was 
distributing them to landless farmers 
ramos described the rebel program as a critical problem aimed 
at making the land reform program of president corazon aquino look 
bad 
the program enacted by congress last july calls for buying land 
from owners and redistributing them over 10 years to about 2 million 
landless farmers at a cost of 73 billion 
officials say the aquino government has already redistributed 
about 326000 acres 
frank fernandez local chairman of the rebel national democratic 
front claimed the guerrillas had distributed nearly 30000 acres in 
this negros island town the past five years 
fernandez also claimed rebels had seized and distributed about 
111150 acres throughout the central visayas islands which includes 
negros 
land reform is widely seen as vital to curbing the largely rural 
communist insurgency now in its 21st year nowhere is the need so 
acute as on this sugar canegrowing island where twothirds of the 
3 million people live in the countryside often in abject poverty 
under the government program sugar cane lands will be among the 
last to be redistributed 
sol altatierra regional spokesman for the communist party of the 
philippines said guerrillas take over abandoned tracts or drive off 
landlords with the help of the national peasants movement a marxist 
farmers organization and one of 12 groups in the 
communistdominated national democratic front 
we are determined to develop and modernize agriculture in the 
rural areas bu putting up cooperatives and creating communal and 
state farms which is the essence of the socialist revolution in the 
countryside altatierra said 
those receiving lands include families of guerrillas killed in 
battle and members of the movement recipients of prime farmland 
mostly irrigated rice fields receive up to five acres 
farmers who select hilly tracts get about 12 acres those willing 
to farm terraced limestone hills suitable for growing coffee 
receive up to 25 acres 
in return farmers must pay five to 10 percent of their net 
annual income to the rebels fernandez said rebels reserve the right 
to take back the land presumably if the recipients failed to 
cooperate 
on wednesday fernandez distributed titles to 216 farmers 
during a festive ceremony attended by about 1000 people at a 
government school near this coastal town about 350 miles southeast 
of manila 
residents said graduation exercises had to be postponed because 
of the rebel ceremony held three miles from a military outpost 
armed guerrillas stood guard as the crowd watched skits depicting 
rebels saving farmers from rapacious landlords the program ended 
with the singing of the internationale the communist anthem 
your aspiration to own a piece of land is no longer a dream but 
a reality fernandez told the celebrants and your rightful 
ownership will be made official by the national democratic front 
acting on behalf of the peoples revolutionary government by 
distributing land title certificates 
finance secretary vicente jayme says the rebel program is bound 
to fail because insurgents cannot provide credit marketing help or 
other expertise ramos has warned that titles bestowed by the rebels 
are invalid 
but a 49yearold farmer named rubio laurente said he was proud 
to receive a rebel title for lands he had already worked for 22 
years 
we have sacrificed for so long and yet the government has not 
given us any land said another recipient santiago diego 41 
now land has been given to me free and i am very happy that the 
land is mine

breathing the cigarette smoke of others may triple 
a womans likelihood of developing cervical cancer roughly the 
same increase in risk that smoking itself seems to create according 
to a new study 
but the finding should be interpreted cautiously because the 
study may have overestimated the risks of both types of exposure to 
cigarette smoke according to an independent researcher 
cervical cancer will strike more than 13000 us women this year 
and kill 6000 of them according to the american cancer society 
the most important cause of cervical cancer is believed to be 
sexually transmitted virus called papillomavirus but higher rates 
of cervical cancer among smokers has led researchers to suspect that 
cigarettes may play a role 
research has shown that substances in cigarette smoke can be 
carried through the blood to distant tissues and organs and these 
substances have been detected in the neck of the uterus the 
researchers said 
the study is the first to explore the possible role of passive 
smoking apart from active smoking in the development of cervical 
cancer a malignancy of the neck of the uterus the researchers said 
overall women in the study who smoked had a 342 times greater 
likelihood of developing cervical cancer than those who didnt 
according to findings published in todays journal of the american 
medical association 
the amount the women smoked made little difference in their risk 
said the researchers led by martha l slattery an assistant 
professor of family and preventive medicine at the university of 
utah school of medicine at salt lake city 
passive smokers nonsmoking women who breathed the smoke from 
others cigarettes for at least three hours a day had a 343 
greater likelihood of developing cervical cancer than other 
nonsmokers the study found 
considered together smokers and nonsmokers who breathed other 
peoples smoke had a 296 greater likelihood of developing cervical 
cancer than smokers and nonsmokers who didnt breathe other 
peoples smoke the study found 
passive smoking had its greatest effect on women who were 
nonsmokers ms slattery said in a telephone interview thursday 
findings were based on data collected on 270 urban women with 
cervical cancer in four utah counties between 1984 and 1987 and a 
control group of similar women were chosen randomly to serve as 
a comparison group 
the researchers said utah is a good place for such a study 
because of the large number of mormon women whose religion forbids 
them to smoke making them good subjects for collecting data on the 
effects of passive smoking alone 
all findings were statistically adjusted to correct for 
differences in cervical cancer risk associated with differences in 
age number of sexual partners and other factors the researchers 
said 
because this is the first study that has really looked at 
passive smoking and cervical cancer the results should be 
interpreted cautiously ms slattery acknowledged they do need 
to be replicated by other studies 
an editorial accompanying the study said a causeandeffect 
relationship between smoking and cervical cancer remains to be 
shown and the similar risks found for active and passive smoking 
seem surprising 
the editorial by dr peter m layde of marshfield medical 
research foundation in marshfield wis said the study also 
probably overestimated both types of risks

attorneys for singer james brown say 
efforts from coast to coast to win early release from prison for the 
godfather of soul could hurt him at a probation hearing 
any kind of publicity hurts mr brown with regard to his 
criminal trouble defense attorney billy weeks said it might 
help his record albums but it hurts him in court it puts pressure 
on the judge to be a little bit harsher 
the 55yearold brown who is serving a sixyear prison sentence 
for trying to run over two police officers during a twostate chase 
last fall was scheduled to appear at a probation revocation hearing 
today in state court in aiken 
corrections officials requested the hearing after the beech 
island resident allegedly tested positive for marijuana and pcp in 
december brown was put on probation after his conviction last july 
for resisting arrest and carrying a pistol random drug testing is 
one probation provision 
he has been incarcerated at the state park correctional institute 
near columbia since dec 29 after his conviction stemming from an 
unrelated wild car chase with authorities from south carolina and 
georgia on sept 24 
jesse jackson has urged compassion for brown new york activist 
al sharpton vows nationwide rallies on may 3 browns 56th birthday 
to draw attention to the soul singers plight and a record by a 
los angeles songwriterproducer team proclaims free james brown 
the man has too much soul 
the freebrown fight even went galactic this week after nasas 
mission control in houston awakened the space shuttle discoverys 
five astronauts with shouts of i feel good from browns smash 
1960s hit i got you i feel good 
in a strange way i think the fact that james brown is now in 
outer space simply heightens the case to a global awareness 
jackson said in a telephone interview jackson appeared before the 
state parole board on browns behalf on march 8 
the campaign however has not persuaded south carolina 
corrections officials to move up browns parole eligibility date 
from may 12 1991 
brown who works as a kitchen aide at the state prison and sings 
with the choir in his spare time did not respond to a letter from 
the associated press requesting an interview 
despite his legal problems browns career is hardly faltering 
an album he recorded in december with aretha franklin is to be 
released soon and cinemax is broadcasting browns november concert 
tour in italy 
browns album im real released in august also is selling 
well said johnny musso president of scotti brothers browns santa 
monica calif record label 
we dont think this browns conviction has hurt him at all

israeli foreign minister moshe arens said his 
country was willing to consider talking peace with authentic 
interlocutors from the west bank and gaza strip even if they turn 
out to be palestine liberation organization sympathizers 
arens a member of prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc told the conference of presidents of major american 
jewish organizations thursday that israel would spare no effort to 
identify interlocutors amongst the palestinian population in the 
occupied territories 
and it may very well be that such authentic interlocutors some 
of them may end up being sympathizers of the plo he said but 
there is a world of difference between somebody who has a 
constituency somebody who has to respond to that constituency on 
the ground or somebody who gets his orders from tunis and knows 
hes going to get a bullet in the head if he doesnt follow his 
orders 
arens statement was considered a significant departure from the 
likud line which has been to rule out talks with anyone connected 
in any way to the plo 
however yossi ahimeir a spokesman for shamir in jerusalem told 
the associated press that that position had not changed 
we will never talk to people who are affiliated who are 
connected with the plo sympathizers is a vague term there are even 
many plo sympathizers among israelis ahimeir said 
arens said that once the government found palestinian 
representatives that we can talk to we will try to protect them 
from threats from terrorism 
we will try to create a situation where their lives will not be 
in danger its going to take courage on their part as well thats 
part of their contribution 
arens who met with president bush and other officials in 
washington earlier this week also strongly denounced the plo and 
its leader yasser arafat and chastised members of the israeli 
parliament for going abroad to mobilize support for direct talks 
with the organization 
his meetings were preceded this weekend by a conference at 
columbia university where palestinians including members of the 
plo met with israelis including knesset members to encourage 
dialogue 
im not helped by the appearance of israeli members of the 
knesset here in new york with plo he said dont take that 
argument abroad dont try to circumvent the decision of israels 
electorate by going to new york or stockholm by trying to put 
pressure on israels government via other governments

a us soldier was being held on 
espionage charges today after he allegedly supplied east germany 
with secret us plans for defending against a communist invasion 
the army said 
the army said east german officials told us military 
authorities that spec 4 michael a peri had contacted them during 
the soldiers mysterious 11day disappearance 
peri vanished on feb 21 from his unit near the east german 
border taking with him a portable computer that belonged to the 
unit peri who worked as an electronics warfare specialist turned 
himself in 11 days later 
on thursday the army said that the 21yearold soldier from 
laguna niguel california had been charged with espionage 
peri who was in confinement in mannheim west germany already 
had been charged with being absent without leave and other offenses 
no date has been set for his trial 
lt col jake dye spokesman for the us army 5th corps said 
peri was considered a pretty decent soldier 
this surprised a lot of people he said 
dye said peri gave the east germans information on the units 
general defense plan but he did not elaborate 
peri was assigned to the 11th armored cavalry regiment which 
provides a frontline defense for west germanys border with east 
germany the unit based in fulda about 65 miles northeast of 
frankfurt includes tanks armored personnel carriers and armed 
troops 
peri operated equipment that detects enemy radar and other 
signals he has been stationed in west germany since march 1988 
nato forces are stationed in the area to defend the west german 
border against any attack by soviet bloc armies 
in a statement the 5th corps said peri has been charged with 
espionage communicating documents andor information relating to 
national defense to the german democratic republic 
he was further charged with unlawfully having classified 
information in his possession removing classified documents from a 
classified document storage area moving classified documents to the 
gdr and transfer of classified information to unauthorized 
persons it said 
the statement provided no further details about the information 
peri allegedly handed over to the east germans and made no mention 
of any money changing hands or his possible motive it said no date 
had been set for his trial 
maj samuel taylor another 5th corps spokesman said the 
evidence we have that he crossed the border was given to us by the 
gdr east german ministry of foreign affairs 
we were told by the east german ministry that peri made 
contact with them taylor said he did not elaborate 
a source at the pentagon in washington said peri also may have 
gone to austria while he was missing 
we now believe he left east germany went to austria and then 
back into west germany to his unit we know he once lived in austria 
before he joined the army but we really dont know exactly whats 
going on here the source said speaking on condition of anonymity 
dye said he did not know exactly where peri went inside east 
germany or how he crossed the heavily guarded border 
some news media reports had speculated that he defected because a 
military vehicle he signed out was found feb 23 near the town of 
obersuhl a remote rural area northeast of fulda and near the east 
german border

the state supreme court has refused to stop 
the enforcement of local bans on semiautomatic assault rifles in 
several california communities including stockton where a gunman 
opened fire and killed five children 
the court on thursday also transferred several lawsuits paid for 
by the national rifle association to the 1st district court of 
appeal in san francisco 
the lawsuits contend that state law on gun registration and 
licensing was intended to forbid local measures restricting gun 
ownership 
police and guncontrol groups have long been pushing for bans on 
semiautomatic rifles particularly in cities like los angeles where 
they are widely used by street gangs 
support for local and statewide restrictions gained momentum 
after patrick purdy entered a stockton elementary schoolyard on jan 
17 and with rapidfire shots from a semiautomatic ak47 rifle 
killed five children and wounded 29 other pupils and a teacher 
before taking his own life 
since then the cities of los angeles berkeley stockton and the 
county of santa clara have passed ordinances banning sale and 
possession of the militarystyle weapons it was enforcement of 
those laws the state high court refused to block 
besides the four ordinances that were challenged in court local 
bans have been passed by the cities of gardena compton and carson 
and are being considered elsewhere 
the local ordinances in general forbid sale and possession of 
assault weapons 
the state legislature has voted curbs on the sale and possession 
of the weapons as of next jan 1 
colt industries inc of hartford conn on wednesday said it was 
suspending sales to the public of its ar15 the company said the 
suspension was a voluntary reaction to the bush administrations 
temporary import ban on semiautomatics

authorities today blamed an underground group of 
jewish militants for arson attacks on the homes of a journalist and 
a relative of a leftwing legislator 
both the columnist and the lawmaker have angered jewish militants 
because they talked to supporters of the palestine liberation 
organization 
no one was reported injured in the thursday night attacks which 
occurred at the same apartment building in jerusalem 
police said a jewish underground group that claimed 
responsibility for two similar arson attacks last month was 
responsible for the latest incidents 
an arsonist set fire to the jerusalem apartment doors of dan 
margalit a columnist for the haaretz newspaper and a television 
show host 
at about the same time an arsonist started a fire against a door 
at the residence of omer shiloni nephew of knesset member yair 
tsaban 
it appeared the arsonist may have mistaken the apartment for that 
of tsabans son dror who also lives in the building the lawmaker 
stays there when he is in the city 
an anonymous telephone caller contacted the masscirculation 
newspaper yediot ahronot and said the attacks were politically 
motivated 
he said his group which he did not identify targeted the 
apartments of dan margalit and yair tsaban their names should be 
erased from the face of the earth because margalit invited faisal 
husseini to appear on television and tsaban met with the plo 
overseas 
tsaban whose leftwing mapam party calls for talks with the plo 
has participated in several international conferences alongside plo 
officials margalit had husseini a proplo leader in the occupied 
territories on his tv show several weeks ago 
police attributed the attacks to an underground group called the 
sicarites after a jewish movement that operated in roman times the 
ancient sicarites named themselves after sica daggers that they 
carried to murder jews who collaborated with rome

dictatorship of gen francisco franco has died he was 92 
a statement by doctors at guipuzcoa hospital in this basque 
provincial capital said leizaola died at 1130 pm thursday an 
hour after he was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment 
following a heart attack

that existed from 1931 to 1939 the spanish civil war broke out in 
1936 and francos nationalist troops were victorious in 1939

an ambulance crew received three 
calls asking for emergency service for a heart attack victim and 
went back to sleep after each call according to a hospital 
executive the victim died 
clarence cowden 77 was dead when he arrived at the hospital 
about an hour after his wife first called emergency services 
dallasfort worth medical center vice president pat gouldy said 
thursday 
both paramedics who were not identified were fired after an 
investigation of the feb 8 incident gouldy told the grand prairie 
ambulance advisory board 
board members appeared to be stunned as they listened to the 
report at an emotional meeting attended by cowdens two children 
cowdens son marvin said his family was not seeking to punish 
anyone but something has got to be done to make sure these people 
are on the ball 
gouldy said a 911 dispatcher received a call from cowdens wife 
thelma at 314 am the dispatcher called the ambulance crew driver 
a minute later at a substation 1 miles from cowdens home in the 
dallas suburb 
the dispatcher made two more calls when the crew did not announce 
its departure on the radio both times a crew member answered the 
telephone but the ambulance did not move gouldy said 
at 330 am gouldy said an ambulance from another station was 
dispatched it arrived at the cowden home at 335 am 21 minutes 
after the first call he said 
the driver did not recall taking the calls or hearing the 
telephone ring gouldy said 
we assume he the ambulance driver took the calls and fell 
back asleep gouldy said 
officials said an investigation has not established whether 
cowden would have been saved if the ambulance arrived earlier 
i find it absolutely appalling that you have let ambulance 
service in grand prairie exist for six years with nothing more than 
a telephone bell said lida woodul the victims daughter it 
just frightens me to death that this has been allowed to exist 
since the incident gouldy said the ambulance service has 
installed alarm bells in each station and has ordered pagers to be 
issued to crew members

a strong earthquake rattled the southern 
tip of this aegean sea island today but caused no damage or 
injuries authorities said 
the quake which measured 54 on the richter scale occurred this 
morning about 240 miles southeast of athens according to the athens 
seismological institute 
some people felt the earth shake a bit but no one was 
worried said a local police spokesman 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater 
a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated 
areas and a quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in populated 
areas

the internal revenue service which has never 
been bigger or busier has its hands full of problems just one month 
before the deadline for filing individual tax returns 
the 110000employee agency expects to receive a record 109 
million returns this year and insists it is fully prepared to 
process them and issue refunds on time 
overall the filing season is going smoothly michael j 
murphy the acting irs commissioner told the house ways and means 
oversight subcommittee on thursday 
but murphy who has been acting in the top job only two weeks 
and other senior irs officials are putting in long hours dealing 
with some major problems they include 
explaining why the 5000 employees who are trained to answer 
taxpayers telephoned questions are giving the wrong answer at least 
30 percent of the time in some areas the accuracy rate is barely 
50 percent calling the irs for tax advice is a real crap shoot 
complains rep jj pickle dtexas chairman of the house panel 
our accuracy rate is unacceptable murphy said we will not 
be satisfied until we see substantial improvement 
assertions that some irs taxreturn examiners were led to 
believe they should keep quiet when they find taxpayers neglected to 
subtract taxes withheld when they completed their returns we were 
actually stealing from the taxpayers said one employee who added 
that in most such cases the taxpayers often retirees lost 
between 100 and 1000 each 
murphy testifying before the subcommittee seemed to acknowledge 
such a policy existed and was amended last december he ordered an 
investigation 
the irs which collects about 1 trillion a year is strapped 
for cash of its own the washington post reported things are so 
tight because of budget cuts that in some offices pens have been 
rationed and employee training has been reduced the irs budget for 
this year was cut by 100 million and the agency then had to cut 
other programs to finance a mandated employee pay raise 
we have a management problem trying to conserve resources 
murphy said we are looking for about 50 million to continue 
operating at present levels for the next six months 
he vowed however that the tightening will not force reductions 
in taxpayer services processing of returns or law enforcement 
the agency still has trouble getting tax forms and publications 
to taxpayers the general accounting office visited 35 irs offices 
in 10 states to check on 79 documents each office was supposed 
stock no office had all 79 15 officers were missing 10 or more 
forms 
the irs sampled 32000 mail orders for forms and found 96 percent 
were processed correctly 
although nationwide the irs is 22 percent ahead of last years 
pace in processing tax returns two of the 10 service centers 
brookhaven ny and kansas city are 114 percent and 102 
percent respectively behind schedule brookhaven processes returns 
from new jersey new york city and nassau rockland suffolk and 
westchester counties in new york kansas city from parts of the 
midwest 
the irs says these are temporary conditions that do not portend 
major problems 
but in all the bad news plaguing the irs lately there is one 
bright spot the gao says taxpayers and the irs are making fewer 
errors completing and processing returns this year errors were made 
on 158 percent of returns compared with 18 percent last year and 
about six of every 10 were made by the taxpayer 
irs analysis indicates that taxpayers are making many of the 
same types of errors as last year even though irs attempted to 
avoid some of those errors by changing the related forms or 
instructions gao told the house panel 
the most frequent errors taking the wrong standard deduction 
erroneously computing or claiming the earnedincome credit and 
figuring a refund wrong

discoverys astronauts packed today 
for the end of their 19 millionmile voyage and prepared the 
shuttle for a fiery plunge toward a dawn landing saturday on a 
california desert 
discovery commander michael l coats and pilot john e blaha 
planned to run through a series of tests today to make sure the 
shuttles computers and control jets were ready for the return to 
earth 
the other astronauts made final runs on a group of experiments 
and followed a script to shoot the last 4000 feet of film in a 
powerful 70mm imax camera used principally to study the earths 
environmental trouble spots then they were to stow their equipment 
for the trip home 
all of the crewmen stopped their work for an interview arranged 
with the today show on nbc but then found they had to wait more 
than three minutes while the network completed a feature on texas 
dove hunting and ran four commercials 
asked about environmental damage viewed from space james f 
buchli said the scale and scope of air pollution is much more 
dramatic as seen from orbit 
what were trying to do is get some evidence and documentation 
to bring back and show people just how much we are dumping into the 
atmosphere and perhaps get a feel how that might affect us in future 
generations the astronaut said you can see it very very 
well from here 
coats said that early in the mission when an electrical problem 
forced the astronauts to reduce power usage it wasnt really a 
great deal to us 
we powered down a lot of our computer displays we powered down 
our lighting as much as possible he said it was a little bit 
of an inconvenience but not a real impact on our work 
discoverys early bird crew preempted the traditional morning 
music from mission control in houston for a third day in a row 
a few minutes before they were to be awakened the astronauts 
beamed to earth a tape of hi ho hi ho its off to work we go 
the work song of the seven dwarfs in the animated movie classic 
snow white 
mission control capsule communicator david low referring to the 
seven dwarfs responded we can account for grumpy sleepy happy 
sneezy and doc up there who wants to sign up to be bashful and 
dopey 
im not gonna touch that said coats with a laugh 
the other discovery astronauts are james f buchli robert c 
springer and dr james m bagian a physician 
early on saturday coats and blaha will fire two powerful rockets 
on the back of discovery to slow the craft and allow it to drop into 
the earths atmosphere the shuttle will then make a powerless glide 
halfway around the world and land at 636 am pst at edwards air 
force base calif in the mojave desert 
the landing will complete a flight of four days 23 hours and 38 
minutes that circled the earth 79 times 
if the shuttle lands at the time now scheduled the mission will 
have been about 1 hours shorter than planned discovery was 
launched almost two hours late on monday because of weather 
considerations and this put the craft in position to land in 
california one orbit early 
nasa officials said the forecasts call for good weather at 
edwards for the shuttle landing 
discovery will return to earth with almost three miles of film 
shot with the imax camera the crew captured views of urban sprawl 
of pollution patterns in the oceans and of vast areas in south 
america where the tropical rain forest is being cleared and burned 
the camera also photographed floods in africa burned areas of 
the florida everglades and western united states and erupting 
volcanoes in south america and southeast asia 
film from the imax will be edited to create a study of the 
environmental wounds inflicted on the earth by industrial man it is 
a joint probject of nasa and the smithsonian institution 
the end of discoverys mission also will be the end for four rats 
carried in cages aboard the shuttle the rats will be killed so 
their skeletons can be studied in an experiment on how 
weightlessness affects the healing of injured bones before launch 
small chips were cut from one bone on each rat 
other experiments on discovery include comparing the development 
of chicken embryos in space vs those on earth a group of plants 
grown in space to test the effects of weightlessness on root growth 
a protein crystal growth study using 19 different proteins and a 
device called the heat pipe which is a type of cooling system being 
tested for use on the space station 
discoverys primary mission goal was to release the 100 million 
tracking and data relay satellite this was accomplished smoothly on 
monday and the satellite later rocketed itself to a stationary orbit 
22300 miles over the atlantic the satellite completes an orbiting 
communications network for nasa that includes two working tdrs and a 
spare 
the mission is 28th in the space shuttle and the first of seven 
missions planned this year by nasa it is also the third shuttle 
mission since flights resumed following the 1986 challenger disaster 
that killed seven astronauts

the departure of six senior political 
appointees at the education department paves the way for more 
cooperation and less ideology at the agency members of the 
education community said 
the department said thursday that president bush had accepted the 
resignations this week of five assistant secretaries and a deputy 
undersecretary they will leave by next thursday 
there really is a new breeze said education analyst emily 
feistritzer director of the national center for education 
information an independent nonpartisan research group 
she predicted a return to collaborative efforts between the 
special interest groups and the department of education that were 
the norm before former secretary william bennett brought his 
confrontational style to bear 
bennett was very ideological and defined the education 
department as a bully pulpit she said all the people he 
brought in that didnt leave earlier of their own accord pretty 
much are being moved on out 
education secretary lauro cavazos a conciliator who has reached 
out to all segments of the education community is a holdover from 
late in the reagan administration bush recently nominated illinois 
school superintendent ted sanders to be undersecretary the no 2 
slot and former white house aide nancy moore kennedy to be 
assistant secretary for legislation a slot now vacant 
there are seven assistant secretary and three deputy 
undersecretary slots at the department the six appointees whose 
resignations were accepted are 
patrick pizzella deputy undersecretary for management 
legree daniels assistant secretary for civil rights 
kenneth whitehead assistant secretary for postsecondary 
education 
beryl dorsett assistant secretary for elementary and secondary 
education 
madeleine will assistant secretary for special education and 
rehabilitative services 
patricia hines assistant secretary for educational research and 
improvement 
just after the president was elected he said he thought it 
would be a good idea to bring a lot of fresh faces into 
government said department spokeswoman mary crawford this is 
consistent with his thinking we dont have successors named for 
those posts yet what well do here is appoint acting office heads 
lamar haynes manager for intergovernmental relations at the 
national education association said the teachers union has had 
problems with some department offices including lack of what the 
union considered proper enforcement of education civil rights laws 
when we began working with secretary cavazos we immediately 
saw some very hopeful signs of being able to collaborate on a lot of 
issues and being able to have a voice at the department level 
haynes said we are hopeful that the replacements will have 
similar philosophies as the current secretary in terms of his 
interests and priorities 
david merkowitz a spokesman for the american council on 
education an umbrella group for higher education organizations 
called the departures a continuation of the direction in which the 
departments been moving since bennett left 
its clear that secretary cavazos has been working to 
reestablish a good relationship with higher education merkowitz 
said he said the newly constituted department will be less 
ideological than the bennett regime because that is the tone the 
secretary has set 
cavazos has said he is interested in helping disadvantaged 
students preventing dropouts and making sure minorities have 
access to higher education

the navy has lifted the veil of secrecy 
surrounding mysterious radio signals and allowed hundreds of 
jammed garage doors to lift as well 
when the navy flicked a switch thursday life returned to normal 
for suburbanites whose electronic garage doors had mysteriously 
failed to operate for days 
i was testing the opener every day and then all of a sudden 
bingo it started working said stan stuttaford of alamo 
the culprit the navy disclosed was a powerful radio wave it had 
beamed off a satellite dish on mount diablo in contra costa county 
the signals provided communications to a ship at alameda whose 
regular communications devices had broken 
maybe it didnt dawn on people in the navy how widespread the 
effect would be said lt joe murphy at the navys san francisco 
base murphy who opens his own garage door by hand said the navy 
will look into ways to prevent such disruptions in the future 
tom hora a spokesman with the federal communications commission 
in livermore on tuesday said a government agency had been 
transmitting the signals but he declined to name it 
garage door openers operate on radio frequencies used by the 
government and others with authorization hora said the public 
wasnt told about the problem because the remote control openers are 
considered unprotected devices 
jammed garage doors were reported in concord orinda walnut 
creek alamo lafayette moraga danville san ramon and livermore

a landlord discriminated against an 
unmarried couple by refusing to rent a house to them a judge has 
ruled 
minnesota human rights commissioner stephen cooper whose lawsuit 
against layle french alleged violations of the states human rights 
act said the decision was filed wednesday by judge peter erickson 
he said thursday that erickson still must decide damages in the case 
the states lawsuit sought damages from french for refusing to 
rent a house to susan parsons because she planned to live there with 
her fiance the lawsuit was based on a section of the states law 
that says refusal to rent on the basis of marital status is 
discriminatory 
french argued that the human rights act violated his religious 
beliefs forbidding sex before marriage 
the bible clearly states this is wrong french had said i 
live with the bible as my guide 
french claimed the law violated his first amendment right to 
freedom of religion and said he believed that by living together the 
couple would violate a littleknown state statute that prohibits 
sexual intercourse between unmarried adults 
but the judge said that when a person engages in forprofit 
undertakings his religious beliefs are not totally protected by the 
constitution 
frenchs attorney james anderson said he would appeal after the 
damages are assessed 
i dont understand the logic behind the law french said 
thursday adding that its frustrating to see these kinds of 
things go on and not be able to do anything about it

jal eldeeb lebanon ap a car bomb exploded during the 
morning rush hour today about 50 yards from the british embassy in 
christian east beirut and police reported that 12 people were 
killed and 75 wounded 
a radio station said the embassy may have been the intended 
target of the attack and that officials there had received threats 
from people offended by salman rushdies book the satanic 
verses 
the blast came during a lull in several days of fierce fighting 
between christian and moslem forces no group claimed responsibility 
for the bomb 
the car packed with an estimated 110 pounds of tnt blew up 
outside the abu habib bakery on the coastal highway in suburban jal 
eldeeb at 1045 am a police spokesman said 
the blast wrecked the onestory bakery the bloodstained 
wreckage was strewn with pieces of human flesh said the spokesman 
who cannot be named under standing regulations 
he said a travel agency on the ground floor of the sixstory 
building that houses the british embassy was completely wrecked but 
the only damage to the thirdfloor embassy was broken windows the 
spokesman said 12 people were killed and 75 wounded in the attack 
gunmen of the lebanese forces the christians main militia 
fired automatic weapons in the air to clear a path for ambulances 
and fire engines through the devastated street 
nervous lebanese guards of the embassy crouched at corners around 
the building fired machine gun volleys into the air and prevented 
reporters from entering the building 
the explosion set several shops and cars ablaze fire crews 
doused the fire with water and ambulance teams picked up bodies 
from the dripping wreckage 
the army command of gen michel aoun whose mainly christian 
troops have been battling moslem druse militiamen for nine days of 
fighting accused the syrian army in moslem west beirut of planting 
the bomb 
aouns headquarters charged in a communique that the syrians who 
support lebanons moslems and control security in west beirut 
engineered the bombing to provoke new fighting between the rival 
forces in the divided capital 
but aouns communique stressed our army units will not be be 
dragged into bombarding our people in west beirut 
the voice of lebanon radio station run by the rightist christian 
phalange party said the proximity of the blast to the british 
embassy suggested that the mission might have been the intended 
target 
the british embassy has received threats of attacks over salman 
rushdies controversial novel the satanic verses the broadcast 
said 
but it could not be immediately ascertained whether todays 
blast was an implementation of these threats 
many moslems claim that rushdies novel blasphemes islam irans 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has ordered rushdie killed 
proiranian shiite moslems groups in lebanon have vowed to carry 
out khomeinis death sentence and attack british targets because 
london has refused to condemn the book or put rushdie on trial 
rushdie who was born into a moslem family in india has since 
become a british citizen and has been in hiding in england 
todays explosion was the fifth car bombing in lebanon this year 
at least 13 people were killed and 68 wounded in the previous 
bombings 
police said a ceasefire went into effect at midnight thursday 
aouns forces and syrianbacked militiamen of druse warlord walid 
jumblatt 
fortynine people were killed and 161 wounded in nine days of 
fighting

marine biologists have reluctantly 
halted a rescue effort for a 35foot california gray whale after the 
giant mammal ensnared in fishing nets disappeared into the fog 
when the fog lifted thursday night the whale was gone and 
scientists who had lost track of the animal earlier in the day 
called off their intensive search 
the bologists said they hoped boaters who spot the 25ton animal 
would alert them 
the northbound whale was first spotted tuesday off dana point 
a team of biologists from the long beachbased whale rescue unit 
tried to get close enough to cut away the nets but lost the whale 
in fog near newport beach 45 miles southeast of los angeles 
the netting wrapped around the whales flukes eventually could 
cause it to drown said joe cordero a spokesman for the national 
marine fisheries service 
debris picked up in the net could drag the mammal under water 
and the nets probably will wrap tighter around the whale as it 
struggles to free itself said tom lewis codirector of the whale 
rescue unit 
from 10 to 15 whales become trapped in giant nets and slowly die 
each year during the migratory journey between california and 
mexicos baja california lewis said 
there are an estimated 21000 california whales 
whales began migrating from the warmer waters in mexico earlier 
this month and will continue their northward treks through may

severe winter weather has 
taken a heavy toll on elk in yellowstone national park and nearly 
onethird of the parks 19000head northern herd may have died 
park biologists say 
mortality rates were highest following the arctic cold in early 
february and a second severe storm at the end of the month 
biologists said 
the elk death rate generally peaks during the last two weeks of 
march said park biologist frank singer this year we hit the 
peak after the arctic front he said 
singer said the mortality rate was estimated by tracking elk 
equipped with radio collars nearly onethird of those animals have 
died he said 
in addition to stress from severe cold and snow summer forest 
fires swept some grazing areas already affected by drought forcing 
the animals outside the protection of the park in search of food 
about onethird of the elk deaths were attributed to hunters 
outside the park near gardiner mont 
more than half of the yellowsone elk herd remains outside the 
park bison that also migrated outside yellowstone in search of food 
have begun moving back into the parks interior but biologists say 
it probably will be several weeks before the elk return 
the elk probably will benefit from the growth of new vegetation 
spurred by the fires singer said 
i cant think of a species that will benefit more he said

political opportunity had been denied starkes black residents

remedies 
the naacp the american civil liberties union and other groups 
have been challenging the atlarge voting system in southern 
communities for many years

clause in the 1927 city charter never amended that requires blacks 
to live in the northeast

hand i fought for what i thought was right city commissioner

a bomb warning dated two days before pan am flight 
103 was destroyed over scotland was an unimportant document and was 
mailed after the disaster the transport secretary said in an 
interview published today 
it went out after christmas i cannot tell you the exact date 
but some days after christmas the secretary paul channon was 
quoted by the times of london as saying it was not a great new 
warning which we had to send out by telex it was a bit of 
supplementary information containing some color photographs the 
newspaper quoted him as saying 
disclosure of the dec 19 letter warning of a radiocassette 
bomb such as the one which has been identified as killing 270 people 
in the pan am disaster brought new demands from opposition 
lawmakers for a full public inquiry 
published reports that investigators have identified and even 
arrested a suspect in the bombing were denied by authorities in 
britain and west germany 
as criticism mounted of the governments handling of bomb 
warnings a spokesman for the governing conservative party pointed a 
finger at pan am 
the truth of the matter is that the west german authorities 
told pan am about a bomb in early november the american government 
told pan am about it on nov 18 conservative lawmaker david 
wilshire said today so what has it got to do with the british 
government are pan am deaf or not 
pamela hanlon a pan am spokeswoman in new york confirmed today 
that the airline received a warning from the west german government 
on nov 10 and another warning from the us federal aviation 
administration on nov 18 
wilshire charged that pan am had covered up the earlier warnings 
but ms hanlon said frankly i dont think its for the company 
to disclose that 
the nov 18 advisory that went out from the faa was not openly 
disclosed by the company per the faas directive she said 
the times of london quoting unidentified government sources 
reported today that authorities know who bombed flight 103 but the 
report was denied by british officials and an official in west 
germany where the flight originated 
i can confirm to you that there is insufficient evidence to 
establish the identity of the person or group responsible for 
this said inspector tom mcculloch a spokesman for the crash 
investigation in lockerbie scotland he said there were no plans 
for an announcement as reported by the newspaper 
i havent given any insructions for the arrest of anyone 
scotlands chief legal officer lord fraser told cbs this 
morning but added of course there are suspicions 
i certainly do not have an identification which i could 
consider putting before a court in scotland in england or indeed 
in any civilized jurisdiction said fraser who is lord advocate 
of scotland 
it would be useful if all these sources would share this 
information with us alexander prechtel spokesman for chief west 
german federal prosecutor kurt rebmann said today of the reports 
the identity of the bomber is known 
prechtel dismissed the story as absolute nonsense 
british and west german authorities also dismissed another report 
in a british tabloid today that said a suspect belonging to a 
radical palestinian group had been taken into custody in europe 
all 259 people on the new yorkbound flight and 11 people on the 
ground in lockerbie were killed in the disaster the flight 
originated in frankfurt west germany and passengers changed to a 
boeing 747 at londons heathrow airport 
the times said police and security services know who made and 
placed the bomb aboard the craft as well as the whereabouts of the 
bomber 
the results of what whitehall british government sources term 
one of the most remarkable feats of criminal detection ever known 
are expected to be disclosed next week the times said without 
elaborating 
the london tabloid today reported this morning that a terrorist 
who planted the bomb had been arrested the prime suspect a 
member of the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command is believed to be under heavy guard somewhere in europe

the fbi is investigating a proiranian student 
group to determine if the bombing of a van driven by the uss 
vincennes skippers wife was a terrorist act a newspaper reported 
today 
an iranian man who attended san diego state university and now 
works near the campus said that fbi agents investigating last 
fridays bombing questioned him twice this week about any militant 
iranians who may be enrolled at the school 
i didnt have any names and if i had any names im afraid id 
get those people in trouble by giving them out the source who 
requested anonymity told the los angeles times 
the investigators wanted information about members of the 
international muslim students association one of four iranian 
student groups on the san diego state campus the source said he 
described the group as consisting of five or six avowed supporters 
of irans ruler the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
a spokesman for that group told the times that it was not 
involved in the bomb attack 
my wish is that they catch the person who did this because my 
opinion is that it was not done by somebody practicing islam said 
the spokesman who was not identified it was done by somebody who 
wants to inflame hatred against muslims 
an fbi spokesman in san diego ronald orrantia refused to 
confirm that the man had been interviewed or to name anyone the 
agency has questioned about the attack 
the fbi is investigating the bombing as a possible terrorist act 
in retaliation for the mistaken downing of an iranian airliner by 
the vincennes last july in the persian gulf 
capt will c rogers iii the ships commander had driven the 
van from home to a nearby store and back shortly before his wife 
sharon left for work in it

a popping noise city fire officials have said

a member of new york states education 
policysetting board claims a pigment in black skin bonds with 
narcotics to help cause drug addiction 
adelaide sanford in asking the state board of regents to devote 
more money to drug education and research suggested the state 
should study whether a chemical link is partially responsible for 
the disproportionate number of black drug addicts 
the melanin in the skin of children of african descent bonds 
with narcotics and causes the addiction sanford who is black 
said at a wednesday night meeting of the board 
sanford said through a spokesman today that her statement 
reported in todays new york post did not mean blacks are more 
prone than whites to drug addiction 
she was just making the point that there ought to be more 
research and i dont think anyone disagrees with that view said 
chris carpenter a spokesman for the state education department and 
the regents 
sanford a retired elementary school teacher from brooklyn told 
the post she learned of the possible link between melanin and drugs 
from km wr science consortium a new age study group 
a spokesman for the group dr neserkar stewart said some 
research indicates theres a link between drugs and melanin but it 
cant be said this makes blacks more prone to drug addiction 
to say that we have a high drug addiction rate because of 
melanin i dont know if such a blanket statement can be made 
said stewart reached by telephone in oakland calif 
dr ron simeone director of research for the state division of 
substance abuse said he had never heard of such research as cited 
by sanford 
sanford was not immediately available for additional comment 
because she was in a meeting carpenter said 
new yorks education officials have drawn criticism for being 
slow to react to the explosion of crack addiction in new york city 
and elsewhere 
its not the first time sanford has been at the center of 
controversy for racially related comments last year some 
legislators called for her resignation after she said that lowering 
the dropout rates for white students as opposed to black students 
was not on her agenda

gun dealers reported runs on semiautomatic assault rifles as 
collectors shooters and investors reacted to a ban on imports and a 
us companys announcement it would stop selling them 
yeah theres been a run said barry cupp manager of the 
bulletstop a gun shop and target range in marietta ga ive sold 
every assault rifle and everything that looks like a assault rifle 
dealers said the run on guns has been limited to the rapidfire 
assault weapons which have been the object of protest since a 
gunman killed five schoolchildren in stockton calif in january 
the massacre and publicity about the use of the guns by drug 
dealers have spurred many city and state governments to consider 
banning the guns several cities particularly in california have 
approved bans already 
on wednesday colt industries of hartford conn said it was 
suspending sales to the public of its ar15 a civilian version of 
the militarys standard m16 with a list price ranging from 739 to 
1359 
the company said the suspension was a voluntary reaction to the 
bush administrations temporary import ban on semiautomatics 
announced tuesday 
president bush who has generally sided with opponents of gun 
bans said thursday that any longterm restrictions on rapidfire 
assault weapons must protect the rights of the legitimate 
sportsman as well as the lives of the nations police officers 
a semiautomatic rifle fires a round each time the trigger is 
pressed the government already bans sale of automatic weapons 
which fire bullets as long as the trigger is pressed but many 
semiautomatic weapons can be readily converted to automatics 
buyers of the weapons this week include gun enthusiasts worried 
that the stock soon would be depleted and investors who have noted 
the rapid runup in prices and are hoping that they can profit if it 
continues 
its hysteria running wild said donald g davis owner of 
dons guns a chain of three stores in indianapolis we could 
hardly give one away prior to this mass hysteria and now every 
other customer that comes in here wants one 
my price has gone up from about 350 to 1000 today and when 
i sell half of what i have left the price will go to 1500 davis 
said thursday 
at the gun gallery in dallas an ak47 a type of gun used in the 
stockton shooting cost 369 on monday 599 on tuesday and 799 on 
friday they dont care how much it costs said owner paul 
rosenberg 
in georgia cubb said his customers included the people who 
always wanted one they mortgaged the house again and come out and 
get one then theres the investor who thinks if i get one today 
for 600 it will be worth 1200 tomorrow 
the whitecollar workers the ones that drive the bmws and the 
mercedes they think its an investment just like the rolex watch 
they wear on their arm cubb said 
a man who answered the phone at the sandy trading post in sandy 
ore where patrick purdy bought the ak47 he used in the stockton 
schoolyard shootings said the store was not experiencing a run on 
the rifles he also said sales of other guns had not increased 
however when asked for his name he hung up 
in california where a gunban bill passed the state assembly 
this week and a similar one passed the senate last week unhappy gun 
owners announced plans for a petition drive seeking the recall of 
the senator and assemblyman who sponsored the bills 
it the ban is simply being ramrodded through without 
considering their constituents true feelings said ray hickman of 
the 500member liberty coalition of the san fernando valley 
i will not be intimidated by recall threats from these rambo 
gun groups countered sen david roberti sponsor of the senate 
bill 
interest in the guns has been on the increase since the 
california shootings but dealers said it was bushs announcement 
tuesday of the temporary import ban coupled with colts halt in 
ar15 sales that really spurred sales 
in indianapolis davis estimated thursday that has about 30 left 
in stock at his three stores if i could find 1000 today in 
america i would buy them all he said well be out for sure by 
saturday 
he had strong criticism for colt for halting the ar15 sales and 
vowed never to sell them again if colt changes its mind we feel 
all theyre doing is making love to the american public and lending 
themselves to this hysteria davis said 
roy furbeck owner of furbecks gun shop in chatham ill said 
he doesnt sell the assault rifles because i dont think theres a 
sporting use for them but hes gotten a few calls about them 
people are trying to scalp them he said people have told 
me that theyll get whatever the traffic will bear

a car bomb exploded 50 yards from the 
british embassy in christian east beirut on friday demolishing a 
crowded bakery and killing 12 people police said 75 were wounded 
no group claimed responsibility the commander of christian army 
units blamed syria but a christian radio station said the target may 
have been the embassy because of the controversy over the satanic 
verses by salman rushdie a british citizen 
people were lined up to buy bread at the habib bakery on a 
coastal highway in the jal eldeeb district when the car blew up 
hurling bodies into the air police reported 
shattered glass littered the street pieces of human flesh could 
be seen in the wreckage 
people had taken advantage of the relative calm to buy some 
bread and food in fear of another round of shelling a police 
spokesman said 
beirut residents had taken shelter for more than a week because 
of artillery exchanges between christian soldiers and moslem 
militiamen that rained shells on the city 
sporadic shelling continued during the day despite a truce in the 
artillery and rocket battle 
the explosion which police said equaled 110 pounds of tnt 
wrecked 20 nearby vehicles and devastated shops and restaurants 
around the bakery 
its force broke the windows of the british embassy edgy lebanese 
guards crouched at corners of the mission keeping reporters out and 
firing volleys into the air from their automatic weapons 
hospitals appealed by radio for blood donations a doctor at the 
abujaoudeh hospital in jal eldeeb his gown stained with blood 
said two bodies were disfigured beyond recognition 
the emergency wards waiting area became a makeshift operating 
room doctors removed glass slivers from the legs and faces of 
dozens of victims 
it was the fifth bombing in lebanon this year police say 13 
people were killed and 68 wounded in the four other explosions 
voice of lebanon the radio station of the christian phalange 
party said the nearness to the sixstory embassy building suggested 
it was the target 
the british embassy has received threats of attacks over salman 
rushdies controversial novel the broadcast said 
many moslems feel the satanic verses blasphemes islam and 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran has ordered the author killed 
gen michel aouns christian army command issued a statement 
claiming the syrian army which oversees security in moslem west 
beirut arranged the bombing to provoke more sectarian artillery 
battles 
our army units will not be be dragged into bombarding our 
people in west beirut it said 
about three hours after the blast six shells landed in christian 
east beirut and four of them hit the governmentrun port there were 
no reports of casualties or serious damage 
a ceasefire was proclaimed at midnight thursday in the 
confrontation between aouns men and the syrianbacked druse militia 
led by walid jumblatt 
fighting began march 8 two days after aoun impose a blockade on 
illegal ports run by moslem militias 
it threatened efforts of arab league mediators to resolve a 
political crisis that created christian and moslem governments and 
has split the army into sectarian commands aoun leads the christian 
government in addition to commanding the christian army 
police said 49 people were killed and 161 wounded nearly all of 
them civilians in the artillery battles it was the most serious 
fighting between christians and moslems since 1985 in lebanons 
14yearold civil war 
aouns christian military cabinet competes with a predominantly 
moslem government led by premier salim hoss a sunni moslem 
president amin gemayel chose aoun to lead the government when his 
own sixyear term expired in september and conservative christians 
would not accept syrias nominees to succeed him moslems then 
pledged allegiance to hoss 
by tradition lebanons president is christian the premier sunni 
and the parliament speaker shiite moslem 
syrian has 40000 soldiers in lebanon and has become the nations 
main power broker

what im going to do hasnt congealed yet molly springer said 
friday from her home near the johnson space center in houston her 
husband is bob springer who was making his first space flight

the engineers and technicians who never get on camera never get 
in paintings the people who make it all possible

the senate gave quick approval today to 
lawrence eagleburger as deputy secretary of state the state 
departments no 2 position 
the approval was by voice vote 
eagleburgers nomination was approved thursday by the senate 
foreign relations committee but only after sharp questioning from 
sen jesse helms rnc 
helms who spent two days questioning the nominees business 
relations with former secretary of state henry kissinger took part 
in the 190 vote to approve eagleburger 
senator after senator praised eagleburger repeatedly during his 
two days of testimony for his distinguished 30year career in 
government 
however the hearings at times were shadowed by the recent bitter 
conflict over former sen john towers failed nomination to be 
secretary of defense 
i have the uncomfortable feeling that im a testtube case 
here eagleburger quipped once while under some intense 
questioning by helms 
helms asserted that his queries into eagleburgers dealings with 
the consulting firm kissinger associates werent out of line given 
the attention paid to towers 1 million in earnings from defense 
contractors 
towers nomination was defeated last week the senate was 
expected to approve the nomination of rep dick cheney rwyo as 
secretary of defense today 
i wish he had an opportunity to answer questions in public 
about his income helms said of tower he wasnt allowed to 
defend himself 
the senator also jabbed at eagleburgers 900000 in earnings 
from kissingers firm and an affiliate commenting that the 
assessments he gave to multinational corporations on international 
affairs must be extraordinary advice 
the firms eagleburger dealt with according to disclosure forms 
filed with the senate include anheuserbusch the south korean 
conglomerate daewoo corp hj heinz the italian car maker fiat 
spa itt corp ab volvo union carbide and cocacola 
helms also tweaked kissinger calling him a revolving 
peripatetic entity 
henry kissinger was a political entity he still is thats 
why larry eagleburger got well over a million dollars not 
because he kissinger was good looking or speaks english 
fluently helms said a clear dig at kissingers looks and thick 
accent 
helms a staunch conservative has been critical for years of 
kissingers conduct of foreign policy especially moves toward 
closer relations with the soviet union during the nixon and ford 
administrations 
helms questioned whether eagleburgers work for kissingers firm 
conflicted with laws that require those who lobby for foreign 
governments to register their activities with the us government 
eagleburger stressed to the committee that he had never lobbied 
the us government on behalf of any of the firms clients and had 
strictly abided by the law 
his nomination was approved unanimously after he agreed to 
disqualify himself from all matters involving clients whod had 
contact with the firm over the last two years one of several steps 
he agreed to take that went beyond the demands of the ethics in 
government act 
eagleburger received numerous plaudits for his years at the state 
department including service as ambassador to yugoslavia and 
undersecretary of state for political affairs the departments no 
3 post 
sen alan cranston dcalif said secretary of state james a 
baker iii was not an expert in foreign policy and needed 
eagleburgers expertise from 30 years in government 
i want to see the president given this choice cranston said

a 255foot medieval tower collapsed in a 
downtown square of this northern italian city today killing two 
people injuring 25 and burying parked cars and a newspaper stand 
the casualty figures were provided by a civil defense official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity he said an earlier report by a 
fire department spokesman that three people had died was incorrect 
more than 100 firefighters who dug for hours through the rubble 
managed to rescue two men and a woman the civil defense official 
told the associated press none of the injured was in serious 
condition doctors at the san matteo hospital reported the civil 
defense said that no one was reported missing but added that rescue 
operations were to continue through saturday 
the 900yearold tower collapsed at 9 am scattering its red 
bricks throughout the square the 501yearold cathedral adjacent to 
the collapsed tower suffered substantial damage and some shops in 
the square were struck and damaged according to the local 
archbishops office 
the baptistery and an arch were cracked following the collapse 
of the nearby tower experts are checking the extent of the 
damage said a local church official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
about 50 people were attending a mass in the cathedral at the 
time of the collapse but none was injured he said 
the cathedral was fenced off and nearby streets were closed to 
traffic as authorities inspected the cathedral including the dome 
designed by donato bramante 
a spokeswoman for the mayors office said there had been no signs 
indicating the tower was in danger of collapsing it all happened 
abruptly and unexpectedly said the spokeswoman who asked not to 
be identified 
experts had recently checked to determine whether the medieval 
tower might need restoration work 
maria antonietta abrate who works at the local historical 
preservation office said deterioration of the mortar probably 
caused the collapse 
its something due to age which cannot be predicted its 
typical of ancient towers she said 
paiva a former capital of the longobards the german tribe that 
founded the city in 568 is about 20 miles southwest of milan 
italys most famous tower the leaning tower of pisa has long 
been judged in danger of collapsing although not in the immediate 
future

apples expelled from school cafeterias because 
of a nationwide cancer scare will return to menus in the nations 
secondlargest school district after passing chemical tests 
tests for the allegedly cancercausing chemical alar known as 
daminozide proved negative for fresh apples apple juice 
appleraisin bars and frozen applecherry juice bars los angeles 
unified school district superintendent leonard britton said thursday 
were delighted to report that apples will be back in school 
and that they are absolutely safe said district spokeswoman diana 
munatones 
the district still will withhold other apple products including 
apple sauce and canned apple slices from school menus until test 
results are delivered next week officials said 
meanwhile shipments of washington apples dropped by 152000 
boxes in the past week a sign that consumer sales are being hurt by 
the alar scare an industry official said today in yakima wash 
the weekly report of outofstate shipments of the nations 
largest apple crop showed a drop from 156 million boxes two weeks 
ago to 14 million boxes last week each box contains 42 pounds of 
apples 
the announcement in the nearly 600000student district coincided 
with similar pronouncements by the federal environmental protection 
agency food and drug administration and department of agriculture 
in a separate statement the epa fda and the agriculture department 
said the federal government believes that it is safe for 
americans to eat apples 
although the epa has acknowledged the link between daminozide and 
cancer james moore acting deputy epa administrator said thursday 
he considers the health risk insufficient at current use and residue 
levels to warrant its removal from the market 
the chemical is used by apple growers to regulate the ripening 
rate of apples and to prolong shelf life 
school district business service administrator beth louargand 
said she didnt regret the weeklong apple ban 
our first concern is to be absolutely sure that children are 
safe louargand said

the leftist sandinista government today 
released almost 1900 former national guardsmen most of them jailed 
since the 1979 revolution that ousted president anastasio somoza 
the prisoners were freed in a ceremony at the jorge navarro penal 
rehabilitation center in tipitapa 15 miles east of managua where 
the guardsmen were being held 
the release was a first step in complying with an agreement by 
central american presidents on democratization in nicaragua and the 
eventual disbanding of ussupported guerrillas that have been 
fighting the sandinista government 
president daniel ortega presided over the release accompanied by 
the secretary general of the organization of american states joao 
baena soares the minister of the interior tomas borge and bishop 
bosco vivas a vicar of the roman catholic church in managua 
more than a thousand friends and family members waited at the 
edge of the road near the penitentiary for the release the red 
cross said it was providing 60 buses to take the former guardsmen to 
their homes throughout the nation 
most of the 1894 prisoners had been jailed since the sandinistas 
came to power the national guard was disbanded after the overthrow 
of somoza 
the national assembly on tuesday approved an amnesty for the 
former guardsmen the release was scheduled for sunday but was moved 
ahead to today 
the assembly however refused to grant amnesty to 39 other 
detainees who it said had committed atrocious crimes against the 
nicaraguan people 
the government has also asked the united nations to monitor the 
countrys elections set for february 1990 and the 10month 
political campaign a un spokesman said thursday 
ortega asked the assembly to grant the pardons under a peace 
accord he signed in el salvador on feb 14 with the presidents of 
that country guatemala honduras and costa rica 
ortega also agreed to adopt democratic reforms and move up the 
date of general elections by 10 months to february 1990 
in exchange the presidents agreed to draft a plan to dismantle 
the 11000member nicaraguan rebel army known as the contras who 
are now in base camps in honduras their forces have faded since the 
united states cut off most military aid to them early last year 
roman catholic cardinal miguel obando y bravo told ortega during 
a meeting wednesday that the amnesty should be extended to all 
jailed guardsmen and political prisoners including 1500 rebels in 
nicaraguan jails 
the opposition permanent human rights commission says 6000 
people are in jail accused of aiding the contras ortega has said

state treasurer a james manchin 
defended himself before an impeachment committee today saying he 
knew nothing of massive state losses for 1 years because other 
employees kept the information from him 
not a single witness has testified that i knew of the magnitude 
of the losses manchin said 
manchin said he depended on thenassociate treasurer arnold 
margolin to run the investment office and margolin and his 
employees did not tell him or his chief of staff about the losses 
which eventually totaled 279 million 
the system failed manchin told the state house judiciary 
committee the checks didnt check the balances didnt balance 
manchin said the first he heard of the losses the bulk of which 
occurred from april to june 1987 in late november or early december 
1988 
since then manchin said he has been keeping a close eye on the 
investment division 
no more trust in one person manchin said 
but when del rod berry asked manchin how much the investment 
division made or lost last week manchin would not answer 
we can get you a report on that manchin said 
manchin is the last witness scheduled to testify before the 
committee 
former gov arch moore told committee on thursday he had no idea 
the consolidated investment fund was suffering losses in 1987 even 
though he knew some bonds had suffered a significant drop in value 
moore said he learned of trouble in the investment fund in late 
1988 from the private touche ross amp co which he had hired to 
conduct an audit of state government 
had we had any idea we certainly would have treated the 
treasurers office the same as a private investment firm giving us 
professional counseling and reporting massive losses moore said 
we would have had them on the carpet in a moment

prime minister rajiv gandhi said friday 
he will release a secret report on his mothers assassination in 
order to stop malicious innuendo about what it contains 
indira gandhi who preceded her son as prime minister was killed 
in 1984 by members of her personal guard 
indias largest englishlanguage newspaper the indian express 
declared tuesday the report prepared by supreme court justice mp 
thakkar says rajendra kumar dhawan mrs gandhis personal 
secretary had consciously or unconsciously facilitated the 
commission of a crime 
the needle of suspicion significantly points at his complicity 
or involvement the paper said 
dhawan 52 was dismissed after mrs gandhis death but became an 
aide to rajiv gandhi in february 
excerpts published in the indian express accuse dhawan of lying 
during questioning and giving unconvincing explanations about 
entries in his diary including the name of one of the two assassins 
dhawan has refused comment on the allegations but senior 
government officials including home minister buta singh told 
parliament he was innocent 
after the indian express article appeared opposition parties 
demanded the report be made public and dissension developed in 
gandhis governing congress party 
on wednesday the government suspended 63 opposition members of 
parliament who shouted slogans against supression of the report 
earlier friday about 80 members from the government party said 
they would tell the prime minister they would release the report if 
he did not the congress party members said they had obtained 
extensive portions of the text 
gandhi told parliament the events of the past few days have 
caused the people of india immense distress i for my part have 
relived the terrible trauma of that time 
the investigations are now complete and necessary followup 
action will be taken soon therefore the release of the report 
would no longer prejudice the course of the criminal 
investigations 
he said the published version is fueling willful distortion 
malicious innuendo and irresponsible character assassination to put 
a stop to this it is important that the full text of the report be 
made public 
it will be given to parliament on march 27 when it reconvenes 
after a vacation he said 
thakkars inquiry ran parallel to police investigations and he 
submitted the report 15 months after mrs gandhi was killed on oct 
31 1984 
the government withheld it citing national security gandhi told 
lawmakers thakkar wanted the report be kept secret because it might 
jeopardize criminal investigations 
mrs gandhi was killed in the garden of her new delhi residence 
by two sikh bodyguards as she walked to a television interview 
accompanied by dhawan 
the indian express quoted the report as saying dhawan fell 
behind her just in the nick of the time as they were approaching the 
scene of the assassination 
one assassin was shot and killed by other guards minutes later 
and the other was convicted of murder and hanged in january a third 
sikh convicted of conspiracy also was hanged

money has been raised to keep the landsat 
earthsensing satellites going for at least four months the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration told congress on 
friday 
the satellites had been threatened with shutdown on march 31 
because of a lack of money but passing the hat among agencies that 
use information from landsat has generated enough pledges to keep 
the satellites operating 
the defense department pledged 3 million 16 million will come 
from satellite operating receipts 1 million from the national 
aeronautics and space administration 500000 from the interior 
department and 300000 from the department of agriculture said 
dr william e evans commerce under secrtetary for oceans and 
atmospheres 
the landsat satellites which collect information used in 
mapping locating mineral resources and assessing agricultural and 
other land features are operated by the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration which is under evans 
the budget problem was caused by the fact that the two satellites 
are past their anticipated lifetimes and planners had not expected 
them to last this long a replacement is to be launched in a year or 
so and that has been funded 
asked what will happen when the new financing runs out in four 
months evans told the house appropriations commerce subcommittee 
that he is not sure but he wants to be cautious about committing 
large amounts of money nature may solve the problem by shutting 
down the satellites he commented 
evans comments came at a hearing on the proposed 106 billion 
budget for noaa which he said will allow the agency to concentrate 
on three primary areas coastal zone research and development 
modernization of the national weather service and research into 
global climate change

the treasury department may ban imports of 
additional kinds of semiautomatic weapons following earlier 
suspension of imports of five types a spokesman said today 
the treasurys bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms is still 
reviewing the uses of all types of semiautomatics that are imported 
but has not reached a decision on whether to suspend importation of 
more models than the five types banned from import this week said 
jerry rudden spokesman for the batf 
the process is ongoing additional firearms may very well be 
added to the list large numbers of firearms are being looked 
at he said 
but he said a report that the batf had added some weapons to the 
list and then changed its mind was erroneous 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen had said earlier that she 
understood such a decision had been made by batf but that it was 
done without any pressure or direction from any other agency 
including the white house and the treasury department hierarchy 
chief of staff john sununus office also heard that batf might 
add more weapons to its suspension said a sununu aide who spoke on 
condition of anonymity the aide said he called batf officials to 
learn if that was true and was told that the bureau was still 
evaluating the matter and had no announcement planned on expanding 
the ban 
the aide said he was only seeking information and the call did 
not indicate any white house pressure although the lobbyist for the 
national rifle association wayne lapierre met with sununu thursday 
while bush was traveling in texas and colorado 
the meeting lasted less than 10 minutes sununus aide said and 
did not involve discussion of a potential expanded suspension 
lapierre brought a copy of the nras public comment on the 
suspension and discussed some concerns about legislation in 
congress 
nra officials refused comment today on any of their contacts with 
the administration 
the washington post reported today that batf had intended on 
thursday to announce it would supplement an import ban announced two 
days earlier on such weapons as the uzi and ak47 
the newspaper said the treasury department squelched the plan 
under pressure from nra officials 
the nra has reacted publicly with caution on the administrations 
suspension of some imports it did not directly criticize the move 
an administration source said the white house has received many 
calls from guncontrol opponents who are worried about the precedent 
the action could set with regard to domestically produced weapons 
its arguably the hottest issue out there the official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
vice president dan quayle said the day after the ban was 
announced tuesday that he had received several calls in that vein 
the ban covered five types that accounted for 80 percent of the 
semiautomatic imports officials said 
william j bennett the administrations director of drug control 
policy called for the temporary ban because of the popularity of 
the weapons with their rapidfire ability and largecapacity 
ammunition clips with drug dealers 
an ak47 was used by a mentally unbalanced drifter to kill five 
children in a stockton calif schoolyard

an ancient mummy of an aristocratic 
young woman her mona lisa smile frozen in a plaster death mask has 
been unearthed in a shallow pit at the foot of the great pyramid of 
cheops 
shes really lovely said aly hassan director of pharaonic 
monuments for the egyptian antiquities organization hassan dated 
the mummy as 4400 years old one of the earliest ever found in 
egypt 
egyptologists expressed surprise at thursdays discovery noting 
the giza pyramids area has been looted repeatedly since antiquity 
and excavated by some of the greatest archaeologists of the last two 
centuries 
hassan said the seals of the grave were intact when an 
antiquities inspector accidentally found the burial shaft 
officials who entered the grave found the mummy she wore a 
bronze crown covered with gold leaf on her head and jewelry around 
her neck 
jewelry pottery wooden items a piece of glass flint 
obsidian a clove of garlic and more than a dozen teeth lay nearby 
the wood and garlic may have been placed in the grave to keep 
insects away 
the mummy was not identified but hassan said the womans 
nobility was established both by the finery buried with her and the 
site of her burial a cemetery reserved for officials of the ruling 
court 
she was about 22 years old when she died and stood five feet 
tall hassan said he said the body dates from the fifth dynasty 
which lasted from 2465 bc to 2323 bc he said he dated her body 
from that dynasty because other bodies in the cemetery were from 
that period 
her body is so dried out that it has been wrapped in foam for 
protection and bound beneath the head 
zahi hawass director general of the giza area said the new 
mummy might have been an important person reburied for safekeeping 
in the shaft where she was found 
two vast cemeteries lie under giza plateau one with royal tombs 
to the east of the cheops pyramid to the west lies the one with the 
new mummy put into use five years into the reign of cheops 4600 
years ago 
inspectors have identified the owner of the complex in which the 
shaft was found as sankh ptah but his position under the pharaohs 
and his relation with the mummy remain mysteries 
egyptologists hope the mummy can provide clues into early 
mummification an art of preservation that spanned more than 3000 
years of egyptian history into christian times 
any find in the giza area in such a condition is a great 
addition to archaeology said hassan this mummy changes our 
concept of preservation and mummification and provides a new date 
for it 
the earliest true mummy is that of waty found in the tomb of a 
court singer called nefer at sakkara watys mummy dates from the 
late fifth dynasty and was preserved so well by resinsoaked 
bandages that even a callus on the sole of a foot is visible 
egyptians mummified their dead for thousands of years and was 
refined over the ages using a solution of naturally occurring 
preservative compounds 
an obstacle to unraveling mysteries that still surround the 
mummification process is that the ancients left incomplete pictorial 
records of the embalming ritual 
some say the art of mummification was too sacred to be revealed

citing two crashes in a weeks time the air 
force said friday it had grounded its fleet of h3 helicopters from 
all but emergency missions as a safety precaution 
the flight restriction order which is indefinite in length will 
allow the choppers to fly searchandrescue missions but restrict 
all other flying until a thorough investigation has been 
completed the air force said 
once the command can assure adequate flight safety the fleet 
will be returned to full operational status 
the restrictions affect 33 h3s assigned to active duty air force 
units and 27 assigned to the air national guard or air force 
reserve the service said 
the order follows a crash last sunday night in the arizona desert 
in which 15 servicemen were killed on tuesday another h3 crashed 
in the ocean off the coast of japan while on a routine 
searchandrescue training mission killing three 
the air force has said it has no evidence suggesting the two 
crashes were caused by the same problem the precautionary grounding 
order was issued however because accidents with the h3 are fairly 
unusual the service added 
in the past six years there have been only four major accidents 
with the h3 
the h3 series of helicopters was designed in the late 1950s and 
early 1960s and used extensively in vietnam nicknamed the jolly 
green giant the helicopter is still flown by the navy and coast 
guard in addition to the air force 
the navy said friday it was aware of the air forces action but 
had not issued any similar grounding order 
earlier this month the air force temporarily grounded all of its 
h3s for a onetime inspection of the main rotor head shaft nut a 
huge nut that holds the rotor blade assembly to the main engine 
shaft 
that grounding was ordered after the air force said it had 
discovered that defective nuts had been received from a spare parts 
contractor the air force said both of the helicopters that crashed 
this week had undergone those mandatory inspections and were flying 
with good shaft nuts

the old custom of decorating easter egg trees 
is as much a part of the holiday in some homes as easter baskets 
and now its spreading 
this year were expecting about 100 percent growth rate over 
last year said barry vaill owner of the country christmas store 
which begins stocking easter trees almost as soon as the season ends 
for the christmas versions 
some people snip spring branches and spraypaint them white or 
other colors and others decorate artificial christmas trees or even 
house plants with eastertheme baubles 
the exeterbased store which displays roughly a dozen easter 
trees of differing themes expects to sell about 100 trees ranging 
from 20 to 250 he said some are tableheight and others are up 
to 7 or 8 feet tall 
the trees have religious meaning to some and are simply festive 
to others 
years ago when emily nero 59 of providence first started 
decorating an easter tree after seeing the idea in a magazine 
virtually all her ornaments were hand made 
you can make them its more traditional she said as she 
shopped for ornaments but the ones you can buy are beautiful and 
they save time 
the country christmas store stocks decorations of porcelain 
glass papier mache wood and ceramic made in countries like taiwan 
and west germany in addition to the traditional egg shape people 
can decorate trees with easter bunnies chicks lambs ribbons and 
the like 
the manufacturers got smart about four years ago and started 
coming out with easter decorations said vaill the selection has 
grown ever since he said calling this year the best ive ever 
seen in terms of variety 
the origins of the egg tree have been lost in oblivion according 
to the book an egg at easter a folklore study by newall 
venetia 
the practice is enjoying new popularity because people are 
going back to the oldfashioned ways of doing things where they 
decorate their house for christmas and halloween passing the 
tradition down from generation to generation vaill said 
its kind of fun said lisa goyette 24 of providence who 
continues the custom she grew up with when you grow older and you 
dont have easter baskets the tree makes it festive 
goyette said her mother a devout roman catholic decorates an 
egg tree because it symbolizes rebirth and rejuvenation the tree at 
her mothers eastham mass home is decorated on palm sunday and 
stays up until easter sunday 
in some places it has become such a tradition that the entire 
town participates 
in decatur ind the practice of decorating a public easter tree 
with hundreds of eggs began in 1951 said joyce iliff director of 
the decatur pulbic library where the tree is displayed 
the town originated the yearly custom a year after publication of 
the book the egg tree by kathleen milhous 
vaill said decorating easter trees is a natural welcoming of the 
springtime 
easter is a breath of fresh air after christmas when its 
cold and dreary and its dark even footballs over he said 
whether they go get a branch out of the back yard and spray 
paint it white or whether theyre buying one of our trees people 
are doing one or the other said vaill

leftist rebels want to disrupt and discredit 
el salvadors presidential election as a means of forcing new 
negotiations on their offer to join the political process two of 
their leaders said 
we want to weaken the electoral process so much that the 
results are not seen as legitimate said mario lopez a member of 
the farabundo marti national liberation fronts political commission 
that will open the door to our proposals lopez said thursday 
in an interview at the fronts mexico city offices 
the rebels contend sundays election will be fraudulent and 
unrepresentative and they believe their boycott will help prove it 
their theory holds that talks will begin when all other solutions 
are seen to fail that if death squads elections and us aid 
cannot pacify the nation perhaps all sides will see negotiations as 
the only alternative 
reality imposes itself on everybodys dreams including our 
own said ana guadalupe martinez another member of the political 
commission who spoke with the associated press 
rebel leaders offered to participate if the election was delayed 
six months and a fair vote was guaranteed when their proposal 
failed they called for a boycott threatened election workers and 
stopped traffic throughout the country with threats to attack 
vehicles and drivers 
they also launched several attacks including one with rocket 
grenades on the presidential palace that wounded seven people 
despite their boycott the rebels have said supporting the 
leftist democratic convergence is a valid option for salvadorans 
the party is running third in polls to the rightwing republican 
nationalist alliance known as arena and the incumbent christian 
democrats 
ms martinez said guerrilla leaders knew the boycott would affect 
the leftist partys showing but they feel the total vote against the 
status quo includes those who do not vote or cast ballots that are 
blank or defaced 
guillermo ungo the convergence presidential candidate has asked 
the guerrillas to call off the boycott comparing the rebel alliance 
to a woman who wants to jump into bed but still remain a virgin 
that sounds like dr ungo all right ms martinez said 
laughing 
the convergence wasnt going to win anyway she added but 
they need to play a respectable political role 
she and lopez admitted the rebels risk being seen as the culprits 
even if they succeed in discrediting the election but ms martinez 
said this war didnt start with these elections it has deeper 
causes and the guerrillas have made responsible gestures towards 
negotiations 
arena leads in the polls but a runoff is possible if one is 
needed it would be held in april and the two officials said the 
offer of negotiations might be renewed before that 
well have to evaluate the election results and whether our 
strategy worked lopez said 
ms martinez said the guerrillas hope their strategy will work 
even if the winner is alfredo cristiani the arena candidate but 
added cristiani has a moderate image but that may not have 
anything to do with the interests he represents 
she said she fears roberto daubuisson a former army officer who 
who founded arena daubuisson has been linked to death squads but 
denies the allegations 
daubuisson may be the power behind the throne ms martinez 
said but nine years of war and 70000 deaths are factors in favor 
of negotiations 
they tried death squads and they couldnt pacify the country 
she said how can they try that again

disillusioned with the hollywood of today 
and i know and im very sad that american film has become 
in my opinion the major motivation for the american being as 
detested as he is throughout the world mankiewicz said 
all they see in american movies is variations on obscenity 
boozing and sex mankiewicz told reporters wednesday

a credit card is all movielovers need to 
buy tickets popcorn and candy at a new suburban washington theater 
but owners said friday most patrons probably arent ready to leave 
their cash at home 
i think we have a lifetime of cash transactions to overcome 
said dick dodderidge senior vice president for corporate marketing 
of kansas citybased american multicinema inc people obviously 
are not used to whipping out a credit card when they go to the movie 
theatre so i think its going to take a while for it to catch on 
by midday friday the opening day for the new amc courthouse 
plaza 8 theaters eight people had telephoned ahead to charge 
tickets and concession stand vouchers said manager charlie 
stoessel the theater began accepting credit card reservations 
tuesday 
the courthouse plaza is the first us cinema to have electronic 
facilities for credit card transactions incorporated into its 
design although amc began experimenting with the idea at a kansas 
theater several weeks ago said dodderidge 
the theatre charges a 50cent handling fee for telephoned advance 
credit card reservations which dont save specific seats but let 
moviegoers avoid long ticket lines the day of a show said stoessel 
there is no extra charge for charges made in person 
the computerized automatic ticket sales system can register 
credit cards as quickly as cash with a quick flick through a 
scanning device dodderidge said amc imported the system from the 
united kingdom where the credit concept has become popular over the 
past three years 
another local chain kb theatres also plans to introduce credit 
card transactions 
we want to see how it works out for them first said kb 
general manager john bailey we think it will give our theatres an 
edge when people are trying to decide between one theatre and 
another that may be the thing that helps them make a decision 
moviegoers have not been flocking to put their movie tickets on 
plastic at a theatre in overland park kan where amc has been 
testing the concept for three weeks credit card transactions at the 
oak park plaza have accounted for about 1 percent of ticket sales 
up from sixtenths of 1 percent the first week said manager keith 
weidenkeller 
its growing weidenkeller said everybody that uses it 
seems to want to use it again i think it will just keep going the 
general response is well its about time 
its all so new we really dont know what to expect said

the leader of the governing 
national party denied friday that he was attempting to oust 
president pw botha but conceded that their awkward relationship 
needed to be clarified 
the main white opposition party meanwhile said national party 
leader fw de klerk lacked the political strength to complete the 
minicoup he launched while botha was recovering from a stroke 
de klerk the education minister became head of the national 
party on feb 2 when botha resigned from the post two weeks after 
suffering a stroke 
the national partys parliamentary caucus resolved this week that 
it wants de klerk to become president however botha returned to 
office wednesday and has made clear he will remain in his post 
indefinitely regardless of the wishes of his party 
it is my and my partys wish that the relationship with botha 
shall remain warm sincere and healthy de klerk said in 
parliament in cape town be calm we will find a sensible way 
de klerk also said that a new constitution presumably one that 
would include the black majority would have to be introduced to 
replace the one botha helped introduce in 1984 
the national party remains committed to its goal of power 
sharing said de klerk a new constitution differing 
substantially from what we have today must come about 
the role of the president would have to be reviewed 
drastically de klerk added 
under south africas apartheid policies of racial segregation 
the countrys 5 million whites maintain political and economic 
control over the countrys 28 million blacks who have no vote in 
national affairs 
de klerk has been depicted as more pragmatic and flexible than 
botha although they appear to agree on most major policy issues 
in recent speeches de klerk has called for race reform but has 
not put forward any specific proposals also he has emphasized his 
commitment to continued segregation of white neighborhoods and 
schools 
ferdie hartzenberg deputy leader of the extreme right 
conservative party said de klerk wanted to oust botha but lacked 
the political strength to do so 
the whole of south africa can be behind de klerk he still 
knows he cannot match pw botha in a mantoman contest he is 
too weak 
hartzenberg whose party favors strict segregation also 
questioned de klerks commitment to sharing power with blacks 
mr de klerk does not even want to share power with the state 
president let alone other groups

the head of the chinese communist party in tibet 
said tibetan activists may defy martial law and adopt new 
methods to fight chinese rule of the remote region the official 
press said friday 
a tibetan contacted by telephone in lhasa said the city was 
quiet on the 30th anniversary of the flight of tibets spiritual 
leader the dalai lama from his homeland to india during an 
uprising against chinese rule 
he said police and soldiers were posted throughout the city and 
arrests continued of tibetans suspected of taking part in three days 
of protests last week at least 16 people were reported killed in 
the protests 
tibetans contacted on march 10 after foreign tourists were 
expelled from the city reported largescale roundups by chinese 
security forces 
a nepalese businessman said the city was very quiet but that 
authorities had not let him leave his hotel 
the peoples daily quoted party leader hu jintao as saying the 
situation in lhasa was reaching stability after 10 days of 
martial law 
but a minority of separatists will not let the matter drop 
he was quoted as saying they might switch their tricks and adopt 
new methods of opposition because of this we must raise our 
vigilance 
hu did not elaborate as to what new methods of protest tibetans 
might use 
last week an official at the provincial office of tibet reported 
scattered cases of rock throwing by tibetans defying martial law 
hu said the riots were the most violent since protests against 
nearly four decades of communist rule began in september 1987 
in fridays report the peoples daily said the demonstrators 
concentrated their attacks on government and party buildings police 
stations and facilities belonging to the staterun news media 
twentyfour government and party buildings 99 private 
chineseowned businesses more than 20 automobilies scores of 
bicycles and threewheeled motorcars were destroyed in the riots 
the report said 
the martial law has led to fears that china will adopt an even 
harder line toward the remote mountainous region but hu was quoted 
as saying tibet would be reopened to foreign tourists once martial 
law was lifted 
martial law was ordered after three days of protests began march 
5 leaving 16 dead and about 100 people injured by official count 
tibetans said that between 20 and 30 people died 
the march protests came as tibetans tried to commemorate the one 
year anniversary of an antichinese clash with police that left an 
estimated 24 people dead 
beijing claims that tibet has been part of china since the 13th 
century tibetans contend their homeland was independent for most of 
that time 
the goals of the protests have been to express four decades of 
anger over what is perceived as alien rule and possibly win outside 
support independence remains a vague concept among the protesters 
who call simply for the return of the dalai lama to power

next week and democrats will push to make military cuts equal to 
domestic spending cuts in fiscal 1990 the chairman of the house 
budget committee said friday 
rep leon panetta dcalif following a negotiating session with 
white house representatives said the two sides talked about 
president bushs plan to increase military spending but freeze 
domestic programs to meet the deficit targets of the grammrudman 
law 
i made the point that from a congressional point of view 
grammrudman has established the principle that you get equal 
amounts out of defense and nondefense panetta said 
richard darman the director of the presidents office of 
management and budget declined to comment on fridays meeting 
panetta said he and senate budget committee chairman jim sasser 
dtenn planned to work together in drafting a democratic budget 
proposal in addition to the balance between domestic and military 
spending cuts panetta said he wants new revenues to equal the 
overall spending cuts 
were going to start exchanging offers and the direction im 
heading in is basically to do dollar for dollar he said 
in addition to the white housecongressional budget talks friday 
sasser convened his committee on friday to officially begin drafting 
a budget in parallel to the talks with the administration he and 
other committee members pointed out the insistent demands for new 
federal spending for cleaning up nuclear plants bailing out 
savings and loans education health care defense and a wide swath 
of other programs 
the overwhelming impression is a radical mismatch between the 
ends most of us acknowledge and the means we have at our disposal 
for reaching them sasser said 
sen james exon dneb and several other members of the 
committee expressed frustration that despite claims it would turn 
things around the deficit has begun going up again under 
grammrudman 
the grammrudman law reduces deficit and not deficit 
estimates he said

the soviet government friday expanded the right to 
trade with foreigners from about 100 ministries and state 
enterprises to virtually all businesses in the country the official 
news agency tass reported 
the decree is a major deregulation in a country in which contact 
with foreigners was strictly limited until a few years ago and still 
causes police scrutiny in some locations 
the move had been expected since the council of ministers 
announced in december that it would act to expand exports by spring 
even cooperatives the private businesses which share that 
profits among their members are permitted to trade 
foreign currency is still strictly controlled and businesses 
that earn convertible currency expect it to be heavily taxed the 
ruble is not convertible and the soviet union urgently needs foreign 
cash to buy western technology 
authorities are planning to allow soviet businesses to buy 
convertible currency like dollars in a sealedbid auction said 
alexander i potyomkin of the foreign economic bank however so far 
he has had trouble finding organizations willing to sell their 
foreign currency 
businessmen are watching for this auction with great curiosity 
as they expect a rate of 6 to 7 rubles to the dollar would be 
necessary to draw sellers the official exchange rate is 10 times 
that at 6224 rubles per dollar 
traders will still operate under considerable uncertainty 
because tass said the ministry for external economic relations is 
being empowered to limit imports and exports of specific goods as it 
sees fit

a 900yearold tower collapsed onto a square 
friday killing two people injuring 25 and damaging an adjacent 
cathedral rescue workers pulled three people from the rubble 
none of those treated at the san matteo hospital in the northern 
italian town of pavia were injured seriously doctors said 
experts said the 255foot tower crumbled either because of 
natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or because 
of a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the water 
table 
shortly before the thick walls toppled several rocks fell from 
the top prompting passersby in the square to flee authorities 
said 
the toll could have been higher without that warning said a 
spokeswoman for mayor sandro bruni 
she said there had been no signs indicating the tower was in 
danger of collapsing but added that experts had recently checked to 
see if it needed restoration the dead were identified as 
52yearold giuseppina casella whose newspaper stand was buried by 
the bricks and giulio fontana 62 
after the collapse firefighters frantically dug through a pile 
of rubble at least 30 feet high and eventually pulled out two men 
and a woman 
the red bricks that fell on the downtown square buried several 
parked cars and damaged several shops and one building 
the 501yearold duomo cathedral partly designed by donato 
bramante also suffered substantial damage 
bramante introduced a style of architecture combining renaissance 
ideas with experimentation that came to be known as the high 
renaissance style which influenced european architecture for 300 
years 
he is best known for the design for st peters basilica 
pavia archbishop giovanni volta said that the baptistery of the 
duomo cathedral and one arch of the church were cracked in fridays 
disaster 
residents were evacuated from two old buildings near the 
collapsed tower 
its the collapse something due to age which cannot be 
predicted said maria antonietta abrate an official of the local 
government office for protection of monuments its typical of 
ancient towers it also happened to the belltower of venice 
in 1902 the 1000yearold st mark bell tower in venice 
collapsed without warning causing no injuries a worldwide 
fundraising drive raised enough money to build a replica completed 
in 1912 
pavia 20 miles southwest of milan is rich with medieval art and 
architecture and is called the city of the 100 towers 
it was founded in 568 by the german tribe of the longobards 
italys most famous tower the leaning tower of pisa has long 
been judged in danger of collapsing although not in the immediate 
future

his conviction in the 1968 killing of a sheriffs deputy was 
released from prison on parole friday after serving 14 years 
gary mcgivern whose release had been supported by a group of 
celebrities waved and said its nice to be out reported

woodstock who led the battle to free him 
culp attracted support from wellknown people including folk 
singer pete seeger conservative columnist william f buckley and 
liberal lawyer william kunstler 
however their 1978 prison marriage isnt legally recognized in 
new york state because he was serving a life term at the time for 
contract purposes lifers are considered to be legally dead and thus 
cannot marry 
prosecutors said mcgivern and codefendant charles culhane were 
involved in a 1968 escape attempt while being driven to a court 
appearance in which a westchester county deputy was killed the 
prosecution said mcgivern fired the shot that killed the deputy 
mcgivern and culhane have steadfastly maintained that a third 
inmate in the car robert bowerman was the only one involved in the 
escape attempt and that he shot the deputy bowerman also was killed 
a second deputy in the car survived and testified that mcgivern 
and culhane were involved in the escape attempt 
mcgivern and culhane were tried three times for the deputys 
murder the first trial ended in a hung jury convictions in the 
second trial were overturned on appeal they were convicted again in 
1975 
culhane wont be eligible for parole until late 1991 cuomo has 
refused to grant him clemency

bids at an unlikely auction site this week fermilab the only us 
atomsmashing facility with a herd of the proud beasts 
while scientists rammed highenergy atomic particles into each 
other underground in the worlds most powerful accelerator farmers 
and ranchers from illinois and five other states on thursday placed 
bids from a flatbed truck for 64 animals being sold so fermilab 
could thin its herd before spring calving 
i knew it was going to be a good sale and it was said dan 
shepherd president of the national buffalo association and owner of 
320 of the animals at his farm in clifton hill mo

buffalo business on a breakeven basis for about 20 years

fermilabs herd normally comprising about 80 animals at the labs 
90acre site 40 miles southwest of chicago he said

its a very healthy meat very low in cholesterol he said 
and its very good meat 
contrary to popular belief the bison is no longer an endangered 
species about 120000 of them live in the united states up from 
around 1000 at the turn of the century shepherd said 
its an alternative agriculture the buffalo business has been 
pretty good to us over the years its been a solid moneymaker

making sure the computers and control jets were ready for the trip 
home 
unlike most previous flights discoverys reentry will not go 
through the eerie radio blackout that has occurred when a shuttle is 
descending through the atmosphere 
the blackout which used to last about 15 minutes occurs when a 
spacecraft generates heat during its reentry ionizing atoms that 
form a layer of electrically charged gas around the shuttle the 
layer blocks radio transmissions between the orbiter and the ground 
but with the help of a 100 million communications satellite 
deployed during the first postchallenger flight last fall briscoe 
said ground controllers contact with the shuttle should be 
interrupted only about three minutes 
instead of trying to send radio messages straight to the ground 
the shuttle can send them to the satellite more than 20000 miles 
above earth which relays them to the ground 
the satellite was first used in december during a classified 
defense department mission by shuttle atlantis the second mission 
since the challenger disaster it had a blackout of only about three 
minutes briscoe said 
although controllers dont plan to communicate with discovery 
during the traditional blackout time the ability is there in case a 
problem occurs or if they wants the orbiter to land on a different 
runway at edwards he said 
if winds saturday morning are 1417 mph mission control would 
like discovery to land on the dry lakebed to determine how the 
shuttle handles under higher winds but if the winds arent strong 
enough the shuttle will land on a concrete runway to test its new 
brake system briscoe said the forecast makes the runway landing 
more likely he said 
a final decision will be made about an hour before coats and 
blaha fire two powerful rockets on the back of the shuttle to slow 
the spacecraft and allow it to drop into the earths atmosphere 
the other crew members are james f buchli robert c springer 
and dr james m bagian a physician 
discovery the first of seven shuttle missions planned this year 
rocketed into orbit monday after being delayed for about two hours 
because of the weather the flight is the third since the challenger 
explosion killed its seven astronauts more than three years ago 
several hours after blastoff the crew completed its primary 
mission deployment of a 100 million communications satellite that 
completes a network nasa can use to communicate with shuttles and 
other satellites nearly all the time 
on tuesday the crew had to turn off unnecessary lights and 
computers because of concern about erratic pressure readings from a 
hydrogen tank that helps provide electricity to the orbiter but the 
shuttle was back on full power the next day after engineers 
corrected the problem 
among the scientific experiments on board discovery are four rats 
and 32 fertilized chicken eggs two projects designed by students 
the end of the mission also will be the end for the four rats 
which will be killed shortly after touchdown so researchers can 
determine how their intentionally cut legs healed in space 
but the eggs housed in an incubator on the shuttle will be 
allowed to hatch to see if embryos can develop normally in space 
discoverys astronauts will return with nearly three miles of 
film shot with a 70mm imax camera the crew captured views of 
pollution patterns in the oceans floods in africa burned areas of 
the florida everglades and western united states and erupting 
volcanoes in south america and southeast asia 
during an interview friday morning on the today show on nbc 
buchli said the scale and scope of air pollution is much more 
dramatic as seen from orbit 
what were trying to do is get some evidence and documentation 
to bring back and show people just how much we are dumping into the 
atmosphere and perhaps get a feel how that might affect us in future 
generations he said 
the imax film will be edited to create a study of the 
environmental wounds man has inflicted on the earth 
other experiments on discovery include a group of plants grown in 
space to test the effects of weightlessness on root growth a 
protein crystal growth study using 19 different proteins and a 
device called the heat pipe which is a type of cooling system being 
tested for use on the space station

the state department accused a soviet official 
on friday of attempting to rewrite history with charges that the 
united states and pakistan are prolonging the war in afghanistan 
there is no doubt in anyones mind about the origin of the 
current conflict and the difficulties in afghanistan today the 
soviets occupied and invaded afghanistan said spokesman charles 
e redman 
hes trying to rewrite history redman said of comments made 
in kabul by the soviet ambassador yuli vorontsov 
vorontsov called the united states tremendously immoral for 
continuing to supply arms to the afghan rebels who are opposing the 
sovietbacked government of afghan leader najib 
the soviet official also charged that the united states and 
pakistan were risking a wider war in the region because of their 
support for the afghan guerrilla attack on the city of jalalabad 
the guerrillas have moved on jalalabad located some 85 miles 
east of kabul in the hopes of advancing on the capital city 
although the soviets completed the withdrawal of their troops in 
midfebruary a major new soviet arms airlift began last week 
redman asserted that new shipments of heavy artillery rockets 
have been made and that they are being used to terrorize the 
afghan people 
redman also accused the soviet ambassador of attempting to 
intimidate pakistan with his comments he said the soviets should 
know that pakistan has our full support in this situation 
the spokesman said he could not quantify us support for the 
rebels 
our position has always been that our support for the 
resistance the mujahedeen was firm and that we would do what was 
necessary and id just leave it at that redman said

a brilliant trio of hungarian chess playing 
sisters led by judit polgar the highest ranked 12yearold player 
in history are poised to break into the highest levels of a game 
dominated by male grandmasters 
in november judit became the youngest player to recieve the 
title of international master an award gained by bobby fischer and 
the current world champion garri kasparov when they were 14 
last month 14yearold zsofi polgar rocked the chess world with 
a startling victory in an international open tournament in rome 
zsofi previously considered the weakest player of the three 
amassed a remarkable eight victories and one draw against a field of 
top soviet and western grandmasters 
the polgars represent the spirit of mozart in chess they have 
a pure talent which i once thought very incorrectly was reserved 
only for male players said larry parr the former editor of chess 
life who now edits the new yorkbased magazine glasnost 
what does all this mean garri kasparov may soon find out 
parr said 
on sunday judit zsofi and szusza 19 will begin play in the 
new york open considered by experts as north americas most 
prestigious annual competition 
in the tournament scheduled to end march 28 at the penta hotel 
facing madison square garden the top section includes more than 40 
grandmasters facing off for the 18000 first prize with additional 
contests for amateurs the 165000 event is expected to attract 
1000 players 
it was at last years competition that judit achieved her first 
international master result since then a series of stunning 
victories has made her the 54th ranked player in the world 
the only player who ever improved so fast in just a year was 
bobby fischer between the age of 14 and 15 said jose cuchi the 
tournaments organizer 
the rise of the polgars is the result of a remarkable experiment 
instituted by their parents laszlo asnd klara who fought pressure 
from east bloc officials and gained the right to educate their 
children at home 
the polgars say children are capable of learning far more than 
conventional educational methods will allow they believe that for 
the best possible results specialization should begin early 
from the age of five each sister has been immersed in the study 
of languages when szusza who achieved her first grandmaster 
performance last summer chose chess over mathematics her sisters 
followed suit 
chess has already taken the family to more than 20 countries 
should the girls realize their potential they are likely to make 
millions 
the girls retain a keen interest in pop stars such as michael 
jackson and dianna ross and enjoy table tennis in jeans and 
sneakers they look like any teenagers 
i used to see judit running around just like any other kids 
but when she plays chess she could be a 50yearold grandmaster 
cuchi said 
in rome zsofi was the only one who competed cheered on on by 
her sisters who enjoyed a nonplaying holiday 
after 14 tournaments in 1988 it was time for a rest said 
judit 
no woman has yet competed successfully against leading male 
grandmasters men and women play for separate world titles and have 
segregated ranking lists 
laszlo polgar believes such artificial divisions hold women back 
the family generally shuns womenonly competitions but broke ranks 
once to lead the hungarian womens team to victory over the soviets 
in last years chess olympiad in salonica greece 
they are a tremendous inspiration said innsa izrailov a 
member of the american womens chess team not just in chess but 
in all other areas where women are competing intellectually with 
men

a court on friday convicted and sentenced a team of 
hijackers who kidnapped a busload of schoolchildren in the soviet 
union and traded them for drugs money and a flight to israel tass 
said 
the supreme court of the russian republic found four hijackers 
guilty of banditry and illegally crossing the soviet border it 
sentenced the ringleader pavel yakshiyants to 15 years 
imprisonment and three others to 14 years each 
tass said one of the three vladimir muravlev flew into 
hysterics when the sentence was read out it took a 10minute 
break to restore him to a state of relative calm 
according to tass a fifth defendant tofy dzhafarov did not 
take part in the hijacking but was found guilty of being an 
accomplice and was given a threeyear sentence 
the four hijackers commandeered a bus holding 30 fourthgraders 
and their teacher as it left a field trip to a printing plant in the 
caucasus city of ordzhonikidze on dec 1 they traded the children 
and teacher for drugs a large amount of foreign currency and 
finally for an ilyushin 76 transport plane and safe passage to 
israel on dec 2 
israel allowed the plane to land but deported the hijackers the 
next day 
the incident led to close cooperation between israel and the 
soviet union which have had no diplomatic relations since the 
soviets broke them following the 1967 middle east war 
soviet officials have said most of the hijackers had criminal 
records and that the hijacking was not motivated by their politics

fixedrate home mortgages currently are 
averaging 1098 percent their highest level since october 1987 and 
adjustablerate mortgages are at their highest point in more than 
three years the federal home loan mortgage corp reported friday 
according to freddie macs weekly national survey this weeks 
average for fixedrate mortgages was up from 1086 percent last week 
to the highest level since rates averaged 1136 percent in the week 
ending oct 23 1987 
on oneyear adjustablerate mortgages meanwhile lenders were 
asking an average initial rate of 902 percent this week the 
highest since they hit 909 percent on jan 17 1986 the arm rate 
was up from 893 percent last week 
the federal reserve board for a year has been nudging up interest 
rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus keep 
inflation in check 
housing construction hit a postrecession peak in 1986 and has 
been sliding since then although most economists say the industry 
remains healthy as it weathers a controlled slowdown 
analysts are forecasting a further decline in the housing market 
this year as the higher interest rates start to pinch and the 
economy begins to cool down 
housing construction was down 114 percent in february the 
government reported on thursday with analysts attributing the 
decline in part to an expected fallback after a warmweather surge 
in january but also to the bite of rising interest rates 
were looking for a modest decline of housing market activity 
due not only to somewhat higher mortgage rates but also due to the 
fact that the economy is slowing said economist richard peach of 
the mortgage bankers association 
peach said the effects of higher interest rates on the housing 
market so far have been minor but are likely to increase in future 
months 
economist michael sumichrast who publishes a newsletter on the 
housing industry maintained the feds tight money policy already 
was having a negative impact on construction and sales 
there has been an outcry of frustration about the federal 
reserve board tightening up he said we are going to get into a 
recession on housing unless the fed eases up 
the rise in adjustablerate mortgages is particularly troubling 
since many homebuyers have relied on the lower initial rates offered 
with arms to break into the housing market sumichrast said

a federal judge said friday he would issue a 
temporary order to delay 135 timber sales planned by the us forest 
service because of the battle over protecting old growth trees and a 
rare owl an attorney said 
the order affects about 1 billion board feet of timber or about 
onefifth of the forest services total annual timber sales in the 
northwest said john lowe deputy regional forester for the us 
forest service in portland ore 
todd true an attorney with the sierra club legal defense fund 
said us district judge william dwyer told him by phone that the 
order would be in effect until thursday when environmental groups 
will again seek an injunction to stop sales of oldgrowth 
the issue pits environmentalists trying to preserve sections of 
virgin forest and the spotted owl which nests only in dense 
oldgrowth forest against loggers who say their jobs are at stake 
earlier this week dwyer denied a request by nine environmental 
groups for an injunction to stop forest service sales of oldgrowth 
timber 
but true said the judge invited us to address particular sales 
and thats what we are doing here our concerns are the same as they 
have always been with the preservation of the ecosystem and the 
owl 
we have filed this case to protect the oldgrowth forest and 
the spotted owl one of the inhabitants of that forest which faces 
an imminent risk of extinction true said 
the basis of seeking an injunction against these sales is to 
protect 18000 acres of owl habitat in the next 60 days said true 
true said 53 sales in the next 60 days are not covered by the 
order he said those sales covered small parcels of forests but he 
did not know the acreage affected 
the assistant manager of the washington contract loggers 
association said he was not surprised by the action 
bill pickell said its just another ploy by the preservationist 
to put a stop to the industry 
pickell said he believes the industry will prevail because the 
spotted owl is not in danger of extinction 
i think weve got all the facts theyve got the emotion 
said pickell 
true said the forest service has hundreds of thousands of acres 
of forest service land that is not owl habitat

president bush said friday hes had a pulse 
change in his views on gun control that was reflected in the 
administrations decision this week to ban the importation of most 
semiautomatic weapons 
bush speaking with reporters on air force one as he flew here 
from colorado said that the national debate over assault weapons 
like the ak47 had gotten a little bit too hot 
well make our decisions in a cool way we wont be swayed 
by the temper of the debate he said 
bush said that the decision to limit imports of five models of 
semiautomatic weapons represents a heightened concern on my part 
about ak47s but that he is not prepared at this point to move 
beyond that action 
we have to find an accommodation between the police and the 
sporting interests bush said 
meanwhile a spokesman for the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms said the government may ban imports of additional kinds of 
semiautomatic weapons 
the bureau is still reviewing the uses of all types of imported 
semiautomatics but has not reached a decision on whether to suspend 
importation of more models than the five types banned from import 
this week said jerry rudden a spokesman for the agency 
the process is ongoing additional firearms may very well be 
added to the list large numbers of firearms are being looked 
at he said 
national rifle association lobbyist wayne lapierre met with 
bushs chief of staff john sununu on thursday but an aide to 
sununu said lapierre did not push to block an expansion of the ban 
to more weapons models 
asked if the import ban which does not affect sale of usmade 
weapons was a change of position on gun control bush held his 
hand up to his wrist and said its a pulse change 
he voiced support for the decision this week of a us firearms 
manufacturer colt to impose voluntary restraints on its production 
of semiautomatic weapons 
im certainly not going to differ with that decision he said 
bush said he could understand the emotionally charged nature of 
the debate on guns i can understand when kids are shot down by 
semiautomatic weapons i can certainly understand the public 
outcry 
when asked whether he was looking at further steps bush said 
well well let you know 
bush also said 
that no decision has been made on a proposed joint venture 
with the japanese for production in japan of a new version of the 
f16 jet fighter he sought to play down earlier suggestions that a 
basic commitment had been made to the project with only details 
remaining to be worked out 
he was saddened that hostage terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press was beginning his fifth year 
of captivity in lebanon but said that wouldnt lead to any change 
or reformulation in us policy on hostages the fact that anderson 
and others remain held against their will is with me every single 
waking hour bush said

more than 15 million fisherprice car safety 
seats for children are being recalled by the manufacturer because 
they do not meet federal flammability standards the national 
highway traffic safety administration said friday 
the agency said it had received no complaints of fires or fire 
injuries from the seats which are models 9100 and 9101 manufactured 
from 1985 to 1989 
the companys own tests discovered that the foam seat pad used in 
the two models burns faster than federal standards permit nhtsa 
said 
since the pad cover does meet standards motorists should 
continue to use the seats until they get replacement pads and 
should not return them to stores the agency said 
fisherprice will notify owners who returned warranty cards and 
will mail displays on the recall to pediatricians 
owners of the affected seats may call a fisherprice hotline

a leading soviet sociologist on friday said 1989 is 
a critical year for president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms because 
empty store shelves have damaged peoples faith that things will 
change 
1989 will be a crucial year for perestroika said tatyana 
zaslavskaya it is necessary to begin implementing promises 
expectations are high 
ms zaslavskaya is a leading theorist of reform efforts and heads 
the soviet public opinion center her comments at a news conference 
came a day after the communist party central committee approved a 
farm reform to counter urgent food shortages 
gorbachev embarked on his reform program upon taking power in 
1985 and ms zaslavskaya said enthusiasm for the program reached a 
peak in 1987 however since then we are witnessing a 
deterioration the most important factor is the supply in the 
shops she said 
intellectuals still strongly support the reform effort because it 
has provided a freer atmosphere for public discussion art and 
literature but workers are more interested in their standard of 
living and polling data indicates most believe they are worse off 
she said 
gorbachevs measures include a major drive to make staterun 
enterprises pay their own way rather than count on state subsidies 
some experts say subsidies discourage producers from manufacturing 
the cheap consumer goods that are in high demand 
the soviet people the russian people have a lot of patience 
but some results are needed ms zaslavskaya said the worst 
thing is when the people become indifferent without the people you 
cannot go ahead 
ms zaslavskaya said to heal its stagnating economy the soviet 
union must enact broad price reforms including eliminating many 
heavy subsidies on retail prices but any such changes must wait two 
or three years she said 
if there is a price reform now it will harm perestroika 
gorbachevs economic restructuring plan ms zaslavskaya said 
in present conditions it would create a social uproar she said 
some workers also are concerned about reforms that tie wages to 
productivity ms zaslavskaya said 
a considerable number of people working at factories and plants 
for an average wage produce shoddy goods at a leisurely pace she 
said 
the soviet central committee on thursday adopted an agriculture 
program it says will improve food supplies by the mid1990s 
the program depends largely on giving farmers the right to take 
longterm leases on staterun land and decide what to plant 
gorbachev sharply criticized the soviet farm system and told the 
central committee that the inability of state and collective farms 
to feed the country was leading to social discontent

consumer advocate ralph nader on friday 
denounced a proposed 30 percent pay raise for federal judges and 
criticized chief justice william h rehnquist for leading the drive 
for higher pay 
rehnquists warning that the current pay levels are a serious 
threat to the judiciary is among the most exaggerated remarks ever 
uttered by a chief justice nader said 
he said few judges are leaving the bench and current pay is no 
barrier to attracting talented law school professors and the vast 
majority of lawyers who make less than federal judges 
less than 1 percent of federal judges have resigned since 1974 
because of the pay or any other reason nader added 
thats too low an attrition rate given the number of judges who 
are indolent or less than competent he said you would want a 
higher attrition rate actually 
rehnquist made a highly unusual personal appeal wednesday for a 
pay hike calling the current situation the most serious threat to 
the future of the judiciary and its continued operations that i have 
observed 
court personnel said the only other instances in which justices 
have held news conferences in the supreme court building were to 
announce their retirement 
nader said rehnquist has lent his prestige to a pretty mundane 
lobbying effort unsupported by evidence 
the chief justice has a right to speak out nader said but 
he is not being held to a standard of proof that supports hardship 
claims 
rehnquist proposed increasing annual salaries for federal trial 
judges from 89500 to 116350 and from 95000 to 123000 for 
appeals court judges the plan would hike the chief justices yearly 
pay from 115000 to 149500 and raise the salary of other high 
court justices from 110000 to 143000 
congress on feb 7 rejected a 51 percent pay hike for itself 
federal judges and highranking government officials 
nader said rehnquists remark that federal judges require higher 
pay so theyll be able to educate their kids is the essence of 
elitism 
nader said if rehnquist is correct then president bush should 
declare a national economic emergency for all parents whose pay is 
less than 90000 a year 
nader also disputed rehnquists assertion that judicial salaries 
are not keeping pace with inflation 
more than half the federal judges were appointed since 1979 and 
their pay raises since then exceed the inflation rate nader said 
he also said the anger of judges who see young lawyers being paid 
more than them is misdirected 
why are these young lawyers paid so much nader said 
because of billing abuses by the big corporate law firms that 
employ them

the agriculture department is imposing a 
farranging federal quarantine affecting 19 states and other areas 
to help stop the spread of tiny parasitic mites that threaten the 
honeybee industry 
officials said the proposed quarantine would also be effective in 
the district of columbia and 15 us territories or other 
possessions known or believed to be infested with the varroa mite 
we are proposing to quarantine all states where varroa mites 
are known to occur said al strating acting administrator of the 
departments animal and health inspection service 
in addition because honeybees have been shipped from infested 
areas to commercial and hobbyist beekeepers throughout the united 
states we would preventively quarantine all states that have not 
conducted varroa mite detection surveys he said this action 
would make possible the identification and containment of varroa 
mite infestations 
states listed in the proposal which was announced on thursday 
include alaska california colorado florida georgia illinois 
indiana iowa maine massachusetts nebraska new hampshire new 
york north dakota ohio pennsylvania south dakota wisconsin and 
wyoming 
other areas include american samoa baker island guam howland 
island jarvis island johnston atoll kingman reef midway islands 
navassa island northern mariana islands palmyra atoll puerto 
rico republic of palau us virgin islands and wake island 
strating said the regulations would restrict the interstate 
movement of honeybees and bee equipment from quarantined areas such 
articles would have to undergo inspection andor treatement before 
being allowed to move across state lines 
varroa mites were discovered in the united states in a wisconsin 
apiary in september 1987 a quarantine was imposed in april 1988 but 
canceled after a month because it was too complex to administer 
meetings among federal and state authorities beekeepers crop 
producers and researchers were held to develop the new proposed 
rules 
the varroa mite is an external parasite of adult honeybees and 
their developing larvae or brood infestations cause decreased 
brood numbers deformed bees and weaken the bees ability to 
pollinate plants and produce honey 
honeybees are used to pollinate a number of crops valued by usda 
at up to 20 billion annually besides their value as honey 
producers 
the proposal will be open for public comment until march 31 
strating said comments on the proposal docket no 89002 may be 
sent in triplicate to helene r wright chief regulatory analysis

as 5000 high school guidance counselors and mental 
health workers convene in boston this week many are talking about a 
problem that isnt going away teen suicide 
i saw five suicidal kids in a twoweek period said rhonda 
chambers a baton rouge la guidance counselor sometimes i just 
tell them i love them 
suicide is the second leading cause of death in americans ages 11 
to 24 said david capuzzi a specialist in suicide prevention at 
portland state university in oregon a young person attempts suicide 
every 90 seconds and one in 60 succeeds he said 
capuzzis lecture which attracted more than 80 people was one 
of six on teen suicide in a fourday conference of the american 
association for counseling and development 
susan virenius a middle school counselor from st louis mich 
told of the eighthgrader who recently shot himself in the shoulder 
while babysitting another child she considered it a suicide 
warning but said getting troubled adolescents help isnt always 
easy 
counseling in my area is 75 an hour virenius said so the 
rich have accessibiity and the poor go without the only way they 
can get help is to get in trouble with the law 
capuzzi said he has helped school districts in 23 states set up 
suicide prevention programs including one at a montana school where 
17 youngsters committed suicide in 11 months 
theyre doing better but many are not even started capuzzi 
said 
he urges school districts to train all the adults not just 
teachers and counselors to recognize signs of trouble since 
students sometimes decide to confide in a sympathetic cafeteria 
worker or bus driver he also tells schools to make sure before 
they broach the subject with students that help is immediately 
available for those who come forward 
adolescents once they make up their mind usually act within 
24 to 72 hours so you cant wait he said 
he also advised schools not to use materials that show actual 
suicide attempts or methods 
doing a presentation wont precipitate suicide in someone who 
isnt suicidal but if you have a suicidal adolescent in a group and 
dont know it and show them how to do it that may be all they 
need he said 
guidance counselors said signs that a teenagers may be 
contemplating suicide are commonplace and can range from depression 
and sudden behavioral changes to reckless driving drinking bouts 
and giving away prized possessions virenius said she recently has 
seen youngsters carve their initials into their arms cut themselves 
or burn themselves with cigarettes 
drugs and alcohol confusion over sexual identity and above all 
family problems are the most common causes of trouble counselors 
said 
you can say i love you but if you cant communicate it in a 
way that it means something to me it doesnt help virenius said

solidarity said friday that draft 
legislation the government sent to parliament violates commitments 
made to the opposition in negotiations on political and economic 
reform 
the outlawed independent union called it a serious crisis in 
the talks which began feb 6 the government said it sent the bills 
to the sejm or parliament only so discussion by the deputies could 
begin 
we have to express deep fear and concern solidarity national 
spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz told a news conference 
government and opposition delegates to the round table talks 
agreed to hold the first fully democratic elections in the communist 
bloc for a new senate and to open up 35 percent of the sejm to the 
independent opposition whose candidates would participate in 
elections 
they also agreed that solidarity and other banned groups would be 
made legal again and a strong presidency would be created 
presumably to be filled by gen wojciech jaruzelski the communist 
party chief 
after all these debates we thought that we had reached an 
agreement on certain things that are not reflected in the draft sent 
to the sejm onyszkiewicz said but the draft legislation puts 
all of the decisions of the round table under a question mark 
the talks at the round table find themselves in a serious 
crisis he said we want to express our anxiety over how the 
talks will end at the moment the impasse is very deep 
government spokesman jerzy urban said friday night he was 
surprised at this dramatizing of the situation 
perhaps nerves fail my colleague or perhaps it is negotiating 
tactics he said in a statement carried by the official news 
agency pap 
urban said the laws were sent to the parliament so deputies 
could discuss them at the same time as the debate at the round 
table nothing is prejudged either at the round table or at the 
sejm 
onyszkiewicz would not go into detail about problems with the 
draft legislation but noted that it went to the sejm before 
specifics of the law creating the senate and presidency were 
discussed in the talks 
he also said the draft lacked an agreedupon provision that each 
candidate in parliamentary elections to ensure fairness would have 
the right to a representative on the votecounting commission 
if the authorities go ahead with the draft law on electoral 
procedure the senate and the presidency the entire contract may be 
broken he said 
the government said friday the parliament would meet next week 
for the first reading of constitutional amendments creating the 
presidency and senate election procedures for the sejm and senate 
a law on forming associations another on trade unions and trade 
unions for farmers 
all the laws have been discussed in the negotiations which are 
supposed end working sessions tuesday in hopes of a final plenary 
session and signing of a social contract april 3

a prosecutor says he has gathered overwhelming 
evidence against an alleged police killer right down to the piece 
of chicken the suspect was eating before the shooting but the trial 
may never take place because detectives lied to obtain a search 
warrant 
on monday suffolk superior court judge charles grabau is 
scheduled to hold a hearing to decide whether albert lewin 33 will 
be charged in the shooting of a boston detective during a raid on a 
drug dealers apartment 13 months ago 
the detective 36yearold sherman griffiths was felled by a 
bullet that pierced the apartments steelreinforced door as members 
of bostons elite antidrug task force prepared to break it down 
grabau dismissed the original charges against lewin two weeks ago 
after detectives failed to produce a potential defense witness the 
informant who supposedly led them to the apartment where the 
shooting took place 
in a remarkable turnabout in their story the three detectives 
under pressure from the prosecutor filed affidavits monday 
admitting that the informant they called john never existed 
assistant district attorney francis omeara in asking grabau to 
change his mind and reinstate the charges said he will argue monday 
that the evidence against lewin is so overwhelming that the 
misconduct by police should not block the prosecution 
by the time the officers finally got into the apartment the 
killer had fled down a back stairway but the evidence that lewin 
had been in the apartment is strong said omeara 
ive got his fingerprints in there ive got his clothes in the 
closet ive got his cigarettes ive got his foot powder ive even 
got the piece of chicken that he was eating 20 minutes before the 
raid omeara said 
lewins defense attorney max stern contends that the 
detectives misconduct has permanently prevented his client from 
getting a fair trial 
the critical witnesses the police officers themselves have 
completely trumped themselves and the prosecutions case by their 
massive and repeated perjury in the case which they now admit to 
stern said they have lied so many times now that theres no way 
to put any faith in the reliability of anything they say 
according to the affidavit filed by the detectives to obtain a 
search warrant an informant named john told them that a 5foot 
6inch hispanic drug dealer named stevie was selling cocaine from 
the apartment 
from the beginning a key hole in the prosecutions case has been 
that lewin who is 6foot2 and jamaican clearly does not fit that 
description as a result defense attorneys requested last year that 
police produce john as a witness but the detectives said they could 
not find him 
under pressure from the district attorneys office which is 
investigating them for possible perjury detectives carlos a luna 
hugo r amate and paul g schroeder filed affidavits this week 
changing their story mark sullivan lunas attorney said the men 
admitted that john was not a real person but a composite of two 
informants 
christopher muse attorney for amate and schroeder says the 
detectives decided to come forward even though they may be 
implicating themselves for perjury because they want to see 
justice done in the murder of their partner 
prosecutors say they now believe that the real informant was not 
john but someone else and that stevie was merely a stock 
description of a typical boston drug dealer 
even though his case may be blown apart by the detectives 
admission that they lied omeara said he does not judge them 
harshly 
he said intense pressure from bostons political leaders and 
society as a whole to crack down on drug dealers forces good and 
decent young police officers into the ethical dilemma should i do 
it right and not get it done or should i do it a little wrong but 
get it done

afghan warplanes bombed moslem 
guerrilla positions outside the strategic afghan city of jalalabad 
and the insurgents claimed friday that government soldiers were 
among those killed in the attacks 
guerrillas claim more than 100 people may have been killed in 
latest fighting for afghanistans third largest city where the 
insurgents launched an offensive nearly two weeks ago the claim 
could not be independently confirmed 
radio stations controlled by two guerrilla groups based in 
pakistan said the bombardment thursday night occurred north east 
and south of jalalabad 
the casualties included civilians and combatants on both sides 
said quribar rehman saeed of the guerrillarun afghan news agency 
they were bombing so heavy they dont care about their own 
soldiers he said of the afghan pilots 
saeed said afghan soldiers died in the bombardment because the 
opposing forces were fighting at close quarters they are 
facetoface he said 
the soviet news agency tass on thursday quoted military officials 
in kabul the afghan capital as saying 4500 guerrillas have died 
and more than 2000 have been wounded since the insurgents launched 
their jalalabad offensive march 6 guerrilla spokesmen put their 
losses at 200 dead and 700 wounded 
the afghan military has not released its casualty figures 
the guerrillas reportedly captured jalalabads biggest garrison 
and penetrated the airport perimeter before the fighting reached a 
stalemate 
the jalalabad offensive is the first the guerrillas have launched 
since the soviets completed their troop withdrawal from afghanistan 
last month 
the fall of jalalabad 80 miles east of kabul and 40 miles from 
the pakistan border would be a major blow to the sovietbacked 
afghan government the city is strategic because it is on the main 
highway from pakistan to kabul 
soviet officials said they resumed airlifting arms and ammunition 
to kabul on wednesday in response to the guerrilla offensive 
elsewhere in afghanistan the afghan army claimed it killed 59 
guerrillas including two foreign military advisers in fighting in 
herat and kandahar provinces the soviet news agency tass reported 
today 
the report which did not say when the fighting occurred said 
the afghan army only lost four men 
moscow and kabul also accused pakistan of sending hundreds of its 
troops to help direct the onslaught by an estimated 14000 moslem 
guerrillas they also claimed pakistani troops were mobilizing male 
afghan refugees some just teenagers to join the fight 
pakistans foriegn ministry called the claims fictitious 
pakistan and the united states have been the insurgents primary 
military backers in their 11year war to establish an islamic 
republic of afghanistan 
afghanistan has complained repeatedly that pakistan has thousands 
of its military men backing up the guerrillas 
tass also quoted soviet ambassador to afghanistan yuli vorontsov 
on friday as saying afghanistans armed forces have shown since the 
soviet withdrawal that they are prepared and able to uphold by 
themselves without our military participation the countrys 
sovereignty 
the state department accused moscow of seeking to rewrite history 
after vorontsov said thursday that the united states is to blame for 
the fighting and that us support of the guerrillas is immoral 
vorontsovs charges are not going to cause the world community 
to forget that the soviets occupied and invaded afghanistan in 
1979 or the continuing soviet effort to prop up the discredited 
regime in kabul spokesman charles redman said in washington 
also friday an afghan guerrilla leader in iran said the 
resistance groups in pakistan should give greater recognition to the 
shiite moslem guerrillas in iran the official islamic republic news 
agency reported 
by ignoring the rights of shiites the afghan sunni groups have 
harmed the islamic revolution in afghanistan sheikh asef mohseni 
qandahari head of the islamic movement of afghanistan was quoted 
as saying 
on thursday the 46member organization of islamic conference 
voted to recognize the interim government formed in pakistan the 
iranianbased factions oppose the interim government saying they do 
not have enough representation

communist party general secretary zhao ziyang 
issued his strongest rebuff yet to increasingly vocal advocates of 
multiparty democracy and vowed in a speech published friday that the 
party will never be supplanted 
the speech was published on the eve of an annual legislative 
session expected to witness open calls by some delegates for 
democracy and an amnesty for political prisoners 
but zhao said china does not need opposition parties and upheaval 
will not be tolerated 
at present no one is satisfied with our backward condition but 
in my view we dont need a new prescription he told a party 
seminar the leadership of the communist party is in the interests 
of the entire nation china cannot adopt the western multiparty 
system 
the text of zhaos speech said to have been delivered in 
january filled the top half of national newspapers front pages and 
nearly a full page inside no explanation was given for the delay in 
its publication 
it was the strongest of several recent warnings by zhao and other 
senior officials on the need for political stability as they work to 
resolve thorny economic problems including 36 percent annual 
inflation 
however many intellectuals say china cannot solve its economic 
problems and develop a marketstyle economy unless it relaxes 
political controls 
xinhua the official news agency said friday the government 
appointed two members of democratic parties to viceministerial 
posts 
china has eight such parties all operating under orders from the 
communist party most of their 170000 members compared to 44 
million communists are aging intellectuals or former capitalists 
those appointed were li peiyao of the revolutionary committee of 
the chinese kuomintang in the labor ministry and hong fuzeng of the 
september 3rd society at the agriculture ministry 
several delegates to the 2796member national peoples congress 
chinas legislature said they will issue a call at the annual 
session that begins monday for an amnesty for prisoners of 
conscience 
more than 100 intellectuals already have signed letters to the 
congress calling for such an amnesty especially for wei jingsheng 
wei was sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in prison for 
counterrevolutionary activities 
but a judge tang zhanyun quashed any hopes for such an amnesty 
on friday the official xinhua news agency quoted tang as saying 
weis sentence was just the agency also quoted tang as denying 
china has political or ideological prisoners 
zhao did not mention wei or the petitions but his speech 
indicated authorities have no intention of letting the congress 
become a platform for critics of the regime 
those who dislike our party know there is no way from the 
outside to destroy or supplant us he said 
the party he said is the key to resolving every national 
problem and economic development cannot succeed without its 
leadership 
but he cautioned that corruption within the party has become a 
major problem and repeatedly called for tougher discipline against 
corrupt party members 
he also acknowledged conflicts within the party saying some 
members do not understand the necessity of current efforts to reduce 
central economic planning in favor of marketstyle reforms others 
he said want to move too fast 
in his speech zhao called for stepbystep change and emphasized 
that china will never reject socialism for capitalism although some 
private ownership is permitted public ownership must remain 
dominant he said 
some people compare china with developed nations and think 
socialism is no good zhao said but he rejected such comparisons 
saying china was starting from a lower level of development 
if you compare china with foreign capitalist countries at the 
same level of development there is none that doesnt have gaps 
between rich and poor social unrest and political upheaval he 
said

more than 50000 moslems left mosques 
and marched throughout the capital friday before gathering at the 
governments headquarters to demand the death of author salman 
rushdie 
also friday about 3000 moslem fundamentalists in sudan some 
shouting down down with britain demanded that sudan break 
relations with the british government which has defended publication 
of rushdies book the satanic verses 
in malaysia the government banned the march 13 issue of newsweek 
magazine and the march 9 issues of the hong kongbased far eastern 
economic review for printing extracts from the book 
many moslems find the book blasphemous because it suggests the 
prophet mohammed wrote the koran instead of receiving it from god 
and because its characters include prostitutes who take the names of 
mohammeds wives 
several countries including bangladesh and malaysia have banned 
the book and iran has offered 52 million to any moslem who kills 
rushdie an indianborn briton of moslem upbringing 
marchers in dhaka chanted we will kill rushdie and gathered 
near the secretariat the headquarters of the government several 
hundred policemen in riot gear followed the marchers but there was 
no violence 
more than 15000 followers of jamaateislami a fundamentalist 
moslem party held another rally in front of the citys main mosque 
and religious leaders accused zionists of conspiring against islam 
and its prophet mohammed 
seven of the countrys top religious leaders have called for a 
nationwide general strike on tuesday to protest the book 
a youth organization has set up a 15member death squad to kill 
rushdie if he comes to bangladesh the group is led by farooq ahmed 
who said the squad had no plans to go to london to kill rushdie who 
is in hiding somewhere in britain 
the demonstrators in the sudanese capital khartoum urged the 
government to break relations with britain and boycott all its goods 
the protest led by the fundamenalist national islamic front is 
seen as the partys first sign of opposition to prime minister sadek 
mahdi 
mahdi is in the process of forming a new broadbased government 
that would start talks with sudans southern rebels to end the 
6yearold civil war 
the national islamic front has said it will not join the new 
government because negotiations and a peace treaty with the rebel 
sudan peoples liberation army would mean a suspension of the 
islamic sharia law 
malaysias deputy home affairs minister megat junid megat ayub 
told reporters the newsweek and far eastern economic review issues 
were banned because the contents would have a deterimental effect on 
moslems whose faith is the official religion 
the malaysian home affairs ministry must receive a copy of all 
incoming foreign publications including newspapers sometimes 
articles or parts of articles are blackened out and occasionally the 
entire issue is banned

the senate reacting to a controversial chicago 
art exhibit approved on a 970 vote thursday a bill expanding 
federal law against desecration of the flag to include placing it on 
the floor or on the ground 
i dont know much about art but i know desecration when i see 
it senate republican leader bob dole rkan the measures 
sponsor said in a statement 
the move came in response to an exhibit by a student at the 
school of the art institute of chicago in which an american flag was 
displayed on the floor in a fashion that resulted in spectators 
standing on it 
what is the proper way to display the us flag is the name 
of the exhibit which for the last four weeks has brought throngs of 
angry demonstrators to march in front of the museum on michigan 
avenue in the heart of downtown chicago 
doles bill would expand existing law against flag desecration to 
include the words knowingly displayed on the floor or ground 
dole said the chicago display is not an appropriate use of this 
nations symbol of freedom our flag 
quite frankly it shows direspect and contempt for our flag 
and should be expressly prohibited by law he said 
the controversy followed last years furor over an art institute 
students painting of the late mayor harold washington wearing 
womens garments 
emotions ran so high at that time that one alderman stormed into 
the museum and ripped down the portrait of washington much beloved 
among black chicagoans and members of the citys independent 
political movement 
the flag exhibit by 24yearold art student scott tyler was to be 
taken down on thursday after being on display for four weeks 
it already has drawn censure from the illinois state house of 
representatives but a judge quickly threw out a lawsuit aimed at 
having the exhibit removed from public display

californias public health chief assured 
applelovers friday that tests indicated the fruit is safe to eat 
and the states schools were told to return apples to lunch rooms 
an apple a day is excellent diet policy state health 
director dr kenneth w kizer suggested at a news conference 
the message to mom and dad out there is that these are safe 
you can eat em theres no problem kizer said 
at the center of the controversy is the chemical daminozide sold 
under the trade name alar which the epa said has caused cancer in 
test animals last month an environmental group issued a report 
suggesting that children are especially at risk from alar because 
they eat many times more apples and apple products compared to 
their weight than adults 
alar has been used as a spray on some apples to increase 
firmness enhance color and extend storage life 
kizer said tests of canned apple juice apple slices and apple 
sauce taken from department of education warehouses failed to show 
residues of alar or related compounds greater than 0055 parts per 
million 
the residues are approximately 400 times below the legally 
allowed tolerance for daminozide in apple and apple products he 
said 
on thursday the us department of agriculture food and drug 
administration and environmental protection agency pronounced apple 
and apple products safe to eat 
theres no foundation or basis for the scare kizer said 
it got going and whatever it was got it going it steamrolled 
kizer declined to place blame but estimated the scare would 
probably cost state agencies a few hundred thousand dollars for 
the tests and other expenses 
kizer said he had advised state schools superintendent bill honig 
that there is no real threat to the health of children from the 
consumption of the apple products we tested 
i have urged that fresh and canned apples and other fruits and 
vegetables be served as a regular part of the diet of all california 
school children and i urge parents who have withdrawn those 
products from their childrens diets to begin serving them again 
kizer said the state tests were conducted at the states food and 
drug laboratories in emeryville and results were confirmed at the 
university of california at davis

the number of mothers and children known to be 
infected with the fatal aids virus by nurses using an unsterilized 
syringe at a provincial hospital has risen to 49 soviet health 
officials said friday 
officials expect to find several more victims as the 
investigation continues said valentin pokrovsky president of the 
academy of sciences 
speaking at a news briefing on an international conference in 
moscow on acquired immune deficiency syndrome pokrovsky said 21 of 
the 49 already identified are children 
he blamed the tragedy in elista a city near the caspian sea on 
health workers who used the same syringe to inject drugs into the 
intravenous feeding catheters of numerous patients 
the aids virus damages the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread most often 
through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their 
offspring 
the soviet union suffers extreme shortages of numerous products 
including syringes the country produced just 30 million disposable 
syringes last year while health workers dispensed 3 billion 
injections said deputy health minister alexander kondrusev 
nurses are supposed to sterilize their reusable syringes between 
patients but this apparently was not done in elista he said nor 
do disposable syringes solve the problem because they too are often 
used repeatedly he said 
we still have cases of health workers using syringes not 
properly boiled or simply changing needles he said there 
should be a system of responsibility to prevent such dangerous 
behavior he continued 
a government newspaper recently commented on a shortage of 
condoms which doctors say are an effective way to stem the spread 
of aids 
the elista case began when a soviet man contracted aids in 
africathen came home and transmitted it to his wife she or her 
child apparently was a patient in the maternity hospital last june 
when the infections began 
pokrovsky said it is possible some of the mothers contracted the 
fatal slowacting virus from their nursing infants scientists 
found that all of the children in this group who were already 
seriously ill and confined to an intensive care ward had mouth 
infections they believe infected blood from the babies mouths 
entered the mothers through their nipples to the lymph glands but 
this is not yet proven prokrovsky said 
so far authorities have identified only eight people who have 
developed aids symptoms in the soviet union kondrusev and pokrovsky 
said three african victims have died as have three soviets two 
other soviets are being treated 
kondrusev said the soviet union has found 554 carriers of the 
infectious virus including 378 foreigners and 176 soviets all of 
the foreigners have been deported or are in the process of leaving 
he said 
all of the soviet infections came from sexual activity except 
for the elista cases said kondrusev the soviet union has not yet 
had an aids case caused by drug abusers sharing needles he said 
worldwide 142000 people have developed the deadly disease and 
an estimated 5 to 10 million are infected according to world health 
organization statistics offered at the briefing 
pokrovsky said a few soviets are panicking about aids but he is 
more concerned that most citizens are utterly indifferent to the 
danger we need to explain that their safety depends on their 
individual actions he said

israeli soldiers clashed with guerrillas who 
apparently infiltrated into israel from jordan on friday and at 
least two soldiers were wounded the army said 
but knowledgeable israeli sources said one soldier was killed and 
another wounded in the 10 pm attack they said on condition of 
anonymity that the guerrillas apparently crossed the border back 
into jordan 
an army spokesman said an initial report showed the guerrillas 
crossed into israel near the southern border communal farm of ein 
yahav 74 miles south of jerusalem 
two israeli soldiers were wounded in the ensuing firefight the 
spokesman said he said no details were available 
one soldier who was shot and slightly wounded in the arm was 
treated at the soroka hospital in the southern town of beersheva 
hospital spokeswoman tami lunenfeld said 
on wednesday two palestinian guerrillas slipped across border in 
the occupied gaza strip town of rafah and hurled a grenade at an 
army outpost the guerrillas were captured by israeli troops there 
were no israeli casualties 
on friday one of the guerrillas 18yearold iman mohammed 
hassan yunis from the canada refugee camp on the egyptian side of 
rafah said he has been operating on orders from yasser arafats 
fatah wing of the plo 
wednesdays raid was the first attempted infiltration attributed 
to fatah since arafat in december renounced terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist after arafats statements the united 
states launched a dialogue with the plo 
us officials reportedly have sought to work out a ceasefire 
between israel and the palestine liberation organization to stop 
infiltrations from lebanon the plo claims these are attacks on 
military targets that are not included in arafats renunciation of 
terrorism 
army officials say at least 30 guerrillas have been killed in 
southern lebanon this year while attempting to cross into israel 
five were killed in two attempts this week 
the last infiltration from jordan was on may 17 1988 one arab 
guerrilla was wounded and captured and two escaped during that raid

leftist rebels frightened city 
mayors and election officials into quitting but a guerrilla 
commander said friday they will not attack polling places or people 
who vote in the presidential election 
the rebels have declared a traffic ban before sundays vote 
threatening to attack vehicles 
no commercial traffic moved on rural highways and rebel sabotage 
kept much of el salvador without power at least one van was 
attacked with a firebomb news reports said 
few buses operated in san salvador but army trucks carried 
people and some pickup trucks took passengers for fares 
you cant stop people said a driver named roberto who said 
he was charging the normal bus fare of 20 cents i did not come 
out yesterday but i need to work so here i am 
all three leading candidates have condemned the rebel actions and 
stressed their efforts to end a 9yearold civil war that has cost 
more than 70000 lives 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said the 
rebels had received large deliveries of ak47 assault rifles and 
ammunition from cuba in the past few months other officials 
speaking privately said at least some were shipped through 
nicaragua 
redman said the deliveries contradicted guerrilla claims of 
interest in a peace settlement 
campaigning ended wednesday by law in preliminary polling fidel 
chavez mena of president jose napoleon duartes christian democratic 
party trails coffee millionaire alfredo cristiani of the rightist 
republican nationalist alliance known as arena 
guillermo ungo a former leader of the rebel political wing is a 
distant third for the leftist democratic convergence four minor 
candidates also are running 
the mayors of chalatenango the northern provincial capital and 
metapan a northwestern city resigned under threats from the rebel 
farabundo marti national liberation front more than half the 
countrys municipalities are without mayors and nine mayors have 
been assassinated 
election officials in three precincts near the eastern city of 
san miguel were reported to have resigned the guerrillas have told 
election officials to quit before sunday 
a guerrilla commander in northern cabanas province told the 
associated press that no attacks would be made on polling places or 
civilians voting on election day but rightwing squads might attack 
civilians disguised as guerrillas 
a member of the guerrilla fronts political bureau based in 
mexico city ana guadalupe martinez said we will not directly 
attack those who are voting those who vote have to have that 
guarantee 
she also said the rebels were urging election officials to quit 
but had not threatened to kill them 
rebel leaders declared the boycott after making an unsuccessful 
offer to participate if the election was postponed until fall and 
fairness could be guaranteed their expressed aim is to discredit 
the election and force new negotiations on their proposal 
polls indicate no candidate will get a majority which would mean 
a runoff in april but reliable polling is difficult because many 
voters are afraid to express an honest preference 
cristiani the arena candidate says he would offer the rebels a 
choice of laying down their weapons to join the political process or 
facing the efficient use of the armed forces 
duartes attempts to improve the stagnating economy have been 
hampered by the war and critics say corruption and mismanagement 
he is barred by the constitution from seeking a second fiveyear 
term 
the christian democrats performance in office has hurt their 
candidate chavez mena who promises to negotiate peace without 
powersharing arrangements the guerrillas want 
ungo has dismissed both his opponents with the statement one 
does not want peace and the other cannot bring it about 
the government election council said the army would distribute 
voting materials across the country on saturday

stock and bond prices plunged friday after the 
government reported another surge in wholesale prices 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell about 50 
points in the opening minutes of trading then stabilized and 
finished 4857 points lower at 229214 it was the biggest drop 
since a 10146point plunge last april 14 
prices of longterm government bonds which are highly sensitive 
to inflation speculation were down more than 17 for every 1000 
in face value by late in the trading day 
lower bond prices mean higher interest rates the yield on the 
treasurys benchmark 30year bond leaped to about 93 percent from 
about 91 percent late thursday 
the labor department said friday that wholesale prices pushed up 
by surging energy and food costs soared 10 percent in february 
after an identical rise in january 
the backtoback increases mean inflation at the wholesale level 
one stop short of retail is running at a 126 percent annual rate so 
far in 1989 that is more than triple the 40 percent increase for 
all of last year 
both large jumps have surprised analysts who in advance of both 
reports had predicted moderate rises of about 04 percent after 
januarys numbers were reported economists dismissed them as an 
aberration and said inflation would return to the 4 percent to 5 
percent annual pace of late last year 
the stock market lost ground late in the session after 
international business machines corp said a shortterm chip problem 
had caused delays in deliveries of mainframe computers and that it 
expects firstquarter earnings to be below the range of security 
analysts estimates 
the intensity of activity in the stock market was heightened by 
the socalled triple witching hour a quarterly occasion when 
the last trading occurs in a set of expiring options and futures on 
stock indexes 
this situation often prompts heavy trading by professionals 
engaged in computer program strategies that involve both the options 
and futures and individual stocks

mexicos chief drug enforcement officer 
rejected claims by us sen jesse helms that mexico has a dismal 
record in combatting drugs congressmen urged the government to 
formally respond to helms allegations 
it is obvious these people havent the faintest idea of what we 
are doing in mexico and are deliberately ignoring the high cost we 
are paying in lives and money deputy attorney general javier 
coello trejo said in comments published friday in the 
englishlanguage mexico city news 
helms rnc introduced a measure in the senate thursday that 
would revoke a presidential finding that mexico is fully 
cooperating with the us government in the antidrug war the 
measure would make mexico ineligible for us financial assistance 
president bush is required by law to certify that certain nations 
are cooperating in the campaign against drugs the state department 
extended certification for mexico this month but said corruption is 
a continuing problem 
mexico is a major transfer point for drugs especially cocaine 
smuggled from south america to the united states it also is a big 
us supplier of marijuana and heroin according to state department 
statistics 
coello without mentioning helms by name said us senators 
critical of mexican efforts should come to mexico and watch while 
our agents backed by soldiers fight to the death with men armed 
with highpowered automatic weapons and finally capture and destroy 
stocks of drugs ready to market 
coello suggested that us critics of mexico look into the demand 
by us drug consumers 
where there is a buyer there is always a seller he said 
congressman victor hugo celaya of the governing institutional 
revolutionary party said that if mexicos antidrug efforts fall 
short it isnt for lack of political will but because of the 
economic crisis the country faces 
we are acting permanently against this social disease not 
because of the need to obtain a certificate of good conduct but 
because it concerns state security said celaya chairman of the 
congressional border affairs committee 
representatives of the leftist and conservative opposition 
denounced helms and called for the foreign ministry to issue a 
statement 
the us senate voted last year to revoke former president 
reagans certification of mexican cooperation in the antidrug 
battle but the house did not support the move 
mexico criticized the certification process as meddling in its 
internal affairs 
five members of the federal judicial police have been killed in 
gun battles with drug traffickers since dec 1 according to the 
attorney generals office a total of 52 government agents and 113 
army troopers have been slain in antinarcotics operations since 
december 1982

a judge on friday urged imprisoned soul singer 
james brown to refrain from using drugs but did not lengthen his 
jail time for having drugs in his system during a probation check in 
december 
i would hope that you can put your troubles behind you 
circuit judge rodney peeples told brown i believe you can still 
do a lot of good for a lot of people i would urge you please to 
stay off drugs 
after making his admonition the judge revoked a probationary 
sentence brown received last july 24 following his conviction for 
resisting arrest and carrying a pistol brown could have been 
ordered to serve a oneyear jail term 
but peeples dismissed six months of that sentence and ordered the 
godfather of soul to serve the remaining time concurrently with 
a sixyear prison term brown began serving dec 29 following his 
conviction on charges stemming from a sept 24 car chase with police 
from two states 
fridays hearing was ordered after brown tested positive for 
marijuana and pcp in violation of his probation for the july case 
brown 55 said after the hearing that he is faring well in 
prison he said he is getting a muchneeded rest learning to cook 
and counseling other inmates at the state park correctional 
institute near columbia 
its not really a low point said brown dressed in a suit 
and tie a lot can be gained from the time in prison he added 
brown is eligible for parole on may 12 1991 but a nationwide 
movement is pressing for an early release among his supporters are 
civil rights activist jesse jackson who appeared before the state 
parole board on browns behalf earlier this month 
browns lawyers plan to ask the state parole board on may 29 for 
a pardon one of browns attorneys george hill jr said friday 
brown said that even though he is incarcerated his career is 
going faster than i can catch up with it 
an album he recorded in december with aretha franklin is 
scheduled to be released soon and cinemax is broadcasting browns 
november concert tour in italy 
browns album im real released in august also is selling 
well according to officials with the scotti brothers record 
company this week his music was used to awaken the space shuttle 
discoverys five astronauts 
also friday probation officials filed a complaint alleging that 
a benefit concert brown performed on dec 4 as part of his july 
sentence raised enough money only to cover expenses and no money for 
charity 
defense attorney bill weeks blamed that in part on bad 
publicity and the judge dismissed the complaint saying he was 
convinced the singer had made a goodfaith effort to raise money for 
charity 
brown also is scheduled to appear in court in north augusta in 
midapril on a charge of driving under the influence

the bush administration announced a steppedup 
inspection plan for imported fruit on friday clearing the way for 
new shipments of chilean produce to us supermarkets after a 
weeklong health scare sparked by cyanidetainted grapes 
under the plan chilean fruit already held by importers 
wholesalers and retailers in the united states is to be destroyed 
to eliminate fruit that cannot be practically inspected said 
frank young commissioner of the food and drug administration 
under the new inspection safeguards we believe that this 
program will provide the maximum feasible safety for fruit from 
chile young said at a news conference 
he said that while not every piece of fruit will be inspected 
the plan is based on the assumptions of the type of sampling that 
would be required to have a high confidence of detecting anything if 
something is there 
it is impossible to assure 100 percent safety he said 
chilean grapes which make up the bulk of grapes on sale this 
time of year and other fruit could be back on the shelves of us 
stores in less than a week officials said 
the plan was announced despite a new poisoning threat received by 
the us embassy in santiago young said he said the third threat 
raises no more concern than two earlier ones which preceded 
discovery of the tainted grapes though officials believe the caller 
may be the same 
as the government inspection plan was being announced 
longshoremen in florida began unloading boxes of chilean fruit from 
a ship that has been anchored off tampa for the past few days 
responsibility to see that fruit already in the united states is 
dumped lies with state health departments young said 
about 5 percent of chilean fruit at us docks or in transit to 
the united states will be visually inspected and all 
suspiciouslooking fruit will be subjected to laboratory tests 
before it is released 
in addition chile will begin increased security surveillance of 
fruit still in that country awaiting export young said a team of 
fda inspectors will fly to the south american country soon to 
oversee that effort 
as always we believe consumers should inspect all products 
regardless of country of origin young said in this particular 
case consumers should look especially for injection marks any 
unusual appearance or discoloration or chemical or burned almond 
smell 
neither fda nor representatives of chilean exporters could give 
figures on the value of the fruit to be destroyed 
young said grapes which constitute about 70 percent of chiles 
sales in the united states raspberries blueberries blackberries 
and strawberries will be the first fruits to be released because 
cyanide contamination of those fruits is the easiest to spot since 
the fruit discolors and becomes mushy 
these chilean fruits will be on store shelves within five to nine 
days young said but he had no estimate of time for return of the 
other chilean fruit exports including melons cantaloupes pears 
apples nectarines plums and peaches once fruit has been 
inspected crates will be labeled as such so wholesalers and 
retailers can be assured of its safety he said 
he said that since the small amounts of cyanide were found in two 
seedless red grapes over the weekend no additional evidence of 
contamination has been uncovered he said 13000 crates of fruit 
have been inspected since the two poisoned grapes were found 
minutes before young announced details of the plan president 
bush said the fdas action in taking chilean fruit off the market 
has cost some economic hardship that i regret 
however he added i think when the health of the american 
people might be threatened youve got to take prudent action 
discovery of the poisoned grapes touched off a major public 
health scare in this country and economic difficulties of a 
different sort in chile where fruit is a major export and where 
thousands of agricultural workers have been threatened with the loss 
of their jobs during the peak harvest season 
chilean foreign minister hernan felipe errazuriz called the us 
decision a workable solution and said we are very grateful 
it takes into account the interest of the us citizens and the 
chileans the consumers and the workers from chile he said at the 
white house where he met with vice president dan quayle 
young said questions about who would bear the cost of the lost 
fruit and the inspections are not his to consider the day i start 
to look at health with regard to somebodys left hip pocket or 
pocketbook then i am not focusing enough in regard to safety he 
said 
some economic impact will be felt by american consumers who are 
likely to soon see at least temporarily higher prices for fruit on 
supermarket shelves said economist donald ratajczak of georgia 
state university 
most of what will be left on the shelves will be hothouse grown 
domestically and that will be more expensive he said 
in santiago after hearing that the us government had lifted 
the restrictions the military government announced a package of 
economic measures to counter the damage caused by the crisis of the 
nations booming fruit export industry 
president augusto pinochet said he signed a bill authorizing the 
government to make emergency loans to affected fruit growers and 
exporters also he said the government will buy part of the 
production the exporters were not able to sell abroad 
interior minister carlos caceres said the government will also 
aid exporters to finance a mass advertising campaign abroad aimed at 
recovering the consumers confidence especially in the united 
states 
effective immediately caceres said the government will 
implement a 12 million emergency job program in the fruitgrowing 
regions to hire workers who lost their jobs as a result of the 
temporary paralization of the fruit industry 
in addition tue government will encourage banks to renegotiate 
credits with fruit businessmen 
in the foreign front caceres added the government will seek new 
credits from the world bank and will renegotiate standing 
agreements with the international monetary funds he did not 
elaborate

twenty years ago students and teachers 
at the massachusetts institute of technology started a movement 
against what they considered a dangerous trend of focusing 
technology on military expansion 
what started out as an mit teachin and became known as the union 
of concerned scientists has grown two decades later into an 
influential national organization promoting social and environmental 
uses of technology and nuclear arms reduction 
the organization claims 100000 contributing members and a 
30member staff in cambridge and washington engaged in research 
lobbying and litigation 
on wednesday night about 200 people celebrated the groups 
anniversary at the boston museum of science at the reception the 
ucs previewed a video on the groups policy on avoiding perilous 
global warming known as the greenhouse effect 
among those present was henry w kendall an mit physics 
professor and defense department consultant who has been chairman of 
the unions board since 1973 
kendalls involvement traces to the groups inception as the 
march fourth movement on the mit campus on march 4 1969 the 
universitys regular activities were disrupted for weeklong 
discussions on the vietnam war which those participating thought 
was unwinnable 
at the time mit was designing components for nuclear weaponry 
which many students and faculty opposed kendall and other 
instructors released a faculty statement outlining their goals as 
a continuing examination of governmental policy in areas 
where science and technology are of actual or potential 
significance 
to direct the emphasis on military technology towards 
environmental and social problems 
to encourage students to focus their scientific and 
technological energies on serving mankind and to scrutinize the 
issues before participating in the construction of destructive 
weapons systems 
howard ris the unions executive director since 1984 said the 
group is celebrating the end of the reagan era the union opposed 
president reagan on many issues such as his strategic defense 
initiative and his relaxation of regulations restricting auto 
emissions 
nevertheless kendall says the group has worked with liberals and 
conservatives alike to pursue its goals 
weve been against a number of technically unsatisfactory 
weapons systems like star wars that were illchosen and unwise 
kendall said our views have now become the standard reaction 
perceptions of the group in washington dc vary 
a public relations worker for the heritage foundation a 
conservative think tank when asked about the union of concerned 
scientists said theyre a peace group right 
but michael mariotte the director of the nuclear information and 
resource service said weve got a lot of respect for them they 
have the expertise we and a lot of other people rely on 
of course we dont agree on every single thing mariotte 
said as an example mariotte pointed to the unions support of 
further development of advanced nuclear reactors which his 
organization is against

united nations prince norodom rinariddh whose father leads the 
cambodian resistance said friday the united states had expressed 
strong and clear support but gave no commitment to provide arms 
he told reporters after several days of talks in washington the 
question of military assistance is being debated but we havent 
gotten any aid from the united states 
rinariddh is the military commander of guerrillas led by his 
father prince norodom sihanouk the former ruler of cambodia 
the threeparty resistance coalition also includes a 
noncommunist group led by former premier son sann and the communist 
khmer rouge who gained control of cambodia in 1975 and conducted a 
reign of terror in which at least 1 million people died before the 
vietnamese invasion of december 1978 
after the news conference rinariddh met with secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar about the cambodian situation possible un 
supervision of a vietnamese withdrawal and a proposed unsponsored 
peace conference there was no immediate report on their discussions 
the prince said the noncommunist resistance groups wanted us 
military aid to give them greater strength relative to the khmer 
rouge the main fighting force and enable them to compete more 
effectively in a future settlement 
he told the journalists however to be very frank i do not 
have a clear and positive response to my requirement to have lethal 
aid to the noncommunists 
he said there were indications of support and the reaction 
appeared to me to be very positive but i cant say im 100 
percent sure the us will provide lethal assistance 
bush administration sources have said privately they discussed 
the possibility of increasing assistance to the noncommunist 
factions projected to be 75 million in nonlethal aid for fiscal 
1990 
they added however that the administration opposes providing 
military aid china and the association of southeast asian nations 
are the major providers of arms and the administration is satisfied 
with the status quo the sources said

as longshoreman began unloading crates of 
fresh chilean fruit importers and wholesalers struggled friday to 
add up losses caused by a food and drug administration order to 
destroy the fruit already in storage 
most industry sources said losses would be in the tens of 
millions of dollars with wholesalers and retailers bearing the 
brunt of the fiveday health scare provoked by the discovery of 
cyanide traces in two chilean grapes across the country importers 
and wholesalers met attempting to interpret the announcement by fda 
commissioner frank young that chilean fruit would be allowed back on 
the us market with increased federal inspection 
young said however that fruit already imported must be 
destroyed if it cannot be practically inspected under the 
order fruit at some ports and docks would be inspected but most in 
storage must be eliminated 
theres millions of dollars worth of fruit in storage right 
now said caryl saunders a spokeswoman for the 46member chilean 
winter fruit association in san francisco everybody stands to 
lose 
at inland distribution points like chicago the fda announcement 
sent wholesalers into despair ms saunders said theyre so 
depressed theyre just all going home 
the mood was better at david oppenheimer california inc in the 
seaport of long beach where much of the fruit arrives for west 
coast distribution 
oppenheimer and other importers believe they can salvage some 
sales of their fruit now on the docks and waiting in boats offshore 
if it can be inspected before it deteriorates said rick eastes 
vice presidentgeneral manager 
but he estimated losses industrywide during the fruit scare would 
equal tens of millions of dollars 
theres going to be some major economic loss he said we 
dont know whats happened to consumer confidence 
eastes estimated nationwide sales of chilean fruit at 75 million 
to 100 million per week and added weve gone one entire week 
without selling 
the company faced another five to nine days before fruit could be 
inspected for distribution he said in that time much of the fruit 
would deteriorate and become unsaleable 
in tampa fla longshoremen began unloading nearly 170000 boxes 
of chilean fruit from a ship that left chile 13 days ago and has 
been at anchor the last few days 
federal agents immediately started inspecting the 3 million 
cargo of grapes peaches plums apples nectarines and pears a 
process that was expected to last into the weekend 
the chilean winter fruit association was unable to provide a 
precise dollar amount on losses expected if all fruit in storage 
must be destroyed nor was the american produce association which 
represents 65 chilean importers 
thats the question of the day said spokesman jay watkins 
who said american produce association officials were in meetings 
attempting to identify losses 
the fda also was unable to provide figures said spokesman don 
mclearn 
vons supermarkets one of californias largest supermarket 
chains on thursday began destroying cases of fruit that had been 
opened and placed on display said vons spokesman vickie sanders 
the fruit was taken to landfills and buried and unopened cases 
were returned to the supplier for credit she said chilean fruit 
probably will not appear on vons shelves again until next weekend 
she said 
wed like to wait till theres brand new shipments we want 
fresh fruit and we want to make sure it has the fda stamp of 
approval ms sanders said

the bush administration and congressional 
democrats were on the verge of agreement friday on a new policy 
toward nicaragua that would bring a rare note of bipartisanship to 
us actions in the region 
were not far apart said sen christopher dodd dconn 
commenting on a proposed bipartisan policy statement that was being 
drafted compared to the contentiousness of the past eight 
years were down to splitting hairs 
but final agreement on the twopage document stamped secret 
eluded negotiators despite a flurry of personal visits in capitol 
hill offices by secretary of state james a baker iii more meetings 
were scheduled for monday 
the agreement includes a broad statement of policy goals worked 
out over the past three weeks in a series of meetings between baker 
and congressional leaders according to congressional sources 
president bush speaking to reporters said he wanted the policy 
statement to put an end to the fractiousness that dominated the 
issue during president reagans years in office i want to see 
something worked out where america speaks with one voice bush 
said it is not helpful to the foreign policy objectives to have 
divided voices 
the language voices strong us support for regional peace 
efforts and for diplomatic steps to press nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government toward democratic reforms said democratic and 
republican sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
it also says that congressional leaders agree soon after 
lawmakers return from their easter break on april 3 to speedily 
bring up legislation extending humanitarian aid to the 
antisandinista contra rebels through feb 28 1990 
the 11000 or so rebel troops now encamped in the honduran 
jungle along the border with nicaragua are subsisting on the last 
of 27 million in us aid voted by congress last year that aid 
technically runs out march 31 although supplies in the pipeline 
could continue to keep the contras fed and clothed well into may 
democrats were concerned that the statement be consistent with 
efforts by the five central american presidents to engineer a 
regional peace agreement the presidents have agreed on a plan that 
calls for disbanding the contras and relocating them either back in 
nicaragua or elsewhere 
we dont want to muck up the peace process said rep david 
obey dwis we have to have better understandings 
one congressional source familiar with the talks said two 
principal issues still divided the two sides whether the 
reintegration of contra rebels into nicraguan society would remain 
completely voluntary and how to deal with the possibility that 
nicaragua might not live up to its democratization pledges a year 
from now 
while calling for steps toward democracy in nicaragua the 
bipartisan policy statement has been left with a certain 
calculated vagueness according to one participant in the talks 
to make it possible for democrats and republicans on opposite sides 
of the divisive policy issue to come together and endorse the plan 
the vagueness also leaves maneuvering room for the administration 
to respond to developments in the region which may not be 
specifically anticipated in the policy paper according to several 
sources 
not included in the statement but understood to be the 
administrations intention is a secret bill of particulars that 
includes a timetable for us rewards and punishments for nicaragua 
depending on whether the leftist sandinista government lives up to 
promises of democratization 
aid to the contras would continue at a rate of about 4 million a 
month under the legislation to be proposed by the administration 
meaning a total aid package of as much as 44 million for 11 months 
the joint statement does not specify the precise amount and duration 
of the aid rather the money would be subject to review at certain 
points before nicaraguas national elections scheduled for february 
if conditions inside nicaragua improve enough meaning political 
freedoms and civil liberties are restored some of the aid could be 
used to pay for relocating rebel fighters from their camps in 
honduras along the nicaraguan border and to reintegrate them into 
nicaraguan society

the senate failed friday to extend a program 
that provides the drug azt to victims of aids who cannot afford the 
costly treatment which virtually assures the program will expire 
march 31 
a bill sponsored by sen edward kennedy dmass sought to 
redirect 5 million in federal aids research funds to the azt 
program for use through september 
but three senators objected to kennedys request that the measure 
be acted on without debate or consideration of amendments the three 
critics were not identified 
due to the twoweek easter recess the senate will not be back in 
session for the rest of the month 
currently some 6000 to 7000 aids victims are receiving azt 
under the program 
some states have already run out of money under the program but 
other state have enough to hold them through august if the program 
expires some 2875 would be affected by the end of june according 
to the human rights campaign fund an aids advocacy group 
kennedy said the 5 million would provide emergency help for 
desperate and dying people who deserve access to the few aids 
treatments that are available 
azt which has been shown to extend the lives of many aids 
patients is the only drug approved by the food and drug 
administration for treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
azt and a handful of treatments are keeping people alive and 
there is no justification for the senates failure to help them 
kennedy said but i refuse to abandon a program that costs so 
little and means so much 
a kennedy aide said the senator would continue work to extend the 
program when the senate returns in april 
the current program was an extension of a program begun earlier 
the senate approved the extension on a voice vote and hours before 
it was to expire the house voted its approval 
the average cost of azt is about 600 a month 
robert bray a spokesman for the human rights campaign fund an 
aids advocacy group said that if the program expires those who 
have been receiving their azt through the program may have to go off 
the drug some may have to spend down their assets to qualify for 
medicaid in states where the federal health assistance program for 
the poor covers azt he added 
he said georgia and kansas have already run out of the funds 
allocated to them and idaho kentucky and utah are expected to run 
out at the end of the month 
it can be dealt with when they members of congress come back 
but its much harder to get a new program started than it is to 
continue an existing program bray said

the recordbreaking murder rate in the nations 
capital this year prompted two senators to suggest thursday that the 
district of columbias police department be replaced with a 
federallycontrolled police force 
sen warren rudman rnh blamed the citys inability to stem 
drugrelated killings on inept local government that doesnt 
understand what its doing 
we cant have people killed and blood running on the streets 
like some third world capital rudman said noting that three 
fatal shootings in the last 24 hours had pushed the citys 1989 
murder total to 111 police later said a fourth man had been killed 
if the killing continues rudman said he would consider taking a 
look at home rule at least the law enforcement aspect 
the senator said he would weigh proposing the creation of a 
federal constabulary to replace the citys police department 
sen ernest hollings dsc echoed rudmans sentiments at a 
hearing of the appropriations committees state justice 
subcommittee which he chairs hollings said he would cosponsor any 
legislation rudman proposed 
the comments by rudman and hollings marked the first time that 
lawmakers had raised the possiblity of limiting or curtailing home 
rule a politically sensitive issue among residents and local 
politicians of the nations capital 
at the hearing rudman told fbi director william sessions and 
jack lawn head of the drug enforcement administration i believe 
the fbi and dea have a very special responsibility to try to help 
the local officials who evidently do not know how to deal with 
the problem 
last year the districts 372 murders set a record this years 
total is nearly twice that for the same period a year ago 
on monday william j bennett the bush administrations drug 
policy director said the federal government should take a more 
active role in helping the district control its drugrelated crime 
spree he and mayor marion barry jr met on tuesday to begin mapping 
out strategies no firm plans have been released 
after the hearing hollings told reporters we have to get on 
top of this if you had to ask me from the crime statistics of 
people being killed home rule is not working 
rudman did not say whether he would favor additional federal 
money to assist the city police department 
we would be opposed to rudmans idea unless the congress is 
going to replace police departments in other communities where drugs 
have become a threat said john white a spokesman for barry 
police chief maurice t turner was not immediately available to 
comment 
the district of columbia received limited selfgovernance from 
congress in 1973 but still must have its annual budget and all 
legislation reviewed and approved by congress 
under city law congress reserves the right to repeal any local 
law or act including part or all of the charter enacted by congress 
for the city 
barry turner and other city leaders have blamed the upsurge in 
murders on the arrival of crack a highly potent and addictive form 
of cocaine a statistical study of city homicides shows that about 
60 percent are drugrelated and about 80 percent of those appear to 
be assassinations

the nationwide scare over the chemical 
additive alar has finally taken a bite out of washington state apple 
sales with fridays shipping report showing a decline of 152000 
boxes from the previous week 
the weekly report of outofstate shipments of the nations 
largest apple crop showed a drop from the record 156 million boxes 
two weeks ago to 14 million boxes last week 
for the same week last year shipments were 15 million boxes 
said bill dewitt of the wenatchee valley traffic association 
foreign exports also showed a decline of 35000 boxes mostly in 
canceled shipments to taiwan he said 
based on the top price quoted thursday for the top three apple 
varieties in washington the loss to growers from last weeks 
decline could be up to 24 million prices also reportedly are 
slipping because of alar fears 
im sure part of this downtrend is the alar scare said 
dewitt manager of apple recordkeeping organization there is no 
doubt in my mind 
sales are also reported down for east coast apple growers 
although specific figures were not available said ralph baldasaro 
of the new york amp new england apple institute in westfield mass 
since meryl streep went on tv there has been a definite 
slowdown baldasaro said of the actress recent vocal opposition 
to alar use theres been no panic but there is some slowdown 
the washington dcbased natural resources defense council 
whose report raised consumer fears agreed that the chemical has had 
an impact 
consumers have no idea whether the apple they pick up 
contains alar or not said nrdc spokeswoman jeanne whalen in a 
telephone interview until they can be sure this is the way 
consumers are reacting 
alar is used to keep apples on the trees longer improving color 
and firmness and allowing a longer harvest time 
us rep sid morrison rwash whose family owns apple 
orchards predicted that the federal governments assurances 
thursday that apples are safe to eat will restore consumer 
confidence 
the issue has turned morrison said at a yakima news 
conference 
morrison also said he believes alar will eventually be banned by 
the government and urged washington growers to voluntarily stop 
using it to quiet consumer fears 
he also criticized the nrdcs scare tactics and said the 
federal regulatory process is the place to decide which chemicals 
are safe to use 
alar the marketing name for daminozide is still legal to use 
although the environmental protection agency has said it will begin 
steps to ban it by 1990 
the downturn in sales figures ended three consecutive weeks of 
record shipments 
dewitt said there was no way to tell how much of the us drop in 
shipments was related to a widespread ban of apple products in 
school cafeterias and how much was a drop in retail sales 
the apple industry has disputed the nrdc findings and also 
maintained that only about 5 percent of the crop is treated with the 
chemical 
ironically however another scare over chilean fruit is helping 
sales of washington granny smith apples with prices jumping about 
3 to 25 per box the federalstate market news service reported 
chile is a major supplier of granny smiths but they were removed 
from markets for five days this week following the discovery of two 
cyanidelaced grapes

the sandinista government on friday 
pardoned and freed 1894 former national guardsmen in partial 
fulfillment of a central american peace agreement 
hours later in the capital managua president daniel ortega 
announced electoral and other reforms and said measures point to his 
leftist governments commitment to end strife in the region 
ortega appealed to the us congress not to renew humanitarian 
aid to the nicaraguan rebels known as contras beyond 90 days 
because it would go against the desire of the central american 
presidents to dismantle the force 
many of the prisoners freed on friday had been under detention 
since president anastasio somozas rightwing regime defended by 
the national guard was toppled in junejuly 1979 in a civil war led 
by the sandinistas 
some nicaraguans opposed freeing the prisoners they said their 
relatives and friends were victims of repression and torture by the 
national guard during the years of somoza family rule 
the president said the guardsmen should be permitted to rejoin 
society but he also said any who return to their criminal 
activities would face the popular ire with all its force 
ortega asked the national assembly to grant the pardons in line 
with his pledge to adopt democratic reforms as part of an accord 
with four other central american presidents 
the assembly denied pardons to 39 former guardsman because of the 
severity of their crimes against the people 
of the 1894 guardsmen granted pardons wednesday by the assembly 
1643 were at the la modelo prison in tipitapa 14 miles from 
managua and the remaining 251 had been under house arrest said 
marcos arevalo deputy commander of the penal system 
at tipitapa the prisoners stood in the dusty prison yard as their 
names were read then they yelled out the names of their loved ones 
and joined waiting relatives in a happy throng 
i give thanks to god i never thought they would let him out 
this soon said a tearyeyed francis montano 26 who greeted her 
freed father 55yearold francisco montano 
ortega was present at the ceremony but did not speak also 
present were joao baena soares secretarygeneral of the 
organization of american states roman catholic bishop bosco vivas 
of managua and some foreign diplomats and opposition politicians 
during the release ceremony which lasted for about 30 minutes 
the names of the prisoners were announced over a loudspeaker they 
walked to several desks where army officers and representatives of 
the oas human rights commission gave them safeconduct passes 
at the back of the prison yard the international red cross 
distributed packages of food the red cross also provided 50 buses 
to take the freed men and their relatives home and said it had plans 
to provide them with food for two months 
ms montano said her father was a sergeant working as a typist 
when he was captured by sandinista guerrillas in june 1979 
they arrested him for being a military man for 26 years she 
said nobody has ever accused him of anything she said her 
father had been given a 22year sentence 
ms montano said her father would live with her and her husband 
who three months ago began serving a mandatory twoyear period of 
military service with the army as a medic over the past three years 
authorities had allowed her father to stay with the family some 
weekends she said 
some prisoners were defiant 
we held up for 10 years and we can take some more said 
sobeida macrea jarquin 41 convicted of spying for the somoza 
security agency and the cia 
after seven official interrogations and two years in solitary 
they never proved anything against me she said 
ms macrea and her husband national guard lt humberto zuniga 
were arrested on july 28 1979 they were released friday and were 
met by ms macreas sisters 
asked about her plans ms macrea said well probably spend 
easter week at the beach then well think about our situation

president daniel ortega announced 
electoral and other reforms on friday and said the measures point to 
his leftist sandinista governments commitment to bring peace to 
central america 
hours earlier the sandinistas freed 1894 former national 
guardsmen from prison 
ortega appealed to the us congress not to renew humanitarian 
aid to the nicaraguan rebels known as contras beyond 90 days 
because it would go against the desire of the regions presidents to 
dismantle the usbacked force 
we appeal to the government of the united states president 
george bush and the us congress so that what is being discussed 
today in congress regarding renewed aid to the contras will be 
contemplated within the framework of the joint declaration of the 
central american presidents ortega said in a speech before 
opposition party leaders and the archbishop of managua cardinal 
miguel obando y bravo 
ortega was refering to an accord he and the presidents of el 
salvador honduras guatemala and costa rica signed on feb 14 in el 
salvador the five agreed to draft a plan by midmay to dismantle 
the contras most of whom are in jungle camps in honduras near the 
nicaraguan border 
in the pact ortega promised legal reforms to guarantee fair 
general elections which he moved up by 10 months to feb 25 1990 
government sources in washington and contra leaders have said the 
bush administration will ask congress for up to 50 million in new 
nonlethal aid for the contras the current package of 27 million 
expires march 31 
ortega said talks he has been holding with his political foes 
have been positive frank and constructive but that the el 
salvador accord did not oblige his government to hold negotiations 
with the opposition 
rather the nicaraguan government assumes the responsibility of 
enacting certain reforms ortega said 
he announced 20 reforms he said his government will send to the 
national assembly within the next few days including 
allowing exiled nicaraguans to vote from abroad thousands of 
nicaraguans have fled eight years of civil war and a dismal economy 
forbidding use of state resources or employees in the campaign 
changing laws on financing political parties 
reducing the number of regional polling and votecounting 
stations 
making the supreme electoral council more representative of 
opposition parties 
passage is virtually assured the sandinistas dominate the 
96member national assembly with 61 deputies to the oppositions 35 
hundreds of former members of ousted president anastasio somozas 
national guard were released earlier friday at la modelo prison in 
tipitapa village just outside managua 
most were jailed in the months following the july 19 1979 rise 
to power of the sandinistas who defeated somoza in a popular 
uprising

occupied lands when he meets president bush next month according to

us without endangering israels security haaretz reported

leading to an unspecified final settlement palestinian leaders and 
the plo have rejected the proposal insisting on the creation of an 
independent palestinian state

sierra nevada shuddered for several minutes with severe vibrations 
friday forcing an emergency landing that revealed part of the tail 
section was scorched

landing at san francisco international airport about 1 pm and 
taxied to a gate on its own officials said there were no injuries

was discovered on the tail there also appeared to be damage to the 
stabilizer the horizontal portion of the tail that helps control 
the planes attitude 
dave messing a continental spokesman in houston said it was 
believed that the problem was in the planes auxiliary power unit 
or apu there was an apu malfunction possibly resulting in an 
overheating condition he said 
an aviation source who had a chance to inspect the plane said a 
fire had damaged the stabilizer on the tail section near the apu 
but he said the power unit itself was not charred 
it the stabilizer is burned on the outside the paint is 
burned off but they dont know how it occurred said the source 
who spoke on condition of anonymity he said the only possible 
source of ignition in the charred area appeared to be one of the 
planes strobe lights 
re griff greffenius a business traveler from walnut creek 
calif said after he got off the plane he noticed a large part of 
the tail section appeared to be burned 
during the flight the vibrations were severe and lasted several 
minutes greffenius said they were followed by several minutes of 
silence he said

vibration problem and were going back to oakland said 
greffenius 
there was obvious damage to the tail greffenius said the 
paint in a fairly large area of the tail section appears to be 
scorched

fortynine aliens suspected of spurring at 
least 200 of their fellow detainees to rush the fence at an 
immigration detention center have been moved to other border 
lockups an official said friday 
it was felt that they were the instigators said duke austin 
a spokesman for the immigration and naturalization service he said 
40 people went to the webb county jail in laredo and nine to starr 
county jail in rio grande city 
a disturbance broke out at the 315acre minimumsecurity center 
for aliens facing deportation about 245 pm thursday about 200 
men threw rocks and ripped up a section of fence but did not try to 
escape officials said 
an ins riot squad quickly assembled and brought the situation 
under control said officials and immigration attorneys who 
witnessed the demonstration at the port isabel service processing 
center 
the rural camp is just south of the laguna atascosa national 
wildlife refuge and about 20 miles northeast of the border city of 
brownsville 
ins officials dont know why the disturbance began austin said 
but he speculated that it probably was the result of frustration of 
detention 
he said the center was calm friday extra guards sealing off the 
main entrance and exit thursday were gone friday 
brownsville immigration attorney linda yanez who was at the 
center interviewing clients when the demonstration broke out said 
the incident was inevitable 
these people do not have any sense of what their legal rights 
are what their situation is ms yanez said they dont have 
any telephones 
all 1600 people at the recreation area rushed the fence but did 
not try to escape she said 
of course people are going to be tense when they are held 
incommunicado and families are split up she said 
representatives from the united nations high commissioner for 
refugees also were present for a regular observation visit thursday 
when the ins cleared all visitors and civilian personnel from the 
camp the un officials declined comment on the incident 
the center held 2279 men and women friday primarily central 
americans including 754 men sleeping in tents 
its population has increased by 500 percent since feb 21 when 
the ins started immediate detention of immigrants whose initial 
applications for political asylum are denied in south texas 
stepped up border patrol enforcement and a curtailment of 
recognizance releases of those apprehended also have swelled the 
number of detainees most aliens are held at the center in lieu of 
deportation bonds of up to 4000 
the ins position is that most of the nicaraguans el 
salvadorans guatemalans and hondurans entering southern texas do 
not qualify as political refugees because they are here for economic 
reasons 
asylum is granted to those able to convince the us justice and 
state departments that they are fleeing persecution 
he said attorneys allegations of shortages of food and medical 
care at the center were untrue the us public health service 
provides doctors physicians and nurses to attend to the detainees 
austin said 
a water shortage however makes it impossible for every detainee 
to bathe daily austin said

a sweeping antismog plan approved friday 
by southern california officials would clamp new restrictions on 
everyone from managers of heavy industry to backyard barbecue chefs 
the plan intended to clean air in the fourcounty los angeles 
basin up to federal standards by 2007 would phase in strict rules 
requiring use of such cleanburning fuels as methanol and compressed 
natural gas in cars trucks and buses 
the changes also attack a variety of large and small pollution 
sources from industrial paints and solvents to such household 
chemicals as charcoal lighter fluid and underarm deodorant aerosols 
the plan prepared in response to pressure from the federal 
government was approved 102 by the south coast air quality 
management district and 161 by the southern california association 
of governments both are regional planning agencies 
the votes capped a contentious eighthour session which drew 
about 200 people from environmental and citizens groups industry 
and government the proposals had been closely watched across the 
nation by industry and pollutionshrouded cities 
lets proceed under a yellow light said bill welsh of the 
hollywood chamber of commerce lets proceed with caution and 
weigh this plan carefully 
labor representatives generally opposed tight restrictions on 
industrial pollutants which they said could shutter factories at a 
cost of thousands of jobs 
ive heard politician after politician stand up and say we 
all have to sacrifice said ron sandes a member of the oil 
chemical and atomic workers union employed at the chevron refinery 
in el segundo i dont know what you are sacrificing but i am 
sacrificing my job 
the district estimates the changes would cost 39 billion a 
year but an industry study by national economic research 
associates inc found the probable cost was 128 billion a year 
or 2200 a year added to the annual cost of goods and services for 
each southern california household 
the plan now must be accepted by the state air resources board 
and the federal environmental protection agency which has 
threatened to take over smog control if local authorities fail to 
act the first provisions of the threetiered plan however could 
go into effect within a year 
the plans 160 proposed rules would reach into unexpected corners 
of everyday life to attack smog sources both large and small 
people would be forced within the next five years to swap 
aerosol deodorant sprays for manualpump sprays or stick deodorants 
hair spray too along with other household aerosols using volatile 
chemicals that form smog also would be banned 
the suburban backyard scene would change forever with bans on 
charcoal lighter fluid for barbecues and requirements that 
lawnmowers and other tools run on either electricity or fuel that 
burns more cleanly than gasoline 
drivethrough burger stands might be limited to cut down on 
smoggenerating engine idling while motorists wait for their orders 
motorists would have to shell out more for tires because 
radials rather than biasply tires would be required on cars and 
light trucks thats because radials last longer and thus throw off 
fewer of the minute flecks of rubber that contribute to particulate 
pollutants in carcrazy southern california where more than 12 
million people drive 8 million vehicles about 234 million miles a 
day that alone would cut particulate pollutants by 31 tons a day 
the authors of the plan said 
the bulk of the pollution reductions would be achieved by larger 
scale assaults on smog sources 
staterequired checks of auto pollutioncontrol equipment would 
be more stringent and new emission limits would be imposed on 
diesel trucks and buses 
owners of fleets of 15 vehicles or more be they governments or 
businesses would have to switch to cleanerburning fuels beginning 
in 1992 
the plans goal is to have such cleanburning fuels as compressed 
natural gas and methane in wide use by 1998 the goal is to have 
such fuels in 40 percent of cars and light or mediumduty trucks 
70 percent of freight trucks and 100 percent of buses 
the plan would cover a district of 13350 square miles covering 
los angeles orange and parts of riverside and san bernardino 
counties

a federal judge gave apple computer inc an 
important victory friday in its legal battle with fellow computer 
giants microsoft and hewlettpackard over the visual displays for 
apples macintosh system 
us district judge william schwarzers tentative ruling held 
that a 1985 applemicrosoft licensing agreement did not entitle 
microsoft to produe a display program called windows 203 the 
target of the copyright lawsuit 
windows 203 the product as it is now being offered is not 
covered by the license schwarzer said 
that means microsoft cannot claim permission from apple to market 
a program with visual displays similar to those in the macintosh 
apples biggestselling model but the case is far from over 
apple still must prove that windows 203 is substantially 
similar to the macintosh menu screen graphics distinctive for 
their use of icons pictoral symbols such as file drawers and 
wastebaskets rather than written commands to enter and use the 
computer system 
microsoft and hewlettpackard which uses the windows display for 
a computer program called new wave contend that apples own program 
was not original but was derived from other companies works 
they also argue that the graphics apple is trying to protect are 
no more than basic ideas like the use of office equipment as 
symbols ideas cannot be copyrighted only expressions of ideas 
courts have also refused copyright protection when an idea can be 
expressed in only one way 
a verdict that gave broad protections to apples 
userfriendly displays could keep microsofts program which is 
compatible with international business machines equipment off ibm 
computers and could slow the development of software for systems 
like windows and new wave 
fridays ruling knocked out microsofts first line of defense 
against the lawsuit that the 1985 licensing agreement with apple 
allowing an early version of the display program called windows 10 
was broad enough to cover a later version such as windows 203 
schwarzer said his ruling was narrow and did not necessarily mean 
that any particular icons could not be duplicated 
the judge did not decide however whether microsoft had the 
right to duplicate icons that were contained in the earlier windows 
10 as well as windows 203 
schwarzer also expressed no view on apples argument that a 
program with the same look and feel as the macintosh display 
would violate the copyright that issue may be resolved when the 
case goes to trial

strikebound eastern airlines has notified aircraft brokers it 
wants to sell part of its 250plane fleet as its owners and 
machinists union hint that talks are under way to sell the carrier 
now reorganizing in bankruptcy court 
were exploring the market eastern spokesman robin matell 
told the associated press on friday he added that he did not know 
the total number of aircraft for sale but that it was nowhere 
near most of the fleet 
the notice to aircraft brokers worldwide was issued either 
thursday or friday and included listings of dc9s boeing 727s and 
757s matell said he said that the airline made similar notices 
hundreds of times in the past 
given the current situation it obviously draws much greater 
attention and people wonder just what it means matell said 
noting that the company had made it clear since the machinists 
struck the carrier nearly two weeks ago that assets would be sold to 
finance easterns rebuilding 
there is nothing unusual about the companys latest attempt 
to sell aircraft matell insisted 
easterns pilots who joined with flight attendants in sympathy 
strikes against the carrier have maintained that easterns parent 
company is stripping the companys assets to prop up nonunion 
sister continental airlines 
in another development friday a pan am corp union official said 
he would meet with the leader of easterns striking machinists in 
miami to discuss a possible joint employee buyout of the two 
airlines 
william f genoese director of the teamsters unions airline 
division told the associated press that he and machinists district 
100 president charles bryan plan to discuss a buyout plan saturday 
to combine the airlines 
pan am like eastern has been racked by financial losses and 
labor tensions pan am chairman tom plaskett recently said the 
carrier probably would need to merge with another airline to ensure 
its survival 
texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo has indicated a renewed 
interest in selling all or parts of eastern since the airline filed 
for bankruptcy protection march 9 eastern is operating only about 
10 percent of its prestrike schedule of 1040 daily flights 
its possible that the most sensible way for eastern airlines 
to proceed would be for some different types of ownership in some 
way lorenzo said in an interview recorded for abctvs 2020 
show friday night 
but lorenzo promised that his goal hasnt been to sell off 
eastern 
bryan the union chief who for years has advocated employee 
control as a leading solution for easterns problems confirmed he 
would meet with genoese but declined to say whether they would 
explore an easternpan am combination 
were going to be discussing a whole range of subjects the 
machinists leader said adding i never make any statements about 
any possible sales or transactions 
financial analysts say the leading potential buyer for eastern 
remains financier carl icahn the owner and chairman of trans world 
airlines inc bryan has talked to icahn several times in the past 
year about buying eastern 
meanwhile attorneys for eastern pilots on friday promised to 
protest to a bankruptcy judge about the apparent transfer of eastern 
landing slots to sister carrier continental on the eve of the 
bankruptcy filing 
other documents obtained by the attorneys indicated eastern also 
gained federal approval for transfer of other slots to rivals pan am 
and united airlines just before the strike began two weeks ago 
we think these transactions just strengthen the employees 
position that a trustee should be appointed by the bankruptcy 
court to oust the present management which has been doing this for 
years said james linsey a new york attorney for the air line 
pilots association 
the unions contend that lorenzo has systematically sold off 
eastern assets or transferred them to predominantly nonunion 
continental at cutrate prices 
the pilots attorneys say they believe the transfers of eight 
landing slots at new yorks la guardia airport and eight at 
washingtons national airport to continental are permanent although 
continental spokesman art kent said they were 60day leases no 
details were made public on the amount of money involved 
continental has been advertising new flights between miami and la 
guardia and washington on miami radio stations 
eastern spokesman jim ashlock said the deals for the slot 
transfers which are effective in april were made last october 
these two things just dont relate to the strike or bankruptcy 
they were made before we knew that was going to happen ashlock 
said 
ashlock said the transfers of six pan am slots at new yorks 
kennedy airport are temporary and only for summer which is pan ams 
peak travel season the transfers of six chicago slots to united are 
permanent he didnt have details on the amounts of money involved 
bryan indicated union attorneys will challenge all recent assets 
transfers and sales before the bankruptcy court including deals 
made before the strike and bankruptcy filing 
the strike began march 4 with a walkout by 8500 machinists 
mechanics and ground service workers in a dispute over 125 million 
in proposed wage cuts the strike quickly escalated with the support 
of pilots and flight attendants five days later eastern filed for 
bankruptcy reorganization

usborn john hull 
accused as a drug runner and a man who violated costa ricas 
neutrality in central american conflicts said friday this country 
is persecuting him for political motives 
hull 69 a costa rican citizen and rancher born in evansville 
ind spoke to reporters for the first time since costa rican 
brought charges against him two months ago 
he said the federal bureau of investigation the central 
intelligence agency and us congressional committees all have 
cleared him of wrongdoing after investigations 
ill repeat that this case is no more than a politicaleconomic 
plot against me hull declared he said costa rica was embarrassed 
by revelations in the irancontra scandal that some contra supplies 
went through costa rica and is prosecuting him as a scapegoat 
on jan 13 hull was charged with allowing a runway on his ranch 
near the nicaraguan border to be used for shipping drugs to the 
united states the money to be used to buy arms for the usbacked 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
he spent two months in jail before being freed on 37500 bond 
because of poor health following a heart attack 
at his ranch is a 1800foot strip where the government alleges 
drugladen planes left for miami 
hulls lawyer juan jose sobrado who appeared with him friday 
said planes carrying drugs need a bigger runway and that the 
government confused the hull ranch with another landing strip nearby 
surely george morales confused hulls landing strip with that 
of llano grande four kilometers 2 miles to the north where 
larger planes can land or take off where the runway is 8000 feet 
long sobrado said 
testimony before the us congress said small planes used hulls 
landing strip for drug runs 
to carry cargos of 25000 pounds of marijuana and 1000 kilos 
2200 pounds of cocaine planes like cessna 404 and 402 are 
needed which require runways at least 8000 feet long and the 
runway on the hull ranch is only 1800 feet the lawyer said 
sobrado said costa rican authorities based their accusations 
against hull on statements colombian drug trafficker george morales 
made in an interview on cbs 
hull himself cited an article published in july 1987 in the new 
york times which he said called accusations against him political 
fantasies 
he displayed the charges drawn against him by costa rican 
authorities which concluded there is no assurance that drugs have 
left from john hulls landing strip 
despite this conclusion they have accused and jailed me 
unjustly in a case typical of political persecution hull said 
the only thing i did was provide humanitarian aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels that consisted of clothing medicine and food 
between 1984 and 1985 this was known by the thenpresident luis 
alberto monge the minister of security and the rural police and 
this was public knowledge 
the man who is costa ricas president now oscar arias won the 
1987 nobel peace prize for his efforts toward ending central 
american conflicts in which costa rican policy is officially neutral 
hull said that because of financial difficulties he has had to 
reduce the help on his ranch about 60 miles north of san jose and 
30 miles from the nicaraguan border from 100 to 70 people 
hull cultivates oranges pineapples nuts and other fruits for 
export 
the harvest has dropped considerably because the banks have 
denied me credit for two years and exports have dropped hull said 
he said if costa rican authorities give permission he will go to 
the united states for a medical examination to see if he needs heart 
surgery 
sobrando complained the government has interfered with his 
telephone service since taking up the hull case but the lawyer said 
that otherwise he has not been pressured

the government and the countrys main 
guerrilla group signed an accord friday to begin talks april 1 
toward permanently ending their 16yearold insurgency 
president virgilio barco in a nationwide television address 
friday night called on the countrys other leftist guerrilla groups 
to follow suit 
the accord was signed in the mountain town of santo domingo 180 
miles south of bogota by the minister of interior raul orejuela 
bueno and carlos pizarro commander of the m19 or the april 19 
movement 
a joint declaration said four meetings that led to the accord 
were held in colombia and mexico after the leftist guerrillas 
declared a unilateral ceasefire eight months ago 
the declaration said both sides agreed on talks beginning april 1 
that would lead to full democracy and reintegrate the insurgents 
into society 
the talks are to finish before legislative elections set for 
march 1990 in which m19 probably will participate as a legal 
political party officials said 
the agreement did not say when the guerrillas would have to give 
up their arms 
barco said the accord opens a time of hope for the fate of the 
country but he said there large obstacles to overcome before 
attaining peace 
the president called on other guerrilla groups fighting the 
government for more than 20 years to join m19 in the peace talks 
an estimated 10000 leftist guerrillas operate in colombia they 
are blamed for more than 2000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings in 
1988 alone 
i urge all guerrillas to integrate themselves in civilian life 
the road is always open barco said 
he signaled that the government is ready to begin talks with the 
revolutionary armed forces of colombia a communist rebel group that 
declared a unilateral ceasefire feb 28 in an effort to join the 
peace process 
however barco said the ceasefire must hold for a certain period 
of time to determine if the farc has a genuine spirit of 
reconciliation 
the joint declaration also said the guerrillas will no longer 
operate underground and will base themselves in santo domingo where 
they receive state protection and will not be subject to harassment 
by the army 
during the signing ceremony orejuela said all sides must stay 
vigilant because there are people interested in seeing that a 
process like this one fails 
the declaration said 13 guerrilla delegates who had no criminal 
record participated in the talks and had government protection 
the april 19 movement takes its name from a 1970 presidential 
election that the guerrillas say was fraudulent 
once the nations most notorious group m19s bloodiest 
operation was seizing the supreme court building in bogota in 1985 
the army retook the building but 11 supreme court justices and 85 
other people were killed

technical experts concluded friday that a missile 
caused the crash of an italian airliner in 1980 but they failed to 
determine who fired it 
all 81 people aboard the itavia dc9 perished when the plane 
plunged into the tyrrhenian sea on june 27 1980 during a flight 
from bologna to palermo sicily 
the six experts said in a 477page report that the disaster was 
caused by a missile exploding in the rear section of the plane 
an airplane near the dc9 at the time of the incident may have 
been involved in the disaster the report said but added it was not 
possible to identify the second plane or tell whether it was an 
aggressor or also a target 
at this point we lack sufficient elements to determine the 
type the startingpoint and the identity of the missile that 
downed the plane the experts said in their report 
the six specialists had been appointed in 1986 by rome magistrate 
vittorio bucarelli who is investigating the case 
italys minister of defense valerio zanone ordered the air 
force to study the report

his cameo roles in movies are often jewels but ian 
holms latest tv assignment offers something more the sustained 
screen exposure any actor craves 
its a huge great leading role and its been a long time 
since id done that holm said of game set and match granada 
televisions adaptation of the len deighton trilogy which starts its 
13part run march 26 on pbs 
holm 57 has made an art form out of the supporting role a 
robot in alien a fictionalized lewis carroll in dreamchild 
a maudlin dinner guest in wetherby and his oscarnominated turn 
as the eccentric running coach in chariots of fire 
now he comes to deightons cloakanddagger world as bernard 
samson a laconic mi6 secret agent who suffers the ultimate betrayal 
the discovery that his wife is a soviet mole 
the 855 million series took more than a year to make shooting 
in mexico germany and england it was the first film to be allowed 
to shoot on location at checkpoint charlie the american crossing 
point through the berlin wall 
it becomes a way of life you cant really believe its 
finishing he said as somebody said my god were all still 
speaking to each other 
during that time holm says he could have made four major 
movies but with all these cameos behind me i sort of thought 
lets go for it 
the series is vintage deighton quirky multistranded and as 
complex as a times crossword puzzle viewers dare not blink for fear 
of missing a clue 
it offers an abundance of meaty supporting roles for its british 
and german cast but its basic texture is oblique and understated a 
perfect vehicle for holms extraordinary ability to express seething 
emotion beneath a calm surface 
i suppose i leapt for the role in a way the slightly 
built amiable holm said in an interview that included imitations of 
john gielgud reminiscences of a chance supper with john le carre 
and thoughts about the acting techniques of john hurt and robert 
deniro 
a psychiatrists son holm is chiefly admired for the stillness 
and unfussy psychological truth of his technique londons weekly 
observer newspaper recently asked actors to name their favorite 
actor holm came second behind laurence olivier 
its the best compliment one can garner said holm pleased 
at being thought of as an actors actor but he offers no blueprint 
for success i dont mean to be flip but you learn your lines and 
get on with it 
im very happy doing nothing im a great doingnothinger he 
said i like having time to stand and stare 
his ability to disappear into a role is reflected in public 
reaction to his work in alien alien was a huge success but 
people would say have you seen alien id say i was in it 
a graduate of londons prestigious royal academy of dramatic art 
holm was a leading classical actor in the 1950s and 1960s 
he played the fool to charles laughtons king lear and his 
richard iii in the royal shakespeare companys landmark 1963 the 
wars of the roses was likened to oliviers 
his portrayal of the repressed lenny in harold pinters the 
homecoming won him a 1967 tony award when it transferred to 
broadway 
but in 1976 while heading a revival of eugene oneills the 
iceman cometh holm suffered a nervous breakdown during the first 
preview and dropped out 
im not a particularly emotional nervous or depressive type 
so when that thing happened it was a severe shock he said 
holm has since appeared in only one play a london fringe staging 
of chekhovs uncle vanya he says the stage still absolutely 
terrifies me and he refused the starring role in the upcoming 
west end production of the broadway hit m butterfly anthony 
hopkins got the part 
he enjoys making movies and would like to work again with woody 
allen after appearing alongside gene hackman one of his favorite 
actors in allens recent another woman 
his next film role is as the welsh captain fluellen in henry 
v alongside paul scofield derek jacobi judi dench and kenneth

actor taurean blacque says he sometimes has an 
eerie feeling that his role as the head of a black family in the new 
nbc daytime serial generations was lifted right out of his own 
life 
blacque stars as henry marshall owner of a successful chain of 
ice cream stores in chicago and the father of three children in 
generations which debuts on monday patricia crowley stars as 
the matriarch of the white family in the show 
the serial created by sally sussman who is also the executive 
producer marks the first time a daytime soap opera has ever 
premiered with black actors in such prominent roles 
the character reminds me a lot of me in real life said 
blacque who is probably best known for his role as detective neal 
washington in the muchhonored police series hill street blues 
i have a large family eight children i have a son almost 
identical to adam my son on the show adam came to me in an episode 
and asked me to bail him out of a scrape at the fraternity with 
3000 that happened to my own son i couldnt let this role go by 
i wanted to share what we parents go through black and white 
blacque who is divorced has two grown children and a grandchild 
and has recently taken six young children into his home 
it began during the last year of hill street blues when the 
los angeles county department of childrens services asked him to be 
a spokesman for the adoption of black children 
i said i wanted to be involved he said i said i wanted to 
know what it was all about i wanted to speak from experience 
first he adopted a set of twin boys chris and paul since then 
hes adopted jennifer 2 mark 15 months whitley 13 months and 
marshall one month jennifer mark and marshall are brothers and 
sister marshall got his name from blacques new role which he got 
on the day the boy was born 
blacque has a fulltime nanny to look after the children and 
recently leased the house nextdoor so that he can adopt three more 
children 
i now have a 9to5 work schedule he said which is 
perfect for the children 
blacque heard about the new serial when he ran into actress joan 
pringle at an naacp awards dinner a year ago 
she told me about generations and said youd be perfect for 
my husband blacque recalled 
i called my agent and he said nbc wanted me for the role but 
hed told them i wasnt interested in doing a soap opera well we 
quickly arranged for an audition and i was cast in the role 
patricia crowley heads the cast as attorney rebecca whitmore 
matriarch of the whitmore family and a longtime friend of henry 
marshall 
its breaking new ground just like hill street blues did 
said blacque who starred for seven years in that show his role as 
henry marshall is totally different from detective neal washington 
as is his physical appearance the beard and the trademark toothpick 
are gone and his trimmed hair now has traces of gray 
the bond between the marshalls and the whitmores goes back three 
generations marshalls motherinlaw lynn hamilton had been 
housekeeper for the whitmores and her daughter joan pringle grew 
up in the house the marshalls have three children chantal sharon 
brown adam kristoff st john and jacqueline marshall rhymes the 
latter role and those of her husband and children have not yet been 
cast 
marshall is a former gang member who with the help of a strong 
wife turned his grandmothers recipe for ice cream into a growing 
business hes a man who wants to pass his success on to his 
children and is as demanding of them as he is of himself 
in particular that puts him into conflict with his son who 
doesnt see the value of staying in college for a masters degree in 
business administration 
i dont like the way my sons taking care of business he 
said hes going to be in for a rude awakening henrys also a man 
who takes kids off the street and out of the gangs and gives them 
jobs 
blacque said of the show its so positive i think thats why 
were all doing it if we can reach youngsters and show them other 
ways besides guns and drugs we can show them that you can make 
it as a black person

work less 
that doesnt sound like the people who brought west germany up 
from the ashes of world war ii and made it the rich and powerful 
nation it is today 
but it is the trend these days among workers some of whom 
already are on the job only 32 hours or four days a week 
work is not in the center of life anymore says meinhard 
miegel a social scientist who heads the institute for economy and 
society in bonn leisure time has become a more important part of 
german life 
this is not laziness this is just a normal expression of a 
very wealthy socitive even for 
industry 
people have become much more relaxed without hurting the 
countrys overall productivity more free time increases creativity 
and spontaneity which is important for a nation 
but industrial groups maintain the trend will mean higher labor 
costs 
we do see a danger that other countries might start to look 
more appealing to some companies says hermann olbermann 
spokesman for gesamtmetall an organization that represents 
employers in the metalworking and electronics industries 
the issue has set off a lively debate across west germany as 
workers demand further reductions in their working time which for 
unionized employees now range from 32 to 39 hours a week 
oskar lafontaine deputy leader of west germanys opposition 
social democrats and governor of saarland state came under fire of 
union friends last year by saying further cuts in the work week 
would be acceptable only if workers took less money 
unions want a shorter work week but not be at the expense of wage 
increases 
employers counter that continuous pay increases coupled with 
lessened working hours could hinder companies ability to make a 
reasonable profit and also make west germany less attractive as a 
place to do business 
while west german workers have a reputation for industriousness 
in recent years they have succeeded in shrinking working hours to 
the extent that on average according to some estimates they now 
spend less time on the job a year than any other workers in the 
world 
the german employers association west germanys largest 
organization representing the interests of german businesses says 
that a worker averages 1716 hours on the job annually compared 
with 1912 hours in the united states and 2138 in the netherlands 
a few hundred employees at an aachen tire plant are already 
scheduled to go on a threeday work week spread over 32 hours and 
some workers with the bmw auto company work a fourday 36hour week 
west germans are also the bestpaid workers in europe in 1987 
the average hourly wage including benefits was the equivalent of 
about 18 compared to about 15 an hour for the dutch exclusive of 
benefits the west german average hourly wage is 10 compared to 
954 in the united states 
west germans also get 30 working days of annual vacation which 
amounts to six weeks for those working a fiveday week and more for 
those who work fewer and than five days 
indicative of the lesswork trend thousands of teachers and 
newspaper employees went on strike recently in demand of shorter 
working hours or no weekend work 
in addition the ig metall union west germanys largest labor 
organization with more than 2 million members is battling with 
employers for a cut in the number of weekly hours for metalworkers 
to 35 from an average of 375 
but employers organizations like gesamtmetall are starting to 
resist 
these ig metall demands would put companies at a distinct 
disadvantage compared with labor conditions in other countries 
says olbermann spokesman for the colognebased gesamtmetall 
in making its demands for shorter working hours ig metall says 
further cuts are needed as a means of reducing west germanys 8 
percent unemployment rate 
we think that the reduction of working time is the only 
possibility to create new jobs says martin oertel an ig metall 
spokesman at union headquarters in frankfurt 
but employers are not likely to hire more workers when it means 
extra costs for mandatory social programs while workers arent 
willing to take salary cuts for shorter hours 
west german companies chalk up good profits every year and the 
country remains one of the most productive in the world 
thats why juergen fusswinkel a mechanic at a bonn volkswagen 
dealership believes he should work less 
free time has become very important because we germans are 
known for highquality work and there is a lot of pressure to keep 
this up employees deserve their free time for all their hard work

a feeling is growing that what this economy needs 
is a good oldfashioned recession 
that option a distasteful one was avoided by most 
positivethinking folks until just the past few weeks there must be 
easier ways better ways to get a grip on inflation they said but 
now they wonder their doubts increase 
the doubts are aroused by the failure of words fears warnings 
and rising money costs to do very much to slow expansion of the 
economy which most reasonable economists believe has about reached 
its limits 
the economy needs a rest they say consumption has to slow in 
order for producers to catch up to make their factories bigger and 
more productive a bigger labor pool is needed too but that takes 
time you cant speed it up 
while there is much agreement among economists public and private 
about the situation they havent been able to convince the public 
week after week their warnings are ignored their forecasts sneered 
at their theories exploded 
consumer confidence rises and when that happens people buy 
even if they have to borrow to do so manufacturers express 
confidence about an even bigger economy by raising expenditures for 
bigger and better factories 
manufacturers are also building their inventories which amounts 
to defiance of all the threats and warnings of a downturn what if 
they cant sell off the inventories good old rebates and 
belowmarket financing they say 
so far it appears rising interest rates have done little to 
sober up buyers ask most consumers what rates they pay on credit 
cards and they cant say ask what percentage of interest payments 
are tax deductible 20 percent and they can only guess ask if 
interest on their homeequity loan is capped most arent and they 
cant respond 
by his actions alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve 
board believes the absence of fears the strong expectations and the 
expressions of confidence add up to a false picture of reality 
the reality he suggests is that the economy cannot do 
everything expected of it that inflation is an inevitable 
consequence of trying to exceed the economys capability and that 
even higher interest rates might be required 
reality he indicates must be reestablished in american life 
there are critics however who believe that the fed itself is 
unrealistic in attempting to bring a highflying economy with many 
ailments to a soft landing through higher interest rates 
rising interest rates for example add billions of dollars to 
uncle sams credit costs interefere with the ticklish rescue of 
already undermined savings and loan institutions and worsen the 
plight of thirdworld nations 
higher interest rates can also force up the value of the dollar 
which in turn could make it more difficult for american exporters to 
remain competitive which probably would worsen the us balance of 
payments deficit 
slowing the economy by pressing the interest rate key never was 
an easy job it has led to more recessions intentional and 
accidental than any other invention of economic minds and the job 
today is even more sensitive 
it is made especially so because of the great gap that seems to 
exist between reality as perceived by the economys private sector 
which attempts to expand and the federal reserve which seeks to 
contract 
conceivably the gap might be closed only through 
recessionintentional or accidental

on march 27 1964 an earthquake of 
recordbreaking proportions seized southcentral alaska and set off 
sea waves that punished faroff pacific ports ward sims now 
retired as ap bureau chief for alaska covered the disaster 
</TEXT>

the earthquake that shuddered across 
alaska on that good friday packed so strong a punch that it knocked 
out a seismograph in fairbanks it took a seismologist at a small 
college in mobile ala to warn the world of what was to come 
it could cause great devastation louis eisele predicted 
you can expect tidal waves from this one 
the earthquake had been felt by eiseles spring hill college 
seismograph it said the temblor was centered about 3600 miles 
northwest of mobile in the gulf of alaska or near kodiak island 
at 85 on the richter scale the 1964 earthquake was the most 
powerful ever in north america and one of the strongest on record 
in the words of the us geological survey the entire earth 
vibrated like a tuning fork 
the quake started at 536 pm alaska standard time on march 27 
centered under a glaciated peninsula 75 miles east of anchorage it 
altered 100000 square miles of landscape 
along a 600mile arc from cape yakataga on the eastern gulf of 
alaska to the trinity islands southwest of kodiak the land to the 
north subsided by as much as six feet to the south it rose by as 
much as 50 feet 
land shifted horizontally as much as 70 feet in several places 
south of seward tangling railroad tracks splitting roads yanking 
down buildings 
property damage exceeded 311 million 
the earthquake and the seismic sea waves it spawned killed 114 
people in alaska more than a dozen others died at depoe bay ore 
and crescent city calif when seismic waves crashed ashore at 
those communities 
in the aftermath came the stories of the lucky and the luckless 
often merest circumstance determined who died and who survived 
in anchorage william tobin had just parked his car outside the 
new jc penney building when he felt a jolt he stepped from his 
car ready to have words with another driver 
i thought some stupid jerk had rammed me from behind says 
tobin managing editor of the anchorage times 
as he got out a huge slab of the building crashed down 
flattening his car 
nine people in anchorage werent so lucky 
in valdez many residents had turned out as usual to watch the 
freighter chena disgorge its cargo the arrival of the 400foot ship 
always was something special for valdez folks and on this day 
typically a crowd was on hand as longshoremen unloaded the vessel 
in an eternity that lasted only moments valdez was shaken 
unmercifully and the chena began wallowing insanely snapping her 
mooring lines the dock heaved rocked shook and then pitched into 
the water carrying onlookers and warehouses 
the chena survived the valdez waterfront and most of the 
business district were obliterated by collapsing ground and seismic 
waves 
thirtyone people died 
in kodiak norman holm and his son were fishing for herring from 
a skiff in the harbor holm could not understand why he suddenly 
lost control of the small boat 
i just couldnt make it respond it kept bouncing bouncing 
he says 
when the movement subsided holm headed to the dock he and his 
son oliver helped secure several fishing boats which had broken 
loose he checked the lines of his own 72foot neptune 
the level of water in the harbor started fluctuating wildly and 
then holm heard the terrible roar of water coming up the channel 
the frightening noise of docks and buildings collapsing 
the holms sprinted for shore as the dock creaked and groaned 
under the pressure of the rising water at the head of the dock 
holm fought the impulse to seek safety atop an eightfoot wooden 
tank used to keep crabs alive he and his son raced about 150 yards 
farther to the base of pillar mountain the hill which forms 
kodiaks backdrop 
with the sound of bedlam in the harbor behind them they clawed 
their way up the steep slope to an elevation of about 150 feet holm 
was too exhausted to go farther he told his son to go on but the 
boy stayed with his father 
the two watched in awe as huge waves battered kodiak for six 
hours the city lost most of its seafood processing industry 75 
percent of its business district and half its fishing fleet 
including the good ship neptune the wooden crab tank vanished 
nineteen people died 
in chenega avis anderson was preparing to take a bath when the 
tiny prince william sound village began shaking she scooped up her 
two sons and dashed up a forest trail to the safety of a high knoll 
behind her she could hear the sound of waves estimated up to 80 
feet tall smashing the village only 70 miles from the quakes 
epicenter of the 20 buildings in the town only the school was 
spared 
twentythree people died including andersons daughter parents 
a grandmother an uncle and an aunt 
i had horrible horrible nightmares for almost 20 years she 
says always they were the same i would be climbing up and up 
and the waves would be creeping higher and higher

lidia selkregg speaks quickly gesturing 
intently as she recalls the day the earth unleashed titanic forces 
in alaska and the land slid heaved and sank 
deep beneath the coastline of prince william sound giant layers 
of rock jostled and slipped on march 27 1964 the earthquake 
measured 85 on the richter scale and it killed 131 people as far 
south as california 
now selkregg a geologist and former anchorage assemblywoman 
says she fears many officials and developers have forgotten that 
days tragic lessons 
they want to think they are more powerful than god nature is 
nature she said adding i feel terrible that i have to say 
what im saying 
some devastated cities have rebuilt away from the areas that 
proved vulnerable in 1964 but in others including anchorage 
reconstruction was on the old sites selkregg and others are afraid 
that will mean greater losses in the next great quake something 
they call inevitable 
im positive there will be one i just dont know when says 
john davies state seismologist but i think the tendency is for 
us to forget the lessons 
in anchorage safetyconscious engineers have clashed with 
developmentoriented land owners since the rebuilding began 
there is a camp that essentially believes development should go 
forward anywhere in the city with little or no regard to the 
consequences of earthquakes says dave cole an engineer and past 
chairman of the citys advisory geotechnical commission 
anchorage building codes have addressed the safety of buildings 
but not the ground beneath critics say that means sturdy structures 
have been built on land thats prone to slide notably high ground 
sought after for its views 
around anchorage in 1964 the primary reason for damage and loss 
of life was not the shaking of ground but rather the failure of the 
bluff areas davies said were rebuilding on those areas 
right now 
indeed theyre some of the citys prime pieces of land 
its nicer property the view property says john aho an 
engineer and 12year member of the geotechnical commission its 
been long enough since 1964 so people have forgotten how hard 
things can shake 
the developers are not really into wanting to hear about these 
things the administration doesnt want to hear about these things 
people who own the property dont want to hear 
before the quake homes stood on turnagain street but a 
quaketriggered landslide dragged the neighborhood into the sea 
theres debate over whether the site has been adequately buttressed 
on l street site of another major slide highrise buildings 
have been allowed to sprout looming over condominiums below 
l street thats the one i have no question saying it will move 
again if there is a large enough long enough earthquake says 
duane miller head of the geotechnical commission 
but bruce phelps comprehensive planning manager for anchorage 
says he thinks the city has done enough to protect residents though 
he acknowledged im in the minority 
developers proceeded with construction in danger areas because 
there was no legal way to stop them he says 
its a major policy question do we develop i dont know if 
it was illadvised or not 
drafting more stringent regulations regarding ground failure may 
be too late now what happens with the buildings that already 
exist phelps says 
a draft seismic risk study ordered by the city estimates there 
could be 300 million in damage from another 64 quake almost half 
of it in slideprone areas coles says 
the report also indicates that during a midmorning earthquake of 
the 1964 temblors magnitude three people would die in the city 
because of structural damage 
the potential for death in my opinion was greatly 
understated aho says 
across alaska other cities also have had to deal with the 
ravages of the monster quake 
the valdez dock area collapsed into the harbor when 95foot waves 
lashed the waterfront the city since has been moved to more solid 
ground the old townsite stands barren 
its hard to predict what would happen if we had another one 
says doug griffin valdez city manager i believe that we have 
largely learned from the experience and that it would not be as 
bad 
seward also was in ruins after the 1964 quake the jolt and 
30foot waves destroyed more than buildings it ruined the economy 
the citys railroad tracks warehouses fuel tanks canneries ship 
loading and unloading facilities had been destroyed 
when the ground started shaking seward was the seaport for 
alaskas interior after that everything moved to anchorage 
says mayor harry gieseler 
that area was not rebuilt what weve done is move the 
industrial base across the bay to an area that is safe he says 
if another quake and sea wave come seward would fare better than 
last time gieseler says the way the bay lies all houses and 
things are above the 50foot line and thats where the water came 
up to last time 
but in kodiak there could be a rerun of the 1964 devastation 
there would be a lot more property loss because when the 
federal government assisted the city in rebuilding they rebuilt 
primarily where the event occurred says gordon gould city 
manager and head of kodiaks emergency management organization

the horror that rocked alaska 25 years ago 
inevitably will happen again somewhere as huge plates of earths 
crust regularly slip and produce monstrous earthquakes 
theres absolute certainty a great quake will hit earth 
somewhere every few years and almost as much certainty that every 
20 to 30 years well have one of the supergiant quakes as in chile 
in 1960 and alaska in 1964 said john nance author of on shaky 
ground an invitation to disaster 
in the united states alaska and perhaps the pacific northwest 
are most prone to superquakes but california and the eastern half 
of the united states have trembled violently in somewhat smaller 
temblors and will do so again 
its dangerous arrogance for any of us wherever we live to 
assume the problem is isolated to any particular region nance 
said by telephone from tacoma wash we stand united in the shadow 
of seismic peril 
the quake that shook southcentral alaska on march 27 1964 
measured 85 on the richter scale and 92 on the moment 
magnitude scale which seismologists say is the most accurate 
measure of large temblors 
that makes it the secondlargest quake ever recorded and one of 
only three supergiant quakes this century 
the largest was of magnitude 95 on may 21 1960 it generated a 
tsunami sea wave that killed 5700 people in chile the third 
superquake was of magnitude 90 on april 11 1952 on the kamchatka 
peninsula of the soviet union 
alaskas giant quake relieved so much underground stress that a 
repeat in the same location is unlikely for 300 to 1200 years said 
christopher stevens a us geological survey seismologist in menlo 
park calif 
a less powerful but still dangerous quake could hit the same area 
much sooner said usgs seismologist stuart nishenko in golden colo 
supergiant quakes and great ones over 8 on the richter scale 
are most likely along the edges of the enormous constantly drifting 
plates of rock that make up earths crust 
one danger zone is the circumpacific ring of fire which 
includes the pacific coasts of south central and north america 
japan and new zealand the other zone stretches from the 
mediterranean sea east through turkey iran the southern soviet 
union and into asia 
superquakes happen only in certain parts of these belts called 
subduction zones where thinner crustal plates beneath the oceans 
smash into and dive beneath thicker continental plates the diving 
plate often hangs up on the overlying plate for decades or 
centuries allowing tremendous stress to build 
at 536 pm on good friday in 1964 such stress reached the 
breaking point 12 miles beneath alaskas prince william sound a 
chunk of the pacific plate hundreds of square miles in area jerked 
spasmodically under alaska and the north american plate 
there is potential for similar sudden movement farther south 
a future quake equally destructive to alaska 1964 lurks only 
a few dozen miles off the oregonwashington coast ready to lash an 
area from northern vancouver island all the way to northern 
california killing thousands nance said 
although superquakes happen only along subduction zones lesser 
temblors can occur within plates such as in the interior of china 
and the eastern half of the united states 
three intraplate quakes estimated at up to 86 on the 
richter scale were centered on a fault deep beneath new madrid 
mo in 18111812 they killed several dozen people temporarily 
reversed the flow of the mississippi river and rang church bells as 
far away as boston 
robert ketter director of the national center for earthquake 
engineering research has estimated a modern new madrid quake would 
kill thousands 
the eastern seaboard is in more danger than the west because 
they are abysmally unprepared with building standards far less 
stringent than californias nance said

while solidarity seeks agreement with 
authorities at roundtable talks the small but noisy confederation 
for an independent poland has stepped up street protests in a drive 
for followers to fight communism 
shouts of kpn the groups initials in polish can be heard 
at most demonstrations these days its banners painted with a black 
anchor the symbol of the polish resistance during world war ii 
often appear in the front ranks of marches even those called by 
other groups 
strikes and demonstrations awaken peoples emotions and they 
become enthusiastic said zygmunt lenyk the kpn leader in krakow 
its easier to awaken the enthusiasm of people who strike and 
demonstrate than among those who sit 
lenyks tiny krakow apartment serves as the headquarters for a 
determined core of young activists dedicated to publicizing the name 
of the organization even though it is illegal 
kpn is the largest and most active of a range of smaller 
opposition groups that reject cooperation with the government and 
criticize solidarity on grounds that it is too moderate 
the groups which also include fighting solidarity and the banned 
polish socialist party have become more active in recent months and 
appear to be trying to coordinate activities through joint meetings 
of the selfstyled antisystem opposition 
during a recent national kpn congress a small brigade of young 
people covered city walls with black anchors until they ran out of 
paint while more than 200 of their elders debated the 
organizations future strategy 
if we want to be a civilized country we must liquidate 
socialism lenyk said we have to become a parliamentary 
country and we want to liquidate communism 
socialism and communism often are used interchangeably 
kpns straightforward strategy has begun to win new sympathizers 
many of whom once belonged to solidarity 
but kpn is far from becoming a movement on the scale of 
solidarity which as a labor union claimed 10 million members in 
1981 kpn claims an active membership of 1600 and 1000 more in 
youth organizations 
kpn was founded by the historian leszek moczulski on sept 1 
1979 the 40th anniversary of hitlers invasion of poland 
supporters say they are attracted by the clarity of kpns call for 
polands independence from communist authorities and the soviet 
union 
though the group claims to favor a peaceful path to independence 
young members of kpn often wear military caps and pants and shirts 
made of camouflage fabric and have thrown stones at police in 
protests they say such action is taken only in selfdefense 
the organizations militarism and staunch anticommunism has 
resulted in a rift between kpn and solidarity leaders who are now 
seeking change by talking with polish government officials 
kpn fighting solidarity and other independence groups are 
treated by us as rival organizations said zbigniew bujak head of 
the warsaw region of solidarity 
but kpn appeals to those who favor fighting communists rather 
than supporting a strategy of negotiating changes with authorities 
i was always engaged in the fight for a free poland solidarity 
is a trade union so now im going with kpn said henryk holfeier 
a retired economist and former solidarity member who joined kpn a 
year ago 
i was attracted to a program with very decisive and clear 
goals said maria grcor a psychologist and editor of opinia 
krakowska a bimonthly underground publication solidaritys goals 
are clear but they are too few and too small 
grcor is also a former solidarity member 
kpns ultimate goal is full independence for a democratic free 
poland she said solidarity is a bridge to this goal and our 
interests are linked together 
while solidarity defends the right of independent groups to 
exist the union leadership has kept its distance from kpn 
maintaining it intends only to be a trade union 
kpns main activity is street protests 
street demonstrations break down the barrier of fear and 
encourage the belief that people can do something said grcow 
our main goal is for the group to become a mass organization that 
will have an influence on society kpn has attracted strong 
support among students especially in krakow where university 
students allied with kpn founded a new group they call the student 
organization 
the historic center of this southern city has been the scene 
recently of several violent clashes between young people and police 
and kpn has been represented at almost every demonstration

christopher columbus discoveries in the 
new world brought riches to this ancient city in southern spain 
five centuries later columbus is doing it again 
this time it is expo 92 an exhibition commemorating columbus 
voyages it will run for six months and end on oct 12 1992 500 
years to the day the explorer reached land in the caribbean 
expo 92 is a gamble by spains socialist government to catapult 
one of europes most beautiful and most neglected cities into the 
21st century 
on an island across the guadalquivir river from the old citys 
narrow streets and shaded patios construction workers labor under a 
warm sun to transform about 600 acres of largely barren space into 
the biggest international exposition ever held 
the monastery where columbus remains were once buried is being 
restored as the spanish royal pavillion where king juan carlos 
expects to greet dignitaries from the 88 countries including the 
united states that have signed up to take part in expo 92 
a new railroad station will be built on the tracks that run by 
the site and a bullet train will carry passengers to the exhibition 
in half the three hours time it takes now 
but right now seville is snarled in traffic as work progresses on 
dozens of new bridges roads and other public works that must be 
completed by opening day april 20 1992 
in addition to the 922 million the government has budgeted for 
administrative costs and onsite construction authorities will pour 
an estimated 56 billion into public works projects to improve 
roads railways and airports throughout southern spain 
seville is going to have a difficult time because its a small 
city for so much construction said antonio rodriguez almodovar 
who coordinates public works funded by the regional andalusian 
government 
weve got to ask residents for patience and compassion because 
after 1992 this is going to be the most important city in southern 
europe rodriguez added 
the government of prime minister felipe gonzalez a native of 
seville has billed expo 92 as the starting point for the citys 
economic renaissance 
angel ojeda the andalusian autonomous regional tax commissioner 
and a member of the expo 92 corps board of administrators said 
the project is expected to break even on the proceeds from entry 
fees royalties pavillion rental and sponsors contributions 
once the administrative capital of spains overseas empire 
seville now presides over andalusia the countrys poorest region 
where unemployment runs at about 30 percent compared to the national 
jobless rate of 187 percent 
a recent study by the national employment institute estimated the 
exhibition will generate 130000 construction jobs over the next 
four years about 7000 other people will be needed to keep expo 92 
running 
forty million people are expected to visit the exhibition which 
will leave seville with an olympic stadium a communications center 
a huge municipal park several theaters and hundreds of new 
buildings that organizers hope will house a research and development 
complex spain will be the host of the 1992 summer olympics 
six high technology companies ibm alcatel telefonica de 
espana fujitsu rank xerox and siemens have signed contracts to 
convert their pavillions into research and development and 
jobtraining centers after the fair ends 
the expo 92 corp has what it calls the 1993 plan a 
postexhibition project to cut travel time between seville and the 
coastal resort areas of malaga to the southeast huelva to the 
southwest and cadiz to the south rather than massive investments 
in hotels in seville itself the number of hotel beds in seville 
will be doubled however 
its better to improve communication with the huelva coast 
which will be 45 minutes away than build hotels in seville that are 
forced to close in 1993 said jacinto pellon general director of 
the expo 92 corp 
three luxury hotels are planned for the expo 92 site along with 
an expo city of residential units for people who come here to 
set up the exhibitions 
expo 92 project has not missed any construction deadlines so 
far and public works coordinator rodriguez said contracts called 
for all the major public works to be finished on time 
but pellon said poor administrative coordination has held up 
approval of marina de sevilla a private 696million complex that 
includes a civic center 300room hotel a marina and shopping 
center on about 40 acres of public land along the river 
marina de sevillas managing director arturo moya said if the 
city and central governments do not approve the development by may 1 
investors will reconsider the project among the investors is 
management resources of tustin calif which has pledged a 
33percent stake

agriculture is under constant assault from 
drought pests and disease a key defense is genetic material in 
seeds that can alter and fortify species the seed banks that store 
this material called germplasm thus stand literally between world 
plenty and famine but chronic neglect at americas largest seed 
bank threatens the precious hoard as reported in the first story of 
a threepart ap extra series seeds of conflict

thousands of irreplaceable crop seeds 
are dead or dying in an antiquated underfunded federal seed bank 
imperiling the future of us agriculture 
furthermore the united states is jeopardizing access to new seed 
samples by banning seed trade with six countries it considers 
adversaries 
these are principal findings of a threemonth associated press 
investigation of us policies affecting germplasm the plant 
genetic material needed to breed heartier crops able to resist 
drought pests disease and the global warming trend called the 
greenhouse effect 
american farmers are reaping four times the corn and potatoes per 
acre that they could 50 years ago wheat and rice yields have 
doubled at least half of these gains come from higheryielding crop 
varieties bred with germplasm from around the world 
germplasm is as important as air food or water said henry 
l shands national leader of the us department of agricultures 
germplasm program 
the national seed storage laboratory housed in a threestory 
yellow building on the colorado state university campus in fort 
collins is the worlds largest seed bank its nine concrete 
subfreezing storage vaults bulge with 232210 seed samples in paper 
and aluminum packets 
but the ap found that in tests conducted within the last five 
years only 28 percent of the samples or 64036 met a government 
standard that 66 percent of the seeds in a sample will sprout 
fully 72 percent 168174 samples either havent been tested in 
at least five years contain too few seeds to risk testing or 
failed to meet the 66 percent standard 
i would maintain that these seed banks are seed morgues what 
goes in isnt going to come out alive said major goodman a crop 
geneticist at the university of north carolina 
many untested samples are certainly dead or dying either because 
of improper storage or failure to regrow them quickly enough said 
garrison wilkes a crop scientist at the university of massachusetts 
in boston 
and efforts to replenish the collection are being jeopardized by 
us foreign policy an ap examination of hundreds of pages of 
government documents revealed 
despite an official policy supporting the free flow of germplasm 
among all nations the united states has quietly banned germplasm 
trade with six countries it considers unfriendly north korea cuba 
cambodia vietnam nicaragua and libya 
some usda officials have fought the embargoes fearing a backlash 
in which other third world countries would deny germplasm to the 
united states developing countries are the birthplace of most 
important food crops and it is there geneticists must go to search 
for desirable new traits 
the issue is expected to flare april 1721 at a meeting in rome 
of the commission on plant genetic resources part of the un food 
and agriculture organization 
recent advances in genetic engineering have further raised the 
stakes the ability to swap genes among different species will 
greatly reduce the time it takes to breed new crop varieties 
jeremy rifkin a wellknown activist who has won important court 
battles to regulate biotechnology filed suit in 1987 charging the 
usda with harming the environment by failing to safeguard its seed 
samples a decision is expected soon 
a visit to the fort collins lab found no guards or alarm systems 
protecting the seeds or costly lab equipment the vaults are 
protected by a metal gate secured only with a common padlock campus 
police patrols provide the only insurance against thieves or 
terrorists 
even critics acknowledge however that conditions have recently 
improved 
for much of its 31year existence the lab operated on budgets of 
less than half a million dollars funding more than doubled in 1988 
from 927580 to 2 million 
much of the credit is given to shands and steve a eberhart a 
research geneticist who became the labs director in march 1987 
under eberhart staff has been increased and vital seed data are 
being transferred from file cards to computers 
but even eberhart concedes it will take years and millions more 
dollars to correct the labs failings 
a computer analysis performed by usda officials at the aps 
request found that 104135 samples almost half of the labs entire 
collection contained too few seeds to risk testing them eberhart 
said 
as a consequence lab officials were unable to say with any 
accuracy how many of their seed samples are alive 
rep george e brown dcalif chairman of the house 
subcommittee on operations research and foreign agriculture called 
the us germplasm system lousy measured against the importance 
of the problem 
each seed vault at the fort collins laboratory can hold 15000 to 
30000 seed packets six cryogenic tanks contain wheat barley 
oats lotus and other grains supercooled with liquid nitrogen a 
process pioneered here in hopes of extending the life of seed 
samples indefinitely 
eight of the nine vaults are full and the last vault is nearly 
so according to the labs annual review written in february 
the usda computer analysis found that in five years only 82538 
seed samples or slightly more than onethird of the labs total 
had been tested to see what percentage of seeds in each sample 
remained alive said loren wiesner the laboratorys curator 
twentytwo percent of those tested or 18502 samples were below 
the usdas 66 percent standard eberhart said 
furthermore 3770 samples had deteriorated to the point where no 
more than a quarter of the seeds would sprout eberhart said 
of the 104135 samples that contained too few seeds to be tested 
94680 are duplicated at other us seed banks he said 
but the national seed storage laboratory is designed to be the 
principal storage facility for agricultural crop seeds noted a 
1987 report by the congressional office of technology assessment 
ideally all plant varieties are stored at nssl as base 
collections 
the four other seed banks where many of the fort collins samples 
are duplicated are in trouble themselves according to figures in 
minutes of a september 1986 meeting of the usdas plant germplasm 
operations committee 
at the ames iowa seed bank 35 percent of samples are in 
critical need of regeneration as are 25 percent at pullman 
wash 33 percent at experiment ga and 50 percent at geneva ny 
these are the most recent figures available said shands 
donald duvick director of research for pioneer hibred 
international and one of the deans of the us seed industry said 
our national stinginess in collecting storing renewing and 
describing the collections is inexcusable not only in regard to our 
national obligations but also in regard to our responsiblity to the 
entire world

in 1970 15 percent of the us corn crop was 
wiped out when a disease called southern corn leaf blight raced 
through the grain belt 
more than 1 billion in corn was lost in a single year because 
the us crop lacked sufficient variations in genetic material or 
germplasm according to jack doyle of the environmental policy 
institute in washington 
the blight was the closest american agriculture has come to 
duplicating the irish potato famine of 18459 in which more than 1 
million people died of starvation 
in each case the genetic uniformity of the potatoes and the corn 
meant that virtually the entire crop was susceptible to destruction 
by a single enemy if the plants had been more genetically varied 
only some would have succumbed and the losses wouldnt have been as 
catastrophic 
the 1970 corn blight was the genetic shot heard round the 
world botanists say because it awakened interest in germplasm 
fully 80 percent of the cornstalks standing in american soil in 
1970 shared at least some of the same genetic material doyle said 
they all contained genes from a single corn plant with a genetic 
variant that simplified the production of hybrid seeds said don 
duvick vicepresident in charge of research at pioneer hibred 
international in des moines iowa one of the nations largest 
producers of seed corn 
the genes from that plant also made the corn susceptible to 
southern corn leaf blight 
if breeders had used a wider variety of germplasm to breed 
american corn varieties many varieties would not have been 
susceptible to the blight the catastrophic losses of 1970 would 
have been avoided 
current american corn varieties no longer contain the genetic 
material that made 1970 corn susceptible to the blight but they 
remain closely related genetically and a new pest or disease that 
could exploit the shared genes might once again destroy a large 
portion of the crop experts say 
if that is going to happen wed better have some genetic 
variation on hand to deal with it said peter day director of the 
center for agricultural molecular biology at rutgers university in 
new jersey

the future of us agriculture depends on free 
international exchange of seeds seeds gathered in faroff countries 
contain the priceless genetic stuff american breeders need to 
develop crops resistant to insects disease and drought yet as 
reported in the second story of a threepart series seeds of 
conflict the united states has risked its access to foreign seeds 
by imposing political embargoes on shipments of seeds to six 
countries 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
despite repeated vows not to play politics with 
the genetic resources critical to the worlds food supply the 
united states is quietly maintaining seed embargoes against six 
countries it regards as adversaries government documents show 
the embargoes contradict stated us policy that these resources 
should be the common property of humanity to be shared as freely as 
the air and the sea the availability of this germplasm from all 
nations is the key to breeding crops able to withstand pests and 
such climatic changes as greenhouse warming 
while america may be the worlds breadbasket it is genepoor 
the traits responsible for iowas hearty corn or the miles of wheat 
in kansas didnt come from this continent the only native us 
crops are the pecan a few species of berries and an obscure tuber 
called the jerusalem artichoke 
us breeders thus depend on the good graces of generich nations 
in latin america asia and africa to obtain the germplasm necessary 
to ensure future bountiful harvests 
yet a threemonth investigation by the associated press revealed 
the united states has put six countries on a germplasm 
blacklist north korea since 1950 cuba since 1963 cambodia and 
vietnam since 1975 nicaragua since 1985 and libya since 1986 
the seed embargoes are part of overall trade bans the federal 
government has imposed over the years against countries it considers 
adversaries 
agriculture department officials fear that including germplasm in 
the embargoes could prompt retaliation by developing countries 
leaving us agriculture the prime victim 
those officials have struggled for two years to get germplasm 
exempted from the embargoes the state department has blocked those 
efforts officials of both departments said 
the very great majority of our germplasm resources come here 
from overseas and if i thought there were any impediment to that 
exchange i would raise holy hell said rep george e brown jr 
chairman of the house subcommittee on operations research and 
foreign agriculture who expressed shock upon learning of the 
embargoes in an interview 
the california democrat whose committee oversees the nations 
germplasm system called the embargoes an example of that ageold 
adage there aint no damn reason for it its just our policy 
germplasm is an inherent part of our biological system we 
depend on all countries for our germplasm said henry l shands 
head of the usdas germplasm program and a leader of efforts to end 
the embargoes 
i dont think it bodes well for us as a country to say we 
support a free policy of exchange and then have others be able to 
say well you dont send it shands said 
even with the embargoes american gene banks are unrivaled in 
making their resources available to researchers around the world 
said george white head of the usda office that approves plant 
imports and exports each year 1500 to 2000 shipments are sent to 
as many as 120 countries white said 
i really think our record is second to none in making materials 
available freely to anyone around the world he said 
usda officials note the united states is not alone in restricting 
germplasm exchange for political reasons ethiopia for example 
forbids exports of coffee germplasm turkey embargoes export of 
tobacco germplasm egypt bans export of cotton germplasm 
furthermore germplasm embargoes are so easily circumvented that 
they amount to little more than a symbolic slap at the targeted 
nations 
scientists need only slip seeds into an envelope and mail them 
if the cubans want something from our banks they can always 
ask somebody else to get it for them they can ask the soviets or 
the french or an international agency said shands 
so slipshod are the embargoes that whites plant introduction 
office itself approved delivery of 13 varieties of cotton seed to 
vietnam in 1977 two years after trade with vietnam was embargoed 
according to a usda tally of overseas shipments 
the same tally indicates 73 germplasm samples were sent to 
nicaragua in 1987 with usda approval 
white acknowledged the vietnam shipment he said he could not 
locate the file describing the nicaragua shipments 
i imagine that those were sent out by people unaware of the 
embargoes or simply forgot about them said white 
the issue could open the united states to charges of hypocrisy at 
a meeting on germplasm trade of the food and agriculture 
organization scheduled for april 1721 in rome 
embargoes bother me not because i know of any specific thing we 
lose said orville g bentley us assistant secretary of 
agriculture for science and education it bothers me because of 
the inconsistency all the people i talk to believe in free 
exchange 
mounting concern prompted shands to call several private meetings 
over the last two years with officials from the departments of 
state treasury and commerce the three departments besides 
agriculture involved in the import and export of germplasm 
he drafted a proposed memorandum of understanding which he 
hoped all four departments could sign to exempt germplasm from 
embargoes 
the memo made available to the ap set criteria for 
authorizing the importation or exportation of germplasm to or from 
a country as to which a ban on trade exists under us law 
shands said he had hoped the memorandum would be signed before 
the april meeting of the fao 
but a state department official who participated in the last 
meeting eight months ago said others in the department remain 
opposed to making any exception 
thats pretty much a general acrosstheboard position they 
take he said they say the same thing to the cocacola company 
there are people all the time trying to get exceptions for a 
particular interest if you start making exceptions to trade 
embargoes theyll be like swiss cheese 
the official who oversees fao affairs for the state department 
spoke only on condition of anonymity 
usda officials said the united states had never rejected a direct 
request for germplasm by embargoed countries because no country had 
asked 
yet usda correspondence shows the united states did reject a 
request in 1986 
nicaraguan researchers wrote the rodale research center in

guatemalan militiamen brandished machine 
guns and ordered hugh iltis out of his jeep iltis determined to 
protect his precious hoard brandished right back 
i showed anger arrogance if you like the 63yearold 
scientist recalled i flashed out my documents they backed off 
they let me go on 
this indiana jonesstyle encounter involved neither gold nor gems 
but rather a humble looking weedy plant 
iltis an intense burly czechborn botanist at the university 
of wisconsin is one of the worlds foremost collectors of rare 
plant species the precious cargo he was protecting from the 
guatemalans several years ago was a genetic cousin of corn called 
teosinte because its genes may carry resistance to certain viruses 
this scraggly plant may someday prove more valuable to mankind than 
gold 
as such plantrich parts of the globe as the amazon jungle are 
stripped and despoiled scientists and governments are racing time 
to gather rare plant species and preserve them before they are lost 
forever 
iltis has braved harsh climates and tropical sickness and says he 
has occasionally given gifts at customs posts to ensure the safe 
passage of himself and his botanical booty across borders and he 
said plant hunters sometimes face tough practical and ethical 
choices 
increasingly third world nations see the germplasm issue as just 
another instance of the united states stealing their resources the 
last thing american botanists want to be accused of is plundering 
such nations 
iltis said that in mexico brazil and other countries that have 
placed impossibly difficult and timeconsuming restrictions on 
plant exploration us scientists look for quiet ways around the 
regulations 
youre supposed to collect with the permission of mexico 
said iltis i never have but i always share 
iltis says he makes up for his intrusions by religiously sending 
back duplicates of any samples to mexican scientists he has also 
sent valuable plant reference books to colleagues in nicaragua and 
other central american nations he has explored 
interviews with several plant hunters revealed that conservation 
rather than profit is most often their prime motivator some like 
iltis join the hunt for purely scientific reasons that have nothing 
to do with improving agriculture 
there is nothing in the world so thrilling to a taxonomist than 
to walk into an entirely new flora he told a recent visitor to 
his university herbarium where row after row of special movable file 
cabinets house hundreds of rare species of corn and other trophies 
of more than two decades of expeditions to mexico central america 
and the soviet union 
for anyone studying natural history life can never be long 
enough he said 
slowly governments including our own have begun sponsoring and 
financing plant expeditions because rare species may contain genetic 
information that plant breeders and geneticists can someday use to 
help protect crops from viruses drought or other lifethreatening 
blights or hazards 
yet despite the limitless potential of this genetic resource 
called germplasm and the high importance scientists attach to 
its preservation the department of agriculture has financed an 
average of only four expeditions a year since 1956 according to 
usda figures 
in the fiscal year 1989 a relatively flush year for germplasm 
exploration the government is still spending only 150000 to 
finance about a dozen missions 
nevertheless that is more than the mere 40000 spent by the 
government as recently as 1986 according to calvin sperling head 
of the usdas plant exploration office who has been on three 
expeditions to south america and the middle east and plans to go to 
turkey this spring to gather wild lentils chick peas and pistachios 
governmentsponsored trips tend to be less hazardous than those 
undertaken by private scientists said david spooner a usda 
botanist who spends 23 months a year on plant expeditions for the 
government mostly hunting potato species such trips usually 
involve sharing the fruits of the search with scientists from the 
host country 
but prior to his stint as a usda explorer spooner recalls he 
knew all too well the dangers of attempting the same thing on 
nothing more than a passport and plane ticket 
i traveled throughout latin america and i was hassled 
constantly he said in mexico police stopped him and asked for 
money he said in honduras police stopped him every 50 
kilometers and challenged him to produce credentials 
what do you do if authorities ask for bribes mused william 
alberson a university of wisconsin plant research associate who has 
explored for plants in colombia and other south american countries 
you pay it

whose seeds are they anyway the united states 
and third world countries have grappled for years over who should 
own and profit from the genetic material breeders use to develop 
heartier crops the final part of a threepart series seeds of 
conflict describes the highstakes conflict some now call seed 
wars which may flare anew at a meeting in rome next month

crop improvements from wild seeds gathered in 
foreign countries mean billions in added profits to american farmers 
now some of those countries are demanding a share 
all of americas major crops first sprouted in foreign soil and 
thats where plant breeders must go to look for varieties with 
valuable genetic traits 
the need for ever heartier wheat in kansas sends botanists to 
turkey for diseaseresistant corn they search mexican 
mountainsides to breed the tubers needed for flawless potato chips 
they go to peru 
the united states has depended on the genetic resources of the 
rest of the world to develop its agricultural base noted the 
general accounting office in a review of americas germplasm 
policies 
now us access to foreign germplasm is threatened by many of the 
developing countries with the richest stores they are angry they 
havent shared in profits generated by new varieties developed from 
plants that once grew wild in their own soil 
the key issue in this growing rift between developed and 
developing countries is patent rights whether or not plant breeders 
have the right to patent commercially produced seed lines the 
united states insists they do 
third world nations call that genetic imperialism they believe 
commercial seed lines should be exchanged as freely as the raw 
germplasm that originates in their countries 
for years now the third world has been donating this material 
on the principle that these botanical treasures form part of the 
common heritage of all humanity said clarence dias president 
of the international center for law in development located in new 
york city 
meanwhile industrialized nations have been patenting the 
offshoots of this common heritage and are now marketing its new 
varieties at enormous profit back to the third world 
officially the united states agrees that germplasm is the common 
heritage of mankind but the 1970 plant variety protection act and a 
1980 supreme court decision established the right of breeders to 
patent their products 
our allowing the patenting of plants doesnt help our 
negotiators who are arguing that plants are the common heritage of 
mankind said a knowledgeable congressional aide who spoke on 
condition of anonymity were in rome arguing common heritage 
and in courtrooms in the us arguing individual ownership 
third world countries dont like it said rodolfo quintero a 
prominent mexican biologist affiliated with the united nations 
the potential for hurting the developing countries is real 
plant patenting he said has already denied mexico profits it 
feels it is due a food developed from a mexican form of algae was 
patented as shrimp feed in japan and mexican shrimp farmers are now 
paying royalties to japan quintero said 
the seed wars debate has simmered within the un food and 
agriculture organization since 1979 the latest round will be fought 
at a meeting of the faos commission on plant genetic resources 
scheduled for april 1721 in rome 
the united states will once again be asked to endorse the 
international undertaking on plant genetic resources enacted by the 
fao commission 5 years ago the undertaking extends the principle 
of free exchange to commercial seed lines 
mexico led the fight for the undertaking and the creation of the 
fao commission to oversee it many of the ideas underlying the faos 
actions came from the writings of pat roy mooney a canadian 
economist who favors compensating developing countries for the use 
of their germplasm 
currently 116 countries have endorsed the undertaking or joined 
the commission including france west germany the netherlands 
great britain and other developed countries said the commissions 
secretary jose esquinasalcazar 
but the united states has not it attends commission meetings 
only as a silent observer 
us refusal to participate could prompt a backlash in which 
other countries would deny germplasm to the united states some us 
officials fear 
india for example the sole source of important varieties of 
cotton and other crops now bars the collection of seeds by 
americans 
im inclined to think that in that case its an outgrowth of 
this whole fao debate said charles murphy secretary of the us 
department of agricultures national plant genetic resource board 
some us agriculture officials favor softening american 
opposition to the commission because they fear it could further 
restrict us access to foreign germplasm 
the faos esquinas insisted that us membership in the 
commission would not compel america to accept any position but 
would merely signal a willingness to listen and debate 
the united states is being hurt in the eyes of developing 
countries esquinas said by its failure to participate the 
countries ask why he said 
hoping to improve the american position in rome the us 
national plant genetic resource board called last year for 
reconsideration of us opposition to the undertaking 
germplasm experts from around the world met at keystone colo 
last summer to try to find a way to resolve the fao dispute they 
couldnt agree on how to reconcile patenting and the fao 
undertaking but they did agree to support an existing international 
fund to channel money from industrialized nations to training and 
conservation programs in developing countries 
the fund was established by the fao in 1987 and it has received 
pledges of about 500000 so far esquinas said 
still the odds remain against the united states joining the 
commission in april said wayne denney a usda official who will 
help represent the united states at the april meeting 
it will suggest that something we opposed vigorously in many 
forums wasnt so bad after all

rafael guzman stepped gingerly down a 
narrow twisting dirt path through tall dense shrubs in the verdant 
sierra de manatlan mountains southwest of guadalajara 
in a clearing stood a thicket of tangled golden cornstalks 8 
feet tall instead of the usual ears the stalks bore tiny seed 
husks not much bigger than pea pods each filled with eight or 10 
misshapen brown kernels 
this is the thing that has caused all the controversy guzman 
said reaching up to split a husk and let its kernels fall 
the discovery a decade ago of this distant relative of corn 
called zea diploperennis ranks as one of the botanical finds of the 
century 
zea diploperennis part of a family of wild corn plants called 
teosinte has three genetic properties that excite plant breeders 
it is a perennial meaning it grows back every year without 
replanting each stalk produces multiple ears of corn unlike 
singleeared us grain belt corn and it is resistant to more than 
a half dozen plant diseases 
scientists hope they can use zea diploperennis to breed perennial 
commercial corn that could mean billions of dollars for farmers who 
would no longer have to replant each spring 
perennial corn is probably decades away scientists said at a 
meeting in guadalajara last december to mark the 10th anniversary of 
the discovery but commercial breeders could harness zea 
diploperenniss disease resistance within five to 10 years they 
said 
at that meeting researchers also tackled the troublesome 
question of who should pay the bill to preserve zea diploperennis 
so far mexicans have borne the cost their fear is that american 
seed companies will get the profits 
the plants seeds are now stored in seed banks all over the 
world there is no longer any danger it will become extinct 
but much of its value will be lost if it isnt maintained in the 
wild where it must continually develop resistance to new insects and 
diseases scientists said 
the sierra de manatlan biosphere reserve is one of only three 
places in the world where zea diploperennis is found all are in 
mexico 
the university of guadalajara is spending 300000 a year to 
maintain the reserve and operate its las joyas laboratory there 
for accepting that challenge they deserve to be 
congratulated said garrison wilkes of the university of 
massachusetts in boston an authority on teosinte the world 
community is dependent on mexico 
companies should pay and governments should pay said guzman 
now at the university of wisconsin but until recently the 
laboratorys director 
maybe it can be done through scientific cooperation between the 
united states and mexico he said suggesting contributions of 
money textbooks and equipment as well as exchanges of students and 
scientists 
his argument holds particular force in mexico because of its 
foreign debt of 104 billion the second largest in the developing 
world after brazil 
guzman and hugh iltis a botanist at the university of wisconsin 
discovered zea diploperennis long after it was thought to be extinct 
the story began in 1977 when iltis sent guzman a christmas card 
with a drawing of zea diploperennis on the front 
botanists believed the plant which had evolved in mexico a 
million years ago had become extinct early in the 20th century as 
mexicos growing population converted wilderness to farmland 
the christmas card gave guzman then a student at the university 
of guadalajara an idea he took the drawing into the hills above 
guadalajara and began to ask local farmers the campesinos whether 
they had ever seen anything like it 
one campesino took an interest guzman recalled he said he 
knew this plant and he led guzman to it 
but guzman wasnt convinced he dug up the plant and took it to a 
university greenhouse there iltis and guzman made the definitive 
identification the discovery was announced in a scientific journal 
in 1979 
a short time later guzman and iltis were on a seed collecting 
expedition in the sierra de manatlan mountains when they stepped 
over a ridge into a valley of overgrown pastures broken by clumps of 
trees where the laboratory now stands 
they stopped zea diploperennis was growing all over the 
hillsides 
no botanist had ever been here before said iltis can you 
imagine how we felt we just stared at each other in disbelief

the nations seed bank system shown in a 
threemonth investigation by the associated press as beset with 
storage and political problems is already making changes prodded 
by a lawsuit by prominent biotechnology critic jeremy rifkin 
rifkin who has won several landmark court battles to regulate 
gene splicing filed the suit eight years ago in an attempt to force 
the usda to disclose the severity of the problems in the seed banks 
henry l shands national germplasm leader at the usda said the 
suit has prompted the preparation of an operating manual covering 
management of seeds of major crops 
the manual a draft of which is expected to be completed later 
this year provides that the germplasm system would for the first 
time have a procedure and have it out on the table so that rifkin 
or anyone else can inspect it 
rifkin chose an unusual legal strategy charging that the failure 
to properly protect the collections in the seed banks was causing 
the loss of oftenirreplaceable seed samples and thus harming the 
environment 
therefore he argued the usda should be required to file an 
environmental impact statement rifkin hoped that would disclose the 
severity of the systems troubles 
final arguments in the suit have been heard and a decision is 
expected soon rifkin said 
germplasm is as critical to the age of biotechnology as oil 
natural gas coal and metals were to the industrial age he said 
the us germplasm system has been a failure from top to bottom 
for 10 years this is an attempt on our part to force the 
government to respond

the directors of texaco inc have approved a new 
poison pill a shareholderrights plan intended to make a 
hostile takeover of the nations thirdlargest oil company more 
difficult 
the poison pill allows shareholders to buy extra shares of texaco 
stock at a steep discount with more shares on the market the cost 
of an unfriendly takeover would escalate sharply 
the terms of the pill which replaces a shareholderrights plan 
due to expire april 7 were reviewed by the investment firm salomon 
brothers inc on behalf of a committee representing texaco 
shareholders texaco said in a statement thursday from its white 
plains ny headquarters 
the plan now goes to shareholders for their approval at texacos 
may 9 annual meeting 
a shareholder vote on a poison pill is rare but texaco agreed to 
the condition after shareholders handed the company a victory in a 
proxy fight with takeover strategist carl icahn 
texaco promised the committee representing shareholders in its 
thenongoing chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization it would not issue 
another poison pill without the approval of shareholders or 
authorization from an investment banking firm designated by the 
committee 
the pill had been a point of contention between texaco and icahn 
its largest stockholder until they settled their differences aside 
in late january 
icahn had been badgering texaco to boost its stock price and 
threatened to mount a takeover to do so if the company failed to 
satisfy his demands 
texaco underwent a restructuring as part of its chapter 11 
reorganization that included the sale of such major assets as its 
texaco canada unit and the payment of a special 8ashare dividend 
to shareholders 
icahn in turn agreed not to launch or support any proxy fights 
against management for seven years 
the new pill would be triggered if a suitor offering to buy the 
company acquired 20 percent or more of texacos outstanding common 
stock and if the buyout offer does not meet certain conditions 
among other things the offer must be an allcash fullyfinanced 
bid and give the texaco board a reasonable opportunity to explore 
the available alternatives to maximize stockholder value the 
company said 
the pill also is designed to deter takeover tactics such as 
market sweeps in which a hostile suitor scoops up large amounts 
of a companys stock over a short period on the open market texaco 
said 
texaco stock rose 12 cents to close at 5362 a share in new 
york stock exchange composite trading thursday

american airlines apparently is near a 
multibilliondollar deal with dutch manufacturer fokker that would 
push the carriers sixweek shopping spree above 10 billion for 300 
plane purchases and options 
the agreement negotiated over the past five years and worth an 
estimated 309 billion would be for 75 f100 twinengine jets 
which seat about 100 people each with options for an additional 75 
fokker spokesman bart van veen said thursday in amsterdam 
american would not confirm the agreement but van veen said the 
companies are discussing the final minor details the deal would 
represent a significant breakthrough into the us market for fokker 
the announcement comes just one day after the fort worthbased 
airline the main subsidiary of amr corp announced a 95 million 
expansion of its corporate headquarters and began distributing 121 
million in profit sharing to employees 
american also plans an announcement in the next several weeks of 
the location for a 200 million second maintenance facility 
analysts said the expenditures indicate the financial strength of 
american the nations second largest carrier and reflect the 
airlines strategy for modernizing its fleet and expanding its 
routes 
in trading thursday on the new york stock exchange amrs stock 
closed at 6037 up 50 cents 
all i can tell you is that we have had interest in fokker 
airplanes along with others said american spokesman al becker 
we are just not in a position at this point to say anything more 
about the fokker airplane 
the f100 is smaller than most domestic airplanes and is ideal 
for use on feeder routes of up to 1100 nautical miles in a hub 
system 
on feb 7 american announced an agreement with mcdonnell douglas 
corp to buy eight longrange md11 widebody jetliners with options 
for another 42 the airline also took options on 100 md80s a 
smaller plane designed to replace the boeing 727 
analysts placed the value of the mcdonnell douglas deal at about 
7 billion 
americans fleet of 478 planes already is one of the youngest in 
the industry at an average of about 94 years and becker said the 
carrier plans to reduce the average to about 84 years by 1992 he 
said the companys fleet would total more than 600 planes by 1991 
last month donald j carty the airlines vice president for 
planning and finance said american would spend about 105 billion 
through the end of 1993 to modernize its fleet 
becker said most of the new airplanes would be used to expand 
americans routes 
the companys been in a very rapid growth mode since the early 
1980s and these recent activities indicate a continuation of that 
program said mark e daughtery who follows the industry for dean 
witter reynolds inc in new york 
the company is convinced that there are additional domestic and 
international market opportunities and they fortunately have the 
financial strength to capitalize on that he said 
amr earned a record 476 million last year on 88 billion in 
revenue making the airline the nations most profitable 
about 121 million of the earnings was set aside for employee 
profitsharing becker said those checks averaging about 1950 
per employee were distributed wednesday 
becker said the company is looking at two locations for its new 
maintenance facility one in oklahoma city and a second at alliance 
airport a project just north of fort worth headed by h ross perot

becker said the announcement of a selection is probably several 
weeks away the project which is planned to open by 1991 
ultimately will employ about 4500 people and cost more than 200 
million he said 
the airline will keep and expand its current maintenance facility

advertisers are showing less backbone when faced 
with complaints about their sponsorship of tv programs and editorial 
projects that some groups find offensive a constitutional rights 
advocate says 
but arthur kropp president of people for the american way said 
companies are being shortsighted by caving in to such complaints 
they are not going to be able to sweep these people under the 
rug they will find they are in a constant battle with them he 
said 
on thursday two advertisers canceled plans to run commercials on 
nbcs popular saturday night live program after hearing from a 
christian group that pointed out skits in recent episodes that it 
found offensive 
ralston purina co confirmed that it had dropped plans to run 
about 1 million in ads on the program starting in april because it 
felt one of the shows crossed over the line of good taste 
general mills inc said it had canceled an undisclosed number of 
ads on the show after reviewing the other episode 
both companies said they had heard complaints about the program 
from others as well as the christan group the american family 
association of tupelo miss 
the rev donald wildmon who heads the group has campaigned for 
more than a decade against what he sees as pornography and excessive 
violence in magazines tv and movies 
last summer cbs cut 3 seconds from an episode of mighty 
mouse after wildmon said the scene gave the impression that the 
cartoon hero was snorting cocaine cbs said he was sniffing flowers 
the saturday night live case provides another example of 
increasing activism by individuals and groups that are trying to end 
shows they dont like by urging advertisers to quit buying 
commercial time on them 
kropp said he understands why companies trying to make a profit 
take their ad dollars elsewhere when an activist group complains or 
threatens a boycott 
it is much easier to pull ads and avoid controversy these 
companies are not in the business of defending the first 
amendment kropp said 
but he said the trend could have a dangerous chilling effect on 
the media 
the american family association said it had pointed out two 
saturday night live episodes it found ofensive to ralston and 
general mills and was later notified they each had canceled ads on 
the weekly comedy show 
in one episode a skit was apparently designed to see how many 
times the actors could say penis on network tv 
patrick farrell a spokesman for st louisbased ralston said 
ralston canceled about 1 million in ads on the show for its 
eveready battery co because of the skit 
farrell said ralston had been a sponsor of the program for a 
number of years and knew it was sometimes controversial and aimed at 
an audience of young adults but he said the skit crossed over the 
line of good taste 
in the second episode a skit featured use of the words funk 
and funking as euphemisms for profanity 
terry thompson a spokesman for general mills in minneapolis 
said some commercials were canceled on the show after the 
episode was reviewed he declined to say many ads were pulled 
but he said the companys current absence from advertising on the 
program reflects scheduling fluctuations and nothing else 
a michigan housewife terry rakolta recently captured national 
attention with her letterwriting campaign to advertisers who 
sponsored the program married with children on fox 
broadcasting network 
rakolta complained about sexual innuendo and the treatment of 
women in the popular program a comedy about a bluecollar family 
since she wrote big ad spenders such as procter amp gamble co 
mcdonalds corp tambrands inc and kimberly clark corp have 
instructed their ad agencies not to buy time on the show 
last week wildmon said the american family association was 
calling on consumers to quit drinking pepsi for a year to protest 
the soft drink makers refusal to cancel its advertising contract 
with the entertainer madonna 
wildmon said his group felt madonnas latest music video 
produced separately from her pepsi ad contained offensive sexual 
imagery 
the american family association publishes a monthly christian 
magazine that claims a circulation of 380000

in the 1978 movie animal house actor tim 
matheson played a college don juan negotiating his way through a 
series of romantic liaisons 
now 11 years later matheson has negotiated his way into a 
liaison with the company that produced the hit film national 
lampoon inc 
matheson and his business partner daniel grodnik announced 
thursday they had won control of national lampoon by buying the 
stake in the entertainment and publishing company held by its 
founder and chairman matty simmons the two investors paid simmons 
6 a share or more than 761400 
simmons resigned from national lampoon and was replaced by 
matheson and grodnik who will serve as cochairmen but simmons 
who has formed his own production company will produce an 
unspecified number of films for national lampoon over the next four 
years the company said 
the acquisition of simmons stake gives matheson and grodnik 
control of about 30 percent of the stock in the company which 
publishes the humor magazine national lampoon and has also produced 
films such as national lampoons vacation 
in december matheson and grodnik an independent film producer 
said they might seek control of national lampoon in january they 
were named to the companys board 
matheson has appeared in a number of films and television 
programs but is best known for his role as otter the shallow 
fasttalking womanizer in animal house the raunchy comedy about 
a midwestern fraternity house the film also starred the late john 
belushi 
grodnik said in a telephone interview it was coincidental that he 
and matheson who together produced the film blind fury ended 
up pursuing the company that created animal house 
the pair had wanted to raise funds to produce pictures but were 
advised by david batchelder who formerly worked with takeover 
specialist t boone pickens jr to instead search for an existing 
entertainment firm that was undervalued 
matheson and grodnik found 23 companies that were possible 
candidates and after they narrowed the field national lampoon 
emerged as their first choice grodnik said 
it was just a marriage that was meant to be he said 
they approached several shareholders who agreed to assign the 
pair their voting rights after buying their own stake matheson and 
grodnik said they controled more than 21 percent of the companys 
stock 
national lampoon said it has 10 films in various stages of 
development the firms next project national lampoons christmas 
vacation is scheduled to go into production later this month 
grodnik said he and matheson would produce films solely through 
national lampoon 
the new cochairmen said they were bringing in new executives to 
handle the publishing end of the firm national lampoon magazine 
suffered a readership decline in the early 1980s but has begun to 
turn around they said

coniston partners says it might raise its 14 
billion bid for food services giant tw services inc but the 
aggressive investment firm may have little choice if it is taking 
its cue from the market 
on thursday tw climbed 262 in active new york stock exchange 
trading to close at 3175 a share a 52week high that outpaced 
conistons current 29ashare tender offer 
trading was spurred by the announcement that tws board was 
exploring alternatives to boost shareholder value those options 
range from selling or reorganizing the company which owns the 
dennys restaurant chain to repurchasing shares 
no alternatives are precluded said tw spokesman james ryan 
coniston principal paul e tierney jr said in a telephone 
interview that the firm planned to review tws information and 
adjust our offer accordingly throughout his exchanges with tw 
chairman frank salizzoni however tierney has maintained that 
coniston is offering a premium price to tw shareholders 
in december letter to salizzoni tierney wrote that coniston did 
not believe the market price of tw as a public company is likely 
to equal the price we are prepared to pay today for years to come 
tw directors who met wednesday reiterated their contention that 
conistons offer is inadequate the board authorized financial 
advisers first boston corp and merrill lynch capital markets to 
seek transactions that reflect our strong forward momentum 
coniston repeatedly has pressed tw to either negotiate with us 
or to auction the company tierney said were pleased that 
after what seems to be a very long time that they have finally 
agreed to sell the business 
tw parent of the 1220restaurant dennys and spartan food 
systems inc the largest franchisee of hardees fastfood 
restaurants reported 1988 profits of 537 million up 15 percent 
from a year earlier 
coniston owns about 19 percent of tws 485 million outstanding 
shares together with shares tendered under the offer tierney says 
over 90 percent of tw stock would be in conistons hands 
in advising shareholders not to tender and to withdraw shares 
that already have been tendered salizzoni noted that tw operations 
have performed exceedingly well and over plan reflecting their 
growing leading market positions and improving sales and 
profitability since coniston made its first overture 
separately the tw board agreed to postpone indefinitely the 
companys april 26 annual meeting where coniston had planned to 
wage a proxy fight to get its candidates elected to tws 11member 
board shareholders are to elect three directors at the annual 
meeting 
ryan said the meeting was postponed to allow the board time to 
review and entertain alternatives that may produce a higher 
value rather than to head off a proxy fight 
earlier this month coniston amended its offer by among other 
changes removing the condition that the tw board approve a 
takeover the change came after the delaware chancery court upheld 
tws poison pill which was designed make an unwanted takeover 
prohibitively expensive 
coniston has said it has spent over 15 million in its effort to 
acquire tw

a permanent cast of undercover moles 
burrowing through the nations futures exchanges could help deter 
cheating by traders says a congressman who is examining the 
industrys regulatory system 
even though we plug as many holes as we possibly can theres 
always some guy out there who thinks he can beat the system this 
would give him something more to worry about said rep glenn 
english dokla 
english made the comments at a news conference thursday following 
his speech before the annual meeting of the futures industry 
association 
in his speech english urged leaders of the futures industry to 
cooperate with federal investigations of commodity trading fraud and 
reassured them that his own probe was not aimed at hindering the 
industrys growth 
i do not intend to throw the baby out with the bath water but 
i intend the baby to be squeaky clean he told more than 1000 
brokers traders and exchange officials 
also thursday some of the industrys leaders called for a 
concerted effort to improve the image of their business in the face 
of a federal undercover investigation of suspected cheating at the 
chicago board of trade and the chicago mecantile exchange the 
worlds two largest futures markets 
english chairs a house agriculture committee subcommittee that is 
investigating futures regulation as part of the process of renewing 
the commodity futures trading commission the federal agency that 
oversees futures trading 
the cftcs current congressional authorization expires sept 30 
the process of reauthorizing the agency through 1994 has been slowed 
because of concerns raised by the chicago investigation 
the justice departments undercover probe has yielded no charges 
since it was disclosed jan 19 it is believed to be targeting as 
many as 100 traders suspected of cheating customers out of millions 
of dollars while executing their orders on the exchange floors 
a futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a commodity or 
financial instrument at a specified price at a future date 
english said the subcommittees work was only beginning but he 
would not rule out the possibility that it will recommend giving the 
cftc authority to maintain a permanent force of undercover agents to 
patrol futures trading floors 
english said his panel also might consider requiring more 
extensive background checks of futures traders and brokers 
in addition he suggested that the general trend toward 
deregulation during the past decade created an atmosphere that 
encouraged a small minority of rotten apples to cheat in the 
financial markets 
cftc chairman wendy gramm spoke earlier in the day saying her 
agency would double its efforts to detect and punish trading abuse 
board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann and chicago merc 
president william brodsky also spoke thursday 
mahlmann touted the board of trades electronic surveillance and 
tradeauditing systems which he said were being improved to curb 
any possible abuses 
brodsky called for coordinated industrywide action to improve 
frauddetection and restore credibility to the futures markets 
we are at a very important crossroads in our development he 
said when all is said and done we must come together and work 
together

traders are calling it nintendo ii 
but whatever the name the chicago board of trade says its new 
electronic futures trading system will usher in a new era of 
international futures transactions 
the aurora system gets its first public showing today at the 
futures industry associations annual meeting here 
journalists covering the conference got a sneak preview wednesday 
night the system resembles a video game and attempts to replicate 
on a computer screen the fastpaced competition of a futures trading 
pit 
aurora will compete with globex an electronic trading network 
developed by the rival chicago mercantile exchange and londonbased 
reuters plc 
like globex aurora is designed for trading of futures contracts 
during the hours that the exchanges trading floor is closed 
primarily to capture business overseas 
but unlike globex and unlike any other electronic trading system 
devised over the past 20 years aurora can disclose what other 
traders are doing in the market and allow users to select the person 
with whom they wish to trade 
a working prototype of aurora should be ready in september board 
of trade officials said 
the board of trade will be the sole owner of the aurora system 
which incorporates technology developed specifically for the project 
by apple computer inc texas insruments inc and tandem computers 
inc 
some board of trade members who have been shown a model of the 
system during the past month call it nintendo trading or 
nintendo ii after the popular video game 
the board of trades entry into electronic trading comes more 
than a year after the chicago merc announced plans for globex which 
also goes on line this fall 
the merc also leads the board of trade in signing up other 
exchanges to offer its products for electronic trading 
the merc the worlds secondlargest futures exchange after the 
board of trade has announced globex links with the new york 
mercantile exchange the sydney futures exchange of australia and 
the french futures exchange marche a terme international de france 
known as matif 
but board of trade chairman karsten mahlmann said the 
revolutionary features of aurora will appeal to traders and win the 
industry over 
aurora is truly the dawning of a new age in international 
trading mahlmann said 
futures are binding contracts to buy and sell commodities and 
financial instruments at a specified price at a future date 
the exchanges say they will limit the contracts traded 
electronically to financial futures which are used extensively by 
large institutional investors to hedge their risks in financial cash 
markets 
globex which is also on display at the futures industry 
association meeting is known in the industry as a black box 
system because buy and sell orders entered into the system are 
matched by a computer 
the user of a black box system does not know the identity of 
the person on the other side of the trade 
the most startling aspect of aurora is the computerscreen 
display instead of the rows and columns of information displayed on 
the terminal screens of blackbox systems an aurora user sees blue 
squares and red circles on a field of gray 
each symbol contains a traders acronym and a number representing 
the price at which that trader is offering to sell red circle or 
bidding to buy blue square a futures contract 
to make a trade the aurora user moves a cursor via a handheld 
mouse from his own symbol to that of another trader and clicks 
the mouses button 
with many traders in the market all vying to buy low and sell 
high the action can move very quickly in a fashion that resembles 
openoutcry trading the traditional futurestrading method in which 
traders face off in recessed pits and execute trades through a 
combination of yelling and hand signals

president bush is prodding congress to swifter 
action on his savings and loan plan as regulators prepared for its 
eventual passage by taking over another 47 failed institutions in 
five states 
the federal deposit insurance corp says it now controls 165 
failed sampls in 25 states after taking action thursday in texas 
illinois louisiana florida and oklahoma it hopes to assume 
control of about another 60 in the next month 
the agency is going into the sickest sampls with the goal of 
minimizing losses while the administration waits for congress to 
appropriate the money to shut them down or sell them to new buyers 
bush in a luncheon speech in houston said congress should get 
moving theres no excuse for delay he said urging legislators 
to meet his challenge to pass the reform package 45 days from feb 
22 when it was delivered to congress 
sen donald w riegle dmich chairman of the senate banking 
committee announced thursday that his committee plans to act on an 
sampl bill by april 14 and is pressing for a full senate vote by april 
21 which is after the 45day deadline expires earlier that month 
were going as fast as we can within the bounds of doing the 
job properly riegle said 
in the house the subcommittee with jurisdiction over sampls plans 
a vote by april 14 with a vote by the full banking committee to 
follow soon after however nearly a half dozen other house 
committees are claiming jurisidiction over part of the bill and that 
may delay a vote by the full house 
in other developments 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said he will push to strip from the bush sampl proposal a 
provision for the automatic reappointment of m danny wall as the 
nations top sampl regulator 
the senate finance committee endorsed the nomination of david w 
mullins jr one of the architects of the administrations sampl plan 
to a senior treasury department post sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny said the full senate could confirm mullins as assistant 
secretary for domestic finance as early as today 
an internal report of the federal home loan bank board 
summarized in a house banking committee memo cited five examples 
where sampl regulators in dallas may have given preferential treatment 
to influential members of the industry 
sen david pryor dark complained in a letter to treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady about efforts by sampl regulators to sell 
repossessed property in europe 
bush in his reform legislation is proposing to wrap the bank 
board into the treasury department reducing the threemember board 
to just its chairman the legislation specifies that wall a close 
ally of sen jake garn of utah senior republican on the senate 
banking committee would continue as head of the agency 
gonzalez at a private meeting tuesday of house banking committee 
democrats said he would offer an amendment to the bush bill that 
would force wall to be reconfirmed by the senate 
the bank board report on the dallas regional bank was finished 
last spring as part of the agencys peer review process where the 
performance of regulators in each of the 12 districts is being 
reviewed by colleagues from the other districts 
the regional banks are controlled by industrychosen boards of 
directors although the boards are supposed to have no influence 
over sampl examiners and supervisors policing institutions in the 
region 
however according to the banking committee staff the agencys 
peer review criticized the dallas bank for five incidents 
involving what appeared to be preferential treatment of board 
members 
karl hoyle a spokesman for the bank board said peer reviews 
were begun about a year ago because there was a recognition that 
the system needs to police itself and tighten up its operation he 
said the reviews are heeded and in some cases have resulted in 
major personnel changes

the government is preparing to obtain a 
possible courtordered recall of 19 million general motors cars 
with an alleged cruise control defect that safety officials say can 
cause drivers to lose control of the vehicles 
the national traffic safety administration took the last step 
before a mandatory recall order on thursday ordering a formal 
investigation covering several models of 1984 to 1988 buicks 
cadillacs chevrolets oldsmobiles and pontiacs 
the formal safety defect investigation has been opened to 
prepare for a possible governmentordered recall the safety 
agency said in announcing the inquiry 
general motors has refused government requests for a voluntary 
recall the agency said 
the safety administration said it received 144 complaints 
involving 18 accidents and seven injuries in which a small plastic 
ring which the manufacturer calls a servo bracket bushing 
slipped out of the vehicles cruise control system at highway speed 
without warning the agency said this caused the throttle to stick 
partially open cruise controls enable a driver to set a constant 
highway speed without tending the accelerator 
under certain conditions the driver may be startled and lose 
control of the car and the brakes will be less effective the 
agency said 
company spokesman david hudgens in detroit said gm does not 
believe the cruise control allegations warrant a safety recall and 
customers should continue to drive their cars with confidence 
our investigation shows that if the servo bracket bushing were 
dislodged the braking system can still stop the vehicle within safe 
stopping distances a company statement said adding that the 
cruise control and steering systems are not affected by the 
condition and no sudden acceleration occurs 
the traffic safety administration agreed that the problem is not 
related to sudden acceleration conditions in which the 
accelerator suddenly goes to the floor the highway safety agency 
concluded last week that the phenomenon reported in the audi 5000s 
and other cars is most likely caused by drivers stepping on the 
wrong pedal possibly due to the way the pedals are designed in some 
cars 
the agency cautioned drivers of cars who experience accelerator 
problems to turn off the ignition and steer carefully but quickly to 
the side of the road keeping in mind that powerassisted braking 
and steering will be diminished once the engine is turned off the 
steering wheel does not lock on gm cars unless they are shifted into 
park after stopping agency spokesman tim hurd said 
the investigation covers 16 million gm cars with fiveliter 
gasoline engines and 300000 cars with eightcylinder diesel engines 
models included are oldsmobile delta 88s 98s cutless supremes 
and toronados buick lesabres rivieras and regals pontiac 
parisiennes and grand prixs chevrolet caprices and monte carlos 
and cadillac broughams eldorados and sevilles 
clarence ditlow spokesman for the center for auto safety a 
safety advocacy group that is often at odds with the auto industry 
said the problem is common in general motors cars 
were glad to see they have taken action ditlow said but 
added that the manufacturer should voluntarily recall the cars and 
correct the alleged defect he said the center has passed along 
dozens of complaints to the government

the federal trade commission is telling eastern 
airlines ticketholders how to get refunds for canceled flights if 
they purchased tickets with a credit card 
commission spokeswoman anna davis said card companies are 
obligated under the fair credit billing act to refund charges for 
which services were not performed a charge for a ticket canceled 
because of the twoweekold eastern machinists strike would fall 
under the legal definition of a billing error she said 
consumers have 60 days after the first bill for a ticket charge 
is sent to appeal for a refund and ms davis said it is probably a 
good idea to apply even if the period has already passed 
the commission in a news release thursday recommended the 
following steps for ticketholders 
send a written notice to the card issuer use the address 
listed on your bill for billing error inquiries 
include in the notice your name and account number a statement 
that you are withholding payment or requesting a refund if you have 
already paid because the bill contains a billing error and a 
description of the error with the dollar amount and reference number 
of the ticket transaction as it appears on your credit card bill 
keep a photocopy of the notice and send the notice by certified 
mail with a return receipt requested 
mail the notice in time to reach the card issuer within 60 days 
after the first bill containing the error is mailed to you 
keep the ticket because you may be asked to provide it later as 
evidence that you held a ticket on a canceled flight 
credit card companies are responsible for reimbursing billing 
errors ms davis said in the case of an airline ticket the card 
company would shoulder the payment back to the card holder and then 
seek a refund from the airline for the canceled flight 
eastern on tuesday announced a ticket holders assistance 
program which gives customers the options of holding tickets until 
the airline resumes service on canceled routes or exchanging tickets 
for up to 25 percent of the cost of a ticket on an operating eastern 
route until all of the tickets original value is used up 
as an incentive to get customers to hold onto the tickets the 
airline said they could be used to buy a halffare ticket for a 
companion if the canceled flight is resumed 
tickets will be honored by easterns sister airline continental 
and the company said it was working out arrangements with other 
airlines 
eastern said it also planned to get other airlines hotels 
rental car companies and nontravel retailers to issue scrip 
coupons or certificates for the tickets at their full face value 
a final alternative would be to hold onto tickets until the new 
york judge handling easterns filing under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy laws determines how much ticketholders will be refunded

based on an inflationlinked index will reverse the steep decline in 
longdistance rates that has taken place since the breakup of the 
old bell system in 1984 the critics said 
the fcc claims the new method will save ratepayers some 900 
million over four years 
i fear that the days of real longdistance price reductions for 
the average residential caller may be over said rep edward j 
markey dmass who added that he would cosponsor legislation 
requiring close monitoring of the new plan to cap atampts rates 
markey who is chairman of the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance said the fccs plan 
does not contain sufficient consumer safeguards to ensure that 
residential telephone customers will fairly share in rate reductions 
which should result from new telephone technologies 
since the mid1960s atampt has been allowed to earn a set 
percentage profit above its costs currently 122 percent under 
this socalled rateofreturn regulation atampts longdistance rates 
have dropped 38 percent since 1984 
much of that decrease has resulted from higher prices consumers 
have been paying to connect to local telephone networks with 
consumers paying more longdistance companies have paid less to the 
local telephone networks and the fcc has forced atampt to pass those 
savings along to its longdistance customers 
the new price caps plan which goes into effect july 1 will 
allow atampt to raise rates to three percentage points less than the 
rate of inflation in each of its three categories of service 
residential and small business 800 calls and other business 
services mainly for large customers 
if the inflation rate were 4 percent atampt could raise rates in 
each of the three categories or baskets by 1 percent which the 
fcc calls the price cap index 
within that residentialsmall business basket prices may go up 
or down for the six individual services in that basket daytime 
calling evening weekend and night international reach out 
america and operator assistance and credit card calling as long 
as the average increase for the basket of services does not exceed 1 
percent 
what worries critics is that an item inside the basket such as 
evening or weekend and night calling may rise at the rate of 
inflation plus the price cap index so with an inflation rate of 4 
percent the prices for popular evening night and weekend calling 
would rise 5 percent with other reductions bringing down the basket 
average 
it will possibly give you the first real longdistance 
increases since the breakup of atampt said gene kimmelman 
executive director of the consumer federation of america like other 
critics he says atampt has been trying to cut the discounts it gives 
to evening night and weekend callers and then lower rates in the 
more competitive businessdominated daytime segment 
prices in all categories within the basket also may not fall more 
than 5 percent which is designed to keep atampt from trying to drive 
out competition with big price reductions 
fcc chairman dennis patrick said the change to price caps would 
give atampt a profit incentive to cut costs and improve its 
efficiency critics fear that service will suffer as a result 
others such as rep jim cooper dtenn fear the fcc will 
abandon the geographical rateaveraging philosophy that keeps prices 
more or less constant in all areas of the country patrick has 
maintained the agency will not change that philosophy 
cooper earlier this month introduced a bill that would delay 
price caps he said thursday he would meet with markey to determine 
whether to continue with that legislation 
atampt applauded the decision but said it was mystified that the 
commission finds it necessary to continue treating atampt differently 
by limiting our ability to reduce prices in such an extremely 
competitive market

administration officials claim their new 
approach to third world debt could reduce developing nations burden 
20 percent over three years but members of congress doubt that will 
be enough even if the plan works 
linking the issue to waves of illegal immigrants and tons of 
illegal drugs entering the united states from latin america as 
well as the heightened political instability there both democrats 
and republicans say they are disappointed the new initiative is not 
bolder 
im not sure that is going to be sufficient given the magnitude 
of the problem rep jim leach riowa told assistant treasury 
secretary david mulford on thursday 
mulford testifying before house and senate banking 
subcommittees described a 20 percent reduction in the 340 billion 
owed by the 39 largest third world debtors as a rough estimate 
of what can be achieved globally 
he said some countries could do much better depending on their 
willingness to swap ownership of their natural resources or 
industries to banks in exchange for forgiveness of some of the loans 
or reduced interest rates 
the new plan unveiled last friday by treasury secretary nicholas 
brady and formally endorsed this week by president bush and federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan for the first time calls on private 
banks to discount their loans voluntarily 
whether the banks will go along remains to be seen they largely 
rejected urgings four years ago by former treasury secretary and now 
secretary of state james a baker iii to increase their lending to 
developing countries 
mulford the chief architect of the new plan said the first big 
test will come when the banks try to negotiate among themselves for 
waivers to provisions in many of the multibank loan packages that 
now preclude them from writing down loans individually 
prior to that however the united states will get an idea 
whether the plan will fly when the 151nation world bank and 
international monetary fund meet in washington early next month 
both democrats and republicans praised president bushs 
willingness to embrace the concept that private banks should forgive 
a portion of the debt an idea brusquely rejected by former 
president reagan and his two treasury secretaries baker and donald 
regan 
senate banking committee chairman donald riegle likened regans 
approach of emphasizing primarily investmentoriented austerity 
programs in developing countries to telling people dying of thirst 
not to be thirsty 
secretary baker put a glass in front of them and thought he 
would be able to get water into the glass and it didnt work 
riegle dmich told mulford now youve come with a glass and 
with a concept that will put some water into the glass the question 
is will it be enough to address the thirst 
senators from states with large populations of recent third world 
immigrants were more skeptical 
in terms of a glass of water im afraid weve been given 
another rock said sen bob graham dfla weve been bombarded 
with a series of small ideas on how to deal with this problem and i 
had hoped we would hear a concept that had a breath of vision 
many of the united states most fundamental problems are tied 
to this graham said among them he cited increased drug traffic 
because other trade is precluded and a staggering increase in 
refugees from countries where a bulk of the earnings is devoted to 
paying interest on the loans

in a bold move aimed at increasing soviet food 
supplies communist party leaders have e 
the committee ended a twoday session thursday by adopting a 
longawaited agricultural reform package that it says will eliminate 
most food shortages by 1996 
we are not promising something that we cannot achieve but we 
assure that we will be able to change the food situation for the 
better politburo member yegor k ligachev told a news conference 
giant collective and state farms onto which peasants were herded 
by the millions during josef stalins bloody collectivization 
campaign of 60 years ago will remain the backbone of the soviet 
farm system 
but the reform is based on soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs proposal to give farmers longterm leases on the 
stateowned land leases may range from five years to 50 years and 
may be inherited said vsevolod s murakhovsky head of an 
agricultural superministry formed in a previous reform effort 
in an admission of failure the central committee decided 
thursday to abolish the agency 
gorbachev has pushed the leasing idea hard since last year 
saying it is a critical element in solving what he views as the 
soviet unions most urgent problem supplying people with enough 
good quality food 
in a dismal accounting of the soviet farm system he said 
wednesday that the food shortage creates social tension and 
generates not merely criticism but actual discontent 
but those who take the risk of leasing land from their collective 
or state farm often are regarded with suspicion and jealousy by 
their neighbors and local officials and sometimes forced out of 
business 
ligachev who once was considered the no 2 kremlin leader and 
now oversees the partys agricultural policy said leasing will be 
accompanied by reliance on selffinancing and making village life 
more democratic 
distrust of especially prosperous farmers remains deeply embedded 
in the soviet countryside the legacy of the collectivization 
campaign when such farmers were branded kulaks and shot starved 
or sent into exile 
western experts say it may be hard to convince many soviet 
collective and state farmers to take the risk of striking out on 
their own because of their neighbors distrust and fears that 
authorities could suddenly abandon the reforms 
in contrast to the repression of stalins collectivization 
campaign no one will be forced to take up a lease and the party 
refused to set targets for leasing ligachev said 
to set targets he said would be to invite moscow to force the 
reforms rather than to let them take hold naturally that was an 
unusual step in a system that has been geared for decades to 
measuring itself by setting yearly targets 
however the party did set targets it wants to reach with its 
reforms 
the soviet diet product of a farm system dulled by mismanagement 
and indifference includes half the meat and fruit as the american 
diet but twice as many potatoes and 50 percent more sugar 
ligachev said the party wants to bring the soviet diet up to 
generally recognized standards of nutrition by 1996 the end of 
the next fiveyear plan to do that he said yearly meat consumption 
should rise from 143 pounds to 176 pounds per capita 
consumption of fruit and vegetables should rise from 220 pounds 
to 308 pounds he said 
ligachev also called for better rural living conditions if 
peasants cant lead a normal life society as a whole cant lead a 
normal life ligachev said 
poor housing education supplies of food and consumer goods and 
transportation are causing a mass exodus from some rural areas of 
the soviet union to the cities

residents of southern california would have to 
change how they paint their houses light their barbecues and spray 
their hair under a plan devised to clean up the nations worst air 
the changes are outlined in a comprehensive blueprint intended to 
enable the metropolitan area to comply with federal clean air 
standards by the year 2007 
the air quality management plan expected to be approved today 
is likely to touch nearly every aspect of southern california life 
for the next 18 years said a norton younglove a riverside county 
supervisor and chairman of the south coast regional air quality 
management districts governing board 
were doing literally pioneering work said younglove 
were moving ahead of congress for example on what they might do 
to amend the clean air act 
the regional agency devised the plan with the southern california 
association of governments and the governing boards of both 
agencies were to consider it at a meeting today 
weve included as many things as possible said bill kelly a 
spokesman for the air quality management district 
new measures would restrict air pollutants in industries 
including electric power generating utilities oil and gas 
refineries dry cleaners furniture makers and auto body shops 
district officials maintain that their regulatory approach is 
fair but the rules have aroused strident opposition among industry 
executives and conservatives such as los angeles county supervisor 
michael antonovich 
this proposal will destroy thousands of jobs increase taxes 
raise consumer prices and exile businesses from our communities 
said antonovich a dissenting member of the air management 
districts 12member governing board 
invoking a specter of big brother government antonovich said 
if this measure passes we will have a new motto use a barbecue 
go to jail 
once approved the plan must be accepted by the state air 
resources board and the federal environmental protection agency the 
plans first provisions however could go into effect within a year 
in big and small ways rules set out in the plan attempt to 
reduce the gaseous chemical stew permeating the air in los angeles 
orange riverside and much of san bernardino counties californias 
most populous region 
for example one of the 160 proposed rules would require 
metropolitan residents to forsake household aerosol sprays 
including hair spray and deodorants within the next five years for 
manualpump sprays 
another set of rules would reduce the reactive chemicals in 
paints coatings and solvents making it more difficult to paint 
homes and varnish furniture 
conventional lighter fluid would be outlawed in a shift to 
electric charcoal starters for barbecues 
radial tires would be required on cars and light trucks 
radial tires last longer kelly said explaining that tires 
that last longer throw off less of the minute flecks of rubber that 
contribute to pollutants 
such a rule may seem trivial but not in a region where more than 
12 million residents drive 8 million vehicles about 234 million 
miles a day kelly said 
by the year 2000 the exclusive use of radial tires would reduce 
particulant pollutants by 31 tons a day he said 
antonovich has rallied support among fellow conservatives and 
several big labor representatives who are alarmed about potential 
economic impact 
mcdonnell douglas cannot build airplanes if they cant paint 
them general motors cannot build cars if they cant paint them and 
rocketdyne cannot build rocket motors if they cant test fire them 
in the santa susana mountains said tom whalen who represents 
about 38000 members of the united auto and aerospace workers 
antonovich also cited a study prepared for the california council 
on environmental and economic balance which estimates the plan will 
cost individual households 2200 a year 
meanwhile the southern california edison and the western states 
petroleum association have prepared alternative smog plans which 
they contend would meet federal standards faster and more cheaply 
we have studied and seriously considered alternatives suggested 
by industry said james m lents the air quality districts 
executive director they simply fail to attain all federal air 
quality health standards as required by law

more than 1000 bethlehem steel workers struck a 
shipyard today after a lastditch meeting with a federal mediator 
failed to resolve a dispute over wages and benefits 
company officials said the strike could endanger the sparrows 
point yard which bethlehem steel said posted a 41 million deficit 
last year 
strikers who are trying to reclaim salary concessions made in 
the early 1980s when bethlehem steel was on the brink of bankruptcy 
said the risk was worth it bethlehem steel reported a 403 million 
profit for 1988 
it took me 37 years to make 10 an hour said ross 
caldarazzo a sheet metal worker ive got 37 years in and i 
wont get out with 500 per month in pension benefits they call 
that a pension plan 
well stay on strike as long as it takes caldarazzo said 
bethlehem steel and union officials were called together by a 
federal mediator thursday afternoon but a twohour meeting yielded 
no progress the union said 
workers on wednesday rejected the companys latest offer by a 
6to1 margin following the recommendation made by leaders of local 
33 the international association of machinistsindustrial union of 
marine and shipbuilding workers of america 
the threeyear pact expired at midnight 
bethlehem steel told union members this week that despite the 
overall profit last year the yard lost 41 million last year and 
30 million the year before 
the union initially asked for acrosstheboard increases of 2 an 
hour the first year of the contract and 1 an hour during each of 
the following two years but murphy thornton president of the 
shipbuilders local said the union lowered its proposal during 
negotiations 
bethlehem steel offered some wage increases but not enough to 
replace wage concessions granted in 1984 union officials said the 
offer reportedly also did not contain pension improvements sought by 
the union 
thornton said the last raise the members received was in 1983 
and that was followed in 1984 by a 1 an hour pay cut 
under the company offer firstclass mechanics who now earn 
1062 an hour with costofliving increases included would get 
raises of 85 cents an hour in the first year 45 cents in the second 
year and 50 cents in the third 
secondclass mechanics who now earn 1050 would see raises of 22 
cents 15 cents and 21 cents thirdclass mechanics would get raises 
of 18 cents 10 cents and 14 cents thornton said

some representatives of the alcohol industry say 
education not a larger pinch of the wallet is the way to curb 
abuse and make up for heavy drinkers costs to society 
their comments came in response to a study that found alcohol 
taxes cover less than half the costs that heavy drinkers impose on 
the public through auto accidents sick leave and other expenses 
the study recommends doubling the federal tax on alcohol in 
part to serve as a deterrent to alcohol abuse 
the real answer to alcohol abuse and any social costs 
associated with it is education of the public and especially the 
young said gary zizka of the national beer wholesalers 
association in a telephone interview thursday from washington 
in countries such as sweden where the 
controlofavailability tactics have been tried they have proven to 
be monumental failure said janet flynn of the distilled spirits 
council of the united states in washington 
researchers writing in todays journal of the american medical 
association say smokers just about pay their own way 
william g manning a health economist who led the study for the 
rand corp in santa monica calif found smoking costs to society 
average 38 cents per pack just over the average 37 cents per pack 
currently levied in state and federal sales and excise taxes 
but alcohol costs society 48 cents per ounce more than double 
the current average state and federal tax of 23 cents per ounce 
manning and his associates said 
the contrast between smoking and drinking is that the drinker 
sometimes takes an innocent bystander with him said manning now 
a professor at the university of michigan in ann arbor 
higher beer taxes would make particular sense he said 
because its the drug of choice for teens and young adults who 
drive when theyre drunk 
the research is the first to look strictly at the external 
costs of smoking and drinking the costs to society exclusive of 
what smokers drinkers and their families pay the authors said 
previous studies reached markedly different conclusions 
acknowledged manning but they often lumped both types of cost 
together and didnt consider them over a lifetime its the cost to 
others that is relevant in establishing tax rates 
the authors defined four types of external costs 
collectively financed benefits such as health insurance 
pensions sick leave disability insurance and group life insurance 
insured property loss from smokingrelated fires and drunken 
driving accidents 
loss of life from such accidents 
alchoholrelated costs in the criminal justice system 
nonsmokers subsidize smokers to the extent that smokers poor 
health habits and shorter lives mean they pay less in taxes and 
premiums than the expenses they incur in medical bills and death 
benefits 
but smokers collect fewer pension benefits so their payments 
underwrite nonsmokers retirement and nursing home care the 
researchers said 
an estimated 2400 deaths are attributed annually to breathing 
other peoples smoke 
traffic accidents killed an estimated 48950 americans in 1988 
and about half of those deaths were drinkingrelated according to 
the national safety council

charges will be filed against whoever 
introduced a banned pesticide into chicken feed forcing the 
slaughter of 400000 tainted birds a federal food safety and 
inspection service official said 
none of the contaminated meat reached consumers because the 
presence of heptachlor was detected through routine testing before 
the poultry made it to grocery shelves inspection chief lester 
crawford said thursday 
authorities were investigating how the feed at townsends poultry 
products in batesville ark was mixed with the suspected 
cancercausing pesticide that was banned for agricultural use six 
years ago 
crawford said the pesticide was applied to a component of feed 
townsends received and distributed to chicken producers 
townsends the ninthlargest poultry producer in the united 
states handles more than 23 million chickens each year for 
producers around batesville which is about 90 miles northeast of 
little rock 
since the pesticide turned up in january during routine tests of 
chicken parts at a campbells soup co frozenfoods factory in 
fayetteville chickens worth 600000 voluntarily have been 
slaughtered said townsends plant manager tom vanemburg two 
million pounds of townsends poultry was stored in a warehouse for 
testing the food safety and inspection service said 
crawford said that if the food and drug administration can find 
out who first treated seed grain with heptachlor prosecution is to 
follow 
we will always try to make a case because this is an illegal 
activity to add an adulterant to animal feed whether intentionally 
or unintentionally he said 
checks during the last month at other feed mills around 
batesville havent turned up heptachlor crawford said but our 
first suspicion is always treated seed 
the batesville plant closed voluntarily for 11 days after the 
contamination was discoverd

the boeing co plans to spend 11 billion on 
plants and equipment in 1989 a 63 percent increase over the past 
year according to the annual report of the aerospace giant 
the report issued thursday did not give any breakdown of the 
spending plans but paul binder of boeing said since we have most 
activities here in the seattle area the majority of these funds 
would be spent here 
boeings plant and equipment expenses amounted to 690 million in 
1988 738 million in 1987 and 795 million in 1986 
earlier this week boeing officials announced plans for a 430 
million expansion and overhaul over the next five years at the 
companys renton complex where production of 757 and 737 jetliners 
is being boosted from the current 19 a month to 24 a month by the 
middle of next year 
the report said capital spending this year will provide more 
space and equipment for current research and development new and 
current programs and measures to improve productivity 
record orders have resulted in a backlog of 1100 commercial 
jets and boeing is boosting the production rate for the 767 and 747 
as well as the 737 and 757 by late next year company officials 
expect to be cranking out at least 34 planes a month 
the annual report also confirmed previous reports of a 28 percent 
gain in earnings in 1988 but contained a sour note in the form of a 
95 million loss in boeings military aircraft business 
analysts many of whom had predicted lower losses blamed 
troublesome contracts including one to build new wings for a6 navy 
fighters 
the a6 rewing project continued to be a major challenge 
and company managers still face major technical and schedule 
problems the report said 
theyve got a real rocky picture there said analyst paul 
nisbet of prudential bache securities in new york 
despite higher production costs and costly embarrassing delays 
in delivering new 747400 jumbo jets the companys commercial 
airplane division logged 113 billion sales a 156 percent 
increase 
operating profits were 585 million for the division the highest 
in more than five years and an increase of 66 percent from 1987 
sales rose 37 percent to 145 billion for missiles and space 
products with operating profits rising by 42 percent to 124 
million for the year

a court battle pitting microsoft against 
apple computer could highlight pivotal questions about copyright 
creativity and the future development of software for personal 
computers industry analysts say 
the whole industry is going to breathe a sigh of relief when 
this case is decided even if the decision is unpopular said 
kenneth wasch an attorney and executive director of the software 
publishers association in washington dc 
apple sued microsoft a year ago charging the redmond company 
with copyright infringement 
apple claimed that microsoft exceeded a contract granting it the 
right to use the look and feel of apples macintosh computer in 
certain microsoft windows programs for ibm and compatible 
computers 
look and feel is industry jargon for how a program appears on 
a screen and is acted upon by the user 
microsoft the nations largest software developer for personal 
computers filed a countersuit saying that its contract permits 
microsoft to bring the simplicity and graphical look of apples 
macintosh to the ibm and compatible personal computer world through 
windows microsoft asked for a summary judgment dismissing apples 
suit 
apple also names hewlett packard in the suit hp licensed windows 
from microsoft to develop a program called new wave 
arguments in the case are scheduled to be heard friday in us 
district court in san francisco before judge william schwarzer if 
questions are raised about the contract the second phase of the 
case would be heard in august 
right now apple and microsoft are speaking different 
languages said william pope senior corporate counsel for 
microsoft we are looking at the same words and saying they mean 
different things we need the judge to give us a common language 
apple had no comment on the litigation 
the seattle times reported thursday that underlying the contract 
language dispute are more fundamental copyright questions the 
answers to which could affect the future course of software 
development nationwide 
what kind of software can be copyrighted who owns an onscreen 
look what is an obvious programming technique and what is 
infringement on somebody elses intellectual property there are few 
answers yet 
these are pivotal issues in the industry said robert 
therrien a stock analyst with painewebber in new york right now 
the legal status of who owns what is unclear 
the nations no 2 and no 3 personal computer software companies 
behind no 1 microsoft spreadsheet maker lotus development corp 
and database maker ashtontate are also suing competitors accusing 
them of copyright infringement those cases have yet to go to court 
legal experts and the software publishers association see 
dangers to the software industry in this litigious atmosphere 
nationwide there appears to be a trend that copyright and 
patent protection is being used as a tool to protect market share 
said esther schachter publisher of the computer law amp tax report 
while that may bring shortterm gains for companies schachter 
said the longterm effect on the industry may be devastating 
were talking about an industry in its infancy which has a 
great need for the maximum amount of freedom and creativity 
schachter said stifling that creativity may put a damper on the 
development of the software industry 
introduced in 1984 apples mac computer is famous for its 
ease of use thanks to its copyrighted graphical user interface 
or onscreen set of pictorial commands 
what is happening now is that the look and feel of the 
macintosh is being emulated all over the ibm pc world wasch 
said 
to most users and even software developers in the ibm world that 
is good news wasch said 
microsoft helped fuel the popularity of the mac with a leading 
spreadsheet and wordprocessing software now microsoft clearly 
intends to duplicate its success on the worlds 25 million 
ibmstyled machines 
the software that runs those pcs is called dos also from 
microsoft windows now gives dos a maclike graphical user 
interface microsoft says it sells 60000 copies of windows each 
month as many macs as apple sells 
more recently microsoft and ibm have produced a newer version of 
windows called presentation manager which is built into microsofts 
and ibm corps new operating system os2 designed to 
run only on newer more powerful pcs os2 is the heir apparent to 
dos 
the new version of windows means that if apple wins big 
microsoft and ibm could face a sudden and potentially disastrous 
roadblock to bringing the ease of a mac to the ibm pc

a national shortage of potatoes caused by 
last years drought is helping oregon growers get the highest prices 
in years for their crop as the marketing season winds down 
officials say 
were shipping to processors in michigan and california who 
arent usual buyers said will wise administrator of the oregon 
potato commission 
we expected to see effects from drought in other states last 
year and less acreage planted and this is a manifestation of 
that wise added 
a us agriculture department report last week showed a klamath 
basin price of 12 per 50pound carton of larger potatoes sized 
7090 per carton wise said 
the price in the same week last year was only 350 a carton 
smaller spuds in the same area sold for 10 to 1150 per 100 
pounds up from 4 a year ago wise said 
the higher prices likely will drive up the prices of potato 
chips according to manufacturers 
we can get all the potatoes we need but the price has about 
doubled said simran khalsa chief operating officer at ns 
khalsa co in salem which makes kettle chips 
the company plans to boost its wholsesale price 6 percent next 
week and reduce advertisements and promotions khalsa said 
oregon has about 570 potato farmers who harvested almost 21 
billion pounds last year from 45000 acres down from 26 billion on 
55000 acres in 1987 
low prices prompted growers to cut planting last year but drought

the shortage will encourage farmers to boost plantings this year

higher price for the 1989 crop he contracts to sell to chip makers

a top wall street executive has begun a campaign 
for a measure he says would stimulate savings without aggravating 
the governments budget problems 
william schreyer the chairman of merrill lynch amp co contends 
that his idea would put some renewed sex appeal into individual 
retirement accounts 
at the same time he says it would help to pay in advance for 
the future costs of health care and the wellbeing of the rapidly 
growing numbers of older americans 
schreyers idea put forward in speeches he has been giving this 
month is not to restore the tax breaks for ira contributions that 
were curtailed by the tax reform act of 1986 not right away at 
least 
rather he is proposing that ira savers be given the right to 
withdraw money from their accounts in the future for certain 
purposes medical educational and home ownership without having 
to pay tax on the proceeds 
schreyers argument starts from the premise that the nation needs 
to increase its chronically low savings rate if it is going to be 
able to bear the costs of supporting an aging population in the 
decades ahead 
but he also acknowledges a more immediate need to settle current 
accounts that are out of whack 
the deficit crisis is real he says weve got to find ways 
to encourage increased savings that take little or nothing out of 
the treasurys hide now 
of course schreyer is hardly a disinterested party in the debate 
over tax policy when iras were opened up to all working americans 
in 1982 they became lucrative products for firms like merrill lynch 
in 1987 when deductions for contributions ended for married 
couples making 50000 or more a year and individuals with incomes 
of 35000 and up the flow of money into these accounts slowed 
significantly 
but does his idea have merit at first glance at least it looks 
like a tax break that would benefit upperincome people the most 
hence it wouldnt seem to have much chance of attracting support in 
congress 
however supporters of the idea point out the situation isnt 
quite that simple all ira withdrawals except for the amount of 
nondeductible contributions made by the welltodo are now subject 
to tax 
so under schreyers proposal all american workers would have a 
greater incentive to put as much money as possible in iras the 
interest dividends and capital gains that now build up taxfree 
inside iras would remain taxfree when they were taken out 
whats more the accounts could be used to plan not just for 
retirement but for other goals schreyer describes as socially 
desirable including education and to help shoulder the burden of 
the mounting cost of health care 
but the idea raises several tough questions first of all what 
would it mean for future government budgets 
if taxpayers were able to build up large new amounts of money 
that the government could lay no claim to might tax rates on other 
income have to be raised and new types of taxes be created 
furthermore would ira contributors totally buy the idea that 
their money could actually never be taxed 
recent tax changes have tainted principles that once were thought 
to be sacrosanct for example no taxes on taxes well state 
sales taxes no longer are deductible and the deduction for state 
income taxes barely survived the last debate about changing the 
rules 
schreyers case is that the nation should be thinking longterm 
in handling its finances as legions of financial advisers have 
pointed out in recent years that is hard to do in a climate where 
the tax rules are subject to frequent and seemingly limitless 
change

two new york businessmen have denied 
accusations that they cheated coleco industries inc out of millions 
of dollars 
isaac perlmutter and bernard marden are accused in documents 
filed in us bankruptcy court in new york by a group of creditors 
involved in colecos chapter 11 case 
but perlmutter and marden said in court documents that all their 
dealings with coleco have been in good faith and without 
fraudulent intent 
the two men have asked judge prudence b abram to dismiss the 
lawsuit filed against them on feb 14 no trial date has been set 
coleco based in avon filed for protection from creditors in 
july citing debts of 5403 million 
perlmutter and marden are together owed about 80 million and 
represent one group making them the toy companys single largest 
creditor they also are first in line to have their claims paid once 
the bankruptcy matter is settled 
the lawsuit was filed by a second group that includes 
bondholders manufacturers and advertising agencies owed a total of 
400 million 
the two businessmen become colecos largest creditor when they 
bought the companys bank debt from a group of us and foreign 
banks but it is their past dealings with coleco that has drawn the 
wrath of the others 
the creditors charge that perlmutter and marden cheated and 
overcharged coleco during the past two years through a complex 
scheme involving the sale of the company excess products in 
exchange for television advertising time 
coleco often sold its excess toys to beckman group a new york 
closeout company owned by perlmutter and marden 
the television credits were given through admerex international 
another company owned by the two men it specializes in buying 
television commercials 
the lawsuit charges that during a twoyear period perlmutter and 
marden received 144 million of merchandise from coleco and paid the 
company 73 million in cash and 764 million in advertising credits 
to use the credits coleco was required to pay 40 percent of the 
cost of a television commercial and use the credits for the other 60 
percent so 506 million in cash was needed to use the 764 
million in credits the lawsuit claims 
the lawsuit charges that perlmutter and marden knew coleco was 
having financial problems and did not have money available 
therefire it claims the two cheated coleco out of 71 million by 
giving the company worthless advertising credits 
the lawsuit also accuses the two of overcharging coleco 27 
million for television commercials that the company did run in the 
past two years 
coleco which is not a defendant in the suit said the charges 
are without merit

senate democrats moved to choke off debate 
today on legislation to force federal intervention in the eastern 
airlines strike but the first test of strength was postponed until 
after a twoweek recess 
sen edward m kennedy dmass made a move to shortcircuit 
republican opposition while union officials appealed separately to a 
senate committee for changes in the federal bankruptcy law that 
would weaken the companys hand in the bitter dispute 
under senate rules the vote on the democratic attempt to advance 
the legislation was put off until april 5 the measure approved 
earlier in the week by the democraticcontrolled house would 
require president bush to name an emergency board to recommend a 
solution to the strike and would impose a 26day coolingoff period 
during which the airlines employees would receive prestrike wages 
eastern oppposes the bill and bush has argued that dispute 
should be settled directly between the two sides 
the maneuvering on the senate floor came while union leaders 
called on the senate judiciary committee to allow easterns 
creditors access to the assets of the parent company texas air 
corp the proposal brought an immediate objection from texas air 
officials 
eastern sought protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy 
code on march 9 five days after its unions began their walkout 
negotiations to end the strike and an accompanying syumpathy walkout 
by pilots are moribund and the intensifying struggle in congress 
marked a new phase in the dispute 
bankruptcy has become a tool in the hands of people like frank 
lorenzo to break their unions said william winpisinger president 
of the international association of machinists whose dispute with 
eastern provoked the strike 
frank lorenzo is the chairman of texas air and has been accused 
by easterns unions of selling the carriers assets to other texas 
air subsidiaries to easterns detriment 
elliott seiden texas airs associate general counsel countered 
that the proposed legislation would threaten healthy companies 
simply because they are partial owners of ailing subsidiaries 
in the future no corporation could or would consider acquiring 
a troubled airline or starting a new airline seiden said 
on the senate floor lawmakers debated another laborsupported 
bill that would force president bush to try to help end the bitter 
strike 
republicans staved off democratic efforts to consider the 
housepassed measure quickly thursday night arguing that the issue 
is so complex that it should be studied for at least a week by a 
senate committee bush has opposed the bill and his aides have said 
he would veto it 
gop lawmakers made it clear thursday night that they would use 
senate rules to block any vote at least until the chamber returns 
from its twoweek easter recess which begins tonight 
i dont say thered be a filibuster but the debate will be 
intense and i think there are a lot of different views said 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
under a filibuster lawmakers attempt to use lengthy debate to 
kill legislation 
the legislation before the full senate would require bush to name 
an emergency board to recommend a solution to the strike and would 
impose a coolingoff period of up to 26 days during which the 
airlines employees would receive prestrike wages 
bush has argued the dispute between eastern and its unions which 
has built up over 17 months should be settled directly between the 
two sides 
supporters of the measure have argued that a presidential board 
could present a proposal each side could agree to without appearing 
to give in to the other 
after hours of closeddoor meetings between democrats and 
republicans ended late thursday senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine tried to commence debate on the measure arguing 
that steps should be taken to end the twoweek old walkout 
the coolingoff period wont hurt it will help said 
mitchell what would hurt is further delay and further inaction 
republicans countered that more study was needed 
to just ram this thing down on the floor i think is just 
rushing blindly into a situation where we might doom any potential 
eastern has to save itself at all said sen orrin hatch rutah 
the airlines 8500member international association of 
machinists precipitated the walkout and were followed by easterns 
pilots and flight attendants 
the house passed the unionsupported bill by a 252167 vote with 
all but 20 votes coming from its majority democrats

employee complaints helped prompt grand 
metropolitan plc to reinstate pillsbury cos director of 
affirmative action at least until a company task force completes its 
report 
a group of employees called the pillsbury black network along 
with the leader of the twin cities chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people had written to 
company officials protesting the transfer of the affirmative action 
directors duties to the human resources department 
grand met which acquired pillsbury in january for 57 billion 
eliminated the affirmative action job along with 550 others at 
pillsburys minneapolis headquarters as part of a costcutting move 
the thing that convinced management that this position should 
be reinstated was really the employees concern said mary 
carroll vice president of external affairs for grand mets food 
sector 
one of the concerns the employees pointed out was that it was 
fine to have a task force but what would happen until the task 
force makes its recommendations that was a major reason for 
the reinstatement carroll said 
pillsbury spokesman larry haeg said today there has been no 
litigation involving anything affirmative actionrelated at 
pillsbury which has 67000 employees worldwide including 1800 at 
the corporate offices 
carroll said the affirmative action director jean fountain was 
also appointed to the task force that will investigate how the 
company should pursue affirmative action goals fountains job will 
be reinstated until the task force findings are in and then well 
have more to say carroll said 
the company also will hire an affirmative action consultant to 
work with the task force 
local naacp leader matthew little said he is pleased with grand 
mets willingness to reconsider its decision and said it 
demonstrates that the company is concerned about its impact on the 
twin cities community a concern he said the community shares

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said 
today he had no hesitation in eating apples treated with the 
chemical alar saying the health risk was minuscule 
if you want to avoid food that has any potential health risk 
youre going to have a very narrow diet youll be down to 75 
pounds real fast yeutter told a meeting of the national newspaper 
association 
in my view the health risk of an apple that has been treated 
with alar is nominal is minuscule he said 
the agriculture secretarys comments came as federal health 
officials tried to reassure parents that apples are safe for 
children amid conflicting claims about the possible health effects 
of alar and other chemicals used by growers 
i have no hestitation in eating apples whether they do or do 
not have treatment for alar yeutter said we ought not to be 
frightened by actions of carefully orchestrated media efforts into 
altering our consumption patterns he said 
i have five children and five grandchildren and i would not 
hesitate to have them have these apple products now food and 
drug administration commissioner frank young said today on abcs 
good morning america show 
officials from the environmental protection agency and the fda 
told congress on thursday there is no reason for parents or school 
officials to stop giving apples or apple products to their children 
after reminding a senate subcommittee of the quick action taken 
earlier this week by the fda to get chilean fruits off the market 
because of fears of contamination young vowed he would do the same 
for apples if he thought it necessary 
but young told the panel the fda has never discovered residues of 
alar a growthregulating chemical technically known as daminozide 
in apples anywhere close to the minimum allowed by the epa 
in 800 samples tested since 1981 for alar he said the highest 
residue level found was 8 parts per million the epa allows a 
maximum level of 20 parts per million he said 
there does not appear to be a need for panic he said 
john a moore acting deputy epa administrator said any 
suggestion that children are gravely at risk is simply untrue 
moore criticized the recent study by a private environmental 
group natural resources defense council which suggested that 
children may be exposed to dangerous levels of carcinogenic 
chemicals in fruits and vegetables because they eat large amounts in 
proportion to their weight the study singled out alar 
since the study parents have reportedly been discarding apples 
and apple products school districts in los angeles chicago new 
york san francisco miami and elsewhere have stopped serving apples 
in school cafeterias 
officials in los angeles said on thursday that apples and some 
apple products that have shown no traces of pesticides in tests 
there are being returned to school district cafeterias 
although the epa has acknowledged the link between daminozide and 
cancer moore said thursday he considers the health risk 
insufficient at current use and residue levels to warrant its 
immediate removal from the market 
nevertheless moore said the epa would reject daminiozide if it 
were a new chemical up for approval now and the agency plans to 
seek its removal he said that process could take three years 
in a separate statement the epa fda and the agriculture 
department said the federal government believes that it is safe 
for americans to eat apples 
despite that vote of confidence the defense council reiterated 
its concerns during testimony before the senate subcommittee on 
children family drugs and alcoholism 
actress meryl streep a leader of mothers and others for 
pesticide limits questioned whether anyone knows the extent of the 
danger from alar and other pesticides on food products she said 
many of the older pesticides have yet to be reexamined using 
current health standards 
i think what we dont know about this issue is whats so 
alarming said ms streep who has three small children 
government and industry witnesses said growers have sharply 
curtailed their use of alar in recent years because of the health 
concerns even though its manufacturer uniroyal inc disputes epa 
claims that it is carcinogenic 
the apple market is dead as a doornail right now across 
america said sen steven symms ridaho whose family is in the 
apple business 
thomas hale president of the washington apple commission said 
after the senate hearing that millions of dollars could be lost 
because of the controversy but that it was too early to assess the 
economic consequences

bond prices plunged in their steepest drop of the 
year and interest rates rocketed higher after the government 
reported a strongerthanexpected rise in a key inflation measure 
for february 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond was down 2 points or 20 
per 1000 face amount at midday while its yield which moves in 
the opposite direction from price climbed to 931 percent from 911 
percent late thursday 
the previous biggest daily drop this year in the 30year bond 
price was a 1 point decline on feb 9 
traders scrambled to sell bonds within moments of the labor 
departments report that wholesale prices soared 10 percent in 
february matching the previous months rise the gain was twice as 
big as most analysts expected 
robert brusca chief economist for nikko securities 
international said the report was terrible news for the bond market 
because it indicated inflation poses a problem despite the federal 
reserves efforts to curb it by pushing interest rates higher 
given whats going on with oil prices we cant say we expect 
good news next month either there is nothing good in this 
report he said 
inflation frightens bond investors because it erodes the value of 
fixedincome securities and increases chances that the central bank 
will encourage higher interest rates further depressing bond prices 
brusca said he expects the federal reserve will respond to the 
latest sign of growing inflationary pressures by encouraging a 
steady rise in the federal funds rate the interest rate banks 
charge each other for shortterm loans 
kevin flanagan a money market economist for dean witter reynolds 
inc said his firm expects the federal funds rate will reach 10 
percent in april

the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was down 1013 at 111076

shipments of washington apples dropped by 
152000 boxes in the past week a sign that some consumers have 
stopped buying because of the alar scare an industry official said 
today 
the weekly report of outofstate shipments of the nations 
largest apple crop showed a drop from 156 million boxes two weeks 
ago to 14 million boxes last week 
for the same week last year shipments were 15 million boxes 
said bill dewitt of the wenatchee valley traffic association 
based on the top price quoted thursday for the three main apple 
varieties in washington the loss to growers from last weeks 
shipment decline could be as much as 24 million 
im sure part of this downtrend is the alar scare said 
dewitt manager of one of two major apple shipment recordkeeping 
organizations in the state there is no doubt in my mind 
exports to foreign countries were down 35000 boxes from 173000 
boxes to 138000 boxes last week dewitt said 
that downturn is mostly taiwan he said of the mass 
cancellations of orders by taiwanese exporters in recent weeks 
the shipment figures are compiled by the state department of 
agriculture from scores of warehouses across the state and they 
show the number of 42pound boxes of apples purchased by retailers 
wholesalers school districts institutional customers and other 
apple users 
the shipment figures are considered an accurate barometer of 
consumer sales 
dewitt said there was no way to tell how much of the drop in 
shipments was related to a widespread ban of apple products in 
school cafeterias and how much was a drop in retail sales some 
schools announced this week that apples would return to cafeterias 
next week 
the alar scare was ignited in late february when the nonprofit 
natural resources defense council issued a report saying eating 
apples treated with the chemical daminozide marketed as alar 
increased the cancer risk in children 
the apple industry has disputed the findings and also maintained 
that only about 5 percent of the crop is treated with the chemical 
but the concerns raised by the nrdc were enough to cause many of 
the nations largest school districts to ban apples from cafeterias 
and prompted the cancellation of thousands of boxes worth of 
taiwanese orders 
the federal environmental protection agency food and drug 
administration and department of agriculture this week also declared 
apples safe for americans to eat

departments producer price index mean that inflation one stop 
short of the retail level is running at a 126 percent annual rate 
so far in 1989 
that is more than triple the 40 percent increase for all of last 
year and the worst twomonth increase in nearly eight years 
prices in both january and february were pushed up by surging 
energy and food prices but the cost of other items which are 
generally more stable increased at a worrisome rate in february as 
well 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said we are of course 
concerned about any indications of more inflation adding we 
also believe that the longterm outlook for inflation is that it 
will remain low and under control 
the twin surges surprised analysts who in advance of both 
reports had predicted moderate rises of about 04 percent 
it look bad its far worse than anyone expected said 
economist michael k evans who heads a washington forecasting firm 
based on these figures no reasonable person could deny the 
conclusion that inflation has worsened 
president bushs chief economic adviser michael boskin speaking 
in a television interview an hour before todays figures were 
released said we want to remain prudent and vigilant against an 
acceleration of inflation and urged congress to act swiftly on a 
credible plan to curb the budget deficit 
we dont want to let that inflation genie out of the bottle 
that would be a bad thing and it would take quite a bit of work to 
get that genie back in he said on nbcs today show 
wholesale food prices rose 12 percent last month the steepest 
increase in 13 months they had risen almost as much in january 11 
percent 
most food items were up except eggs which dropped 15 percent 
after rising 201 percent in january food prices were led by 353 
percent increase in vegetables including a huge 158 percent rise in 
tomato prices 
energy prices jumped 24 percent overall in february following a 
49 percent increase a month earlier the latest surge was led by a 
41 percent rise in gasoline prices the same as januarys increase 
and a 19 percent advance in the cost of natural gas fuel oil 
prices fell 31 percent recovering somewhat from an 116 percent 
surge a month before 
analysts expect little relief in energy prices in the next few 
months as the vacation driving season begins crude oil prices near 
20 a barrel are at a 17month high propelled by the success of 
oilproducing nations in controlling output 
wholesale prices excluding the volatile food and energy 
catagories rose a worrisome 06 percent in february up from a 04 
percent rise a month earlier 
toilet paper prescription medicines books and flatware prices 
all increased substantially 
the overall february increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1117 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 11170 last month that 
was up 70 cents from january and 560 or 53 percent from 
february 1988 
before todays inflation report financial markets had been 
rallying this week after the government reported evidence of some 
welcome cooling in the economy last month 
the federal reserve board has been pushing interest rates higher 
for the past year in an effort to moderate the strong economic 
growth fueling inflation 
the fed has been concerned in particular about tight labor 
markets with unemployment at a 15year low and strains on factory 
capacity 
this week analysts spotted what some thought were signs that the 
feds tight money policy was beginning to bite use of factory 
capacity eased in february for the first time in five months retail 
sales fell by the widest margin in a year and housing starts posted 
the sharpest decline in nine months 
but economist allen sinai of the boston co said slower economic 
growth does not immediately calm prices 
there is a long time between when the economy softens and slows 
down and when inflation once entrenched begins to recede he 
said 
despite the severe price hikes in february at the finished goods 
level items such as bread and clothing the index for earlier 
stages of production indicated wholesale inflation likely will 
moderate at least from the pace set so far this year 
prices at the intermediate level representing items such as 
flour and cloth rose 05 percent while the cost of crude goods 
commodities such as cotton and wheat dipped 01 percent 
the labor department will report next tuesday on how much 
wholesale price pressure in february fed through to consumers in 
january retail prices increased 06 percent the steepest rise in 
two years

developer donald trump is negotiating 
to buy a longdormant hotelcasino project that would expand his 
holdings in this resort city a published report said friday 
the press of atlantic city quoting unidentified sources said 
trumps representatives have been talking with owners of the former 
penthouse boardwalk hotel casino project which is located next to 
the trump plaza hotel and casino 
trump could not be reached for comment friday his secretary said 
trump was not in his office and likely would not be available for 
comment 
trump has tried to buy the penthouse property in the past but 
was turned down by penthouse if he is successful trump is expected 
to convert the project into a noncasino hotel linked to trump 
plaza the press said 
last november trump sold resorts international inc to 
entertainer merv griffin and bought back from resorts its unfinished 
taj mahal casino complex here 
a deal to buy the penthouse project could be complicated by an 
agreement between penthouse and pratt hotel corp which planned to 
convert the property into the sands hollywood hotel casino the 
press said 
the 55 million deal apparently also includes the site of a 
proposed parking garage located one block away from the penthouse 
site it remains uncertain how trump could buy that property since 
penthouse bought it in partnership with pratt hotel corp 
william weidner president of pratt hotel corp told the press 
he knew about rumors that trump and penthouse officials were 
talking he questioned whether penthouse would be able to sell the 
property 
we have a valid contract in place and i think they penthouse 
officials run the danger of some rather expensive litigation if 
they try to do something other than sell it to us weidner told 
the newspaper

a federal grand jury has issued fraud indictments 
against three former executives of an aerospace company that last 
fall paid a record 1153 million in fines for overcharging the 
government on defense contracts 
the three men were charged with conspiring to defraud the defense 
department scheming to conceal material facts and making false 
statements 
sundstrand corp pleaded guilty in october to fraud and agreed to 
pay a 115 million fine the largest fraud settlement in defense 
department history 
the indictments unsealed thursday resulted from a continuing 
threeyear investigation of the rockfordbased defense contractor 
us attorney anton valukas said 
the three middle to upperlevel executives were identified as 
joseph mccarthy 53 of rockford a former division controller ray 
john chapel jr 46 of reston va a former division pricing 
manager and ralph hamann 63 of rockford a former pricing group 
supervisor 
the three executives were all previously assigned to sundstrands 
advanced technology group which manufactures electrical power 
systems for military and commercial aircraft 
mr mccarthy categorically denies that he conspired to conceal 
from the government one of sundstrand corps accounting 
practices said his lawyer henry f schuelke iii of washington 
chapels attorney jack bray said the government has indicted 
someone who was not part of the problem but part of the 
solution but declined to comment further hamanns attorney 
refused to comment 
if convicted mccarthy faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in 
prison and 1 million in fines chapel and hamann could face 30year 
terms and 15 million in fines 
sundstrand spokesman claude vernam said the company was not 
involved in the indictment of these individuals and they are not 
employed here for these reasons its not appropriate for the 
company to comment further 
assistant us attorney william clabault who will be one of the 
prosecutors if the men go to trial declined to say whether the men 
were acting on orders of company superiors or whether they have 
agreed to cooperate 
the government contended the aerospace manufacturer had 
overbilled the government for aircraft parts obtained some 
contracts by underbidding actual costs then attempting to recover 
them through overhead accounts set up for other purposes and 
submitted claims for such things as babysitting expenses country 
club memberships and even servants for some executives 
on jan 26 sundstrand agreed to repay an additional 623 
million to the pentagon and make costsaving concessions on future 
contracts that one defense official estimated could be worth an 
additional 34 million

public radio and television programming faces 
serious disruption unless congress finds money to replace a 
satellite expected to fail in 1991 the corporation for public 
broadcasting said today 
cpb officials who also are seeking full financing of their 
fiscal 1992 budget authorization of 265 million urged a senate 
panel to provide an additional 14319 million to replace the 
satellite which since 1980 has handled the public broadcasting 
network 
cpb president donald ledwig said failure to receive the satellite 
money would force the public broadcasting system to divert scarce 
resources away from programming and into satellite replacement 
he said that would seriously disrupt and adversely affect 
public broadcastings programming nationwide 
the satellites useful life will end in 1991 when its 
transponders which relay tv signals to public radio and tv stations 
around the country run out of fuel 
congress last year authorized 200 million to replace the 
satellite but thus far it has appropriated only 5681 million for 
fiscal 1991 for the project cpb said 
the bush administration has proposed freezing cpbs fiscal 1992 
appropriation at its 1991 level of 24206 million with no 
additional funds to replace the satellite 
cpb board chairman r kenneth towery testifying before a seate 
appropriations subcommittee said the freeze recommendation 
directly counters the intent of congress to fund cpb at levels 
that reflect reasonable federal support for the nations public 
telecommunications system 
dollar for dollar the funds spent for public broadcasting are 
the most efficient means of ensuring that all americans have access 
to outstanding educational cultural and informational programming 
and services towery said 
cpbs request of 265 million in general programming support only 
amounts to approximately 1 for each us citizen for the year 
he said adding that more than 100 million people watch public tv 
each week and more than 10 million listen to public radio 
today approximately threefourths of all families with 
children under the age of six watch and learn from public television 
regularly ledwig said 
he also said longrange funding is essential to public 
broadcastings ability to obtain the nonfederal revenue that makes 
up the 81 cents of every dollar the system spends 
cpb is a private nonprofit corporation that was authorized by 
the public broadcasting act of 1967 to develop noncommercial radio 
and tv programs

inflation is a nuisance to say the least but 
would you really pay the price of getting rid of it altogether 
if you say yes you have made a decision that no president or 
federal reserve chief has ever dared make 
there is a very high price to eliminating inflation or even 
making the attempt and whoever steers the economy in that direction 
is likely to provoke his or her own good riddance 
inflation might have a bad reputation but to some extent it is a 
necessary evil in maintaining a strong economy in a limited sense 
say some economists it can even be a measure of economic 
enthusiasm vitality and intensity 
roger brinner economist at dri mcgrawhill the old data 
resources organization so highly esteemed by many economists 
recently accused the federal reserve of not having the courage to 
eliminate the cussed curse 
brinner wasnt encouraging the fed to pursue such a course he 
was merely stating what he believed to be a fact of economic life 
and to demonstrate this he put some hypothetical numbers in his 
computer economic model 
he asked it 
what unemployment rate would the fed have to target in the 
early 1990s in order to bring inflation to zero by 1995 
it answered 
unemployment would rise to an average of 86 percent over the 
next five years more than three million workers who are now 
employed would be unable to find satsifactory jobs output would be 
depressed an average of 5 percent 
all this observes brinner in order to cut inflation by four 
percentage points relative to current rates and by five percentage 
points relative to rates predicted for 1995 
such numbers clearly suggest why pursuit of zero inflation at 
this time would be foolhardy the gain would be minor the damage 
inestimable for a president it would be political suicide for a 
fed chairman professional ruin 
the problem with attempting to erase ingrained inflation is that 
it is bound to force unemployment higher and almost certain to 
reduce output while this might not be a law of economics it is a 
very powerful thesis 
simply put says brinner the theory is that inflation will 
continually fall as long as slack exists in labor and goods 
markets if that sounds innocuous you may be sure it isnt 
right now there is very little slack in either unemployment is 
just a bit over 5 percent of the civilian labor force a low figure 
for recent years while factories are operating at about 85 percent 
of capacity a high figure 
when you reach those figures you are close to starting the fires 
of serious inflation stressed both markets react by pushing up 
their price tags ie wage levels and the prices of goods 
to eliminate inflation slack is necessary 
the greater the slack the greater the yeartoyear decline in 
inflation will be says brinner 
the dri mcgrawhill models conclusion explains to some degree 
the adage that a lot of inflation is a dangerous thing while a 
little inflation can be tolerated 
based on the current level of economic understanding it is all 
but impossible to fine tune the economy to zero inflation while 
protecting the country from serious recession and political 
explosions 
in short its just not worth the effort the price is too high

oil prices should slip lower in the second 
quarter after a surprising 7 surge over the last six months as 
parties on both sides of the barrel adjust to a more favorable 
petroleum climate analysts say 
the onset of warmer weather should dampen demand which has been 
running higher than normal this year 
moreover the 13 opec nations might not want prices to rise much 
higher for fear that such large nonopec producers as the united 
states britain and canada will be encouraged to start pumping more 
of their own oil 
on thursday the april contract for west texas intermediate the 
benchmark us crude finished at 1984 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange the highest since the nearmonth contract 
closed at 1996 on oct 30 1987 in early trading today prices 
topped the 20 level for the first time since october 1987 
were close to what i call a blowoff which means we are ready 
to set a top said nauman barakat vice president of energy 
investments for prudentialbache securities inc 
barakat said thursday he expects prices to top 21 over the next 
few weeks before reversing and heading back toward 19 
i dont think the market can sustain 20 for any length of 
time said james steel an energy analyst with refco inc at 
that price we will see more production from opec as well as canada 
the united states and others 
opec has to watch out that they dont undermine their own 
position like they did in 1979 steel said 
high oil prices in 1979 fueled by an arab oil embargo against the 
united states and western europe led to more exploration and higher 
production by nonopec countries strong prices also encouraged 
conservation and demand for opec oil fell 
last october crude prices sank to a twoyear low of 1260 a 
barrel due to a world glut stemming partly from overproduction by 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries in november 
after months of haggling the cartel decided to set a production 
limit of 185 million barrels a day to lift crude prices to 18 a 
barrel 
although opec continues producing more than 19 million barrels a 
day the cutbacks have been enough to restore investor confidence 
and spur demand among customers who had allowed their inventories to 
dwindle market observers say 
also for the first time ever several nonopec producers such as 
mexico and the soviet union have decided to cut exports by about 
300000 barrels in the second quarter as a show of unity with opec 
problems with various oil producing facilities in the north sea and 
declining production in the united states also have contributed to 
lower output 
while production has declined demand and prices have risen and 
us oil supplies have dwindled 
analysts said buyers had allowed their inventories to slip as 
prices inched up thinking prices would decline with the approach of 
warmer weather but that weakness did not materialize and customers 
have been buying inventory to avoid possibly higher prices later 
barakat said 
a 48cent surge in west texas intermediate on wednesday stemmed 
partly from an american petroleum institute report showing crude oil 
and product inventories had fallen dramatically in the week ended 
march 10 heating oil stocks reached their lowest point since 1972 
due largely to a decline in us refinery capacity and an increase 
in middle eastern capacity analysts said 
strong demand also reflects healthy economies in major producing 
areas including the united states western europe and the far east 
steel said 
however theres not that much more demand to justify much 
higher prices steel said i dont see any pressure now but i 
think we will reach an equilibrium sometime soon 
japan and some european countries already have lowered their 
crude orders from february levels analysts said 
john odea manager of international energy futures at dean 
witter reynolds inc said that although strong demand and lower 
output imply higher prices 18 probably was closer to a longterm 
price 
anything much over 18 a barrel the opec countries will make 
a pretty good profit he said but market share is also 
important maybe more so than profits

the bush administration said today it would 
allow chilean fruit back on the us market ending a fiveday 
public health scare sparked by the discovery of traces of cyanide in 
two grapes 
with these and other safeguards in place we believe that this 
program will provide the maximum feasible safety for fruit from 
chile fda commissioner frank young told a news conference after 
outlining a plan for stepped up inspections in this country and 
abroad 
young said he had high confidence of detecting anything if 
something was there but he conceded it is impossible to insure 
100 percent safety and he urged grocers and consumers to make 
their own checks when chilean fruit reappears on the shelves in five 
to nine days 
the plan was announced despite a third poisoning threat received 
by the us embassy in santiago young said he said he got word of 
the latest threat which was made today a short time before he 
announced the plan he said the latest threat doesnt raise any more 
concern than the first two 
young outlined the administrations plans for ending the fiveday 
public health scare after president bush told reporters the 
quarantine of chilean fruit had been justified despite any economic 
hardship it imposed 
it has cost some economic hardship that i regret bush said 
i think when the health of the american people might be 
threatened youve got to take prudent action the president told 
reporters aboard air force one en route back to washington 
at a crowded news conference a few minutes later young said 
we are now ready to reintroduce chilean fruit beginning with 
grapes blueberries raspberries and strawberries 
he said that since the small amounts of cyanide were found in two 
grapes over the weekend no additional evidence of contamination has 
been uncovered he said 13000 crates of fruit have been inspected 
since the two poisoned grapes were found 
young said chilean fruit en route to the united states would be 
subjected to increased inspection and said the chilean government 
would take safety measures before allowing produce to leave the 
country 
he said fruit in some ships in port in philadelphia also would be 
inspected 
but he said any chilean fruit in the hands of importerswill 
be destroyed to eliminate fruit that cannot be practically 
inspected 
the discovery of the two poisoned grapes touched off a major 
public health care in this country and difficulties of a different 
sort in chile where fruit is a major export and where thousands of 
agricultural workers have been threatened with the loss of their 
jobs during the peak harvest season the government has sent 
highlevel diplomats to this country in recent days to try and speed 
a resolution of the problem 
chilean foreign minister hernan felipe errazuriz called the us 
decision a workable solution 
it takes into account the interest of the us citizens and the 
chileans the consumers and the workers from chile he said at the 
white house where he met with vice president dan quayle 
young dismissed questions about who would bear the cost of the 
lost fruit and the inspections the day i start to look at health 
with regard to somebodys left hip pocket or pocketbook then i am 
not focusing enough in regard to safety he said 
in addition to the cost to importers consumers may also feel the 
pinch at the checkout lines economist donald ratajczak of georgia 
state university said fruit prices on supermarket shelves will rise 
at least temporarily because of the chilean scare 
most of what will be left on the shelves will be hothouse grown 
domestically and that will be more expensive he said 
young said the fda would borrow inspectors from other agencies to 
help with future inspections he said that would begin with the 
agriculture department where secretary clayton yeutter said he had 
agreed to loan as many as 200 inspectors to help 
young said inspectors would examine 5 percent of the fruit that 
arrives in this country from chile a dramatic increase from the 
normal 1 percent 
at the same time he called on consumers to conduct their own 
inspections and look for injection marks unusual appearance 
discoloration or chemical or almondlike smells 
he said chile had already undertaken steps to eliminate 
opportunities for tampering from the chilean fields to the united 
states 
errazuriz met thursday with secretary of state james baker and 
called for swift action to avoid further economic and social 
turmoil in chile according to a joint communique issued after the 
meeting 
the statement said 200000 chileans and their families face 
unemployment and even destitution 
the two sides agreed to address the problem on an urgent 
basis recognizing the danger to the chilean economy and the 
need to protect the safety of american consumers 
as part of an effort to cool tempers in chile the administration 
has sought to assure chileans that the sales suspension was not 
politically motivated but rather was aimed at safeguarding the 
health and safety of americans 
as chilean fruit continued to pile up at airports and docks the 
us food and drug administration said a small team of fda 
inspectors was to be sent to chile to check security on chilean 
fruit 
inspectors at ports in philadelphia los angeles and miami have 
examined 6859 cases of grapes and nearly 4000 cases of other 
fruits honeydew melons nectarines apples raspberries pears 
cantaloupes plums peaches seedless watermelon juan canary melons 
and blackberries 
in miami robert aders the president of the food marketing 
institute said the entire food industry will be hurt by the 
discovery of cyanide in chilean produce and cancercausing chemicals 
in apples 
the loss will probably be felt throughout the system he said

president bush said today he has made no 
decision on a deal that would enable japan to build an advanced 
version of the f16 fighter plane 
its a good one to be sure you listen carefully to all sides 
ofand thats what we are doing bush told reporters aboard air 
force one as he flew back to washington from colorado 
no decision has been made i have not made any decision at 
all bush said 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said thursday the administration 
wants to go ahead with the controversial technology transfer 
agreement involving the fsx warplane which japan wants to deploy in 
the late 1990s 
but he said there are at least three or four basic issues 
regarding the agreement that still must be resolved 
fitzwater speaking with reporters on air force one as bush flew 
to houston for a speech said a final presidential decision on the 
fsx may not come until next week 
he said bush was reviewing documents and reading position papers 
while on the plane once the president decides on safeguards then 
we would be able to announce that we are prepared to go ahead with 
an agreement fitzwater said 
what hes deciding are the terms of the agreement that we would 
want to strike for the coproduction of the plane the spokesman 
said 
under the usjapan agreement initialed late last year st 
louisbased general dynamics would join forces with japans 
mitsubishi heavy industries to codevelop and coproduce the 
nextgeneration fighter 
proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the 
united states could negotiate in the face of japanese opposition to 
buying f16s directly from the united states they say the deal will 
serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in both directions 
while generating income and jobs for us industry 
but critics contend the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of 
advanced technology that japan may use to help propel its civilian 
aircraft industry into headtohead competition with the united 
states in the world market they say tokyo should purchase 
americanmade planes to help offset the 50 billion us trade 
deficit with japan 
opposition to the aircraft deal within the administration has 
been led by commerce secretary robert a mosbacher backed by other 
cabinet members including budget director richard g darman us 
trade representative carla hills and energy secretary james d 
watkins 
pushing for approval of the deal as negotiated with japan have 
been officials of the pentagon and state department including 
richard l armitage assistant secretary of defense for 
international security affairs

a naval officer today denied a news report 
that five japanese ships were seized in retaliation for japans 
decision to ban imports of chilean fruit he said the ships were 
detained for safety inspections 
on thursday chileans ate grapes apples and other produce in 
defiance of a cyanide poisoning scare that resulted in the japanese 
ban and warnings in the united states and canada that caused chilean 
produce to be removed from stores 
japanese officials said that only two fishing trawlers were 
receiving a strict inspection by chilean authorities 
the bush administration said today it would release chilean fruit 
for public consumption but said any produce already in storage must 
be destroyed 
with these and other safeguards in place we believe that this 
program will provide the maximum feasible safety for fruit from 
chile fda commissioner frank young told a news conference in 
washington 
he outlined the administrations plans for ending the fiveday 
public health scare after bush told reporters the quarantine of 
chilean fruit had been justified despite any economic hardship it 
imposed 
since traces of cyanide were found in two chilean grapes in 
philadelphia tens of thousands of chilean fruit workers have been 
laid off and chile has lost millions of dollars in export revenues 
chilean officials say chile exports about 65 percent of its fruit 
to the united states 
chiles foreign minister hernan felipe errazuriz said in 
washington that 200000 chileans and their families face 
unemployment and even destitution 
navy lt jose araya said in an interview with the associated 
press today that the five japanese trawlers were undergoing a 
mandatory thorough safety inspection at three ports in southern 
chile 
this is necessary for the safety of all people on board those 
vessels araya said once inspectors are satisfied with the 
safety standards of the boats they will let them sail off 
he said he did not know how long the inspection would take 
on thursday the official news agency orbe quoted navy capt 
patricio urbina as saying the five japanese trawlers were seized 
in the ports of talcahuano chacabuco and punta arenas in southern 
chile 
it quoted adm jose merino navy commanderinchief as saying 
the japanese have closed their market to chilean fruits so im 
holding their ships merino who is also president of the 
lawmaking military junta also was quoted as saying none of them 
is going to fish in our waters until they reopen the market to our 
fruits 
but araya said the ships were merely detained for safety 
inspections and did not say the action was meant as a retaliation 
for the japanese ban 
on thursday pinochet made a surprise visit to a fruitpacking 
house and said foreign reaction to the cyanide scare was 
exaggerated he ate several seedless white grapes to show they were 
safe they are very good said pinochet who took power in a 
bloody 1973 military coup 
at rallies in santiago on thursday chileans waved antiamerican 
signs and ate the native grapes peaches pears nectarines and 
granny smith apples the us japan and canada have urged consumers 
to avoid

a union leader at pan am corp said today he will meet with the 
head of eastern airlines striking machinists union to discuss a 
possible combination of the two airlines that would involve 
ownership by employees 
meanwhile strikedecimated eastern told many of its remaining 
workers to take time off without pay and the chairman of its 
parent texas air corp hinted that selling the airline might be 
his next step 
william f genoese director of the teamsters unions airline 
division told the associated press that he and eastern machinists 
leader charles bryan plan to meet saturday to discuss strategy and a 
possible employee buyout 
bryan confirmed he would meet with genoese but declined to say 
whether they would explore an easternpan am combination 
were going to be discussing a whole range of subjects he 
said in a telephone interview from his office in miami 
financial analysts say the leading potential buyer for eastern is 
financier carl icahn the owner and chairman of trans world airlines 
inc the eastern machinists indicated last week they want him to 
explore a possible buyout 
eastern which once had 30000 workers told its 1500 remaining 
nonunion employees thursday to work 60 hours without overtime pay 
some weeks and take other weeks off without pay as it sought new 
ways to cut costs 
there are not going to be any layoffs right now said eastern 
spokesman james ashlock as we are now stabilized at this schedule 
of about 110 flights a day theres not enough work to justify the 
amount of people on hand 
eastern does not want to lose the employees because it still 
hopes to rebuild ashlock said but in an interview scheduled for 
broadcast tonight texas air chairman frank lorenzo said selling the 
airline off could be more likely 
its possible that the most sensible way for eastern airlines 
to proceed would be for some different types of ownership in some 
way lorenzo told barbara walters for abcs 2020 show 
citing the planned sale of easterns profitable northeast shuttle 
to millionaire developer donald trump as an example lorenzo said 
the deal would produce more than 300 million and just the 
interest on that 300 million is more than eastern has ever earned 
on the shuttle even in its best years 
also thursday eastern resumed jetliner service between boston 
and washington but ashlock had no comment on reports that eastern 
was trying to hire new pilots it needs to add other routes 
the company is operating at about 10 percent of its former 
schedule of 1040 daily flights ashlock said eastern returned seven 
direct roundtrip flights between boston and washington to the 
schedule thursday but the loads are not heavy we have a lot of 
seats 
before thursday eastern was offering only flights on its shuttle 
service between boston and new york and between new york and 
washington and some flights to latin america 
federal regulations restrict pilots from flying more than 30 
hours per week preventing eastern from returning to other routes 
without more pilots 
the eastern pilots union which estimates that fewer than 200 of 
3600 eastern pilots have flown since the machinists strike began 
predicted that easterns reported search for pilots would be 
fruitless 
i know theyre out there trying to hire but i dont know where 
they would get them said union spokesman jb stokes 
he said other airlines are offering better pay better 
conditions certainly better management 
the strike began march 4 with a walkout by 8500 machinists 
mechanics and ground service workers in a dispute over 125 million 
in proposed wage cuts the strike quickly escalated with the support 
of pilots and flight attendants five days later eastern filed for 
bankruptcy reorganization 
among other developments 
in denver labor activists staged a rally thursday to kick off 
a campaign to discourage passengers on continental airlines and tie 
up ticket lines more than 1000 union members and supporters 
rallied outside the stapleton international airport terminal 
denouncing lorenzo 
in upstate new york police said 21 members of the 
communications workers of america were arrested for yelling at 
passengers buying tickets inside the lobby at syracuse hancock 
international airport union officials said they only sang songs and 
chanted in support of the striking eastern mechanics 
in washington thursday republicans used a parliamentary 
maneuver to delay a senate vote on a houseapproved measure that 
would require president bush to appoint an emergency panel to try to 
end the walkout that could delay the vote until after the senates 
twoweek easter recess which begins saturday 
meanwhile the federal trade commission recommended that eastern 
airlines ticketholders who purchased tickets for canceled flights 
with a credit card appeal for refunds commission spokeswoman anna 
davis said card companies are obligated under the fair credit 
billing act to refund charges for which services were not performed

wholesale prices soared 10 percent in february for the second 
consecutive month the government reported today sending stock and 
bond prices tumbling 
the dow jones average of 30 leading industrial stocks which 
plunged about 50 points right after trading opened was down 4714 
to 229357 at 2 pm on wall street that was off sharply from the 
sixweek high the popular market indicator had reached just thursday 
amid sentiment that inflation might be slowing 
bond prices a sensitive barometer of inflation speculation 
also fell sharply before leveling off the governments bellwether 
30year bond was down nearly 2 points or 19 per 1000 of face 
amount at midday while its yield jumped to just over 93 percent 
the identical backtoback increases in wholesale prices as 
measured by the labor departments producer price index were 
propelled by rises in energy and food prices 
the increases mean that inflation at the wholesale level one 
stop short of retail is running at 126 percent annual rate so far 
in 1989 that is more than triple the 40 percent increase for all 
of last year 
both large jumps had surprised analysts who had predicted 
moderate rises of about 04 percent after januarys numbers were 
reported economists dismissed them as an aberration and said 
inflation would return to the 4 percent to 5 percent annual pace of 
late last year 
wholesale food prices climbed 12 percent the steepest increase 
in 13 months energy prices jumped 24 percent and analysts 
anticipate little relief as the vacation driving season nears and 
crude oil prices continue to hover around the 20abarrel mark 
on thursday government reports on housing construction and 
factory use indicated the economy might be cooling off 
in its report on housing starts the commerce department said new 
homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 15 million units in february down 114 percent from januarys 
rate of 169 million units 
part of last months decline was due to the weather which turned 
cold again after an unseasonably mild january but analysts said 
higher mortgage rates were taking their toll 
analysts said a longerterm slowdown in the housing market also 
reflects the steady upward climb of interest rates 
in a separate report the federal reserve said the nations 
industrial operating rate also known as factory use eased last 
month for the first time since september 
us factories mines and utilities operated at 843 percent of 
capacity in february down 02 percentage point from january when 
the 845 percent rate was the highest in nearly a decade the fed 
reported 
at the same time the pace of industrial production held steady 
in february after 12 months of steady advances the central bank 
said in a second report 
the news was welcomed by those worried that the overheating 
economy is pushing up prices the closer factories get to full 
capacity the greater the fear they will have trouble producing 
enough goods to meet demand leading to shortages and price 
increases 
federal reserve vice chairman manuel johnson told reporters the 
figures are consistent with the notion of some moderation in the 
economy although it would be premature to say they signal a trend 
the reports heartened traders in the stock market the dow jones 
average of 30 industrial stocks rose 2017 to 234071 its highest 
close since it stood at 234321 on feb 8 the day before that the 
average hit a postcrash high of 234714 
traders took the fed reports as evidence that inflationary 
pressures in the economy were easing but analysts were cautious 
about reading too much into one months figures 
bond prices finished little changed in light trading analysts 
said the government reports met the markets expectations 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond rose 132 point or 31 
cents per 1000 face amount while its yield which moves in the 
opposite direction from price was about 911 percent roughly even 
with late wednesday 
many traders remained on the sidelines awaiting todays producer 
price report

drexel burnham lambert inc has rejected a 
government demand to fire financier michael milken immediately 
further delaying settlement of fraud charges against the investment 
firm sources said friday 
the refusal by drexel chief executive frederick h joseph marks a 
possibly significant roadblock in resolving civil charges and could 
complicate resolution of criminal charges stemming from a twoyear 
federal investigation into one of wall streets biggest and most 
profitable companies 
drexel already has agreed to government demands to axe milken 
withhold his multimilliondollar 1988 pay and bar him from ever 
speaking with members of the firm about any business matters 
but the latest request by the securities and exchange commission 
would require the 42yearold financier to immediately leave the 
firm which he helped develop into the leader in the highyield 
junk bond market 
milken who has emerged as a leading figure in a federal campaign 
against securities abuses is expected to be charged with a range of 
fraud and racketeering charges he has denied wrongdoing and has 
been working parttime at drexels beverly hills calif office 
while preparing his defense 
sources who have direct knowledge of the settlement negotiations 
said sec enforcement director gary lynch made the new demand during 
talks earlier this week joseph told lynch the firm wouldnt do it 
said the sources who spoke on the condition they not be identified 
lynch told fred joseph they need to fire michael prior to any 
settlement being signed and agreed to by the sec said one source 
the thinking by the sec is that if drexel does that then 
milken has less of a case because theyre not mandating his 
firing the source said 
firing milken would not be a written provision of the settlement 
with the sec the source said 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to comment on any part 
of the negotiations as did a spokesman for milken sec spokeswoman 
mary mccue also refused to comment 
drexel already has conceded to terminating milken as part of a 
deal settling criminal charges with the manhattan us attorneys 
office reached in december drexel also agreed to plead guilty to 
six felony counts and pay a record 650 million in fines and 
restitution 
milken has asked a federal judge to reject or modify the pact 
which cannot be approved by a federal judge until the sec deal is 
completed his lawyers say firing him and withholding earned 
compensation denies him his legal rights 
the sec is said to want milken ousted immediately regardless of 
his legal challenge to the criminal settlement on grounds that all 
employees that the agency believes are responsible for illegal 
activities should be purged 
sources said the government also wants to insure that milken is 
fired because his legal challenge may take months to resolve and he 
could remain at the firm indefinitely

soybean futures prices closed mostly higher but 
wheat and corn ended mixed friday on the chicago board of trade 
because inflationary developments are viewed as favorable to 
commodity prices most traders expected the governments report of a 
strong 1 percent rise in the producer price index would prove a boon 
for the futures markets 
instead after a short climb on the opening prices in all three 
pits quickly slid on a wave of selling that some traders attributed 
to concerns in the financial markets where stocks and bonds fell 
sharply 
wheat stayed in a narrow range all day as the market split on 
conflicting forecasts of how much rain will hit the winter wheat 
areas of the plains this weekend 
soybeans however made a stunning recovery 15 cents on some 
contracts on late buying by professional and commission houses 
either covering short positions or squaring up for the weekend 
there was no fresh news but the same people who were selling 
the market early turned out to be the ones who bought it late 
said vic lespinasse a floor trader for dean witter reynolds 
on the close wheat was 3 cents lower to cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 434 a bushel corn was cent 
lower to cent higher with march at 278 a bushel oats were 
cent lower to cent higher with march at 208 a bushel and 
soybeans were 1 cent lower to 6 cents higher with march at 769 
a bushel

the worlds biggest futures exchanges 
traded jabs friday while pitching competing electronic trading 
systems to hundreds of brokerages but brokers said they want to use 
the systems before expressing a preference 
the systems are key elements in plans by both the chicago 
mercantile exchange and chicago board of trade to compete against 
foreign exchanges for aroundtheclock trading in the increasingly 
globalized commodities markets 
the systems also are seen as helping to monitor trading practices 
that are object of an ongoing federal probe into alleged fraud and 
other abuses in the chicago futures markets 
both would replace the traditional openoutcry trading system in 
which traders crammed into pits on exchange floors make buy and sell 
deals via hand signals and shouts 
the board of trades proposed aurora system and the globex system 
being developed by the merc and londonbased reuters holdings plc 
differ in the way they look on computer screens aurora resembles a 
video game while globex looks like a financial spreadsheet 
the merc has touted the development of globex for some time 
while the board of trade formerly a critic of electronic trading 
only recently revealed that it planned its own electronic system 
leo melamed chairman of the chicago mercantile exchanges 
executive committee referred to the chicago board of trade as a 
johnnycomelately to electronic trading board of trade board 
member burt gutterman alluded to the mercs system as bombarding 
users with information 
some of the brokers who attended both presentations at the 
futures industry associations annual convention said they could not 
express a preference until they have worked with both systems 
neither system will be operational until this fall 
if there was one system or if there was some standardization 
that would be desirable said john conheeney chairman of merrill 
lynch futures inc 
but apparently from what weve seen so far thats not going to 
happen 
before the 1970s futures markets traded only commodities such 
as gold wheat or frozen concentrated orange juice but the chicago 
mercs first successful introduction of financial instrument 
contracts such as treasury bill futures in 1972 revolutionized the 
industry and attracted investors from around the globe 
the chicago exchanges which lead the world in financial futures 
volume want to make their markets accessible to investors in europe 
and asia when their own trading floors are closed at night 
all orders to buy and sell us futures contracts now are 
executed by openoutcry trading 
the board of trade which commands about half of all us futures 
volume launched an evening trading session about two years ago in a 
largely successful effort to give japanese investors easier access 
to its popular us treasury bond contract 
the merc which trades foreign currency and stockindex futures 
announced plans to develop globex in september 1987 at that time 
the board of trade criticized electronic trading saying it could be 
easily abused and would never match the efficiency of openoutcry 
trading 
but in early february of this year the board of trade revealed 
that it was working on its own computerized trading system the 
board of trade now says it had aurora under development even while 
it was criticizing globex 
but many industry observers believe aurora is a response to the 
january disclosure of a federal investigation of trading fraud at 
the chicago exchanges 
the probe has raised questions about recordkeeping by pit 
traders recordkeeping would be done by computers in an electronic 
trading system theoretically making it easier to detect cheating 
melamed recalled the board of trades reversal on friday and 
alluded to its claim that aurora with its electronic replication of 
a futures pit is superior to globex 
now come those critics again those johnnycomelatelys and 
tell us well maybe it was a good idea after all but the 
technology is all wrong melamed said 
globex they say is not like openoutcry you bet it is not 
melamed said while we recognize the value of openoutcryit is 
simply not the only or last or even the best answer to the worlds 
needs 
melamed said globex which matches buy and sell orders 
anonymously evens the odds for small traders thus improving on the 
openoutcry system 
board of trade officials emphasized auroras video gamelike 
display which they hope will appeal to offthefloor traders and 
brokers who watch globexlike pricequote screens all day 
this protects the user from being bombarded with alphanumeric 
symbols said gutterman

the stock market took its sharpest drop in nearly 
a year friday as a new surprise on inflation jolted wall street 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell 4857 to 229214 
for its biggest point decline since it tumbled 10146 last april 14 
that all but wiped out strong gains recorded earlier in the week 
leaving the average with a net increase of 10 points from the 
previous fridays close 
declining issues outnumbered advances by almost 7 to 1 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks 
volume on the floor of the big board reached an eightweek high 
of 24290 million shares against 19604 million thursday 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 27831 million shares 
before the opening the government reported that the producer 
price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in 
february matching its increase the month before 
that news came as a rude shock to stock traders who had been 
expecting a gain of about half that size and set off a new wave of 
inflation and interestrate worries 
in the credit markets prices of longterm government bonds 
which move in the opposite direction from interest rates fell about 
1750 for each 1000 in face value 
conjecture immediately began to spread in the financial world

international business machines the no 1 holding of investing 
institutions said its firstquarter earnings would fall short of

futures and individual stocks

a sharp stock market selloff sparked by renewed 
inflation fears friday triggered futures trading limits aimed at 
preventing another market crash 
the price limits on stockindex futures trading on the chicago 
mercantile exchange were used for the first time since being imposed 
last year by major financial markets 
sparking the trading frenzy was the labor departments report of 
a largerthanexpected increase in februarys producer prices 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials plummeted about 50 points 
on the opening and held at lower levels throughout the day as a new 
wave of inflation fears and worries that the federal reserve would 
boost interest rates rippled through the market 
the dow industrials finished down 4857 points at 229214 
last october the securities and exchange commission and the 
commodity futures trading commission approved a series of socalled 
circuitbreaker measures designed to calm jittery volatile 
markets and prevent a repeat of the black monday crash of oct 19 
1987 
many critics blamed the effect of computerized strategies 
involving simultaneous trading of stocks and stock index futures for 
worsening the black monday crash when the dow jones average fell 
508 points 
as a result regulators approved plans to limit trading when it 
appeared that sharp price movements in the futures markets where 
stock index futures are traded might spark ensuing plunges in the 
stock market 
part of the plan stipulates that sampp 500 futures price movements 
be limited for 30 minutes once the sampp 500 contract drops 12 points 
to give the markets a coolingoff period such a decline is 
equivalent to roughly a 100point drop in the dow industrials 
on friday a separate fivepoint price limit on the sampp 500 
contract was in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading when 
traders sold off the contract following the inflation report 
merc officials and the new york stock exchange conferred by phone 
during the opening limit the merc said in a statement issued after 
the market close the merc said the sampp 500 limit coordinated an 
orderly opening and noted that the markets continued to trade 
normally afterward 
although the plunge in the dow was noteworthy it came nowhere 
near the 250point drop required to temporarily suspend stock market 
trading under the circuit breaker plan trading on the major us 
exchanges would be halted for an hour on days when the dow drops 250 
points 
if there is an additional 150point plunge for a total of 400 
points in a single day a second circuit breaker would impose an 
additional twohour halt 
stock market activity also was intensified somewhat on friday by 
the triple witching hour the quarterly simultaneous expiration of 
options and futures on stock indexes 
this situation often prompts abnormally heavy trading by 
professionals engaged in complicated strategies involving trading of 
both the options and futures and the individual stocks

placing undercover regulatory police on 
the trading floors of futures exchanges sounds invasive but they 
may be needed to help curb trading fraud a highranking chicago 
mercantile exchange official said friday 
but the chicago mercs planned improvements to its internal 
surveillance systems should make it unnecessary to have government 
moles patrol the trading pits added john f sandner a special 
adviser to the exchanges board of directors and its immediate past 
chairman 
sandner made the comments in an interview with the associated 
press following rep glenn englishs statement thursday that he 
would not rule out the possibility that his investigative panel 
would consider giving federal regulators the authority to place 
undercover watchdogs on the floors of futures exchanges to guard 
against the kind of trading abuse being investigated by the justice 
department in chicago 
it sounds like a pretty invasive approach but we dont object 
to that approach if it is warranted sandner said 
but once congressman english sees what the chicago mercantile 
exchange is going to do as far as supervising our pits and 
increasing surveillance i think that will be unnecessary 
officials of the chicago board of trade the worlds largest 
futures market declined to comment on englishs remark 
the chicago merc is the worlds secondlargest futures exchange 
english dokla chairs a house agriculture subcommittee that is 
examining the fitness of futurestrading regulation 
he spoke thursday at the futures industry associations annual 
meeting here 
the federal undercover probe of suspected trading abuse at the 
chicago exchanges has not yet yielded any charges but it has 
focused attention on the opportunities for cheating and prompted 
lawmakers to take a closer look at fraud detection and prosecution

a union leader at pan am corp said he planned to 
meet the head of easterns striking machinists union saturday to 
discuss a possible employeeled buyout that would combine the two 
troubled airlines 
william f genoese director of the teamsters unions airline 
division told the associated press that he and charles bryan 
planned to discuss a possible combination of eastern and pan am 
his bryans fight is our fight genoese said friday in a 
telephone interview from miami well do everything we can do in 
order to make this successful 
the employees of the two carriers would be able to secure 
financing for a buyout by agreeing to labor concessions said 
genoese who also serves as head of the teamsters local at pan am a 
combination of the two airlines would give pan am domestic routes to 
feed into its international network he said 
bryan confirmed that he planned to meet with genoese but declined 
to say whether they would explore an employeeled easternpan am 
combination 
were going to be discussing a whole range of subjects bryan 
said from his office in miami 
eastern has been crippled since last its machinists went on 
strike march 4 and later were joined by most of the airlines pilots 
and flight attendants 
spokesmen for other unions at the two airlines werent available 
for comment pan am spokeswoman pamela hanlon in new york and 
eastern spokesman robin matell in miami said their companies had no 
comment on the meeting 
financial analysts say the leading potential buyer for eastern 
remains financier carl icahn the owner and chairman of trans world 
airlines inc who expressed his interest last fall the eastern 
machinists indicated last week they want him to explore a possible 
buyout and he expressed a willingness to do so if eastern did not 
object 
eastern would provide twa with the same sort of fit between 
domestic and international routes that a pan ameastern combination 
would create 
pan am like eastern has been racked by financial losses and 
labor tensions pan am chairman tom plaskett recently said the 
carrier probably would need to merge with another airline to ensure 
its survival 
last year pan am imposed 35 million in pay cuts on its 4200 
teamsters who are led by genoese after they rejected a new 
costcutting contract 
two negatives dont make a positive said robert joedicke an 
airline analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc referring to a 
possible pan ameastern combination the cards are stacked against 
them 
as the labor crisis at eastern has escalated bryan has been the 
nemesis of eastern boss frank lorenzo genoese has long been a thorn 
in the side of pan am and other airlines where the teamsters are 
represented 
the teamsters at pan am and the 8500 eastern machinists both 
represent baggage handlers although there are differences in the 
composition of the two unions 
bryan and genoese said the teamsters plan to contribute 100000 
to the eastern employees strike fund

wholesale prices surged 10 percent in 
february matching the january increase and marking the worst 
backtoback news on inflation in nearly eight years the government 
said friday 
the identical increases in the labor departments producer price 
index mean that prices one stop short of the retail level have risen 
at an annual rate of 126 percent so far this year 
not since march and april of 1981 have prices risen so sharply 
for two months in a row wholesale prices rose 40 percent last year 
stock and bond prices tumbled after fridays report the dow 
jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 50 points in the first 
half hour of trading and closed down 4857 at 229214 the 
evidence of resurgent inflation renewed traders fears that the 
federal reserve board will push interest rates higher 
that would increase the governments cost of financing the 27 
trillion national debt which would be bad news for president bush 
who is trying to trim the budget deficit without raising taxes 
bush speaking to reporters as he returned to washington from 
colorado said his administration would always be vigilant against 
inflation and never relax our concern 
he said the best way to beat inflation would be an agreement with 
congress to reduce the deficit and called fridays report another 
clarion call to do something negotiators from capitol hill and 
the white house will exchange proposals next week on bringing down 
the deficit 
bushs remarks amount to a shift in his rhetoric previously the 
president has said he is not overly concerned with inflation and 
interpreted economic reports less negatively than the federal 
reserve 
many economists had dismissed the january inflation news 
including a 06 percent rise in the consumer price index the 
largest in two years as at least a partial aberration and had 
predicted only a moderate 04 percent climb in wholesale prices in 
february 
with the latest report its difficult to put a happy face on 
it said undersecretary of commerce robert ortner theres no 
other interpretation that can be put on it other than it shows a 
pickup in inflation 
prices in both january and february were pushed up by soaring 
energy and food prices but the cost of other items which are 
generally more stable increased at a worrisome rate in february as 
well 
wholesale food prices rose 12 percent last month the steepest 
increase in 13 months they had risen 11 percent in january 
meat and most other food items rose while eggs dropped 15 
percent after rising 201 percent in january food prices were led 
by 353 percent increase in vegetables including a huge 158 percent 
rise in tomato prices 
economist donald ratajczak of georgia state university said beef 
prices should continue to rise through the spring until ranchers 
can rebuild herds that were culled by extra slaughtering during last 
summers drought 
he said fruit prices will continue to rise at least temporarily 
because fruit grown domestically in hot houses is more expensive 
than chilean fruit held off supermarket shelves because of the 
cyanide scare 
energy prices jumped 24 percent overall in february following a 
49 percent increase a month earlier the latest surge was led by a 
41 percent rise in gasoline prices the same as januarys increase 
and a 19 percent advance in the cost of natural gas fuel oil 
prices fell 31 percent recovering somewhat from an 116 percent 
surge a month before 
ratjczak said he expects further increases in energy costs as the 
vacation driving season begins crude oil prices at 20 a barrel 
are at a 17month high propelled by the success of oilproducing 
nations in controlling output 
wholesale prices excluding the volatile food and energy 
catagories rose a brisk 06 percent in february up from a 04 
percent rise a month earlier toilet paper prescription medicines 
books and flatware prices all increased substantially 
the overall february increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1117 meaning that a hypothetical selection of 
goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 11170 last month that 
was up 70 cents from january and 560 or 53 percent from 
february 1988 
despite the severe price hikes in february at the finished goods 
level increases earlier in the production process were more 
moderate prices at the intermediate level rose 05 percent while 
the cost of crude goods dipped 01 percent after two months of 
increases above 3 percent a loaf of bread is an example of an item 
at the finished goods level flour at the intermediate level and 
wheat at the crude level

the federal communications commission on 
thursday repealed a rule that had limited contracts between 
television networks and their local affiliate stations to two years 
the fcc said the rule adopted in 1945 when tv networks were just 
forming and lining up local outlets for their programs was no 
longer necessary to assist in the development of new tv networks in 
todays television industry of alternative delivery systems such as 
satellites and cable 
the current video marketplace provides so many opportunites for 
establishing alternative networktype systems for the delivery of 
video programming that existing networks will not be able to 
foreclose the entry of new networks in the future the commission 
said 
without the rule new networks may find it easier to attract 
capital and advertisers if they can attract a stable crop of 
affiliates the fcc said 
elimination of the rule may in fact facilitate new entry and 
thereby enhance competition and provide even greater program 
diversity to the public the agency said 
longer contracts may permit a more solid financial base for 
networks and affiliates with longer contracts will have a longterm 
guarantee of programming that may make it easier for them to attract 
advertisers the commission said

international business machines corps stock 
plunged and helped pull down the dow jones industrial average friday 
after the company said it expected its firstquarter profit to be 
below security analysts estimates 
ibm attributed the earnings disappointment to a chip problem that 
delayed delivery of some computers in its 3090s mainframe line and 
said the problem had been fixed 
ibms stock sank 562 a share to 11250 a drop of nearly 5 
percent in consolidated new york stock exchange trading ibms 
drop added to the decline in the dow jones average of 30 industrial 
stocks which had already been hammered by a report of a jump in 
wholesale prices 
a 562 drop in ibms price translates into an 8point drop in 
the dow average overall the average fell 4857 points to 229214 
the decline in ibms price occurred even though the company 
simultaneously announced plans to increase prices for most of its 
products and services by nearly 5 percent effective immediately 
higher prices would tend to increase revenue and profitability 
ibm had acknowledged earlier this month that a chip problem was 
delaying delivery of its big mainframe computers but at the time had 
said it could not determine what effect if any there would be on 
its quarterly results 
it said it now had enough information to predict earnings below 
analysts forecasts but the statement was ambiguous because it did 
not specify which forecasts it would be below said analyst wendy 
abramowitz of argus research corp she noted that quarterly 
forecasts range from 165 to 215 per share 
zacks investment research inc of chicago said the consensus 
earnings forecast of the analysts who report their results to it is 
179 a share for the first quarter and 1098 for 1989 as a whole 
that compares with ibms actual earnings of 153 in the first 
quarter of 1988 and 980 a share for 1988 
ibm spokesman peter judice said the production problem involved 
chips manufactured by ibm a shortage of usable chips caused delays 
in assembly and shipping of the mainframe computers they go into he 
said he declined to be more specific 
the chip problem that occurred earlier in the quarter has been 
fixed and the company is working hard to minimize any inconvenience 
to customers ibm said in a statement 
for the year as a whole ibm said the delivery delays will make 
it more difficult for ibm to achieve the higher end of the range of 
analysts earnings estimates those estimates range as high as 
1180 a share 
excluded from the 5 percent price increase announced friday are 
personal system2 personal computers and baselayer system software 
maintenance agreement prices on all products and recently announced 
products and price changes including the new enterprise system3090 
model 100s and newly introduced models of the application system400

the government national mortgage association has 
seized control of a 24 billion portfolio of loans from heights of 
texas fsb a thrift formed last year from four insolvent 
institutions federal officials said 
the federal agency known as ginnie mae took over administration 
of the portfolio after houstonbased heights did not pass through 
mortgage payments to investors who own the loans said agency 
spokesman jack flynn 
the takeover ranks as the biggest single default for the agency 
the dallas morning news reported thursday the agency already has 
contributed 15 million to make up for shortfalls in the payments 
flynn said 
ginnie mae part of the us department of housing and urban 
development insures securities backed by home mortgages lenders 
pool their loans for sale to investors in secondary markets 
providing fesh cash to the institutions to make new mortgages 
however the thrifts usually retain servicing rights including 
the collection of mortgage payments for disbursement to holders of 
the ginnie mae securities 
ginnie mae only insures payments on loans already insured by the 
federal housing administration or guaranteed by the veterans 
administration but those two agencies have increasingly refused to 
take back homes choosing instead to reimburse lenders at a flat 
rate

a government report on inflation belted the stock 
and bond markets friday with the dow jones industrial average 
plunging nearly 50 points on fears of spiraling prices crushingly 
high interest rates and a possible recession 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 4857 points 
to 229214 its biggest drop since a 10146point plunge last april 
14 
in the inflationsensitive bond market the treasurys benchmark 
30year bond was down more than 17 for every 1000 in face value 
in late trading pushing the yield to nearly 93 percent from 91 
percent late thursday 
the shock came from a labor department report that wholesale 
prices rose 10 percent in february equalling januarys surprising 
rise and projecting an annual wholesale inflation rate of 126 
percent 
inflation erodes the value of bonds and produces high interest 
rates that sap money from the stock market wholesale price 
inflation so far this year is more than triple the 40 percent rate 
of 1988 
economists said if the federal reserve boosts interest rates too 
high in its effort to cool off the economy and dampen inflation it 
could accidentally cut short the record 6yearold economic 
expansion 
this does increase considerably the chances for a recession 
said lawrence h meyer the president of a st louisbased economic 
consulting firm that bears his name 
its kind of the worst nightmare for the fed inflation is 
picking up just as the economy is beginning to slow down meyer 
said 
the financial market turmoil would have been worse if investors 
concluded that wholesale inflation was going to hit double digits 
this year but most economists agreed the twomonth trend is at 
least partly a fluke 
it certainly is a very very discouraging report but its going 
to take more information to determine where inflation is going 
said thomas holloway a senior economist at the mortgage bankers 
association of america in washington 
bond prices tumbled immediately after the release of the report 
stock prices followed suit an hour later when the new york stock 
exchange opened prices plunged so steeply in the opening minutes on 
one stockindex futures contract in chicago that a price limit was 
triggered for the first time since it was instituted last year 
bargain hunters bought stocks at the lower levels and stabilized 
the market in later trading trading activity was heightened by 
strategies connected with the triple witching hour expiration of 
stock index futures and options 
the inflation report also knocked stocks lower abroad in london 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index suffered its 
worst loss of the year falling 19 percent 
the first and by far the greatest fear is that international 
interest rates have yet to go higher said paul walton an 
equities analyst at warburg securities in london 
us analysts agreed if the next move is up in interest rates 
this market is going to sail south said william howard manager 
of overthecounter trading at sutro amp co inc in san francisco 
most worrisome to economists was that inflation seemed to be 
rising at a time the economy was slowing as reflected in reports 
this week on declines in factory use and housing starts and flat 
industrial production 
the recent rise in crude oil prices to 20 a barrel if it 
sticks will keep pressuring inflation higher in coming months said 
richard stuckey economist at du pont co in wilmington del 
the nature of inflation also seems to be shifting from the kind 
that comes from vigorous economic growth to the kind stemming from 
longerterm pressures on labor and materials costs said bethel 
minter economist at suntrust banks inc in atlanta 
this new inflation does not result directly from the economys 
strength and is thus harder for the fed to stop by raising interest 
rates minter said 
despite the latest inflation report the mortgage bankers 
association continues to predict the national average rate on 
fixedrate mortgages will not rise above 115 percent this year 
from the current level of just under 11 percent 
still all interest rates rise in tandem with a decline in the 
credit markets and tightening by the federal reserve economists 
said that includes adjustablerate mortgages which are tied to 
shortterm interest rates many credit card rates and homeequity 
loans which often are tied to the prime rate set by banks and car 
loans which often are tied to mediumterm debt issued by financing 
companies

the former head of nowdefunct people express 
airlines says the labor crisis gripping eastern airlines has raised 
the prospect that the government will try to reregulate the airline 
industry that it opened up a decade ago a task he says the 
government is illequipped to handle 
donald c burr the founder of people express and former employee 
of texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo says the government 
already is failing to oversee the industry adequately and would be 
unable to do so if it again reimposed stiff regulations on fares 
eastern has been virtually grounded by a twoweekold strike by 
its machinists union which has been supported by most of the 
airlines pilots and flight attendants the near shutdown of its 
operations forced the carrier to file for bankruptcy protection from 
creditors on march 9 
the possible disappearance of eastern from the skies and the 
temptation for its rivals to hike fares has given rise to public 
debate about competition within the industry and burr said in an 
interview thursday has raised the prospect of reregulation 
the federal government deregulated fare competition in the 
airline industry in 1978 giving rise to cutrate carriers such as 
people express 
burr 47 a graduate of harvard business school has placed 
himself in the public eye again after about two years of shunning 
the press and the spotlight that fueled speculation he could be 
putting himself forward as a possible participant in an eastern 
buyout 
burr said he would have to consider it if the eastern unions 
approached him about leading a buyout but he stressed that is not 
his primary intention 
ive been president of three companies ive already done 
that he said im after the same things ive been after my 
whole lifetime i would love to see the airline industry evolve 
toward highcommitment service organizations 
burr said he has talked about broad concepts with lorenzo from 
time to time before the eastern strike that started march 4 
despite easterns travails deregulation on the whole has been 
a stunning success that has opened air travel to more americans 
burr said it freed the industry to be marketplaceoriented 
burr quit his job as president of texas international texas 
airs predecessor in january 1980 to start up nofrills people 
express 
spurred by the removal of federal restrictions on fares the 
discount carrier quickly grew by burrs reckoning into the worlds 
fifthlargest airline with revenue of about 2 billion at its peak 
in the summer of 1985 
people express eventually was defeated by competitors who were 
able to match and undercut its fares in addition to offering 
fullfare services and to offer their own powerful computer 
reservations systems said burr who sold people express to texas 
air for 300 million in september 1986 
his faith in deregulation undaunted by the experience burr 
points to lorenzo as the current lowcost warhound 
if lorenzos eastern and sister carrier continental airlines 
fail we would lose the last major lowcost product burr warned 
that event also could open the field to a new lowcost carrier 
which some observers say burr might be inclined to start up 
he currently is writing a book on people express and lectures at 
several universities including harvard stanford massachusetts 
institute of technology and the university of north carolina he 
says he also has looked at possible new airline deals from time to 
time

stock index futures plunged friday under the weight of a 
fastfalling stock market prompting the first use of a trading 
limit designed to halt panic selloffs that had been put in place 
after the october 1987 crash 
on other markets crude oil futures posted another strong gain 
but the rest of the complex slipped precious metal futures advanced 
slightly and livestock and pork futures were mixed 
the standard amp poors 500 stock index futures opened limitdown 
and prompted the first use of a socalled circuitbreaker that was 
designed to halt panic selloffs 
there was panictype selling at the opening and after the 
limit fear to enter the market for nearly five hours said roy 
postel analyst with ide reports inc but looking back id call 
it an orderly selloff in all respects 
a largerthanexpected 1 percent increase in wholesale prices 
slammed the stock market at the opening bell and the sampp 500 
futures contract for june on the chicago mercantile exchange opened 
simultaneously down 5 points 
merc officials responded by imposing a 10minute trading limit on 
the contract following the terms of an agreement with the new york 
stock exchange designed to prevent freefalling prices 
the agreement which calls for limits of trading of varying time 
depending on how steeply prices fall is triggered at the merc 
before the nyse because of the quicker access to the futures 
contracts than stock issues 
after the circuitbreaker was lifted the sampp 500 contract 
tumbled another three points and moving in lockstep with the stock 
market it tracks stablized until about 1 pm est 
thats when word came out that ibm was going to have trouble 
delivering a product line on time and hurt its earning prospects 
and the bargain hunters who were buying left about the same time 
said bob ray of dean witter reynolds in chicago we hit the lows 
about a halfhour later and pared back a little from then on out 
the sampp 500 futures index settled 84 points to 85 points lower 
with june contract at 29545 
crude oil meanwhile continued its steady climb at the new york 
mercantile exchange unlike earlier in the week however heating 
oil and unleaded gasoline failed to follow the move higher because 
of adequate supplies and slackening demand for the products 
crude oil was 1 cent lower to 49 cents higher with the april 
contract crashing what some traders called an important 
psychological barrier at 20 and settling at 2033 a barrel 
heating oil was 03 cent to 26 cent lower with april at 5357 
cents a barrel and unleaded gasoline was 27 cent lower to 26 cent 
higher with april at 5562 cents a gallon 
gold silver and platinum futures all posted moderate gains but 
a number of traders were puzzled why the precious metals didnt 
advance further in the wake of the inflationary implications of the 
rise in wholesale prices 
i think the problem is the market is still getting mixed 
signals on inflation said peter cardillo commodity trading 
adviser for josephthal amp co new york at the beginning of the 
week most of the economic indicators pointed to slowing growth i 
think the 64000 question in the precious metals is will we see 
slower growth in the next two or three months 
gold settled 370 to 570 higher on the comex with the march 
contract at 39360 a troy ounce silver was 65 cents to 102 cents 
higher with march at 6124 a troy ounce platinum traded on the 
new york merc was 460 higher across the board with april at 
55010 a troy ounce 
the livestock market on the chicago merc opened under pressure 
because of a government cattleonfeedlot report released after the 
markets closed thursday showed a record number of placements for 
feburary 
but traders betting that slack demand will pick up after easter 
helped rally the april contract and that forced those who were 
holding contracts for the deferred months back into the market 
exactly the opposite situation prevailed in the hog contracts 
with several influential analysts predicting a usda report on hogs 
due march 31 will show some supply tightness later this year or 
early 1990 traders flocked to the later month contracts 
live cattle settled 23 cent lower to 70 cent higher with april 
at 7805 cents a pound feeder cattle were 93 cent lower to 15

lower to 15 cent higher with april at 4272 cents a pound and 
frozen pork bellies were 25 cent lower to 70 cent higher with

soybean futures prices closed mostly higher but wheat and corn 
mixed friday on the chicago board of trade

a federal judge gave apple computer inc an 
important preliminary victory friday in its legal battle with fellow 
computer giants microsoft corp and hewlettpackard co clearing 
the way for a copyright suit over visual displays for apples 
macintosh system 
us district judge william schwarzer issued a tentative ruling 
which he affirmed by comments at an hourlong hearing that a 1985 
applemicrosoft licensing agreement did not entitle microsoft to 
produce a display program called windows 203 the target of the 
copyright suit 
windows 203 the product as it is now being offered is not 
covered by the license schwarzer said 
the ruling means microsoft cannot claim permission from apple to 
market a program with visual displays similar to those in the 
macintosh apples biggestselling model but the case is far from 
over 
apple still must prove that windows 203 is substantially 
similar to the macintosh menu screen graphics distinctive for 
their use of pictoral symbols such as file drawers and wastebaskets 
rather than written commands to enter and use the computer system 
microsoft and hewlettpackard which uses the windows display for 
a computer program called new wave contend that apples own program 
was not original but was derived from other companies works 
they also argue that the graphics apple is trying to protect are 
no more than basic ideas like the use of office equipment as 
symbols ideas cannot be copyrighted only expressions of ideas 
courts have also refused copyright protection when an idea can be 
expressed in only one way 
microsoft said it would have no comment until it had reviewed 
schwarzers written ruling apple called it an important ruling 
hewlettpackard was not directly a party to the decision 
the suit could have a large impact microsofts program is 
compatible with international business machines corp equipment a 
verdict that gave broad protections to apples userfriendly 
displays would keep similar systems off ibm computers and could slow 
the development of software for systems like windows and new wave 
fridays ruling knocked out microsofts first line of defense 
against the suit that the 1985 licensing agreement with apple 
allowing an early version of the display program called windos 10 
was broad enough to cover a later version such as windows 203 
schwarzer said his ruling was narrow and did not necessarily mean 
that any particular visual symbols called icons could not be 
duplicated but the judge indicated disagreement with a suggestion 
by microsoft lawyer david mcdonald that the copyright claim could be 
decided by comparing each individual symbol in the two programs 
i dont think you can go itembyitem schwarzer said you 
have to look at the visual display as a whole 
the judge did not decide however whether microsoft had the 
right to duplicate icons that were contained in the earlier windows 
10 as well as windows 203 
schwarzer also expressed no view on apples argument that a 
program with the same look and feel as the macintosh display 
would violate the copyright that issue may be resolved when the 
case goes to trial
