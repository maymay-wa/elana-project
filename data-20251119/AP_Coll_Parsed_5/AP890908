outside on yet another day when new york felt 
like seattle people ran with newspapers over their heads to fend 
off a summer shower but inside a manhattan museum others pondered 
a rain of umbrellas 
from the ceiling of the american craft museum about 30 artful 
umbrellas are suspended in the air a seeming snapshot of a 
freefall down a threestoryhigh stairwell all thats missing is 
mary poppins 
the exhibit has lured in many during a season that demanded a 
good umbrella more than 28 inches of rain fell from april to july 
double the norm 
i do think the timings been wonderful museum director janet 
kardon said but when its raining outside its quite cheery in 
here 
a rain of talent umbrella art was created by painters 
sculptors architects and ceramicists who were given white umbrellas 
and instructions to do as they pleased 
most painted whimsical designs but one artist fused an umbrella 
with a kindergarten chair another hung strands of string inside the 
frame to create an image of an umbrella that lets in rain and a 
third painted long knives and daggers for a creation called acid 
rain 
a fourth artist robbed her umbrella of its function its all 
frame no cloth and yet another from texas made an insideout 
umbrella that looked as if it had been through a tornado 
many visitors said they now will look differently at umbrellas 
and rain 
most people think depressing things about the rain but this is 
bright and wonderful almost childlike said sasha bergmann of 
santa barbara calif this makes me want to go home and paint my 
umbrella and then never use it 
adriana de freitas of rio de janeiro said the show was like a 
crazy rainy day they had a lot of fun with it 
the show at the museum until sept 24 will be at a university 
of chicago gallery early next year and then may tour the country 
said richard siegesmund director of the fabric workshop in 
philadelphia which organized it 
the fabric workshop asked patterson sims curator of modern art 
and associate director for art and exhibitions at the seattle art 
museum to create an exhibition living in seattle you are real 
conscious of the necessity of having an umbrella and you want 
umbrellas to be as cheerful as possible said sims who doesnt 
own one 
its a form of denial he said i just get a little wet 
umbrellas are an object that we often review in mundane 
fashion siegesmund said but if you think about it umbrellas 
can become an object of startling beauty and demand consideration as 
an art object 
but most of the exhibits can still do the job for which they were 
designed 
edward henderson from stony point ny took apart a small 
schoolroom chair to create a sort of umbrellachair one of the few 
exhibits not hanging from the ceiling it could serve as a childs 
allweather reading spot 
i wanted to make something that would be much more than just an 
umbrella said henderson a painter and sculptor i wanted to 
embellish it its very common to put paint on it so you just 
stretch it you cant take it that seriously but then i take my art 
very seriously 
claire zeisler a fiber artist from chicago didnt take her 
assignment seriously at all she said helpers at her studio 
thought of putting long strands of string inside her umbrella it 
doesnt mean anything you know except that its fun maybe theyre 
trying to upgrade umbrellas

government helicopters and 
warplanes have stepped up attacks on suspected guerrilla positions 
near towns in the northern war zone but local civilians say the 
rockets bombs and bullets have hit homes in the area and left 
civilians terrified 
a nun said rockets hit near a school where a crowd of children 
were at play 
this town of 1000 people in the heart of el salvadors 
rebeldominated mountains was the only municipality to suffer direct 
hits in raids aug 1920 but inhabitants of surrounding hamlets are 
angered and worried by the governments use of powerful weapons in 
civilian areas 
only by the providence of god was none of the children 
killed sister teresa racia said as she described a raid aug 19 
that left rocket craters and strafing damage across town 
she said more than 200 children were playing around the adobe 
schoolhouse when a helicopter gunship arrived and one rocket crashed 
into a hillside 60 yards away and a second just 15 yards away 
minutes after the ussupplied uh1m gunship blasted the 
surrounding cornfields and hills a c47 warplane strafed las flores 
with 50caliber machine guns firing 
the paving stones looked like they were exploding said elias 
menjivar whose house was one of a dozen damaged they were even 
smoking 
rev miguel vasquez a roman catholic priest in arcatao said an 
a37 dropped four bombs aug 20 at the nearby hamlet of santa rita 
damaging three houses 
peasant farmers andres cordova and felipe orellana said their 
hamlet los pozos was strafed the same day 
there was combat near the houses and they called in the 
airplanes cordova said six houses were damaged everyone was 
panistricken 
orellana said it seems the planes are coming more often and 
closer to the houses and it makes you afraid 
the air force says that air strikes are made only against 
military targets but in densely populated el salvador few areas are 
well away from civilians 
chalatenango province is one of the most foughtover areas in the 
nearly decadeold war between the 56000member ussupplied and 
trained armed forces and about 7000 marxistled guerrillas 
air power is the armed forces single biggest tactical advantage 
over the rebels who control a wide northern swath of the 
massachusettssized country 
but the danger of catastrophic error such as a direct hit on 
the las flores schoolhouse has increased lately because new 
antiaircraft weapons acquired by the guerrillas force government 
pilots to attack from higher altitudes and therefore with less 
accuracy 
since late last year the rebels have received several hundred 
sovietdesigned dragunov sniper rifles when used against aircraft 
the dragunovs effective range of 3000 feet obliges government 
pilots to stay higher in the sky 
the guerrillas also have obtained several thousand ak47 rifles 
and they have been trained to fire them at helicopters and aircraft 
flying below 2000 feet 
while they rarely bring down aircraft the groundfire wounds 
crewmen and damages the aircraft pilots report taking more hits and 
abandoning more missions than at any time in the war

white voters sent mixed 
messages to the governing national party but one point was clear 
the government will get nowhere trying to please both reformists and 
racists 
following his partys record election losses to both right and 
left acting president fw de klerk will be under pressure to 
signal clearly and quickly which way he will turn 
the result could well be a divorce between the government and 
hardline segregationists whose gains wednesday fell short of their 
own predictions 
de klerk implied such a split in his postelection news 
conference thursday when he lumped his party and the antiapartheid 
democratic party together as advocates of renewal and reform 
but a break with the right will not guarantee success or 
acceptance for the centerpiece of de klerks reform program a 
vague fiveyear plan to bring the voteless black majority into 
national politics without jeopardizing white sovereignty 
the crucial political debate at least within the realm of white 
politics now may take place within national party ranks is it 
serious about granting blacks political rights will it phase out 
segregation laws will jailed black nationalist nelson mandela be 
freed 
the nationalists can no longer attempt to satisfy on both 
sides those who want reform and those who want regression the 
daily news the leading newspaper in durban said in the editorial 
thursday de klerk has the clearest mandate for real change will 
he act on it 
zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi one of the countrys most 
powerful black moderates said the election marked the start of an 
entirely new and very distinctive political era in which south 
africa was moving inexorably away from apartheid toward democracy 
but buthelezi said his optimism was dependent on de klerk 
having the guts to go further than he ever thought he would have 
to go 
helen suzman who has retired after 36 years as standardbearer 
for the liberal opposition in parliament said de klerk should write 
off the far right and develop more concrete reform proposals 
hes now got to produce the goods she said otherwise both 
locally and internationally his credibility will disappear 
a similar view was expressed by alfred nzo secretarygeneral of 
the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement he said 
at a summit of nonaligned nations in yugoslavia that de klerk now 
has to prove the honesty sincerity and seriousness of his pledges 
to negotiate a solution to south africas problems 
de klerk expected to be elected next week to a fiveyear term as 
president has called for allparty talks aimed at negotiating a new 
constitution but he says the anc can participate only if it 
renounces its use of violence 
militant antiapartheid leaders in south africa reiterated their 
rejection of segregated elections and dismissed suggestions de klerk 
be given an opportunity to prove his sincerity 
de klerk has spoken to us the oppressed with tear gas 
with sjamboks whips with water cannons with all the 
repressive instruments at his governments disposal said the 
south african council of churches we consider it folly to give a 
chance to such a regime 
in the election the farright conservative party won 31 percent 
of the total vote and increased its parliamentary strength from 22 
to 39 seats 
but political analysts suggested the party had little potential 
for further growth in part because the parliamentary districts are 
due to be redrawn in a way that will reduce the power of the 
conservatives rural strongholds 
the democratic party won 33 of the 166 elected seats in 
parliaments dominant white chamber a gain of 13 and received 20 
percent of the total vote it won decisively in the three largest 
cities johannesburg cape town and durban where segregation laws 
are crumbling most rapidly 
like the conservatives the democrats prospects for further big 
gains appear limited but their successes wednesday could motivate 
de klerk as he chooses his response to what buthelezi called an 
epochmaking golden opportunity

president saddam hussein has offered 15 
million to any iraqi who can solve a 3000yearold puzzle how 
king nebuchadnezzar managed to water the fabled hanging gardens of 
babylon 
archaeologists are divided over whether the gardens said to have 
graced terraces hundreds of feet above the palmfringed euphrates 
existed they reputedly were built by nebuchadnezzar in the 6th 
century bc to enchant his homesick queen the median princess 
amytis 
the ancient greeks considered the gardens one of the seven 
wonders of the world but nebuchadnezzar made no mention of them in 
his detailed writings and no conclusive evidence they existed has 
been uncovered 
but the iraqi government which is rebuilding the city where 
nebuchadnezzar ruled ancient mesopotamia from 604 bc to 562 bc 
believes they did exist based on findings by german archaeologists 
who first excavated babylon more than 75 years ago 
hussein who is known as saddam in iraq and the arab world 
announced a 15 million prize for whomever comes up with the most 
plausible watering system and 750000 to the runnerup 
the winning system likely will be used if the iraqis decide to go 
ahead and reconstruct the hanging gardens as part of their effort to 
restore the crumbled city in what is now central iraq 
no modern technology can be employed in the watering system only 
the primitive tools available in 6th century bc mesopotamia 
hussein said the contest is for iraqis only and will be judged by 
iraqi archaeologists but iraqi embassies around the world 
reportedly have been flooded with telephone calls cables and 
letters from foreigners eager to participate 
archaeologists have been excavating babylon for decades but never 
have been able to figure out how the mesopotamians without modern 
pumping systems watered the gardens that reputedly were on terraces 
high above the euphrates river 
legend says the terraced gardens had seven levels and the most 
likely method of watering them was a type of system that hauled 
buckets up from the euphrates 
some scientists believe the gardens may have been as high as 365 
feet above the ground 
officials said scores of iraqi engineers and architects have 
ideas on how the babylonians did it but they refuse to give details 
the soviet news agency tass reported last month that leonid 
khasenevich an engineer from minsk claimed to have solved the 
mystery and wanted to take part in the baghdad contest 
a hitherto unstudied hydraulics phenomenon which i discovered 
in 1982 helped me solve this puzzle he was quoted as saying 
khasenevich a hydrologist for 30 years said that after 
experimenting with models i came to the conclusion that parts of 
the construction may be unearthed on the hill of babel near the 
biblical tower where god punished the people by making them speak in 
different tongues 
he refused to give details of his findings but noted i 
believe the technology of water inlets was primitive and did not 
require large mechanisms which would have spoiled the beauty of the 
famous gardens 
robert koldewey and walter andrae the german archaeologists who 
excavated babylon before world war i believed that underground 
chambers beneath what were once the towering walls of 
nebuchadnezzars palace were the foundations of the hanging gardens 
georges roux of france who spent years in iraq wrote in his 
book ancient iraq a respected general history of the country 
that in the cellars beneath the palace excavators found an 
unusual well with three shafts side by side probably used in 
connection with a chainpump 
it is extremely tempting to see in this construction the 
understructure of the roof gardens the famous hanging gardens of 
babylon 
other experts believe the chambers were for storage and that the 
gardens may have been west of the palace in an unexcavated area 
the persians destroyed the magnificent city in 539 bc what was 
left standing crumbled into dust

to some they look like little clowns with 
conical hats others find them so ugly they build brick walls to 
hide them 
but to wally rosenwach and scott hockhauser the wooden water 
tanks that dot new yorks skyline are matters of family pride 
the two men run businesses that have been competing with each 
other for nearly a century in making installing and fixing the 
ubiquitous brown tanks between them rosenwach tanks and its rival 
isseks tanks handle just about all the rooftop tanks in new york 
city 
and both men are tickled that in an age of computers skyscrapers 
and synthetics most new yorkers get their water via a wooden barrel 
on the roof 
when i tell people the tanks are wood they dont believe it 
said hockhauser 28 who runs isseks with his brother 32 and their 
mother 
they say come on arent those tanks made out of steel or 
plexiglas 
some water tanks are indeed made of steel like those atop the 
empire state building but wood insulates better from heat and cold 
is easily repaired and doesnt have to be painted every five years 
like steel even us steels manhattan headquarters gets water from 
wooden tanks said rosenwach chairman of his familys company 
how long do the tanks last too long rosenwach said we 
just replaced a tank that my father had put up in 1926 
while wooden water tanks are used on some buildings in other 
large cities in new york with its great density of tall apartment 
buildings they are fixtures on the landscape 
you cant have a skyline without the tanks rosenwach said 
the tanks are required by law on most tall buildings so that 
water will be available in case of fire 
a few buildings like the world trade center use electrical 
pumps alone to bring water up from the citys underground pipes but 
for water to be available on top floors any time a faucet turns on 
the pumps must run constantly 
rooftop tanks are more efficient requiring the use of pumps only 
when the water in the barrel drops below a certain level and more 
must be brought up from the ground gravity then allows the water to 
flow to each floor as needed the typical tank holds 10000 gallons 
stands 12 feet high and is mounted on a steel structure 20 feet 
high the height makes tank work on a windy day dangerous if not 
impossible 
the tanks are made from redwood or cedar staves cut to size in 
the factory assembled on the roof and encircled by galvanized iron 
hoops the coneshaped tops made from plywood keep rain snow and 
contaminants out and trap air inside which adds insulation in 
wintertime 
with the hoops pressing in and the water pressing out it makes 
it watertight hockhauser said 
isseks has its factory in philadelphia while rosenwachs is in 
the new york city borough of brooklyn 
one of the things that comes up very often is are we related 
to our competitor hockhauser said my greataunt lily who is 
my oldest living relative says yes there is a relationship way 
back when and no one disagrees with this at least no one here 
when my greatgrandfather started the business here in 1890 
rosenwach came over and worked for them because he was a distant 
cousin and then there was a fallingout of some sort 
poppycock says rosenwach 
this whole bit about when who started what business is silly 
he said they say their grandfather has been in business since 
1890 but i think their grandfather didnt come over until 1896 
that was the year rosenwachs grandfather bought the tank company 
hed been working for and gave it his own name 
while they differ on their companies origins rosenwach and 
hockhauser agree that their products are aesthetically pleasing 
nowadays they hide the tanks in brick enclosures hockhauser 
lamented the sort of people who care most about the way things 
look the artists who live in soho they love em but the yuppie 
who lives on the upper east side who just bought his apartment he 
doesnt want to see a water tank when he looks outside 
said rosenwach i feel towards them like nobody else they 
are friendly little people to me

while irish citizens find it difficult to immigrate 
to the united states hundreds of americans in recent years have 
taken advantage of irish laws that make it relatively easy to claim 
irish citizenship 
americans who become irish citizens can easily establish 
residency in ireland obtain an irish passport or gain access to the 
11 other countries of the european community 
but nostalgia seems to be the main reason many americans seek a 
link to the emerald isle officials say 
i think the majority of people do this out of a sense really 
of their irish heritage said declan kelleher spokesman for the 
irish embassy in washington 
kelleher said interest in dual citizenship was negligible until 
about seven years ago since 1985 about 4100 americans have 
claimed their irish citizenship about 1300 from the boston area 
this year 600 nationwide have applied 400 to the consulate in new 
york 
foreigners have been able to claim irish citizenship since 1956 
one of those to apply this year was bob mccarthy of lewiston 
idaho his grandparents came from ireland and soon after landing in 
boston in the 1890s they moved to work at a montana smelter 
mccarthy a lawyer said he hopes to live in ireland some day to 
gain a new perspective on americas history 
i think that its helpful in terms to understand where you 
come from and in terms of knowing yourself he said by telephone 
and i think the ethnicity of people in the united states is an 
important element that shouldnt be forgotten 
obtaining dual citizenship does not jepoardize ones us 
citizenship as long as the second country does not require any 
superseding oath of allegiance said phil covington of the state 
departments consular bureau 
ireland israel the united kingdom italy and canada are the 
five countries from which most americans obtain dual citizenship 
embassies for the other countries could not provide figures 
they are generally places that dont make it difficult to 
obtain or require a strong oath of allegiance which would make it 
difficult for an american to obtain citizenship he said 
although rules vary from country to country an american 
generally must have a blood tie or birthright to claim citizenship 
from a foreign country 
countries from which it is difficult to obtain dual citizenship 
are mexico spain austria and germany they require new citizens 
to renounce old allegiances 
in 1986 the irish citizenship law was tightened the rules are 
as follows 
anyone whose parents were born in ireland is automatically an 
irish citizen and simply needs to register with the embassy or a 
consulate 
grandchildren of people born in ireland must prove their link 
by presenting their birth certificates and those of their ancestors 
or other documentation a 153 registration fee is also required 
beyond that a family can continue to evoke the right but there 
is one provision kelleher said and that is that at the time of 
the birth of whoever chooses to invoke that right their parents 
were already irish citizens

the navy said thursday that gunners mate 
clayton hartwig most likely caused the explosion that killed 47 
sailors aboard the uss iowa by shoving a detonator between gunpowder 
bags in one of the battleships huge guns 
the formal report on the explosion the worst naval disaster 
since the vietnam war said the exact cause cannot be pinpointed 
since the sailors close enough to see what was going on including 
hartwig were all killed in the fiery blast 
however rear adm richard milligan presenting the official 
conclusions at a pentagon briefing said much circumstantial 
information pointed to hartwig whose job put him closest to the 
gun 
he cited an fbi psychological profile of hartwig with the 
opinion that he took his own life and hoped it looked like an 
accident 
members of hartwigs family strongly disputed the navy 
conclusion family lawyer kreig j brusnahan said dead men cant 
defend themselves the navy knows that 
milligan said hartwig was a loner and a man with low 
selfesteem who had a series of male principal friends 
throughout his life but the admiral and other military briefers 
said there is no substantive proof that hartwig was homosexual 
and there is no mention of that in the report 
adm leon edney the vice chief of naval operations said of 
hartwig he was a cleancut sailor he didnt smoke he didnt 
drink he didnt carouse on leave he wasnt a troublemaker 
we dont know the motivation edney said 
the navy admirals said investigators extensively questioned 
hartwigs acquaintances and family after the explosion 
after more than four months of investigation the navy concluded 
the explosion was most probably caused by an intentional act the 
weight of evidence indicates that some type of detonation device was 
deliberately placed between the powder bags being rammed into the 
breech of the center gun 
as evidence the investigators cited foreign material found 
on the projectile that remained in the gun barrel after the 
explosion milligan said the navys tests showed that a detonation 
device apparently was placed between the first and second bags of 
gunpowder and that it could have been composed of such simple 
elements as bleach brake fluid and steel wool 
the most likely person with the access knowledge and possible 
motivation to accomplish this act has been identified as gunners 
mate 2nd class clayton m hartwig usn the center gun captain in 
turret ii at the time of the explosion the navy said 
milligan said no accidental cause could be found and a criminal 
investigation was launched after hartwigs sister kathy kubicina 
disclosed the existence of a 100000 accidental death and 
dismemberment policy on her brothers life naming gunners mate 3rd 
class kendall truitt as a beneficiary 
the navys conclusions were immediately disputed by hartwigs 
relatives who have asked for a separate congressional investigation 
i never believed it right from the start said his sister 
who attended a briefing by navy officials at her fathers home in 
cleveland 
earl hartwig the dead sailors father said i think there was 
a powder explosion accidental that caused the explosion 
truitt one of the crew who survived the blast in the lowest 
level of the massive gun turret has demanded an apology from the 
navy contending it leaked information about the investigation to 
the news media in order to find a scapegoat edney rejected the idea 
of an apology 
at a news conference in miami truitts attorney ellis rubin 
dismissed the navys version of the explosion saying our 
information was that it was the navys negligence untrained and 
unqualified crew members and 50yearold technology dangerous from 
day one 
the navy report found numerous lapses in the recordkeeping of 
the gun crews training the requirements for handling the world war 
iivintage ships weapons and safety procedures 
but the navy said these shortcomings did not cause the 
explosion 
the report said investigators found that hartwig had experimented 
with explosive devices and detonators had frequently talked about 
dying and had a fascination with ship disasters 
the investigators said hartwig had recently had a fallingout 
with an extremely close friend and that on the night before the 
explosion his attempts at a close relationship with another 
sailor had been rejected 
the navy in its 1100page report said the investigation had 
ruled out technical failure or an accidental cause for the april 19 
blast 
investigators said hartwig as the gun captain was responsible 
for overseeing the loading of the 16inch gun during the 
battleships gunnery exercises some 330 miles from puerto rico 
the report said he could have hidden a small homemade detonating 
device in a pack that is normally placed between the bags of powder 
and helps clean the barrel out after the explosion 
hartwig was positioned at the breech of the gun meaning that he 
would have been the first killed when the massive force of the 
explosion blew backwards through the open barrel and into the 
sevenstory gun turret 
the navy officials noted that the reports conclusions about 
hartwig were based on circumstantial evidence but they contended 
that this evidence combined with an exhaustive fbi and naval 
investigative service studies of the blast supported their theories 
the 4 million navy investigation involved interviews with more 
than 318 people and 20000 tests some trying to simulate the 
explosion 
only 11 survivors none nearby lived through the fireball which 
tore through the no 2 or middle gun turret the 16inch weapons 
aboard the battleship can fire 2700 pound shells a distance of 23 
miles 
each projectile is propelled by explosives loaded into the gun 
barrel contained in silk bags the gun usually requires up to six 
bags each containing about 100 pounds of black gunpowder 
the investigators said the foreign material that was found in the 
gun should not have been there under normal firing conditions 
they also said their tests showed that an exact replica of the 
explosion could only have occurred if a detonating device had been 
placed between the first and second bags of gunpowder such a device 
could have gone off when the rammer supposedly directed by hartwig 
pushed the silk bags of powder together in the guns barrel 
the ships commander capt fred p moosally the ships 
executive officer weapons officer and gunnery officer are all 
expected to be called to explain onboard proceedural lapses in a

michael bohdan says the entry to his companys 
contest from japan is somewhat reassuring 
yeah theyve got cockroaches too he said 
bohdan whose wife refuses to let him bring his work home is one 
of four regional coordinators of a contest to find the largest 
cockroach in the world the american cyanamid co is paying 1000 
to whoever brings in the largest cockroach 
the largest cockroach found in the contest in japan arrived 
earlier this week at bohdans office 
the customs guys were joking saying they didnt have to worry 
about it being any kind of endangered species said bohdan who 
has appeared on the tonight show and hour magazine to show 
off some of the many varieties of cockroach he keeps at his office 
the japanese entry however may not be a contender like some of 
the countrys imports its compact 
well it may be small but you have to talk about quality its 
a quality roach said ira caplan of american cyanamid of japan in 
a telephone interview from tokyo 
the entry which won about 800 for kazuko miyagi of okinawa is 
about 1 inches long caplan said miyagis daughter actually caught 
the roach in her bathroom but just got engaged and was too shy 
about entering it herself 
the japanese consider it a great embarrassment to have 
cockroaches caplan said 
we had a group of housewives in a focusgroup study and asked 
them how they felt about roaches he explained one woman said 
im so embarrassed by them when the exterminator van pulls up in 
front of my house i hope my neighbors think im having an affair 
some japanese specimens arrived in matchboxsized satinlined 
caskets 
bohdan said all entries in the contest must be of the american 
cockroach species and the largest found to date has been about 2 
inches 
were hoping to find a larger one now that the search has gone 
international he said 
bohdan said he anticipates receiving entries soon from korea 
spain australia and egypt 
about 250 roaches have been entered so far most of them from 
florida other regional judging points are in miami new york and 
hollywood 
the eventual winner will receive not only the 1000 prize but 
something that probably will prevent entering again next year a 
years supply of the companys combat roach bait trays 
each regional champion also gets a trip for two to new york for 
the nov 1 finals 
but the bad news is the flight reservations are for the finder 
and the roach not two people

the mcmartin preschool molestation trial after a juror was 
hospitalized with a rare blood ailment the judge said thursday 
superior court judge william pounders said he was shaken 
after conferring with the juror and his doctor 
if he was asked to continue to serve in the trial the next 
six weeks is a critical period and might cause his death pounders 
said 
although the unspecified blood disease is not contagious 
pounders said that the juror has a secondary illness of shingles a 
contagious variant of the chicken pox virus 
pounders said it wont be known until next week whether other 
jurors have been infected even though we may have the jurors 
coming down with chicken pox thats at least manageable if not 
desirable the judge said 
he said he would formally excuse the ailing juror on monday when 
the other panelists return to court 
the jurors dismissal will pare the remaining panel to just 12 
with no alternates available the loss of one more juror could force 
a mistrial in the case of raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy 
mcmartin buckey 62 
they are charged with 64 counts of molestation in what has become 
the nations longest and possibly costliest criminal trial expenses

prince charles has charged to the front again in 
his crusade for more aesthetic buildings 
he hopes a new town he is having built on his estates will 
demonstrate his concern for a better environment for the people who 
live in it 
i am not mad enough to try to create my ideal town there is 
no such thing i am trying to show that man cannot live by 
technology alone the prince said thursday at a party for his new 
book on architecture a vision of britain 
the prince has promoted a longrunning debate on modern 
buildings likening some to frankenstein monsters unloved by 
anyone except the people who designed them 
when the town of dorchester in southwestern england asked to buy 
land adjoining the princes duchy of cornwall estate to house 8000 
to 10000 people charles decided not to sell but to oversee the 
building himself 
we should see something going up there within a year said 
leon krier the princes main architectural adviser 
krier designed the new town named poundbury and shares the 
princes convictions that buildings should be on a human scale and 
in harmony with their surroundings 
the town will have homes up to four stories and some apartment 
blocks side by side with clean and silent hightechnology 
industries and all the services needed by its residents within 10 
minutes walk he said 
about 600 people attended the book party held at the victoria 
and albert museum which is staging an exhibition based on the book 
a vision of britain is about the heir to the thrones 
architectural likes and dislikes 
charles does not like office blocks towering over sir christopher 
wrens renaissance cathedral of st pauls on the london skyline 
wayside gas stations factories department stores and highrise 
apartments on windswept plains 
he likes tradition classicalstyle buildings with porticoes 
columns and decorations and housing in turnofthecentury styles 
charles said the exhibition illustrates some pretty horrifying 
mistakes in modern british architecture but was staged in the 
belief that tomorrows architecture will be better 
in poundbury he said i am determined to try to achieve 
something which i hope the people of dorchester will one day be 
proud of and in that sense this will be my own small contribution to 
the vision of britain 
he said he hoped poundbury would encourage other communities that 
have a sense of belonging and enhance the local environment 
i think its excellent that the prince has brought architecture 
into the public realm of debate said thomas fridstein london 
director of the chicagobased skidmore owings and merrill 
architectural firm but i dont feel he is fully aware of some of 
the problems 
sir andrew darbyshire one of britains most distinguished 
architects said he is making people interested in what we do and 
the more we are challenged the harder we will try to do better 
people dont care enough about buildings in this country i 
think its our education system which is very literary not 
visual he said

only 34 of americas 1175 worst 
toxic waste dumps were cleaned during the first eight years of the 
superfund program and polluters paid less than onetenth of the 
cost the rand corp said today 
superfund has been superslow at cleaning up toxic waste sites 
spending available funds and recovering its outlays from those who 
did the polluting the nonprofit think tank said in a statement 
summarizing the study by its institute for civil justice 
the report released today details the federal environmental 
protection agencys superfund accomplishments between 1980 when 
the program was created in response to toxic waste problems such as 
the abandoned landfill at love canal ny and september 1988 
the bottom line is that we passed legislation that could have 
permitted as much as 10 billion of federal money to start cleaning 
up hazardous waste sites said jan paul acton who wrote the study 
congress has appropriated only about half that amount and epa 
has only spent a quarter of that amount what weve got is a gap 
between the rhetoric and the reality 
acton found only 34 dumps were declared clean out of 1175 on a 
highpriority list of 30000 hazardous waste sites that eventually 
may need cleanup 
the report also found epa spent only 26 billion of the 45 
billion in superfund money appropriated by congress during 
19801988 and only 16 billion went directly to cleanup work with 
the rest spent on management and legal costs 
the agency recovered only 230 million of the 26 billion from 
polluters who are supposed to pay for the cleanup work the study 
said 
we think improvements are possible but substantial progress 
has been made said walter kovalick jr the epas deputy director 
of superfund 
while only 34 dumps had been declared clean by september 1988 
kovalick said cleanup is under way on more than 170 others designs 
for waste isolation or treatment facilities or other cleanup work 
are in progress at 230 dumps studies of the extent of contamination 
and cleanup options are under way for more than 640 other waste 
sites kovalick said 
the 26 billion actually spent doesnt include formal epa 
obligations to pay for work under way kovalick said by telephone 
from washington only a fraction of cleanup costs has been recovered 
from polluters because its hard to recover the money until youve 
finished the project 
after president bush appointed him epa administrator william 
reilly ordered an internal review that criticized superfund reilly 
pledged in june to toughen toxic waste cleanup enforcement 
rand blamed cleanup delays partly on epa sluggishness under 
former president reagan when superfund official rita lavelle went 
to prison for perjured testimony to congress and on high staff 
turnover confused management failure to learn from experience and 
other inefficiencies at the agency 
the study also said the cleanup effort is lagging because of 
court battles due to the superfund requirement that the epa make 
polluters perform or pay for cleanup work whenever possible if 
companies responsible for pollution cant be identified or no longer 
exist then the superfund trust fund pays 
when the superfund law comes before congress for reauthorization 
in 1991 lawmakers may want to ask whether attempting to make 
polluters pay is worth the delay acton said 
we could say lets forget about cost recovery and then clean 
sites like we build highways with taxpayers footing the bill 
acton said 
that possibility was criticized by linda greer technical 
director of the hazardous waste treatment council which represents 
companies that do cleanup work 
there is no inherent reason epa cannot go ahead and 
aggressively clean up these sites then go back to the responsible 
parties polluters and get the money she said theres no 
reason for the american taxpayer to pay for industrial dumping 
congress is unlikely to make taxpayers assume more cleanup costs 
given existing budget woes said tom gilroy spokesman for the 
chemical manufacturers association 
while other industries have tried to escape cleanup costs our 
position has been and still is that the polluters should pay 
gilroy said

the energy department says it will resume 
production of tritium an increasingly scarce gas needed to make 
nuclear warheads in fall 1990 despite urgings by environmental 
groups for a further delay 
the first of three tritiumproducing reactors at the departments 
savannah river complex near aiken sc will begin lowpower 
testing late next summer and production is expected to start 
between october and december 1990 energy secretary james d watkins 
said thursday after briefing white house officials on the plan 
watkins said precise dates for the restart schedule will not be 
set before next april after department officials review progress in 
a broad management and mechanical overhaul under way at savannah 
river since last fall 
the three active reactors at savannah river designated k l and 
p are the nations only source of tritium a manmade hydrogen 
isotope used to boost the destructive power of nuclear weapons all 
three have been out of operation since spring 1988 
environmental groups criticized the announcement saying it means 
the reactors will be back in operation before all safety questions 
are answered 
the energy department is certainly not putting safety first 
restart is still no 1 said brian costner director of the energy 
research foundation a columbia scbased group that wants the 
reactors closed down permanently 
costners organization joined the environmental groups greenpeace 
and natural resources defense council in suing the energy department 
in december to force watkins to complete an environmental impact 
statement before restarting the reactors costner said in a 
telephone interview that the suit will proceed 
watkins said he had briefed the national security council on the 
plan prepared by westinghouse savannah river co which operates the 
reactors under a government contract 
there are still uncertainties about getting the reactors 
running again on the proposed schedule watkins said so a precise 
restart timetable isnt ready he didnt identify the remaining 
problems but westinghouse has said it is undertaking a wideranging 
program of safety improvements 
jl gallagher the westinghouse manager in charge of the restart 
effort told an energy department advisory group wednesday the 
company was committed to safe operations with a balanced 
experienced mixture of people on the job 
westinghouse took over management of the site in april from ei 
du pont de nemours amp co which had run the plant since it was built 
in the early 1950s 
watkins has faced some congressional pressure to further study 
the environmental implications of restarting the savannah river 
reactors but he also is under pressure from the pentagon to resume 
production of tritium before existing stockpiles run so low that 
weapons systems must be cannibalized 
tritium decays at a rate of 55 percent annually and thus must be 
regularly replenished to keep the us nuclear arsenal in a state of 
full readiness 
watkins restart target of roughly september 1990 is a delay of 
more than two years from an august 1988 incident at one of the 
savannah river reactors that triggered a shutdown of the whole 
complex while safety and management issues were reviewed the 
shutdown initially was expected to last only a matters of weeks but 
restart was continually set back as more problems were discovered 
the k reactor that watkins said would be restarted first has been 
idle since april 1988 the reactor suffered ruptured valves in its 
backup cooling system last january when operators mishandled a 
routine pressure test the incident raised new questions about 
operating procedures at the plant and led to additional demands on 
westinghouse to improve training of reactor operators and other 
workers 
westinghouse recently confirmed that it had proposed to watkins 
that the k reactor be restarted in september 1990 but that the 
energy secretary had pressed for an earlier date 
meanwhile the energy department said thursday it will put one of 
the two plants producing uranium fuel for naval reactors on standby 
because less fuel is needed these days the plant is at the savannah 
river site where some 600 affected employees will be absorbed into 
other projects 
the only other plant producing fuel for reactors that drive 
nuclear powered warships is operated by nuclear fuel services inc 
at erwin tenn the department said the erwin plant can supply the 
navys entire needs

rep glenn english dokla says rural 
development legislation being crafted by his subcommittee will 
reflect individual local needs expressed at hearings in four states 
during the congressional recess 
english chairman of the house agriculture subcommittee on 
conservation credit and rural development has been gathering 
information for months on how best to pull rural communities out of 
economic depression and stop population losses 
the new thoughts and contributions we received sensitized us to 
regional concerns english said thursday we will try to make 
sure that these are reflected in the bill we formulate 
hearings were held last month in clarksdale miss amarillo 
texas marshalltown iowa and blackfoot idaho english will go on 
the road again monday when he hears testimony in le roy ny and 
sept 18 in montgomery wva 
english said he hoped to have a bill written next month 
the senate already has passed a rural development bill but 
englishs office said the house version may not be ready for a full 
vote until next year and may even be incorporated into the 1990 
farm bill 
the senate measure would create a revolving loan fund for 
investments in rural enterprises establish an insurance fund for 
lenders and investors provide additional funding for sewer and 
water projects and improve telecommunications links for rural 
hospitals 
rep lee hamilton dind issued a recent report to constituents 
in his largely rural district emphasizing the need for local 
leadership to make any new programs work 
i have come to the view that legislation at the federal level 
will at best have only a marginal impact on rural development 
hamilton said 
assistance from the federal government is not the key to 
economic growth the initiative for change must come from local 
communities where many tactics can be effective

disabled americans including most aids 
victims would get new legal protections in jobs and public places 
under a senatepassed emancipation proclamation for the disabled 
heading to the house 
the measure passed 768 thursday night is being billed as the 
logical extension of the landmark civil rights act of 1964 that gave 
similar rights to blacks and other minorities 
in a sense this legislation is an emancipation proclamation 
for the disabled and america will be a better fairer and stronger 
nation because of it said sen edward m kennedy dmass whose 
committee on labor and human resources cleared the bill last month 
the measure prevents employment discrimination against the 
handicapped requires equal access to public accommodations such as 
stores restaurants and transportation and requires special 
telephone service for the hearing and speechimpaired at no greater 
cost than regular service 
sponsored by sen tom harkin diowa the bill had 59 senate 
cosponsors and was widely supported by advocacy groups with a 
qualified endorsement from the white house 
in a historic gesture to the bills beneficiaries the senate 
waived its usual strict access rules and allowed signlanguage 
interpreters on the floor during the debate 
the americans with disabilities act is a landmark statement of 
basic human rights that will make the promise of equal opportunity a 
reality for 43 million americans with disabilities said harkin 
who has a deaf brother and quadriplegic nephew 
businesses with 15 or more employees would be covered but for 
the first two years of the law only businesses with 25 or more 
employees would be affected 
violations of employment discrimination rules would be sanctioned 
by injunctions back pay and attorneys fees violations of the 
public accommodations sections would be punishable by a fine of up 
to 50000 for the first violation and 100000 for the second 
but sen david pryor dark echoing criticism voiced by the 
small business lobby and the us chamber of commerce said he was 
concerned with the extremely loose definition of handicapped as 
well as the harshness of the sanctions 
were not talking about a bus or a train or a plane were 
talking about a shoe store were talking about a grocery store 
pryor said 
im concerned about what i think may put some people out of 
business said sen dale bumpers dark who nonetheless voted 
for the bill 
sen jesse helms rnc took issue with the coverage of people 
suffering from aids or infected with the aids virus asserting that 
85 percent of those people are homosexuals or drug users 
this bill responds to those 15 percent who are not said 
harkin who also quoted the health and human services secretary dr 
louis sullivan as saying there is no medical reason for 
discrimination against aids sufferers 
the bill would prohibit discrimination against people suffering 
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome or those who carry the hiv 
virus that causes aids so long as they are not in the advanced 
highly contagious stage of the disease 
rep steny hoyer dmd the house sponsor said all four 
committees with jurisdiction over the house version plan to hold 
hearings this month judiciary energy and commerce public 
utilities and transportation and education and labor the bill has 
226 house sponsors 
voting against the measure were helms william armstrong

dissident roman catholic priest the rev george 
a stallings accused of having sex with an altar boy 12 years ago 
is refusing to say whether he has ever had sexual relations with 
young males 
stallings appearing on a talk show thursday on wjla television 
declined to answer questions about whether he ever had sex with boys 
the washington post has reported that a former altar boy swore in 
a signed statement that he had sexual relations 12 years ago with 
stallings who was suspended by the church this summer for starting 
an unsanctioned africanamerican congregation 
asked thursday whether he had ever had sexual relations with 
young males stallings said my answer is to those people whom i 
served those persons who are touched by my ministry i say to them 
i am the same pastor today as i was 12 years ago when i first 
ministered to you i have not changed you know that my credentials 
are impeccable and that my morals are beyond reproach 
asked the same question again stallings said its not a 
question of answering yes or no for me to give any type of response 
would mean first and foremost that i would allow a single issue 
whether it would be my life whether i wear my hair long or 
short to become the driving concern rather than the central issue 
or focus that there is racism in the catholic church 
according to the post story published monday a former altar boy 
now 28 said that when he was 16 he repeatedly had sex with 
stallings in the rectory of st teresa of avila catholic church 
during a three to fourmonth period in 1977 the man was not 
identified in the article 
the story also said washington cardinal james a hickey had 
confronted stallings with allegations of more recent sexual 
misconduct and asked him to seek treatment in a new mexico church 
facility that treats pedophilia and other emotional disorders 
stallings however said thursday that hickey never brought forth 
any sexual charges 
stallings has labeled the article scurrilous and baseless 
and called it an attempt to divert attention from his mission of 
establishing a congregation attentive to the needs of blacks

they called it the saddest day in 
manchesters history the late summer day 20 years ago when five of 
the citys sons killed by the same land mine in vietnam as they 
prepared to head home returned in flagdraped coffins 
a few days later the rest of their national guard unit arrived 
home to a different but equally emotional welcome 
we cried at both said former guardsman roland provencher of 
manchester whose best friend was one of the five guardsmen killed 
aug 26 1969 it was a very sad and a very happy time 
new hampshires 3rd battalion 197th artillery went to vietnam 
in 1968 becoming one of the first of a handful of national guard 
units to go some of its nearly 600 soldiers will meet in portsmouth 
sept 1517 to mark the 20th anniversary of their service 
the units artillery batteries were in the thick of combat 
sometimes being dropped by helicopter into bombedout jungle 
clearings to support ground troops until just before they came home 
20 years ago this week only two had been killed 
but the deaths of the five manchester guardsmen killed by a land 
mine as they rode in the back of a truck after surviving a year in 
vietnam shocked the city and state and brought home the meaning of 
war 
yvonne lussier remembered sitting on the porch when a military 
official came up to tell her that her only child richard raymond 
had been killed 
i said was he hurt and he said its much more than that 
he is gone she recalled this week 
two thousand people jammed manchesters small airport when the 
bodies arrived on aug 30 
there were those five caskets said mrs lussier everyone 
was crying it was too sad to think about 
the sound of drums helped provoke such grief that the drummer 
stopped playing 
thenmayor john mongan called it the saddest day for manchester 
that i can remember 
killed were raymond 27 roger robichaud 24 richard genest 24 
guy blanchette 22 and gaetan beaudoin 20 several were from the 
same block on manchesters francoamerican west side 
the men were buried sept 1 and 2 in the same cemetery their 
funerals illustrated the countrys division over the war 
genests young widow brenda refused to accept the flag that 
covered her husbands coffin his nonmilitary funeral featured folk 
songs that asked haunting questions 
where have all the soldiers gone gone to graveyards every one 
when will they ever learn when will they ever learn 
the deaths brought home the futility of the war mongan said 
slowly emotionally at that mass i could understand 
military honors marked the other funerals 
in contrast to mrs genests antiwar message blanchettes 
widow lise forbade the use of her husbands name in an antiwar 
demonstration 
mrs lussier honored her lost son by becoming active in veterans 
groups 
it burns me up that everyone has forgotten them she said 
but provencher said not everyone has forgotten i think of the 
boys almost daily 
provencher recalled this week that as they left manchester on a 
bus to go to war he and genest watched crews tearing down the old 
amoskeag bridge and building a new one 
i told him some of us are not going to come back and they are 
going to name this bridge after us provencher said several 
years later the bridge was dedicated to those from manchester who 
died in vietnam 
two days after the last funerals the rest of the 197th flew into 
pease air force base in newington 
former guardsman john barvenik recalled that ropes encircled the 
spectator area as the troops came off the planes then one young 
girl spotted her father and she hollered out daddy and broke 
through the ropes barvenik said others followed and the troops 
broke ranks 
mrs lussier plans to carry snapshots her son sent from vietnam 
to the reunion so she can search for the tanned smiling young men 
in fatigues that she knows only as images from the past 
i want to meet them she said i want to match up some 
faces

california lawmakers were deep in an 
ethics discussion thursday when somebody smelled a rat 
actually everyone saw the rat when it stuck its brown nose over 
the edge of a decorative corinthian column on the wall of the 
assembly balcony thursday 
bedlam ensued and little attention was paid to the serious debate 
on details of a proposed constitutional amendment that would enact a 
series of ethics standards for legislators 
youd think nobody around hered ever seen a rat said the 
presiding officer assemblyman mike roos 
the capitol built in the 1860s and renovated a decade ago has 
suffered cricket and mouse infestations but this was a different 
matter 
wheres the assault rifle joked assemblyman trice harvey 
the legislature last spring passed a law restricting sales of many 
assaultstyle semiautomatic guns 
speaker willie brown went up to the balcony and peered at the 
column 
but the rat perhaps having its fill of ethics debate did not 
reappear

from year to year us foreign policy has a 
sameness that dulls the senses except when a crisis looms but two 
events this week demonstrate that external events can provoke major 
shifts in direction 
the reopening of conventional arms negotiations in vienna with a 
powerful drive by the bush administration to reduce troops and 
armories across europe shows how far the united states has gone in 
less than a decade from disinterest to zeal 
the 1980s began with ronald reagan on a successful drive for 
election denouncing existing arms control agreements with the 
soviet union and stirring distrust of moscow as an unreliable and 
evil negotiating partner 
in the middle east on the other hand the united states was 
busily trying to expand on the historic 1979 egyptianisraeli peace 
treaty with other settlements in the region 
by 1983 largely through us influence israel and a second arab 
neighbor lebanon were on the verge of a de facto peace treaty the 
accord promised to normalize relations between the two neighboring 
states 
but syria determined to exert influence over lebanon torpedoed 
the pact us influence went into decline reaching a low point 
this week with the evacuation of the us embassy in beirut 
with the country near anarchy ambassador john mccarthy and his 
staff departed for home it was the first time in 15 years of civil 
war between christians and moslems that the us ambassador was 
withdrawn 
in both areas arms control and the middle east the dramatic 
shifts in us foreign policy were partly due to decisions in 
washington and to the influence of others 
whether president reagan would have changed his mind about the 
soviet union and about harnessing the arms race had mikhail 
gorbachev not come to power in 1985 is a question that will keep 
historians busy for years 
the likelihood is that reagan was both swayed toward arms control 
by an instinctive humanity and also hurried along by gorbachevs 
flurry of proposals and the positive impact they were having on the 
west europeans 
president bush is following in reagans path while placing a 
special emphasis on tanks artillery and other nonnuclear weapons 
he has adopted reagans stress on strict verification procedures to 
guard against cheating and with an optimism that matches his 
predecessors set next spring as his target for a 23nation treaty 
the fact that 15 years of eastwest negotiations failed to 
produce a much more modest accord to scale down weapons in central 
europe underscores the enormity of bushs goal 
it could spill over into a broader accommodation with the soviet 
union when he has his first summit meeting with gorbachev 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze will map plans for the session when they meet 
in wyoming in two weeks 
on some other foreign policy fronts the picture hasnt changed 
much american presidents come and go and so do secretaries of 
state and national security advisers and yet the united states 
seems unable to have a lasting impact on hunger and disease in the 
third world or to thin the ranks of dictatorship and add to the list 
of democracies 
despite white house hoopla there is even a sameness about bushs 
war on drugs from colombia that foreign policy objective is likely 
to fail without a vast change in other circumstances chief among 
them the fact that the united states creates a market for cocaine by 
being the worlds largest consumer

given the drugrelated violence wracking 
colombia can the united states take adequate security precautions 
to keep extradited drug kingpins in jail 
the marshals service and the bureau of prisons say they can 
they contend the handling of convicted medellin drug cartel 
leader carlos lehder rivas proves their ability to keep 
highvisibility drug traffickers in prison 
this week the colombian government extradited eduardo martinez 
romero wanted on moneylaundering and drugtrafficking charges 
leveled in march in atlanta martinez who arrived in atlanta early 
thursday is the first person brought to the united states under a 
newly reinstituted extradition agreement 
attorney general dick thornburgh says the country must face up to 
the task of providing security in drugtrafficking cases despite 
the possibility of attacks 
we cant succumb in this country to what has already brought 
the criminal justice system to its knees in colombia thornburgh 
said when he recently announced the list of the top 12 alleged drug 
traffickers the united states wants to bring here to stand trial 
including the leaders of the notorious medellin and cali cartels 
the marshals service handled the security for the transport and 
trial of lehder who was extradited in 1987 and convicted july 20 
1988 in jacksonville fla he is in federal prison in marion ill 
serving a life sentence without parole plus 140 years 
although the colombian supreme court revoked the extradition 
agreement two years ago president virgilio barco reinstituted it 
under emergency measures after the aug 18 assassination of leading 
presidential candidate luis carlos galan an outspoken foe of the 
drug trade 
the justice department attempted to prevent any information about 
the martinez extradition from getting out even after the news was 
broadcast in colombia 
department spokesman david runkel said thursday that concern 
about security prompted the clampdown on information even after 
the dea confirmed that martinez was in the air heading toward the 
united states 
bill dempsey spokesman for the marshals service which takes 
custody of people extradited to the united states said that if any 
of the top 12 are extradited every effort would be made to 
provide all the necessary security and the resources would be 
obtained to provide the security for the extradition of the 
individuals 
dempsey said he was unsure how much it cost to provide security 
for lehder who was convicted on charges of conspiracy to import 
cocaine importation of cocaine possession with intention to 
distribute cocaine and operating a continuing criminal enterprise 
he arrived at prison aug 5 1988 
randy davis a spokesman for the marion penitentiary said 
lehders ties to the medellin cartel have not prompted any 
additional security measures by the prisons 215 corrections 
officers 
this being the most maximumsecurity penitentiary in the 
federal prison system it doesnt require us to add any additional 
security here he said it was always present that was the 
reason for his designation to this facility 
lehder doesnt present a remarkably greater threat to security 
than the other 435 or so prisoners at marion he said 
we have a lot of highprofile highpublicity inmates with a 
lot of money doing a great deal of time davis said 
lehder like all the other inmates there has a cell to himself 
and he prefers to remain alone even when he gets out of the cell for 
one hour of recreation per day davis said only about 20 inmates 
are allowed in the recreation yard at a time he said 
davis said he couldnt disclose who was on lehders visiting list 
and said he didnt know if lehder had had any visitors but he added 
that any visitors would have to be checked out to ensure that there 
are no security problems 
it wouldnt be very smart for them to come here if theyre part 
of the medellin cartel davis said 
he noted that all visits except for those with attorneys are 
noncontact meetings

the pilot and copilots of united flight 232 
hailed as heroes by president bush for guiding their plane to a 
crashlanding that most on board survived say they want to resume 
flying dc10s 
the only thing that upsets me is i have to wait to get well to 
do it said dennis fitch a pilot trainer who joined the crew from 
the passenger compartment and helped land the plane july 19 at the 
sioux city iowa airport 
pilot albert haynes fitch the two copilots flight attendants 
and air traffic controllers involved with the flight met thursday 
with bush after the cockpit crew held their first joint news 
conference 
the crash killed 112 people including one who died from injuries 
a month later 184 passengers and crew members survived after the 
dc10 cartwheeled and burst into flames during an emergency landing 
on a flight from denver to chicago 
the landing followed an explosive engine failure that 
investigators say cut hydraulic systems that control flight the 
pilots said they were left with the thrust from two engines to steer 
and level off the plane which haynes said began descending and 
turning to the right after the engine failed 
i know al haynes would disclaim all credit but certainly he 
deserves an awful lot bush said and theres the controllers 
and theres the ground crew and theres the cabin crew and then 
theres a lot of plain people that just were watching with wonder 
and great pride 
three of the 16member group still bore outward evidence of their 
injuries a man on crutches another with his hand in a large cast 
and a woman in a wheelchair with a bandaged hand 
haynes fitch and copilots william records and dudley dvorak 
said at the news conference that they plan to fly when they have 
fully recovered none expressed qualms about the dc10 and said they 
believe investigators will determine the cause of the crash 
im looking forward to flying the dc10 as soon as possible 
records said 
federal aviation administrator james b busey said last month 
that there was no evidence to warrant grounding dc10s despite the 
iowa crash and an aug 10 emergency landing by a northwest airlines 
dc10 in denver the northwest plane made a safe landing with holes 
blasted in the housing of its tailmounted engine 
all dc10s were grounded for a month in 1979 after an american 
airlines plane crashed after taking off from chicago killing 273 
people 
busey did form a task force after the iowa crash to examine 
possible changes in the design of widebody planes 
haynes said the thought of dying never entered his mind as he and 
other crew members tried to land the plane by applying power 
selectively to its two remaining engines 
my life did not flash before me he said 
he said pictures of the plane coming in for a landing are 
deceiving 
it looks like were flying a standard instrument approach and 
we werent he said the airplane was still wanting to roll 
on us it was a constant battle all the way down

house democrats are rekindling a turf battle 
over who will control a massive expansion of federal subsidies to 
help parents pay for child care 
on a voice vote thursday the house ways and means committee 
rejected a competing version written by the education and labor 
committee that would have established a new program of direct 
subsidies for child care 
instead the tax law writers on the ways and means panel want to 
provide the bulk of the new aid indirectly by increasing existing 
tax credits for lowincome families with children 
their measure also would increase direct subsidies by 200 
million a year in 1990 and 1991 and by 400 million thereafter but 
through an expansion of an existing entitlements program for the 
poor 
by using existing entitlements rather than establishing a new 
program proponents say they will be able to protect child care from 
future budget cuts 
but it also would give the 37 members of the ways and means 
committee and its chairman rep dan rostenkowski dill rather 
than the 34 members of the education and labor panel and its 
chairman rep augustus hawkins dcalif control over the bulk of 
the program 
with the legislation a key priority for members of both parties 
the chief democratic sponsors of the competing versions said they 
hoped to reach a compromise and avoid a politically damaging fight 
on the house floor 
were not that far apart we want to avoid democrats fighting 
democrats said rep thomas j downey dny chief author of the 
ways and means version 
because of its reliance primarily on tax cuts for poor families 
with children the ways and means version is more agreeable to 
republicans and the bush administration 
in june the senate approved a shotgun marriage of the two 
approaches totaling about 13 billion over the next five years 
including 11 billion in new tax credits for poor families 
the version expected to emerge from the house speaker thomas s 
foley wants a floor vote before the end of september will likely 
total 16 billion 14 billion of it in new tax credits 
thursdays vote was a virtual repeat of the stand the ways and 
means panel took in july when efforts were afoot to include the 
measure as part of a bill reconciling how to pay for all government 
programs and still reduce the federal deficit 
however the committee amended its proposal to begin raising the 
existing child care subsidies that the federal government finances 
through block entitlement grants to states by 200 million in 1990 
rather than in 1991 
those entitlements designated for a wide variety of programs to 
aid the poor are capped at 27 billion a year no one knows exactly 
how much of that is spent on child care but estimates range from 
400 million to slightly over 1 billion 
congressional budgeters already have set aside 200 million for 
new child care subsidies in the 1990 fiscal year which begins oct 
1 downey said the amendment was necessary for the ways and means 
committee to stake its claim on that money for its version of the 
bill 
otherwise he said it would go to the creation of a new act for 
better child care or abc subsidy program approved by the senate 
and advocated by the house education and labor committee

us officials say theyre concerned that 
disclosure of details on the crack cocaine president bush displayed 
in his television speech could jeopardize the undercover 
investigation that produced it 
the drugs the president held up in tuesdays antidrug address 
came from an ongoing undercover investigation in which no arrests 
have been made said cornelius dougherty a spokesman for the drug 
enforcement administration 
he said thursday that the packet of crack is back in the evidence 
vault at the deas washington field office to be used as evidence in 
court when and if a prosecution is made 
since no arrests have been made there is some concern that the 
seller might just decide to leave town given the publicity 
surrounding the sale said white house deputy press secretary alixe 
glen 
she declined to give any details on the value or the weight of 
the crack bush displayed suggesting that such details might further 
serve to alert the dealer 
dougherty said a larger delivery of crack from the same 
source was expected and that the narcotics displayed by the 
president represented only one installment 
it was a relatively small amount in terms of what we expect to 
get dougherty said we have to be careful what we say to keep 
from endangering the rest of the investigation 
holding up the plastic evidence bag containing several large 
white chunks bush told his television audience this is crack 
cocaine seized a few days ago by drug enforcement agents in a park 
just across the street from the white house 
and while saying the substance looked like candy the 
president said its murdering our children let there be no 
mistake this stuff is poison 
then he concluded his address by holding up the packet a second 
time declaring if we face this evil as a nation united this 
will be nothing but a handful of useless chemicals 
dea officials said the drug came from an undercover buy a few 
days before bushs speech in lafayette park directly across 
pennsylvania avenue from the white house 
dougherty said dea officials were present at the white house 
during bushs speech to maintain the integrity of the chain of 
custody of the drugs needed when the case goes to court 
the chain of custody remained unbroken dougherty said 
the idea for bush to use the crack as a prop came from the white 
house said spokeswoman ms glen 
we just called the dea to see if they had any on hand when 
it turned out the agency had drugs recently seized from near the 
white house it was a perfect fit ms glen said

a bitter regional dispute over who should pay 
to clean up acid rain emissions is threatening a consensus in 
congress on clean air legislation 
the longsimmering feud resurfaced thursday at a house hearing 
when the panel chairman said nine states with polluting electric 
utilities refuse to pay a disproportionate share of the cleanup 
costs 
we are talking about economic justice for the country rep 
philip r sharp chairman of the energy and commerce energy and 
power subcommittee said on behalf of the nine states that want the 
whole country to help pay the bill 
sharp said the nine states have utilities that burn highsulfur 
coal accounting for 50 percent of the acid rain but their electric 
ratepayers would be required under most clean air proposals to 
bear 67 percent of the cleanup cost 
lawmakers from other states countered that their constituents 
already are paying for power plant cleanups in their own areas and 
wont pay again to clean up polluting utilities elsewhere 
the dispute could become more important than ever in the coming 
months as lawmakers and president bush search for a formula that 
will break a decadelong deadlock over new clean air legislation 
the other 41 states have cleaned up their act said rep 
carlos j moorhead rcalif who said utility rates have gone up 
because of emissions reduction programs 
the nine states have the cheapest rates moorhead said 
referring to ohio pennsylvania indiana west virginia illinois 
kentucky missouri tennessee and georgia 
bushs clean air proposal is among those using the theory that 
the polluter pays meaning the states burning dirty coal should 
pay the cost 
united mine workers of america president richard l trumka 
pleaded for costsharing otherwise he said the most affected 
utilities would simply switch fuels and leave up to 30000 miners of 
highsulfur coal out of work because the demand for their product 
would drop 
richard e ayres chairman of the national clean air coalition of 
environmental health and labor groups said with strong 
arguments on both sides there is probably no single right answer 
he said his organization has backed at least partial costsharing by 
regions outside the nine states 
the edison electric institute recently released a report that 
said bushs acid rain proposal would cost ratepayers 5 billion to 
71 billion a year over 20 years 
most costsharing proposals would levy a fee on electric 
generation by fossilfueled plants nationwide to subsidize 
installation of pollutioncontrol equipment another possibility 
make refinery and smelting plants help pay for pollutionreduction 
measures since they also produce chemicals that become acid rain 
the bush plan calls for a reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions 
by 10 million tons by the year 2000 with a reduction of up to 5 
million tons in the first phase of the program through 1995 
the cleanup burden in the first phase would fall entirely on 107 
utilities burning highsulfur coal in 20 states but after 1995 
utilities that exceed their cleanup requirements could trade credits 
with other utilities and with other industries 
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide which has its own reduction 
schedule are the main components that form an acidic compound in 
the atmosphere and rain destruction on trees and lakes thousands of 
miles away refineries and smelting plants emit these pollutants 
also although certain coalburning utilities are the main culprits

depletion of ozone in the skies above may lead 
to sick and dying plants on the earth below according to studies by 
a us department of agriculture researcher 
autar k mattoo leader of the usdas plant molecular biology lab 
in beltsville md said ultravioletb radiation or uvb the 
solar rays that give people tans and skin cancer will destroy half 
of a plants store of a critical photosynthesis protein every half 
hour 
the plant is able to restore the protein and continue 
photosynthesis when it receives normal levels of uvb radiation 
mattoo said but at higher levels of uvb the plant would be 
stripped of the protein and photosynthesis would stop 
in a few hours time you would have hardly any of this protein 
left in the plant he said thursday in a telephone interview 
the plant would wither away and die 
mattoo said that based on his studies an increase in uvb also 
could weaken and kill some plants 
experiments in beltsville and israel showed that uvb causes a 
breakdown of a plant molecule called d1 protein that protein he 
said is an essential component in the photochemistry that enables 
plants to convert sunlight into chemical energy a process called 
photosynthesis 
the plant does try to replenish the molecules mattoo said 
but if you have higher uvb radiation the plant will not keep up 
with the molecules that are being destroyed thats when we think 
there will be an effect on photosynthesis 
such an impact on the normal growth of agricultural crops would 
inevitably lead to a smaller harvest and less food he said 
uvb is a normal component of sunlight most of the radiation is 
filtered out by ozone in the earths stratosphere and never reaches 
the ground but recent studies have shown that some types of 
pollution are causing the ozone layer to thin in places creating 
what scientists called ozone holes 
experts are concerned that a thin ozone layer would allow enough 
additional uvb to reach the earths surface to cause a rise in skin 
cancers 
uvb can damage the skin and that damage is related to 
development of cancers 
mattoo said he and a colleague marvin edelman of the weizmann 
institute of science in israel discovered the effect of uvb on 
photosynthesis by studying the level of d1 protein in the duckweed 
plant at different light exposures 
specimens of the plant which grows in water were exposed to 
various wavelengths of light he said the amount of protein found 
in the plants through chemical analysis was then related to the 
amount and type of light exposure 
at a uvb exposure equivalent to noon sunshine mattoo said the 
plant lost half of its d1 protein stores every 30 minutes 
a report on the research will appear this month in the 
proceedings of the national academy of sciences

the library of congress today opens this 
countrys first big exhibition on alexis de tocqueville who 
finished his classic democracy in america just 150 years ago 
the angloamerican relies upon personal interest to accomplish 
his ends and gives free scope to the unguided exertions and common 
sense of the citizens the russian centers all the authority of 
society in a single arm tocqueville wrote 
the principal instrument of the former is freedom of the 
latter servitude their starting point is different and their 
courses are not the same yet each of them seems to be marked out by 
the will of heaven to sway the destinies of half the globe 
the exhibit which will run until oct 29 is part of a 
frenchamerican commemoration the year 1789 also was marked by the 
proposal of both the us bill of rights and french declaration of 
the rights of man 
one of the 250 items on show is a letter from the marquis de 
lafayette it asks thomas jefferson then us envoy in paris to 
look over the marquis draft of the french declaration 
tocqueville made his first trip to this country at age 25 an 
unpaid apprentice judge who obtained leave to write a study of the 
american prison system 
english was a language not much studied then in france said 
francoise melanio cocurator of the exhibit who is preparing a new 
edition of his work 
but he worked hard on the voyage which took over a month in 
1831 and he did without an interpreter when he got here 
with his friend gustave de beaumont a state prosecutor he 
roamed for 18 months from quebec to new orleans to memphis to green 
bay wis they met the leading americans of the time including 
president andrew jackson 
his book the first part of which was published in 1835 was an 
immediate success it has long been recognized in this country for 
evaluations of the american character and political system 
man is not made for slavery that truth is perhaps even better 
proved by the master than by the slave he wrote almost 30 years 
before abraham lincolns emancipation proclamation 
he did not live to see that dying in 1859 after a political 
career that led him to become minister of foreign affairs his 
political career ended when he was briefly jailed for his opposition 
to the coup by louis napoleon who became napoleon iii 
ms melanio said his preference for decentralized government was 
not popular in france a proposal for decentralization led to 
president charles de gaulles political downfall 20 years ago local 
government has become more popular under president francois

a washington businessman recently convicted on 
drug charges says he gave cocaine to a friend of mayor marion barry 
jr for barrys use while the mayor was present according to a 
report published today 
the washington post reported that george h van wagner iii met 
with federal prosecutors to discuss the alleged january 1987 
incident 
van wagner told federal prosecutors and the post that he 
delivered oneeighth of an ounce of cocaine to the mayors friend 
while barry and his friend sat in a parked car in downtown 
washington the newspaper reported 
van wagner met with federal investigators thursday in alexandria 
va the post said 
van wagner also reportedly said he handed another eighth of an 
ounce of cocaine to either barry or the mayors friend at a private 
party at a downtown restaurant a week earlier 
barry told the post he had never heard of or met van wagner 
barry who has not been charged with any criminal wrongdoing has 
repeatedly denied he has ever used drugs 
it seems to be the popular thing to do now when people want to 
make a deal to lie on the mayor once again a convicted drug 
dealer with nothing to lose and everything to gain by lying the 
post quoted barry as saying 
van wagner 36 told the newspaper he was cooperating with 
federal prosecutors in the hope of getting a lighter sentence 
the mayors unidentified friend an advertising executive told 
the post that van wagners allegations were an absolute 
fabrication the friend told the newspaper he briefly met with van 
wagner twice but never received any drugs from him 
van wagner was convicted aug 25 of conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine and to launder the proceeds from the transactions he is 
being held in the alexandria jail and faces a minimum of 10 years in 
prison 
federal investigators are probing former barry associate charles 
lewis allegations that he smoked crack with barry at a downtown 
hotel and during trips to the virgin islands

a california nuclear weapons lab with a history 
of drug trafficking problems is the target of at least four 
congressional investigations focusing on possible security and 
ethics violations sources say 
the latest probe begun two months ago by the house energy and 
commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee focuses on the 
terms under which the lawrence livermore national laboratory 
transferred a new computer technology to a company led by former lab 
scientists who had helped develop the process 
subcommittee chairman john dingell dmich has suggested the 
deal violated conflictofinterest standards although officials at 
the laboratory and the company nchip inc of livermore calif 
deny any wrongdoing 
congressional sources involved in the investigations disclosed 
thursday that lab officials also have come under investigation for 
allegedly failing to protect important security assets at the 
site 
the sources who spoke on the condition they not be identified 
declined to reveal details of the security lapse but said energy 
undersecretary john tuck acknowledged in a closed hearing in july 
that the problem posed an unacceptable risk to national security 
immediate corrective actions were promised they said 
tuck did not return a telephone call seeking comment 
plutonium and other sensitive materials are used at lawrence 
livermore in nuclear weapons design and research activities the 
lab one of three major weapons design facilities is operated by 
the university of california under an energy department contract 
the dingell subcommittee also is investigating the national 
security implications of an allegation by roy woodruff formerly a 
leader of the labs weapons program 
woodruff contends he was blocked by superiors from writing to 
national security officials in washington in 198385 to dispute 
optimistic projections by physicist edward teller about the xray 
laser weapon being developed there 
the xray laser uses the energy of a nuclear explosion in space 
to destroy enemy rocket boosters 
separately the general accounting office the investigative arm 
of congress is looking into allegations of thefts of government 
property at the lab that investigation was launched last year after 
dingells panel was told in a public hearing that some lab employees 
had sold computers and other government assets for drug money 
the lab in 1986 launched its own investigation of drug 
trafficking by employees after a number of workers became involved 
in drugrelated incidents and arrests 
last month the lab was embarrassed when small amounts of cocaine 
and other drugs were stolen from a locked safe the narcotics were 
being used to train a drugsniffing dog that had been brought onto 
the site to fight a drug problem 
dingell stepped up pressure on energy secretary james d watkins 
to review the university of californias management of the lab by 
pressing him for information about the circumstances of a licensing 
deal the lab made earlier this year with nchip 
the departments internal auditors also are investigating the 
licensing deal 
in a july 7 letter to watkins a copy of which was made public 
wednesday dingell called the awarding of the license to nchip to 
commercially develop a technology known as laser pantography 
highly curious 
he cited the appearance of a conflict of interest in granting 
an exclusive license to a company whose top officials include at 
least three people who helped develop the technology 
laser pantography is used for connecting computer chips in a way 
that permits supercomputers to be compressed to the size of a 
cigarette pack

the lawyer representing us district judge 
walter nixon at an impeachment hearing before a senate panel says a 
key witness is unreliable 
david stewart said thursday that wiley fairchild had changed his 
story about nixons intervention in a drugsmuggling case involving 
fairchilds son but the hattiesburg miss oil man said the 
discrepancies were caused by confusion 
ive always intended to tell the truth fairchild said i 
got confused 
the testimony came as a 12member senate panel considered the 
impeachment case against nixon who is serving a fiveyear prison 
sentence for perjury he continues to draw his 89500 annual salary 
the real reason i went to judge nixon was because bud holmes 
was not treating my son right fairchild said about paul bud 
holmes who was prosecuting drew fairchild in a marijuana smuggling 
case 
fairchild said he and nixon became friends after he sold him 
lucrative oil properties 
fairchild 76 said he thought holmes was trying to blackmail him 
by pressing charges against his 50yearold son in an effort to get 
the elder fairchild to pay more legal fees 
fairchild contended it wasnt fair that his son was being 
prosecuted while his sons partner in the alleged scheme was not 
fairchild admitted to failing and confused memory about his 
previous testimony in the long case against nixon which began in 
1983 but said he would remember for as long as i live what 
nixon told him on the telephone from holmes house 
he said everything is going to be taken care of to your 
satisfaction fairchild said 
after the call fairchild said the case was passed to the 
file which meant the prosecutor would be taking no action against 
his son 
the articles of impeachment approved unanimously by the house 
allege 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he never discussed the case 
against drew fairchild with holmes 
nixon lied when he told a grand jury he had nothing to do 
officially or unofficially with the fairchild case and never 
influenced anyone in the case 
nixon undermined the integrity of the judiciary and 
disobeyed the law by making 14 false or misleading statements during 
an interview with federal investigators and in his sworn grand jury 
testimony 
stewart charged that fairchild changed his story at a 
postconviction hearing 
he testified that the phone call actually occurred after drews 
case was passed to the files stewart said 
but fairchild said he got confused real bad at that hearing 
and based his testimony on information given to him by his brother 
not on what he had remembered 
stewart argued that nixons only involvement was to talk to 
holmes about fairchilds fears that he was being blackmailed not to 
interfere in the case 
while judge nixon visited bud holmes at his farm outside of 
hattiesburg he mentioned wiley fairchilds blackmail complaint 
stewart said holmes said that wiley was crazy and offered to tell 
judge nixon about drews case but the judge told holmes that he did 
not want to hear about it 
stewart said holmes called fairchild and said he intended to 
honor a plea bargain with drew that would keep him out of jail 
rep don edwards dcalif said in his opening remarks before 
the committee that the evidence would show nixon had little regard 
for the truth and cannot be trusted to continue as a federal judge 
the senate will the vote whether to remove nixon as a judge

senate action to limit civil contemptofcourt 
jailings in the district of columbia is expected to free a physician 
jailed for two years for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her 
daughter in a custody dispute 
thursdays senate action is the penultimate step in a long march 
to freedom for dr elizabeth morgan a prominent washington plastic 
surgeon 
this bill is simple its clear and its fair said sen 
orrin hatch rutah who sponsored the legislation at this time 
there has to be a limit to this thing and a way to resolve this 
problem 
rep frank wolf rva sponsor of a similar measure approved in 
the house in june said the final step to morgans freedom could 
come next week with a conference between the house and senate to 
work out differences in the bills 
congress has review power over all city laws and court 
regulations 
morgan was jailed in august 1987 after refusing to disclose the 
whereabouts of her 7yearold daughter hilary saying she feared 
the girls father would sexually abuse her 
the battle between morgan and her exhusband dr eric foretich 
has become a national rallying point for womens group and 
antichild abuse organizations 
were delighted to have the senate take care of this matter 
said alice monroe a spokeswoman for the friends of elizabeth 
morgan we had such an abusive situation here it demanded some 
action 
foretich who denies sexually abusing his daughter has been 
supported by a host groups backing the rights of fathers in custody 
battles 
his lawyer elaine mittleman criticized the senate for refusing 
to consider the health and safety of hilary 
both bills are to be applied retroactively to morgans case but 
the house bill sets a 12month cap on civilcontempt jailings and 
requires that the person either be freed after that period or be 
subjected to criminalcontempt charges which guarantee a jury trial 
the senate measure sets a 12month cap on childcustody jailings 
but it doesnt apply to all civilcontempt jailings 
the senate version which passed without opposition includes a 
sunset measure that would wipe the legislation off the books in 18 
months 
wolf has said he didnt intend his legislation to apply only to 
morgan 
charlie lyons a spokesman for wolf said the congressman isnt 
likely to object to the sunset amendment even though it means the 
law likely will affect only morgan 
mittleman has complained that neither bill guarantees that hilary 
will be returned or that foretich will be allowed his courtapproved 
visits 
dc superior court judge herbert dixon ordered morgan jailed 
until she produced the child in may dixon rejected a request that 
she be freed and his decision was upheld last month by a dc court 
of appeals 
neither the house nor the senate bill prevents morgan from being 
jailed after future court proceedings

proper health care is mostly unavailable for the 
more than 80 percent of homeless people studied in baltimore 
suffering from mental illness a medical researcher says 
current resources are woefully inadequate to meet the needs 
of the homeless concluded a study published in todays journal of 
the american medical association 
in an accompanying commentary dr david hilfiker of the 
community of hope health services in washington said that behind the 
statistics of the study lies human pain we who are affluent can 
scarcely imagine 
the study by dr william r breakey of the johns hopkins 
university school of medicine psychiatry department and his 
colleagues found that 80 percent of the women surveyed and 91 
percent of the men suffered from mental health problems 
schizophrenia was diagnosed in 12 percent of men and 17 percent 
of women and major depression or manicdepressive disorders in 19 
percent of men and 24 percent of women less severe psychiatric 
problems such as phobias or anxiety disorders were found in 28 
percent of men and 44 percent of women 
alcohol abuse was found in 68 percent of men and 32 percent of 
women in the sample 
although more than half of those surveyed acknowledged having 
used illegal drugs just 22 percent of men and 17 percent of women 
were considered to have a problem with drug dependency 
among the most common physical problems observed were dental 
gynecological skin heart respiratory and neurological disorders 
the researchers said 
on average 83 physical problems were found in men and 92 
problems in women 
the study was based on a random sampling in 1986 and 1987 of 298 
homeless men and 230 women from missions shelters and jails in 
baltimore 
a subgroup of 203 people was selected for detailed psychiatric 
and physical examinations 
hilfiker said the statistics all testify to enormous suffering 
much of it preventable the government must spend more money to 
provide health care for the poor hilfiker said 
congress is trimming the allocation for healthcare programs for 
the homeless from the 207 million recommended by the bush 
administration in its fiscal 1990 budget to 160 million said mary 
ellen hombs acting director of the washington office of the 
national coalition for the homeless 
ms hombs sid the baltimore study reflects national trends 
we see rates of mental illness running around 30 percent 
nationwide and about the same for alcohol abuse she said 
homelessness is a serious health threat and it can actually kill 
you 
both ms hombs and authors of the study said the homeless need 
more community mental health services specialized services for 
substance abusers and special treatment programs staffed by people 
familiar with their problems 
estimates of the number of homeless people in the united states 
range from 250000 to 3 million

common cause charges that the federal election 
commission is falling down on its job of policing federal campaign 
finance laws and has actually encouraged illegal practices by its 
seemingly willful refusal to act 
the citizens lobby thursday said the problems are so pervasive 
the best albeit drastic remedy may be to abolish the fec 
altogether and to create a new election law enforcement agency 
the fec in recent years increasingly has abdicated its most 
basic responsibility to enforce the law common cause said in a 
report 
fred eiland a spokesman for the election commission said he 
wasnt certain whether the agency would issue a response common 
cause is an enduring critic of the fec and has sued the agency 
frequently 
the study charged that the failure to enforce the federal 
campaign finance laws springs both from the structural defects 
congress created in the agency and from the recalcitrance of the 
commissioners themselves congress virtually has ignored the fecs 
failure to enforce the law 
under laws passed after the watergate scandals in the early 
1970s the fec is charged with administering public funding of 
presidential campaigns policing public disclosure interpreting 
laws pertaining to presidential and congressional elections 
investigating alleged violations and undertaking enforcement actions

forcing automobile manufacturers to boost fuel 
efficiency 40 percent by the turn of the century could make cars 
less safe hurt sales and cost jobs industry representatives and 
senate opponents said 
the increase in prices may make it prohibitively expensive for 
people to purchase automobiles therefore theyll continue 
driving their old gas guzzler sen don nickles rokla said 
but the sponsor of a proposed update of the corporate average 
fuel economy law said the same dire warnings were proven false after 
the original measure was debated and enacted in the mid1970s 
your predecessors in effect forecast the collapse of 
western civilization as we know it sen richard h bryan dnev 
told industry lobbyists during a hearing of the commerce science 
and technology consumer subcommittee wednesday 
instead he said the domestic industry remained profitable while 
doubling the fuel economy of its cars why should i believe you 
based upon your previous testimony 
the cafe law requires that each manufacturers fleet of new cars 
and light trucks sold in the unites states average at least 275 
miles per gallon bryan wants to require a 20 percent improvement in 
fuel efficiency by 1995 and a 40 percent improvement by 2000

the family of the sailor cited by the navy as 
most likely causing the uss iowa explosion says he was made a 
scapegoat and has called for an independent review of the disaster 
the navy reached the conclusion that they must have a scapegoat 
in this matter to deflect attention away from their negligence 
their incompetence and their indifference in the operation of the 
uss iowa said kreig j brusnahan an attorney representing the 
family of clayton hartwig 
navy officials briefed hartwigs family thursday morning before 
the report was released 
ive never believed it right from the start hartwigs 
sister kathy kubicina said when asked if she thought her brother 
had caused the april 19 blast which killed him and 46 shipmates 
ms kubicina who has been an outspoken defender of her brother 
said families of other iowa victims had offered their support 
weve been in touch with a few of the families who lost people 
in that turret explosion and theyre on our side she said they 
said that the navy is basically trying to cover their own self we 
got word from a few families keep your heads up you have nothing 
to be ashamed of 
ms kubicina and her father earl v hartwig said they wanted a 
congressional investigation into the navys handling of the iowa 
probe 
the navy is kind of investigating itself and clearing itself 
brusnahan said 
earl hartwig a navy veteran said he was unconvinced that his 
son or any other crew member had caused the explosion 
family members disputed allegations reported in the media since 
the blast that clayton hartwig was a suicidal homosexual 
why didnt he slit his wrists why didnt he jump off the 
ship brusnahan said why would he take 46 of his closest 
friends with him 
the navy has concocted this fable in the guise of a 1001page 
report in an attempt to shift the blame away from its dismal track 
record in their operation of this battleship and lay the blame on a 
dead sailor who isnt here to defend himself brusnahan said 
dead men cant defend themselves the navy knows that 
brusnahan said dead men cant be libeled the navy knows that 
elsewhere the findings were greeted with skepticism 
retired rear adm eugene carroll said the navy was grasping at 
straws to explain the explosion this probable cause diverts 
attention from the question of the performance of the equipment and 
the personnel said carroll deputy director of the center for 
defense information in washington 
still others accepted the report 
i would say the navy investigative service has probably done 
their homework they probably know for fact or have enough 
evidence circumstantial or not to back up this theory said 
steven haight a retired navy man who worked mostly in intelligence 
during a 20year career 
i dont think its a copout agreed petty officer 3rd class 
michael glass a crewman on the amphibious cargo ship charleston at 
norfolk va 
the iowa left its norfolk homeport in june for six months in the 
mediterranean sea the crew received copies of the report wednesday 
during a port call in gaeta italy said capt paul hanley an 
atlantic fleet spokesman

antiestablishment politics gained 
ground this week when the green left alliance won six seats in 
parliament uniting after years of disagreement and capitalizing on 
a wave of environmentalist sentiment 
division had been the rule among the communist environmentalist 
and antinato parties in the coalition but when they stopped 
fighting and ran on a single platform the green left parties 
doubled their contingent of three seats in the 150seat legislature 
in wednesdays vote 
the rise of the green left in the netherlands comes after the 
greens drew a surprising 6 percent of the vote in june elections for 
the european parliament greens have won significant parliamentary 
representation in countries such as west germany and have made 
steady electoral advances in italy where they hold key posts in a 
number of municipal and regional governments 
according to analysts in the netherlands green lefts win was 
mostly at the expense of the opposition labor party seen by many 
radical leftwing voters as too middleoftheroad 
labor lost three of its 52 parliamentary seats in the election 
wednesday 
premier ruud lubbers christian democrats kept their 54 seats and 
remained the largest single legislative faction 
among establishment parties everybody has sort of moved toward 
the center said ina brouwer leader of the communist party of the 
netherlands 
in a preelection interview ms brouwer said labors softening 
of its once unconditional rejection of nuclear weapons was a major 
factor contributing to the green lefts success 
in the early 1980s labor was active in a grassroots campaign 
against the deployment of 48 us cruise missiles on dutch soil but 
in recent years the party has been far less outspoken in its 
opposition to the proposed modernization of natos shortrange 
nuclear systems rejected outright by green left 
the alliance also has capitalized on renewed interest in the 
environment spurred by the governments fall last may over an 
ambitious antipollution plan 
green lefts environmental platform includes slapping a 
prohibitively high tax on the sale of automobiles and other 
pollutioncausing industrial products 
the revenue of that socalled green tax has been estimated at 
3 billion and would be used to stimulate production methods that do 
not harm the environment 
i dont see other parties putting that into their platform yet 
because theyre serving two masters one is the environment and the 
other is economic growth said ms brouwer at her penthouse 
apartment overlooking an amsterdam canal 
the party also wants to drastically raise the incomes of the 
nations 3 million recipients of subsistencelevel social benefits 
prompting criticism by labor leader wim kok that green left was 
building castles in the air 
on thursday the conservative newspaper de telegraaf noted with 
relief that green left had not gained the 10 parliamentary seats 
predicted by some preballot projections 
green lefts ideas were so far beyond social reality that 
they couldnt be taken seriously the paper said 
apart from the communists the alliance includes the pacifist 
socialist party a staunchly antimilitary group that until recently 
opposed all forms of armed resistance 
its remaining two members are the evangelical peoples party and 
the radicals leftwing groups that split off from lubbers 
christian democrats in the 1970s and 80s 
disputes over leftist doctrine kept the four apart for decades 
although they formed alliances in some local elections 
in the previous parliament the radicals held two seats and the 
pacifist socialists had one 
under the influence of grassroots movements like the campaign 
against the missiles the four parties gradually grew closer ms 
brouwer said 
the 39yearold lawyer lost her parliamentary seat in 1986 but 
was returned in the wednesday election 
in 1982 she led the moderate faction of her party in a dispute 
with orthodox communists who saw her program of feministoriented 
reform as an insult to the moscowordained party line 
the sovietoriented old guard formed its own splinter group 
centrally organized socialism with a oneparty system is 
bankrupt that much is clear from events in eastern europe ms 
brouwer said

to murder and conspiracy and agreed to testify that she helped her 
coworker and lover kill one of five slain nursing home patients 
catherine may wood told a judge on thursday that she and 
gwendolyn graham discussed killing as many as 20 patients at alpine 
manor nursing home in walker a grand rapids suburb 
in her appearance before kent county circuit judge robert benson 
wood admitted helping graham kill marguerite chambers 60 on jan 
17 1987 two murder charges against wood were dropped in exchange 
for her guilty pleas to seconddegree murder and conspiracy 
in the plea bargain wood agreed to testify for the prosecution 
in grahams trial on five counts of firstdegree murder and a count 
of conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder jury selection in 
grahams trial is to begin monday 
attorney james piazza who is representing graham said woods 
plea makes little difference in his case he has called wood a 
pathological liar whose credibility he planned to challenge 
wood tentatively scheduled for sentencing on oct 11 faces a 
maximum of life in prison with parole possible after 10 years 
the five victims died at the nursing home between jan 18 and 
april 7 1987 of what was assumed at the time to be natural causes 
walker police began an investigation after woods exhusband said 
his former wife had confessed to him 
at a preliminary hearing in april wood testified the deaths were 
part of a pact she and graham hoped would bind them as lovers she 
said graham suffocated residents to relieve tension 
the pair chose patients whose poor physical condition would leave 
no signs of a struggle wood testified they abandoned a plan to 
spell murder with the victims initials after some of the 
slaying attempts failed she said

moderates led by yugoslavia guided 
the ninth summit of nonaligned nations to a close today with 
resolutions calling for the immediate release of all hostages and 
debt relief for the third world 
we have achieved a high degree of unity about what the future 
of our movement should be yugoslav president janez drnovsek told 
the closing session 
the moderates who have emerged as the overwhelming majority in 
the 102member movement resolutely resisted throughout the fourday 
meeting attempts by a group of radical countries to introduce cold 
war rhetoric into the proceedings 
however some of the language in the summits final declaration 
reflected compromise among moderates and hardliners who insisted 
on inclusion of references to the struggle against imperialism 
colonialism neocolonialism racism apartheid and all forms of 
domination 
an effort by yasser arafat chairman of the palestine liberation 
organization to add a condemnation of zionism to the document 
was thwarted by moderates after a heated debate the reference 
eventually was relegated to one of 30 political and economic 
resolutions 
conference documents drafts of which had earlier been prepared 
by the yugoslav hosts with the aim of revitalizing the nonaligned 
movement dealt with topics ranging from afghanistan and the middle 
east to terrorism and drug trafficking 
one document resolutely demanded that all hostages and all 
kidnapped persons be immediately released irrespective of the 
perpetrators and the place of the crime 
the document on international terrorism said the summit 
participants condemned all acts of terrorism perpetrated by 
individuals states and groups of states 
the movement also said growing links existed between terrorists 
rightist paramilitary groups and drugs smugglers 
economic issues particularly the need to alleviate the burden of 
the 132 trillion foreign debt of third world countries received 
unprecedented attention at the summit 
the meeting adopted a package of resolutions calling for the 
cancellation of the debts for the least developed countries and 
lower interest rates to help the debtor countries revive their 
economic growth 
the summit brought together about 50 heads of state and a dozen 
premiers the largest number to attend since the nonaligned 
movement was founded in 1961 
the movement once prided itself on its opposition to the 
superpowers and on its efforts to secure international peace but 
since the 1970s member nations have fought a series of bloody wars 
against each other 
however attempts by the summits yugoslav hosts to tone down 
acrimonious debates between countries engaged in bitter conflicts 
such as afghanistan and pakistan proved largely unsuccessful 
un secretary general peres de cuellar also was successful in 
reviving stalled peace talks between iran and iraq after the two 
countries exchanged accusations over who was to blame for 
obstructing the negotiations 
todays closing ceremony was marked by a sudden and impassioned 
appeal from the lebanese delegate for all foreign forces to withdraw 
from that country 
a lighter touch was provided by libyan leader moammer gadhafi 
who claiming he had come to save the movement brought along a 
small herd of camels and a fullsized bedouin tent that he pitched 
in the yard of a guesthouse put at his disposal 
a lastminute attempt by nicaragua to host the next summit in 
1992 foundered in the face of determined opposition from moderate 
nations that felt the country should be selected at a ministerial 
conference to be held in ghana in two years

colombias latest round of violence has dried up the 
flood of cocaine into the united states raising prices and 
shrinking the size of crack rocks authorities say 
but the sudden drop in trafficking could be the work of middlemen 
trying to drive up the price experts said thurday and could be 
only temporary 
the coast guards southeastern district has seized 97 percent of 
the more than 10000 pounds of cocaine intercepted by the entire 
service in 1989 according to lt cmdr jeff karonis now the 
miamibased district has seen cocaine imports suddenly grind to a 
halt 
weve seized about 10000 pounds of cocaine in the last year 
which dwarfs what we had seized previously karonis said but 
then just about two weeks ago it virtually stopped it has fallen 
off to virtually nothing 
were still carrying out the same operations as we were but 
the targets just arent there 
pat obrien outgoing director of the us customs service in 
miami said agents from the district tracked three to five air drops 
a week until the crackdown began in colombia 
we usually see somewhere in the area of 40000 to 50000 pounds 
of cocaine a year he said since the violence in colombia 
started we have had only one major seizure now we have no 
cocaine 
that recent cocaine seizure was an 800pound shipment found on a 
freighter in tampa last saturday but loaded and shipped before the 
violence began 
attempted cocaine purchases by undercover agents have been put 
off for two to three weeks obrien said and no new shipments have 
been coming through 
while the summer has traditionally been the busiest time of year 
for traffickers obrien said moneylaundering activity monitored by 
customs also has dropped off 
the change also has been noticed by the us drug enforcement 
administration but dea agents said the reasons behind the apparent 
drop in cocaine shipments remain unclear 
yes there appears to be a slowdown of drug activity out of 
south america said miami dea spokesman john fernandes a 
fluctuation in distribution and a rise in the wholesale price of 
cocaine 
but we dont know if thats because of whats happening in 
colombia fernandes said or if entrepreneurs are trying to take 
advantage of whats happening to raise the price 
the price of large cocaine shipments has risen in the past two 
weeks from 1100015000 a kilogram to 1800019000 said 
fernandes individual kilogram sales have gone up to 23000 
but the dea spokesman noted there have been slowdowns before 
in the cocaine supply it is normal for the narcotics trafficking 
business 
metrodade police cmdr steve rothlein said the lack of crack 
also is being felt on the street 
the price of a kilogram of cocaine on the street has jumped by 
about 7000 said rothlien head of the county narcotics bureau 
he said crack still sells for 10 a rock but some of the rocks 
are getting smaller 
the disruption appears to be due in part to the confiscation of 
planes used to carry cocaine from southern colombian processing 
plants to coastal staging areas obrien said

two soviet cosmonauts had to switch to manual 
steering today to travel the last few yards between their capsule 
and the mir orbiting station after the automatic linkup system 
failed radio moscow reported 
the cosmonauts managed to complete the maneuver and remanned the 
mir complex after a hiatus of four months they found the 
traditional russian welcome symbols of bread and salt left by the 
last crew radio moscow said 
after reaching mir the soyuz tm8 capsule floated around it 
instead of completing its approach correctly radio moscow said 
to cover the last few meters alexander viktorenko was forced 
to apply manual control of the craft it reported 
such things occasionally happen in orbit cosmonaut training 
chief vladimir shatalov told radio moscow 
the glitch was the latest in a series of guidance problems soviet 
spacecraft have experienced a year ago crew members who left mir 
were stuck in their space capsule for 26 hours after problems with a 
guidance system forced them to abort two attempts to reenter the 
atmosphere in 1987 it took several tries to dock an unmanned space 
laboratory with mir 
tass said today the soyuz capsule hooked up with the space 
station at 225 am moscow time 625 pm edt thursday five 
minutes later than scheduled 
the cosmonauts carried out two manuevers earlier thursday to 
bring their craft close to the space station the official news 
agency said 
everything is in order on board and the cosmonauts feel well 
tass said 
flight commander viktorenko and engineer alexander a serebrov 
blasted off from the baikonur cosmodrome in soviet central asia 
early wednesday 
along with the cosmonauts scientists sent up two modules to 
increase the amount of living space at the space station and improve 
its scientific capabilities 
viktorenko and serebrov are to remain in orbit six months radio 
moscow said today they had already begun their research 
their mission was delayed because the new modules were not ready 
and because of sharp public discussion over sovit expenditures for 
space exploration at a time when the country has a high budget 
deficit and is seeking ways to improve supplies of many consumer 
goods

an atlanta judges decision to let a 
quadriplegic turn off machines keeping him alive affirms developing 
legal doctrine that competent people should control their destinies 
say judges and ethics specialists 
but those attending a bioethics conference thursday said such 
decisions are difficult for judges as medical technology advances 
create dilemmas not covered by law 
none of these issues are easy said judge james pudlowski of 
the missouri court of appeals i think these are the most 
difficult types of decisions judges have to make but someone has to 
make them thats why were on the bench 
the missouri appeals court in november overturned a lower court 
opinion and ruled against the family of a braindead women who 
wanted doctors to stop giving her nutrients and let her die the 
case is on appeal to the us supreme court which decided to review 
it 
pudlowski distinguished between the atlanta case of larry james 
mcafee 33 who has been kept alive by machines since a 1985 
motorcycle accident and the braindead womans situation he said 
she can breathe without the use of medical technology while the 
quadriplegics life is being sustained by machine 
we cant say to someone you cant have any more food and 
water pudlowski said there is a distinction 
earlier this week fulton county ga superior court judge 
edward johnson ruled mcafees right to refuse continued 
lifesustaining medical treatment outweighs the states interest in 
preserving his life 
family members and friends testified that mcafee an avid 
sportsman paralyzed from the neck down had repeatedly told them he 
wanted to die rather than continued as he is 
mcafee himself signed a shaky x with a pencil held in his 
mouth to an affidavit stating i understand turning off the 
ventilator will result in my death 
in atlanta mcafees lawyer said his client did not expect the 
legal process to move as fast as it did and he has yet to make 
plans for returning to georgia to fulfill his wish to die 
randall h davis said thursday that mcafee who is in an 
alabaster ala nursing home was very pleased to hear about the 
details of the order he was particularly touched by the judges 
sensitivity and demeanor as i explained it to him but he was 
surprised it moved forward so quickly 
davis said it would take a week or two at the earliest before 
mcafee returns to atlanta he said mcafee wanted to arrange the 
transfer to make it convenient for his family 
julie orr one of mcafees sisters said her brother has not told 
the family how he will handle the trip or his death 
ruth putilo the director of the ethics program at massachusetts 
general hospital said at the reno conference that mcafees case 
is an interesting moment in legal history but not a radical 
departure from developing law 
he was a competent man who decided enough was enough she 
said i think were just bringing the patient more fully into the 
negotiating process as it were in the medical field 
weve moved away from an era when the doctor made all the 
decisions and sometimes didnt tell the patient everything 
questions still exist however when that person has no way to 
communicate his or her wants 
ms putilo said these kinds of lifeanddeath ethical decisions 
are difficult for judges doctors patients families involved and 
sometimes the best decision is the one that hurts everybody the 
least 
there is not right and wrong she explained there are 
several rights and wrongs a person just has to choose the most of 
the right and the least of the wrong 
ms putilo and pudlowski are among an expected 150 physicians 
lawyers ethicists and judges planning to participate in a 
bioethical conference at the national judicial college in reno the 
conference runs through sunday

more measles cases have been reported in the 
united states already this year than in any since 1980 as a decline 
in the childhood disease has come to an abrupt halt 
the national centers for disease control in its weekly report 
thursday said 10115 cases of measles had been reported through 
last week thats nearly five times the 2170 cases reported at the 
same time last year and is the highest total since 1980s 13430 
federal health officials coincidentally issued their final 
measles report for 1988 on thursday showing that the disease 
decreased by 7 percent last year to 3411 
the atlantabased cdc said more than 90 measles outbreaks have 
been reported this year mostly at colleges and universities 
however one outbreak among unvaccinated preschoolers in houston 
struck more than 1700 
in chicago where officials say school doors will remain shut to 
thousands of public school students until they are properly 
inoculated and examined for measles more than 1000 measles cases 
had been reported in the city as of aug 23 more than 80 percent of 
the cases reported have been among preschoolers 
the cdc said unvaccinated young children particularly in 
outbreakprone inner cities are one of two major impediments to 
wiping out measles in the united states the cdc said the other is 
the failure of vaccinations to protect some people which has 
allowed outbreaks in highly vaccinated school populations 
the cdc this year recommended a second dose of measles vaccine 
for children beginning kindergarten or firstgrade 
everyone born since 1957 when measles was so widespread that 
americans had some natural immunity is considered a potential 
measles risk 
dr steve wassilak a cdc immunization specialist said it 
would be an expensive exhaustive undertaking to revaccinate 
everybody born since 1957 but revaccinating children upon school 
entry he said should start chipping away at the problem 
the cdc also has recommended earlier vaccinations for innercity 
children as early as 9 months rather than the standard 15 to 
try to prevent large outbreaks additionally in the case of school 
measles outbreaks the agency has recommended revaccinating certain 
children 
specifically the cdc recommended outbreak revaccinations for 
students who were vaccinated before 1980 or vaccinated between ages 
12 and 14 months in both cases the agency said studies have shown 
diminished vaccine effectiveness 
the twodose schedule and intensive efforts to raise 
immunization levels should facilitate the goal of measles 
elimination in the united states the cdc said 
but wassilak cautioned that measles rises and falls in cycles to 
some degree and even if next year is low thats not 
inconsistent theres not going to be an immediate effect its 
going to take awhile for the new policy to deter a significant 
number of measles cases 
federal health officials believed measles eradication was within 
reach early this decade when only a few remaining clusters of the 
disease remained but the disease increased between 1983 and 1986 
still incidence of measles remains well below the prevaccine 
levels of half a million or more cases a year

debate within the warsaw pact has hindered 
agreement on verification procedures as part of eastwest arms 
reductions the soviet ambassador said as talks on reducing 
conventional forces resumed 
also thursday the longstanding rivalry between nato allies 
greece and turkey caused an impasse in efforts by the alliance to 
limit military maneuvers as part of the negotiations sources said 
nato diplomats in vienna and brussels wednesday put the finishing 
touches on the western plan described by senior officials as an 
unprecedented effort to curb military exercises on the worlds most 
heavily armed continent 
the east and west have said they will present proposals on 
verifying reductions in conventional forces but diplomats on both 
sides have said privately that disagreements within their alliances 
have been difficult to resolve 
soviet ambassador oleg a grinevsky said on west german 
television wednesday night his country would welcome hundreds of 
north atlantic treaty organization officers to monitor compliance 
on thursday however grinevsky said differences arose within the 
sevennation warsaw pact at a meeting in moscow last week and he 
would not say when the alliance would present its proposals 
us ambassador stephen j ledogar said differences on 
verification within nato which has 16 members were due to 
geographical reality 
with the alliances european members a thin sliver shaped like 
a new moon around the warsaw pact any proposal to remove troops 
from heavily armed central europe produces problems on the flanks 
he told a news conference 
diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said after 
the talks resumed that greece believed nato set the limits too high 
when it proposed requiring military maneuvers be announced in 
advance if 40000 reservists were called up or 1200 armored 
personnel carriers used 
greece sought lower limits because of concern about neighboring 
turkey said the sources who characterized the matter as a 
psychological problem that could be overcome 
greek and turkish relations worsened in 1974 when turkish troops 
invaded cyprus after greekcypriot officers seeking to unite cyprus 
with greece staged a shortlived coup the mediterranean island has 
been divided into greekcypriot and turkishcypriot zones since then 
the west had hoped to begin this third sixweek round of talks 
between nato and the warsaw pact with proposals that would help 
maintain what ledogar called the breathtaking pace of the 
23nation negotiations which began in march 
some diplomats say norway and turkey oppose the nato plan for 
reductions in central europe because weapons withdrawn to soviet 
territory might be moved to their borders 
divisions also exist between the united states and canada which 
want maximum verification and european nations reluctant to have 
inspectors from the soviet bloc constantly touring their weapons 
factories and military bases 
ledogar said he hoped proposals for curbing the number of weapons 
in storage armaments deployed during maneuvers and the number of 
reservists called up could be presented next week verification 
proposals should follow he said 
grinevsky told reporters the main thing now is not to declare 
our positions the main thing now is to agree on them the time for 
grand battles of words is over 
he and ledogar expressed optimism about reaching agreement next 
year and implementing a plan by 1992 or 1993 
in proposals made july 13 at the end of the last round of talks 
nato suggested limiting each alliance to 5700 combat aircraft and 
1900 combat helicopters with no nation having more than 3420 
combat aircraft and 1140 combat helicopters 
the west wants no more than 20000 tanks 16500 artillery pieces 
and 28000 armored troop carriers for each alliance in addition 
nato proposes limiting the united states and soviet union to 275000 
soldiers each in europe outside their national territory 
in march the warsaw pact proposed reducing six kinds of weapons 
including aircraft by 10 percent to 15 percent by 1994 and a 
further 25 percent by 1997 with only defensive forces permitted by 
2000

it may not survive the ages but life has 
been extended at least temporarily for carhenge a circle of junked 
halfburied cars in a replica of englands prehistoric stonehenge 
in an effort to salvage the tourist attraction the alliance city 
council voted 31 thursday night to pursue a change in zoning laws 
allowing carhenge to remain intact 
critics argue it should be torn down because it is unsightly but 
council members decided to review the specialuse permit granted to 
its creator james reinders of houston after he bought the land 
reinders a former alliance resident contends that the monument is 
a work of art though some critics have described it as nothing more 
than a junkyard 
before thursday nights vote about a dozen citizens appeared at 
a public hearing to voice their support for carhenge 
janet steele executive director of the alliance area chamber of 
commerce told the council that carhenge helps attract visitors to 
the community in northwestern nebraska and a supportive letter was 
submitted to the panel from state tourism director peggy briggs 
vice mayor paul phaneuf made the motion thursday night to 
instruct city staff to prepare a change in the city zoning ordinance 
allowing the display of noncommercial exhibits on land zoned 
agricultural

a weakened hurricane gabrielle continued past 
bermuda on a path to irrelevance today in the same cool atlantic 
waters where longharmless hurricane felix was downgraded to a 
tropical storm 
gabrielles winds dropped from 135 mph to 105 mph after the 
center of the hurricane passed northward about 300 miles east of 
bermuda late thursday 
while little change in strength was predicted for gabrielle 
today forecasters expected tropical storm felix to turn toward the 
northwest and become engulfed in the larger gabrielle system 
the winds wont change much until it reaches cooler waters 
said bob sheets director of the national hurricane center 
thursday residents in bermuda reported swells of 10 feet in the 
harbors and the islands eastern tip reported swells of 15 to 20 
feet 
cruise ships berthed in hamilton bermudas capital had been 
advised wednesday to sail for the comparative safety of open waters 
rather than get trapped in confined harbors 
the high seas and winds of 30 to 35 mph prevented any seagoing 
traffic around the island thursday and prompted residents to buy 
emergency supplies in the islands shops 
but gabrielle bermudas second hurricane of the 1989 season and 
the third in less than two years largely bypassed the island 
according to forecasters at the hurricane center 
meanwhile strong winds stretched more than 1000 miles from 
gabrielles center reaching the us east coast 
a ship 60 miles off the coast of long island reported seeing 
12 to 15foot seas sheets said high seas also were reported off 
the coast of north carolina 
at 6 am edt today hurricane gabrielle was centered near 349 
degrees north latitude and 595 degrees west longitude or about 625 
miles south of sable island nova scotia it was traveling north at 
18 mph 
felix was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm earlier 
thursday as it continued to weaken the tropical storm posed no 
threat to land as it traveled north northwest at 7 mph with winds of 
50 mph 
at 6 am felix was located near 418 degrees north latitude and 
488 degrees west longitude or about 400 miles southeast of cape 
race newfoundland in canada 
gabrielle was the seventh named storm of the 1989 atlantic 
hurricane season storms are named when maximum sustained winds 
reach 39 mph and are classified as hurricanes at 74 mph

the bodies of two palestinians suspected of 
collaborating with israel were found in the occupied gaza strip 
despite a warning by uprising leaders against killing fellow arabs 
reports said today 
in another development israeli military officials accused syria 
of being behind two recent attacks along the israeljordan border 
israel radio and three newspapers reported 
the body of 30yearold niman abu hilal was brought to nasser 
hospital in gaza after he was severely beaten at his home in the 
town of rafah by masked palestinian youths arab reports said 
late thursday the body of jasser al krinawi 24 was found 
stuffed in a well in the magazi refugee camp reports said adding 
that he had been stabbed to death 
both were suspected of collaborating with israeli authorities 
an army spokesman said soldiers found the body of krinawi who 
had been reported missing since the start of august the spokesman 
said four arab suspects were in custody 
the spokesman also confirmed the death of a 30yearold arab man 
in gaza he said the man had been brought to the hospital after 
suffering a fatal beating and stab wounds police were 
investigating said the spokesman who declined to elaborate 
the deaths raised to 109 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs since the start of the uprising against israeli rule 
nearly 21 months ago most have been accused either of 
collaboration prostitution or drug dealing 
in its latest leaflet the underground leadership of the uprising 
urged caution in killing collaborators saying that accusations 
should be cleared with the leadership and that suspects should be 
given an opportunity to repent and reform 
at least 559 palestinians have been killed by israeli soldiers or 
civilians since the start of the rebellion 39 israelis also have 
died in the violence 
katyusha rockets fired from jordan hit israeli farmland thursday 
and a stray rocket apparently landed on jordanian soil the army 
said no damage or injuries were reported 
israel radio reported the attack was believed the work of the 
marxist popular front for the liberation of palestine based in 
syria 
last saturday a suspected palestinian guerrilla infiltrated from 
jordan killed two israeli soldiers and wounded another before being 
fatally shot it was the fourth infiltration along the israeljordan 
frontier this year breaking a lengthy period of quiet 
the syrianbased taalat yakoub faction of the palestine 
liberation front claimed responsibility for saturdays border 
penetration 
zeev schiff a military analyst for the haaretz daily said syria 
may be encouraging the palestinians to act via jordan to punish 
jordans king hussein for assisting iraq in moving weapons to 
lebanons embattled christians the lebanese christians this summer 
have been engaged in ferocious artillery duels with syrian forces 
and their moslem allies in lebanon 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir told televisions arabic 
language service on thursday that we still do not think that 
jordans policy of ensuring the security and quiet of the border 
between us has changed 
but shamir called for greater caution and alertness by jordan 
to prevent further problems 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity noted 
that jordan has recently allowed palestine liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat to reopen several offices in amman they 
suggested the warming of relations may be giving a signal to 
palestinian groups that they are welcome to use jordanian territory 
for acts against israel

the man accused of being the brains behind the 
medellin cocaine cartels laundering of money in us banks is 
getting a crash course in americanstyle justice from his lawyer 
eduardo martinez romero on the us list of socalled 
extraditables colombias most important drug kingpins was 
being held without bond at an undisclosed highly secure location as 
he awaits his day in court 
at a preliminary hearing thursday before us magistrate joel m 
feldman martinez said through an interpreter that he understands 
very little english and doesnt fully comprehend what is happening 
to him 
at this time i do not understand the charges i am accused of 
we would like to have sufficient time to see what they deal with 
martinez said 
feldman agreed to delay his arraignment until monday morning 
an affidavit filed in court thursday by us drug enforcement 
administration agent albert d latson said martinez warned an 
atlanta undercover drug agent last year that he would be kidnapped 
and interrogated if anything went wrong with their laundering 
ventures for the medellin cartel 
the affidavit said that during january 1988 meetings in panama 
city panama martinez told agent caesar diaz in an angry voice 
that if anything goes wrong with his customers money the first 
thing they do is question mr martinez 
mr martinez said he would disclose his contacts the 
affidavit said each person would be kidnapped and interrogated 
if the answers were not satisfactory then they would retaliate 
martinez 36 appeared tired and somewhat distracted during the 
hearing security at the courthouse was unremarkable despite the 
wave of bombings associated with the colombian governments 
crackdown on drugs which resulted in martinezs arrest in august 
martinez was not handcuffed or shackled 
martinezs lawyer ed garland said his client was very 
frightened and quiet when he was brought to court 
i think it will be extremely difficult for him to get a fair 
trial garland said my understanding is that he wasnt afforded 
any judicial process he was just picked up and brought here 
us attorney robert barr whose office is prosecuting the 
martinez case said today that the reputed kingpin would be fairly 
treated 
were confident that mr martinez will not only get a fair 
trial but will receive all of the guarantees under our laws and our 
constitution as would any defendant barr said on nbcs today 
show 
all of these issues if there are issues of pretrial 
publicity im sure will be brought out in court and be fully aired 
but were confident of our case barr said 
martinez was brought to atlanta before sunrise aboard a dea 
plane he was then shuttled downtown to the federal courthouse 
aboard a helicopter 
martinez who told the judge he holds a postgraduate degree in 
marketing is accused of laundering up to 27 million in drug 
profits by funneling the cash through us banks 
he was indicted in march in atlanta as a result of an 
investigation codenamed operation polar cap which officials said 
revealed an operation that laundered billions in cocaine profits 
charges were brought against 127 people and two latin american banks 
martinez called by some the finance minister of the medellin 
cartel is the first person extradited to the united states since 
colombias crackdown began last month he was arrested aug 20 a 
previous attempt to arrest him in panama failed last march 
garland told reporters after the hearing that president bushs 
speech tuesday vowing a war on drugs may whip public opinion into 
such a frenzy that martinez cannot obtain a fair trial in atlanta 
the speech probably expressed accurately the feeling of the 
american people said garland a defense lawyer in atlanta for 25 
years my concern is that in our frustration over the drug 
problem we will ignore our other freedoms he like anyone else in 
our country should be presumed innocent

the navy says it will tighten procedures on its 
ships but that its difficult to prevent the suicidal behavior 
officials believe caused the blast that killed 47 sailors aboard the 
uss iowa 
a report on the april 19 explosion released thursday by the 
pentagon said circumstantial evidence indicated that gunners 
mate clayton m hartwig intentionally sparked the explosion 
the family of the 25yearold sailor contends the navy made him a 
scapegoat for its negligence 
more than 1100 pages of evidence released with the report 
depicted hartwig as an expert in explosives who had trouble making 
friends had once attempted suicide and 11 days before the explosion 
said he might become one of those little white headstones in 
arlington national cemetery any day 
but petty officer kendall truitt once a close friend of hartwig 
on the iowa and beneficiary of his 100000 life insurance policy 
said today i dont believe a word of the report and said 
hartwig lacked the mechanical aptitude to build an explosive device 
i had to install this mans radio in his car because he 
couldnt do it and this came with instructions truitt said on 
abcs good morning america program 
the admirals investigating the explosion also found that iowa 
officers were lax in instructing sailors on gunnery and ordered 
that procedures be tightened before the 16inch guns resume regular 
firing 
firing of the guns has been suspended since the explosion but 
were tested last month 
as with any catastrophe the immediate impulse is to take every 
possible step to prevent a recurrence wrote adm carlisle ah 
trost chief of naval operations and the navys top officer 
however trost said in a commentary it is virtually impossible 
to have established procedures to absolutely preclude disastrous 
results of such an individual choice 
adm leon edney the vice chief of naval operations said the 
navy would not change its psychological screening procedures saying 
the investigation found nothing to require a drastic change 
investigators said hartwigs alleged suicidal tendencies were not 
known to his superiors only becoming apparent after interviews with 
acquaintances and family during the fourmonth investigation 
he was a cleancut sailor he didnt smoke he didnt drink he 
didnt carouse on leave he wasnt a troublemaker edney said 
at a pentagon news conference 
but the report concluded that hartwig was the principal 
suspect 
he was emotionally capable of committing suicide probably with 
the intent of killing others also it said 
we dont know the motivation edney said 
kreig j brusnahan a lawyer representing the hartwig family 
criticized the report 
the navy reached the conclusion that they must have a scapegoat 
in this matter to deflect attention away from their negligence 
their incompetence and their indifference in the operation of the 
uss iowa brusnahan said 
rear adm richard d milligan who directed the investigation 
told reporters how hartwig stood next to the breech in the middle 
gun of turret no 2 describing how he could have dropped a 
detonator between bags of gunpowder being loaded during firing 
exercises off puerto rico 
but because all those near hartwig died we will never know 
with absolute certainty exactly what happened edney said 
the circumstances of the explosion are muddied further by a 
number of major administrative and supervisory discrepancies on 
board the uss iowa as well as substantial and serious failures by 
senior uss iowa personnel to properly discharge their 
responsibilities adm powell f carter commander of the atlantic 
fleet said in a letter released with the report 
among the problems cited were a failure to fully train sailors on 
firing procedures but carter said those discrepancies were ruled 
out as a cause of the blast 
milligan began investigating the possibility that the explosion 
was intentional after receiving a letter may 8 from hartwigs 
sister kathy kubicina saying hartwig meant to change the 
beneficiary of the insurance policy from truitt to his parents 
truitts friendship with hartwig cooled after truitt became 
involved with a woman milligan said 
friends and acquaintances described hartwig as weird 
troubled and shy saying he had a hard time making 
friends and had very little selfesteem according to the 
report 
one woman told investigators that hartwig confided to her that 
he was unhappy aboard the ship because the other sailors made fun of 
him 
the names of those who spoke with investigators were blacked out 
in a letter written to a woman friend 11 days before the 
explosion hartwig said 
i really wish you would stop saying that i am hiding in the 
navy i dont think the 1200 men that went down on the uss 
arizona were hiding or the 37 sailors that were killed on the uss 
stark in the persian gulf in 1986 i could become one of those 
little white headstones in arlington national cemetery any day 
several sailors said hartwig told them he had feelings of 
suicide and had attempted suicide several sailors also said 
hartwig said he knew how to build bombs 
he told me he could take out the ship very easily with a small 
bomb said one sailor he just said that an internal explosion 
that could set off magazines with chain reaction would go all the 
way down the ship 
although investigators found no evidence that hartwig had built a 
detonator they did find a book called getting even and a 
military manual on explosives at his bunk 
the milligan report recommended charges against five individuals 
whose names were blanked out administrative action to caution three 
people including the executive officer of the ship with respect 
to duties removal of the gunnery officer and the weapons 
officer from their jobs and administrative or disciplinary action 
against another person one recommendation not approved by the 
chief of naval operations 
the endorsement by the chief of naval operations concurred in a 
recommendation by the commander of surface forces atlantic fleet

emigration from hong kong will jump 25 percent 
in 1990 because of fears of the communist chinese takeover said an 
official 
about 55000 people will leave hong kong in 1990 up from a 
projected 42000 in 1989 mike rowse head of a government task 
force on emigration told reporters today a private emigration 
specialist said both figures are low 
lack of confidence in hong kongs future caused by chinas 
crackdown on a movement for freedom is the main reason for the 
projected increase he said 
the expected exodus is already damaging hong kong rowse said of 
the 409squaremile british colony of islands and peninsula 
transformed into an economic powerhouse by its hardworking people 
talented people are leaving the colony hurting various 
industries he said and their departure affects the morale of those 
who stay 
the territory on the southern chinese coast reverts to beijing in 
1997 under an agreement signed in 1984 by britain and china beijing 
has promised to maintain hong kongs freewheeling economic system 
for 50 years but many in the colony do not believe that 
since the june 34 crackdown thousands in hong kong have been 
clamoring for the right to settle in britain but the british 
government has refused 
london currently is working on a nationality package that will 
give some hong kong residents the right to live in britain 
rowse criticized the british government for looking at the 
package purely in terms of asian immigration and not as a matter 
of principle 
the hong kong people were never given an opportunity to decide 
what they wanted nor were they represented in the british 
parliament which took the decision he said i think we have to 
ask is that fair 
last year 45800 people emigrated from hong kong mostly to the 
united states australia and canada the figure marked a 35 percent 
increase over 1987 and a 51 percent jump from 1980 the first year 
statistics were kept 
this year the government has projected emigration will fall 
about 4000 
an emigration specialist claimed the projections are low 
the only way emigration will fall is because consulates in hong 
kong are getting too many applications and there is a backlog 
said horatio cheung of the hong kong freedom of movement and rights 
of abode it would in no way reflect peoples desire to get out 
government figures show the number of requests for certificates 
of no criminal convictions a document required by many countries 
doubled in july and august of this year when compared to the same 
months last year 
in an interview cheung said the colony faces a catastrophic 
brain drain and that he doubts efforts by china britain and the 
colony will succeed in calming peoples fears 
government statistics released thursday indicate the average hong 
kong emigrant has five times more chance of being collegeeducated 
and employed as a professional than the average colony resident 
emigrants also are younger

the state department says it differs strongly 
with the violent methods of the african national congress but 
intends to expand its contacts with the black group in an effort to 
dismantle racial segregation in south africa 
as the oldest african nationalist movement in south africa the 
anc reflects the aspirations of many blacks for a just and 
democratic system the department said in a policy statement 
released thursday night 
it also called for the release of anc leader nelson r mandela 
who has been imprisoned since the early 1960s by the new government 
of acting president f w de klerk 
the anc is one of several organizations with substantial 
political support in south africa particularly but not only among 
blacks the statement said it is a political diverse 
organization representing a range of views 
the bush administration intends to expand its dialogue with the 
anc and other south africans across the political spectrum the 
statement said 
earlier the state department called on south africa to end the 
state of emergency it imposed in 1986 and legalize the anc and other 
antiapartheid groups 
and yet the departments statement said we strongly differ 
with the anc on some of its methods for pursuing these objectives 
we have condemned its use of violence as we have all violence in 
south africa whatever its source 
department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler called the election 
of de klerk a mandate for real change in south africa 
the department press office said later that secretary of state 
james a baker iii would like to meet with de klerk at a mutually 
convenient time 
congratulating de klerk on his election ms tutwiler said we 
are committed to working with all parties to bring the south african 
government and black south africans together in a substanial effort 
to end apartheid 
we therefore are prepared to work with the new government 
toward this end the most important first step in the process is 
dialogue among south africans 
she offered no hint as to what role the united states may play in 
promoting an end to apartheid 
us influence in south africa declined sharply after congress 
imposed sanctions against that country in 1986 over president 
reagans veto there has been little highlevel contact between the 
two governments since

gen michel aoun today called on 
washington to send back its diplomats taking a conciliatory tone as 
his besieged christian forces battled syrian troops outside beirut 
with tanks and mortars 
warweary residents of the capital got a respite today as the 
fighting raged in rainlashed mountains overlooking beirut center 
of a 6monthold confrontation between aouns lebanese christian 
forces and the powerful syrian army allied to lebanese moslem 
militias no injuries were reported 
aouns threeman cabinet issued a statement urging the united 
states to reconsider the evacuation of its diplomats from lebanon 
in order to preserve bilateral relations on thursday aoun lashed 
out at the united states saying its decision to pull out was based 
on halftruths and propaganda 
us ambassador john mccarthy and 29 diplomats were airlifted 
from their fortified embassy in christian east beirut on wednesday 
after aoun accused washington of siding with syria and reportedly 
threatened to seize americans 
the pullout heightened the christians sense of isolation at a 
time when aoun seeks to muster international support for his 
campaign to drive the syrians out of lebanon syrian troops came to 
lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate aoun says they 
betrayed by siding with the moslems 
aouns new conciliatory tone was adopted after he summoned his 
chief aides to a meeting in his underground command bunker two 
floors below the shellbattered presidential palace in christian 
east beirut to assess the repercussions of the us move the 
withdrawal marked the first time the us mission in beirut has 
closed since the civil war began in april 1975 
mccarthy and his staff were evacuated a few hours after 1000 
young christians besieged the embassy compound demanding us 
action to help them 
the christians believe washington has not tried to rein in the 
syrians who outnumber aouns forces by 31 for fear of harming 
us hostages held by in lebanon by iranianbacked moslem 
fundamentalists syria is irans closest ally 
eight americans are among 16 westerners missing in lebanon the 
other captives are four britons two west germans an italian and an 
irishman sunny mann the wife of one of the britons jack mann 
said today she believed he died in captivity but the british 
government did not confirm that 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads a syrianbacked 
moslem cabinet vying for power with aouns expressed regret today 
at the us withdrawal 
in a statement broadcast by the moslemrun voice of the nation 
radio he said he hopes that all foreign diplomats would return to 
lebanon 
aouns appeal today made no reference to his previous statement 
that he would welcome the american diplomats return only if 
washington recognizes his cabinet as lebanons legitimate 
government 
mccarthy who arrived in lebanon a year ago did not present his 
credentials to either aoun or hoss 
lebanons majority moslems want a bigger share of power in 
running the country traditionally dominated by christians who are a 
minority 
the current round of fighting broke out march 8 when aoun 
blockaded illegal ports south of beirut run by syrianbacked 
militias in a vain bid to restore longeroded government authority 
a police spokesman said todays battles raged around douar area 
12 miles northeast of beirut douar controls one of the main routes 
into the beleaguered christian enclave north of the capital 
the spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
said there was no immediate report of casualties at least 830 
people have been killed and 2462 wounded since the artillery war 
began in march 
ninety percent of beiruts 15 million people have fled the 
divided city which is shelled almost daily by both sides

the horsedrawn carriages that hundreds of 
thousands of tourists ride and photograph would mostly disappear 
from midtown manhattan streets under a bill approved by city council 
the bill which drivers said could destroy their business would 
bar the popular carriages from midtown streets except between 
midnight and 7 am to protect the horses from heat and traffic 
said its main sponsor councilman robert dryfoos 
when carriage horses were of yore 100 years ago manhattan was 
an oasis now midtown manhattan is a jungle i want to take them 
out of the asphalt jungle dryfoos said 
the bill which now goes to mayor edward koch would ban horse 
carriages entirely during rush hours during nonrushhour periods 
between 7 am and 7 pm the carriages would be restricted to 
central park from 7 pm to midnight the carriages would be 
allowed on city streets except in the congested midtown area and 
from midnight to 7 am they would be allowed in midtown as well 
the bill also limits use of the horses to eighthour shifts 
gives them 15minute rest breaks every two hours and forbids their 
working when the temperature is above 89 degrees or under 18 degrees 
it would require drivers to have more training and owners to 
carry more liability insurance 
opponents of the bill mainly the 68 carriage owners and 120 
drivers said they could not do business under the new restrictions 
but the bill also contains a provision allowing the drivers to 
increase fares

us and south korean negotiators reached 
tentative agreement early today on a north pacific fishing treaty 
heading off a confrontation that could have led to a ban on south 
korean fisheries products 
ed wolfe the state departments ambassador for oceans and 
fisheries said the agreement would be initialed after both sides 
reviewed the final text before it could go into force both nations 
will have to formally sign it 
under the agreement us enforcement officers will have 
unrestricted authority to board and inspect korean drift net 
vessels to search for evidence of illegal fishing and all korean 
drift net vessels will have to be equipped with satellite 
transponders by the 1990 fishing season wolfe said 
the transponders will allow us officials to keep track of the 
location of the korean vessels to ensure they dont fish outside of 
designated drift net fishing areas 
the agreeement also calls for scientific monitoring of the korean 
fleet and will allow the koreans to fish in an expanded area in the 
north pacific during the month of may 
president bush warned the koreans two weeks ago that they faced a 
possible ban on shipments of their fishery products to the united 
states if they hadnt reached an agreement by the end of september 
drift net treaties were earlier negotiated with japan and taiwan 
wolfe said the state department was satisfied with the tentative 
pact with the koreans and talks with the koreans had been more 
difficult than those he conducted with the japanese and taiwanese 
more than 700 driftnet vessels from japan taiwan and korea have 
been using drift nets in the north pacific ostensibly to catch 
squid but us fishing groups have claimed the vessels are actually 
fishing for north american salmon and that runs in alaska 
washington state and oregon have already suffered as a result of the 
illegal catch 
environmentalists who call the nets walls of death have 
said their use results in the deaths of thousands of marine mammals 
and seabirds annually 
the lighweight monofilament nets can stretch for more than 30 
miles and hang in the water snaring any animal they come in contact 
with on any given day the nets can cover an estimated 30000 miles 
of ocean 
congressional reaction to the korean agreement was guarded 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said he was satisfied with the 
treatys enforcement provisions but was critical of the expanded 
fishing zone for korean vessels in may and the scientific observer 
program 
all these countries ought to be held to the same standard and 
that should be as rigid as necessary to protect our interests 
said murkowski 
rep jolene unsoeld dwash who has introduced legislation 
calling for an international ban on the use of drift nets said 
its important to remember that these are just monitoring 
agreements the drift net fleets will continue intercepting our 
salmon and indiscriminately slaughtering the worlds marine life 
we will just have a little better idea of the extent they are 
doing that

representatives of ethiopia and a rebel eritrean 
group opened preliminary talks on ending the war they have waged 
since 1961 meeting far from their african homeland with former 
president jimmy carter acting as neutral observer 
delegations from the government and the eritrean peoples 
liberation front met with reporters and issued opening statements 
thursday then went behind closed doors at the carter center to try 
to set an agenda for more substantive negotiations they resumed 
their talks this morning 
when you consider that this is a 40to50year struggle the 
fact that theyre there is a great accomplishment mayor andrew 
young said today after attending a breakfast meeting at the center 
and the mood is you know friendly but this is real difficult 
for both sides 
during breakfast young said there was still not a great deal 
of interchange between the two sides 
he said the talks were taking place not across a table but in a 
kind of living room environment as though they were in the 
carters home talking 
no time limit was set for the preliminary talks young who was 
united nations ambassador during the carter administration said 
today that he thought they would go at least into the weekend 
carter had said earlier that giving progress reports before the 
talks ended would be counterproductive 
it makes it very difficult if both sides are giving their own 
separate and sometimes conflicting reports about the process and 
also revealing private statements made in the talks said carter 
who as president a decade ago helped bring about the camp david 
accords between egypt and israel 
ethiopia and eritrean rebels have been fighting over the 
independence of the province of eritrea a former italian colony 
that has ethiopias only direct access to the red sea an estimated 
1 million people have died in the war and related famine 
the rebels considers the conflict to be a war for independence 
ethiopia views it as a battle for secession 
a un agreement federated eritrea with ethiopia in 1952 rebel 
groups began forming in the early 1960s when they did not get 
selfrule and ethiopia unilaterally annexed the area 
leaders of both sides referred thursday to the bitter divisions 
between them 
the search for peace should not be viewed as a subterfuge 
to buy time or still worse as part of military maneuvers and 
tactics of war said alamin mohamed saiyed the head of the 
eritrean delegation and a member of the politburo of the eritrean 
peoples liberation front 
ashegre yigletu head of the government delegation said ethiopia 
has tried repeatedly during the past 15 years to end the conflict 
peacefully 
these peace talks should start off in an atmosphere that avoids 
polemics and recrimination he said 
alamin and ashegre each sat with stern expressions as the others 
statement was read in arabic then translated for the 
englishspeaking reporters but prodded by carter they rose at the 
meetings conclusion and shook hands 
the atlanta journalconstitution quoted unidentified diplomats 
thursday as saying egyptian president hosni mubarak would mediate 
further talks if the carter center sessions were successful 
the atlanta talks are under the auspices of an informal group 
called the international negotiating network which includes 
scholars and former diplomats and operates out of the carter center 
the carter center opened in 1986 houses the presidential 
libaray a museum a think tank and organizations dedicated to 
peace public health and other issues

the law and order minister 
accused antiapartheid leaders today of lying when they blamed 
police for more than 20 deaths during antielection protests 
activists stuck by their claims and demanded the ministers 
ouster 
the rev allan boesak and other activists said at a news 
conference that they knew of 29 people killed in the cape town area 
in electionrelated violence wednesday night 
the evidence points to the fact that the violence in all these 
areas was instigated by police said boesak who called for the 
dismissal of law and order minister adriaan vlok 
vlok said in a statement that boesak and anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu were trying to capitalize politically on the extensive 
violence that occurred this week in mixedrace townships near cape 
town 
vlok also claimed 26 policemen were injured in unrest late 
wednesday and early thursday following elections for the white 
mixedrace and indian chambers of parliament 
blacks are excluded from parliament and militant leaders of all 
races urged a boycott of the elections for the two nonwhite 
chambers 
vlok expressed his deepest condemnation about the lies and the 
manner in which the two church leaders have attempted to make 
political gains from the unrest 
boesak president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
said thursday that acting president fw de klerk now sits in a 
pool of blood because police had opened fire on antielection 
protesters 
according to vlok police are aware of 15 unrest deaths in the 
cape town area wednesday night 10 of them attributed to 
blackagainstblack factional fighting in the township of 
khayelitsha he said the other five deaths were being investigated 
vloks spokesman brig leon mellet challenged tutu and boesak 
to produce the evidence which they used as the basis for telling 
the world that the presidential seat of the acting state president 
was dripping with blood because of the alleged deaths of 23 people 
in the cape on election night 
we do not have such information mellet said 
both police and antiapartheid activists increased their figures 
for known deaths today police earlier had reported 12 deaths and 
activists had reported 23 on election day 
although the number of deaths remains in dispute hospital 
officials have confirmed that dozens of people were treated for 
birdshot wounds sustained during the disturbances 
about 180 lawyers law professors and law students held a 
demonstration today in downtown cape town to denounce police 
violence prior to the protest antiapartheid lawyer dullah omar 
said police brutality reached uprecedented heights this week 
in a related development figures released today showed that 
despite an election system designed to make voting easy fewer than 
20 percent of indian and mixedrace adults cast ballots for their 
segregated houses of parliament 
one indian candidate gangiah naidoo received zero votes 
the indian and mixedrace chambers are largely impotent compared 
to the dominant white chamber in the tricameral parliament 
the regional police commissioner for the cape town region maj 
gen philip fourie met today with a mixedrace lieutenant who has 
created a furor by publicly accusing fellow policemen of brutality 
police spokesmen said the allegations would be investigated and 
insisted that rockmans career would not be affected 
rockman said he had been ordered to stop communicating with the 
press he said he planned to leave the police force soon to study 
law 
on wednesday rockman told reporters he saw a police riot squad 
whipping and beating schoolchildren and bystanders during an 
incident tuesday in mitchells plain the largest of cape towns 
mixedrace townships 
the policemen were just hitting people they couldnt care if 
they were innocent bystanders rockman said it seemed to me 
that they were enjoying themselves feasting on the people 
in pretoria police banned a rally planned for tonight in an 
indian township to protest alleged police brutality 
also in pretoria the canadian embassy released a statement by 
canadas foreign minister joe clark decrying deaths and injuries 
that resulted from a brutal and manifestly excessive police 
response to protests 
de klerk expected to be elected next week for a fiveyear term 
as president has yet to issue any public statement about the cape 
town violence 
his national party narrowly retained its outright majority in 
parliaments dominant white chamber losing nearly a quarter of its 
seats to farright and opposition parties that oppose apartheid

gamblers and guests safely evacuated a resort 
hotel when a fire raced through a new casino wing under construction 
and burned several dozen hotel rooms in an adjacent building 
but within hours guests in the riviera hotel were moved to 
undamaged rooms the existing casino reopened and only two minor 
injuries were reported 
the first thing we did was secure all of the money in the 
casino and evacuate all the people said hotel president mark 
sterbens 
everything worked the way it was supposed to work hotel 
chairman arthur waltzman said of the thursday morning fire 
we went through some pretty dark smoke getting out of the 
casino said dr paul bender of jefferson ind the hotel people 
should be given credit for getting people out in a nonpanic way 
the blaze in the new wing licked up the exterior of the 
ninestory original part of the hotel breaking windows in 75 rooms 
automatic sprinklers in the rooms quickly beat back the flames but 
the fire in the new casino wing took firefighters about two hours to 
extinguish 
damage was estimated at 35 million 
the sprinklers were installed in the early 1980s when tough new 
state laws were enacted following blazes that killed 87 people at 
the mgm grand hotel and eight people at the las vegas hilton 
this is a great example of the importance of sprinklers said 
bob leinbach a clark county fire department spokesman 
clark county fire department spokesman bob leinbach said the 
blaze was touched off by welders working on the new wing 
the fire also spread to the eaves of an existing casino area and 
burned part of an outdoor sign on the casino embers from the blaze 
fanned by 25 mph wind blew across the street and briefly set the 
roof of a motel on fire 
the existing casino reopened thursday evening and a show with 
singer paul anka went on an hour later in the hotels showroom 
hotel officials offered guests free tickets to the show and a free 
prime rib buffet 
sterbens said the hotels 2200 rooms were sold out but some 
people with reservations had canceled allowing hotel officials to 
move guests from damaged rooms into other rooms

the united states the soviet union and 
their allies are moving toward their first exchange of military 
doctrines and detailed information on armies and weapons a senior 
us arms negotiator said today 
john j maresca the chief us delegate to the 35nation talks 
on enhancing security in europe sounded a hopeful note but 
cautioned that the east and west are still far apart in a dispute 
over whether to include naval and air forces in the negotiations 
the participants at the talks include nato and warsaw pact 
nations and neutral european countries 
i believe that these negotiations are now well positioned to 
move forward however we must be realistic maresca told fellow 
negotiatiors at the start of the third round of the negotiations 
a copy of his speech was made available to the associated press 
the common ground which has emerged over the first two rounds 
can only lead to an early positive conclusion if proposals which are 
unlikely to attract consensus are put aside this will undoubtedly 
be the most difficult task before us he added 
nato and warsaw pact countries are holding separate talks in 
vienna on reducing conventional weapons both sets of talks are 
scheduled to continue through oct 20 
maresca said an agreement in principle has been reached in some 
areas at the 35nation talks one important agreement is on the 
annual exchange of military information among east west and neutral 
nations on the worlds most heavily armed continent 
the principle of a regular exchange of information has now i 
believe been broadly accepted in this forum maresca said of the 
35nation talks which bring together the united states canada the 
soviet union and all european nations except albania 
details on how these nations will set up a data bank and which 
information they will share on troop deployments weapons 
procurements and a host of other military matters remain to be 
worked out maresca noted 
neverthelesss a breakthrough has been made with acceptance in 
principle that there should be such an exchange he said 
this represents an important step forward which can only have a 
positive effect on the range of arms control talks currently under 
way maresca said 
a major outstanding issue in the talks is the soviet insistence 
that naval and air forces be included in the talks 
nato insists they were never meant to be part of the negotiations 
and would further complicate already complex talks the west also 
believes that land forces pose the greatest threat on the continent

a handwritten letter by marilyn monroe was sold 
for 7150 setting a record for an auction price for a letter by a 
movie star according to a specialist in autograph auctions 
the auction thursday broke the old record of 6600 paid in 
september 1987 for a handwritten letter by actress greta garbo said 
herman darvick who stages autograph auctions six times a year 
the record does not include one movie actor the one who became 
president a handwritten letter by ronald reagan praising frank 
sinatra once sold for 12500 but his white house connection made a 
large difference darvick said 
the monroe letter in an envelope postmarked jan 17 1945 is 
actually signed norma jeane monroes given name she was 18 when 
she wrote it 
also during the sale a black and white photograph from the 1952 
motion picture niagara signed in red ink to jacklove and 
kissesmarilyn monroe sold for 2750 darvick said he did not 
know who jack was 
other highlights of the sale were 4400 for a twopage letter 
from abigail adams the first first lady to live in the white house 
6050 for a photograph signed by all seven crew members of the 
illfated challenger space shuttle 3575 for a letter by adolf 
hitler and 11000 for a document signed by george washington 
ordering the execution of a spy 
darvick said the sale shows people will always be fascinated by 
marilyn monroe 
the letter was written by monroe while she was working at the 
radio plane co in burbank calif as an inspector on the plants 
assembly line she was transferred to the line apparently because 
her typing speed was considered insufficient and she indicated in 
the letter she wanted to improve her secretarial skills 
thank you so much for sending the book of business english and 
for the encyclopedia she wrote i didnt have an encyclopedia 
and i really did need one so i am most grateful to you 
darvick said the letter would not have fit the image of a dumb 
blonde evidently she was bettering herself

about 6000 east germans have fled to west germany taking 
advantage of hungarys decision in may to remove border 
fortifications with austria hungary has been seeking closer ties 
with the west as it reforms its communist political and economic 
system 
another 6000 east germans many of them people vacationing in 
hungary flooded refugee camps in recent weeks to take advantage of 
a onetime sanctioned migration apparently tacitly agreed to by 
hungary 
the prospective exodus has worsened tensions between hungary and 
east germany which has spurned the liberal reforms embraced to 
varying degrees in the soviet union poland and hungary 
austrian volunteers have opened four reception centers along the 
border for the east german arrivals unger said a fifth was 
hurriedly set up in the changing rooms of a sports ground overnight 
after one group of 32 east germans arrived at a crossing point near 
the small town of nikitsch 
we dont know if well keep it open whether this was a single 
group or the start of a trend he said we cant just open up 
another reception center every place the groups arrive

some cook county courtrooms will be opened for 
trials at night in a move to alleviate jail overcrowding and a 
soaring backlog of pending felony cases 
chief circuit court judge harry comerford said thursday that 
plans are being developed to use five cook county courtrooms at the 
criminal court complex especially for trials of defendants charged 
with drug offenses and related crimes who have been unable to post 
bond 
in addition comerford said six divorce courtrooms in one court 
building will be converted to felony trial courtrooms 
comerford said the measures should increase the capacity of the 
countys criminal court system by about 30 percent raising the 
number of felony courtrooms from 39 to 50 
when we have a crisis like the jail overcrowding and burgeoning 
criminal court calls we have to take dramatic steps comerford 
said this may be a temporary but necessary move because we have 
to do something drastic to alleviate the problems 
the latest figures show the inmate population at cook county jail 
at more than 7000 for the first time and that more than 900 
inmates are without beds 
in february a federal judge fined the county 1000 each day 
that the jail population exceeds the number of available beds the 
judge made the order retroactive to december 1988

solidarity would have authority over 
foreign affairs and the broadcast media in a proposed government 
that would allow the communist party to retain control of the police 
and military 
under the proposed government of former solidarity activist 
tadeusz mazowiecki the first noncommunist prime minister in the 
soviet bloc the trade union would have 12 cabinet posts and the 
communists would have five 
the solidarityallied united peasant and democratic parties would 
have four and two cabinetlevel posts respectively 
committees of the sejm or lower house of the national assembly 
began hearings on mazowieckis nominees today and planned to vote 
tuesday on mazowieckis proposed government 
no official list of nominees was released the party newspaper 
trybuna ludu the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza and the 
state pap news agency all published lists today and thursday that 
varied in some details government and parliamentary sources also 
provided slightly varying accounts 
but the general shape of the proposed government was known and 
appeared likely to win approval in parliament which is dominated by 
a solidarityled coalition 
according to an unofficial list of nominees compiled from 
government and parliamentary sources solidarity will run six 
government departments or ministries it also is to have at least 
six cabinentlevel posts that are essentially ministers without 
portfolio 
one woman was among the 20 nominees proposed culture minister 
izabella cywinska a prominent theater director 
the prestigious post of foreign minister was denied the communist 
party and given to krzysztof skubiszewski a lawyer close to the 
roman catholic church 
the relatively unknown skubiszewski an adviser to polish church 
leader cardinal jozef glemp and specialist in germanpolish 
relations was considered a compromise in the fight between 
solidarity and the communists for the post 
the prosolidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza called skubiszewski 
neutral because he is not active in solidarity although 
mazowiecki was overheard by reporters telling lawmakers the nominee 
had been a solidarity member 
the communist party which had directed the government since 
1948 will have just four ministries plus one member without 
portfolio in the cabinet for a total of five posts on the cabinet 
council 
however it will retain control of the interior and defense 
ministries which run the military and security police 
the united peasant party is to have four ministries and the 
democratic party is to have two according to the unofficial list 
both parties are allied with solidarity 
 
mazowiecki nominated solidarity members to head the ministries of 
finance labor planning industry building and housing education 
and culture 
 
solidarity also would receive the key chairmanship of the 
committee that supervises state television and radio which the 
communist party has controlled since world war ii 
besides the interior and defense ministries the communists would 
have the transporation and foreign trade ministries and a secretary 
of state post 
the peasant party would have agriculture health environment and 
justice ministries the democratic party would head the technology 
and domestic trade offices 
several nominees have been victims of government repression 
jacek kuron the solidarity adviser nominated for labor minister 
has spent more than nine years in prison henryk samsonowicz 
nominated as education minister was dismissed as rector of warsaw 
university in 1982 because of his sympathy for solidarity 
at a news conference after the solidarity caucus bronislaw 
geremek the unions parliamentary leader said it was very 
favorable that communists would not be in charge of most economic 
ministries 
he conceded there were disputes over some choices however 
members of the independent farmers union rural solidarity 
objected to the strong role for the peasant party previously allied 
with the communists rural solidarity which like solidarity was 
legalized in april after a sevenyear ban contends it is the 
authentic voice of the countryside 
rural solidarity activists ran for the parliament as part of 
solidaritys successful campaign and are an important faction in the 
caucus 
jozef slisz the rural solidarity leader was quoted by the 
solidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza on thursday as saying his group 
was offered only the environment ministry and it does not suit 
us 
the peasant party which has no say in the countryside got 
more and we who are the main force got nothing he said 
mazowiecki was named prime minister on aug 24 after the 
communists weakened by elections in june failed to form a 
government the elections were among reforms agreed on this spring 
between solidarity and the government after widespread strikes last 
year 
the new government will face an economy wracked by inflation low 
productivity and a foreign debt of 39 billion

recordkeeping methods that would allow 
investigators to reconstruct trades on the nations commodities 
exchanges are fundamentally inadequate a senate committee was 
told today 
but officials of the general accounting office said 
computerization doesnt necessarily spell the end of the traditional 
hurlyburly method of trading by shouts and hand signals known as 
open outcry 
i think thats a question the exchanges themselves need to 
answer said richard l fogel an assistant comptroller general 
with the gao the auditing arm of congress 
i dont personally believe that the government should dictate 
how the exchanges want to trade he added 
fogel testified to the senate agriculture committee about a study 
of the methods used by exchanges to track trading and keep futures 
traders honest 
the study found exchange systems for tracking a given trade 
known as an audit trail lacking because so much of the 
recordkeeping is left to the traders and brokers themselves 
sen patrick leahy dvt the committee chairman asked fogel if 
he believed the current audit trail systems in place at the major 
us exchanges are fundamentally inadequate to police the trading 
floors against abuses 
i think it is yes said fogel noting that there is no 
guarantee that information about the timing of when an order gets to 
a broker and when the order is executed by the broker 
fortyfive traders at the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange were charged aug 2 with bilking profits from 
hundreds of customers through a series of illegal activities 
including falsified trading records 
while detecting every abuse may never be possible most of the 
types of abuses alleged in the justice department indictments could 
also have been detected and documented with independent precise and 
complete timing of trades the gao report said 
the two futures exchanges the largest in the world have been 
criticized for not keeping a closer watch on traders while the 
commodity futures trading commission which oversees the futures 
markets has been accused of doing so with too light a touch 
the cftc is up for reauthorization this fall and a bill passed by 
the house would require exchanges to reconstruct a trade to within 
one minute of its occurence no later than one year after the bill 
becomes law 
audit trails accurate to the nearest 30 seconds would be required 
within three years of the bills enactment 
within weeks of the indictments the two chicago exchanges 
announced they were developing handheld computer terminals to 
record floor trading 
but the gao study said the cftc has not been actively involved 
in conducting or setting guidelines for technical assessments of 
these systems capabilities to control trading abuses and automation 
risks 
the gao also said the cftc lacks the necessary technical 
resources to keep tabs on the exchanges developing technology

suspected smuggling coordinators for colombias 
medellin cocaine cartel have been charged with funneling the drug 
through the bahamas and the florida keys in exchange for air drops 
of ice chests stuffed with cash 
a federal indictment disclosed thursday charges two members of 
the cartelleading ochoa clan and 10 others helped smuggle almost 4 
tons of cocaine from colombia into the united states 
mauricio ochoa 32 is being held without bond in the 
metropolitan correctional center south of here he has been in 
custody since june 20 
the second man fabio enrique ochoa disappeared from his 
suburban miami condominium shortly after mauricio ochoas arrest 
and authorities believe he fled to colombia 
the pair have been described by federal authorities as principal 
smugglers for the medellin cartel 
a man named fabio ochoa is on a justice department list of 12 top 
drug figures sought in the united states but prosecutors are 
uncertain if the fabio ochoa named in the indictment is the same 
person and also are not sure what the ochoas relationship to 
cartel patriarch fabio ochoa restrepo is 
the indictment was unsealed after the arrest of a couple accused 
of driving drugbearing speedboats from the bahamian island of abaco 
to key largo prosecutors said 
once cocaine loads were safely ashore the indictment said a 
plane dropped the smugglers payment of 200000 to 400000 in 
cash packed in plastic foam chests at sea to be picked up by boat 
the final load of 400000 burst when it hit the water 
scattering loose bills across the water in july 1987 after the ring 
had handled 7700 pounds of cocaine an affidavit said

house democrats are urging president bush to 
boost by 100000 the number of east european refugees allowed to 
enter the united states over the next 12 months 
a letter to bush signed by house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo and rep william o lipinski dill said that 
while the iron curtain has begun to open to permit people to leave 
an american bureaucratic curtain keeps most of them from coming to 
the united states 
unfortunately the gates to america for those who have suffered 
under communist regimes are closed gephardt and lipinski said 
while immigration policy favoring family reunification and job 
skills is generally correct it has prevented american policy from 
reacting to the increase in emigration from eastern europe they 
said in the letter released thursday 
restrictions on emigration are being eased by the soviet union 
and other eastern european nations but immigration to the united 
states from the region decreased from 27480 in 1982 to 12838 in 
1987 they said 
the bush administration has resisted increasing refugee totals 
with some officials contending that the united states can no longer 
accommodate the large numbers of people wishing to immigrate the 
1989 immigration ceiling for the soviet union and eastern europe is 
31500 and has been filled 
ongoing suppression and persecution in these communist 
countries justifies americas acceptance of eastern european and 
soviet refugees the letter said 
ronald h brown chairman of the democratic national committee 
endorsed the move to increase the flow of refugees from eastern 
europe to the united states 
the president ought to use his authority to help the thousands 
of people that have already fled communist regimes in the soviet 
union and eastern europe brown said in a statement his 
leadership on this initiative is critical

premature babies breathe easier to 
the disco beat a dutch doctor claimed friday 
preliminary results of an experiment at amsterdams university 
hospital indicate that infants with respiratory problems need less 
oxygen in their incubators if soft disco music is played said dr 
heleen loggers the pediatrician 
most premature babies suffer respiratory problems since early 
this year about 24 such infants have had 90 minutes a day of disco 
music piped into their incubators ms loggers told the associated 
press 
we sought a method to lower the oxygen content of the 
incubators because oxygen can damage the babies corneas said ms 
logger when we played music in the incubator more or less as a 
joke we found that the children needed about 10 to 20 percent less 
additional oxygen 
at first the children were treated to perry como 
but when we changed that to disco music the breathing rhythm 
also improved said ms logger the beat seems to pull them 
along 
she stressed that the findings were preliminary research is to 
continue for at least a year she said

a tide of refugees is forcing this insular 
country to cope with a backlash of racism as it heads toward a 
national election it is one of the hottest issues of the campaign 
but many candidates are reluctant to touch it 
antiimmigrant sentiment is partly credited for the rising 
popularity of rightwing leader carl i hagen who has emerged as 
the main challenger to prime minister gro harlem brundtland and her 
labor party in the sept 11 vote 
polls predict his party of progress may jump from two seats in 
the 157seat parliament to as many as 32 in the new 165seat 
legislature 
hagen says norway cannot afford to support refugees whose number 
swelled 10fold in two years peaking in 1987 at about 8600 
in recent months immigration centers and homes have been bombed 
or shot at two pakistani immigrants were stabbed to death in july 
those wanting to keep out refugees claim they burden the social 
welfare system take jobs bring more crime and drugs have 
extremely large families and steal norwegian women 
at the opposite pole are norwegians who have disrupted 
antiimmigration rallies and sheltered refugees facing deportion

wilkesbarre pa ap a jury today convicted a couple of 
thirddegree murder in the starvation of their 14yearold son while 
the family went without food for six weeks though they had nearly 
4000 they were saving for their church 
the jury deliberated a halfhour today after considering the case 
for little more than an hour thursday night 
the defendants larry and leona cottam held hands but displayed 
no emotion when jury foreman maria uitti read the verdict 
jurors also convicted the couple of two counts each of recklessly 
endangering another person and endangering the welfare of children 
son eric died jan 3 after the family had not eaten since nov 22 
cottam summoned police the day after the boy died 
they could be sentenced to up to 28 years in prison on all 
counts no sentencing date was set 
the family fasted despite 3775 in savings set aside as a tithe 
or offering for god cottam a former seventhday adventist 
minister believed spending the money would have amounted to 
stealing 
their other child 12yearold laura has recovered from 
malnourishment caused during the fast and has been placed in foster 
care 
in his instructions to the jury luzerne county common pleas 
court judge gifford s cappellini said malice in the case had a 
legal definition including a combination of a hardness of heart and 
conscious disregard to a high risk of death or serious bodily harm 
the jurors also could have convicted the couple of voluntary or 
involuntary manslaughter if they found them innocent of thirddegree 
murder which requires a finding of malice 
defense attorney al flora jr in his closing argument thursday 
afternoon said cottam 39 and mrs cottam 38 feared losing their 
children if they went to authorities for help during the six weeks 
the family went without food 
flora said the cottams mistakenly believed god would intervene to 
save them during their fast meaning they werent legally 
responsible for erics death 
he said the couple distrusted society after laura and eric told 
them they were sexually abused by several people including their 
paternal grandparents who denied the charges as well as a 
seventhday adventist leader and officials at a church school near 
their home in nuangola in northeastern pennsylvania 
but prosecutor thomas marsilio luzerne county assistant district 
attorney said the cottams not society were to blame for their 
sons death 
the parents watched him die and they didnt lift a finger to 
prevent his death marsilio said in his summation to the jury 
before a packed courtroom 
a phladelphia jury heard testimony during the nineday trial 
after cappellini decided pretrial publicity made picking an 
impartial jury in luzerne county impossible 
flora said the couple would appeal they remained free on bond 
today pending the appeal

the demand by the salcininkai district has put lithuanian 
officials who complain of moscows authority over their baltic 
republic in the uneasy position of hearing the same arguments about 
their authority over salcininkai 
this is a cry from the soul the desire of the people to say 
what hurts l yankelevich chairman of the salcininkai regional 
council told the official tass news agency 
tass quoted v belskaya a kindergarten teacher as saying at the 
council session that made the demand we see autonomy as the only 
way today to protect our peoples interests 
the council voted 5014 to declare the region autonomous and 
residents carrying polish flags rallied outside the council 
building the news agency reported thursday it did not say when the 
vote was taken 
salcininkai 30 miles south of the lituanian capital of vilnius 
and near the border with byelorussia is a traditionally polish 
district tass reported it said the population now is 81 percent 
ethnic polish and only 7 percent lithuanian while the republic as a 
whole is 80 percent lithuanian 
ethnic poles fear the campaign for lithuanian sovereignty 
organized by the political movement sajudis which so far has 
produced a law making lithuanian the official language 
a major complaint in salcininkai is that the law requires 
interoffice communications to be in lithuanian by january 1991 even 
if nearly all employees are polish 
members of the district council complained of a case in which an 
accountant four years short of retirement would have to leave early 
because he could not learn lithuanian well enough in the time 
allowed tass said 
lithuanias language law took effect in february before 
resistance stiffened among ethnic minorities in small soviet 
republics that seek greater autonomy 
the soviet union encompasses 100 ethnic groups and animosities 
exist between many of them 
in the moldavian republic on the romanian border ukrainians 
russians and other nonmoldavians are in the third week of a strike 
to protest a law making moldavian the official language ethnic 
moldavians make up 64 percent of that republics 42 million people 
a christian turkish people known as the gagauz a small minority 
in moldavia are demanding an autonomous district 
many republics have passed laws making the tongue of the dominant 
ethnic group the official language and more are being prepared 
in salcininkai the people appear inspired by kremlin reaction to 
the baltic campaign for sovereignty rather than polands experiment 
with democracy 
some banners carried by the crowd at the council building said 
down with the sajudis dictatorship and others expressed support 
for a tough kremlin statement that separatists were leading the 
baltics into an abyss tass reported 
it said president vytautus astrauskas of lithuania and s 
gedraitus a secretary of the republics communist party attended 
council meetings and urged patience 
tass quoted astrauskas as saying the council decision did not 
make autonomy a fact and declaring earlier we worked together in 
friendship and no problems arose thats the way well search for a 
solution

when capt joseph hazelwood reported the 
exxon valdez was spilling crude oil into prince william sound he 
automatically won immunity from prosecution on any charges from the 
spill his lawyer claims 
hazelwood has been charged with three misdemeanors and three 
felonies in the spill but court documents filed in his defense 
claim a littleknown state regulation protects him from prosecution 
the regulation was designed to encourage reporting of spilled oil 
or other hazardous substances the immunity clause provides that 
information obtained in such a report may not be used in prosecuting 
the people who make the notification 
prosecutors have until later today to file answers to the 
arguments raised in the memo which was filed last month 
hazelwoods trial is tentatively set for oct 30 
early march 24 hazelwood reported to the coast guard that his 
vessel was impaled on bligh reef and spilling its toxic cargo into 
the sound 
the promise of some kind of immunity to any natural person 
providing this notification or report clearly is stated in the 
alaska administrative code but it will be up to superior court 
judge beverly cutler to decide how far the protection extends 
dick madson one of hazelwoods attorneys said the immunity 
clause prohibits prosecution for anything stated by the reporter 
as well as any information which is derived from investigating the 
report 
if cutler rules for hazelwood it could eliminate all the 
evidence gathered by the state to support its charges against the 
former skipper 
madson argued that a broad interpretation of the immunity clause 
is necessary because people who spill oil are legally required to 
report the incident violating their right to protection from 
selfincrimination 
the immunity offered is to ensure that if one obeys the law by 
reporting a discharge he cannot be criminally prosecuted for the 
discharge itself madson argued 
madson also said the state improperly ignored laws specifically 
designed to deal with oil spills and charged hazelwood instead with 
catchall criminal mischief felonies that carry stiffer penalties 
the 49page memo outlining hazelwoods defense also argues that 
all charges based on alleged recklessness the three felonies and 
one of the misdemeanors should be dismissed because the state has 
its facts wrong 
madson said the allegations of recklessness are based on two 
accusations both untrue first the state claims hazelwood turned 
over control of the ship to a third mate without a required coast 
guard license endorsement to pilot a tanker in the waters near bligh 
reef 
madson said the coast guard waived that rule before march 24 and 
no special license endorsement was necessary however information 
by the coast guard appares to dispute madsons assertion 
the second allegation of recklessness is based on charges that 
hazelwood tried to rock the 987foot tanker off the reef after it 
was grounded if true the action would have risked sinking the 
damaged ship and spilling the rest of the cargo 
madson said automatic logs of the ships engine show it was not 
put into reverse at any time after the grounding the lawyer said 
that proves hazelwood did not try to rock the ship off he did not 
mention recorded conversations between hazelwood and the coast guard 
in which he says he is trying to get the ship off the reef

congressional leaders are calling for 
accelerated action on the bush administrations antidrug bill with 
the senate already approving a 45 million down payment from 
lawmakers own budgets to finance the fight 
lets begin to break the habit and begin to help those who need 
help sen pete wilson rcalif said as the senate voted 838 on 
thursday to cut its own mass mailing funds by 45 million and devote 
the money to drug programs 
it was the first move to funnel money into the war on drugs since 
president bush on tuesday night unveiled his 79 billion strategy 
that relies partly on such transfers to pay the bill 
congress seems to be getting into the swim of things white 
house chief of staff john sununu told reporters traveling with bush 
to new orleans for speeches urging support for his drug program 
he said the senate ought to be complimented for approving the 
cut in mass mailing funds 
the amendment was attached to a 2 billion legislative expenses 
bill that must be reconciled with a differing housepassed version 
asked whether the administration would be amenable to congress 
voting more money for the drug war than bush proposed sununu said 
that would be difficult within the boundaries of a budget compromise 
however he said if they can find an appropriate readjustment 
of priorities within the budget compromise were not going to 
be closeminded if there are good suggestions that come from 
congress 
meanwhile thursday national drug policy director william j 
bennett acknowledged under questioning at a senate judiciary 
committee hearing that bushs drugfighting blueprint envisions 
state and local governments paying substantial amounts in addition 
to what would be contributed at the federal level 
bennett conceded that a 40 percent increase in prison capacity 
called for under the plan could cost the states 5 billion to 10 
billion although he said that was the roughest of estimates and 
subject to revision he said the federal government should not play 
the role of a sugar daddy in supplying funds to the states 
to succeed we need the support and involvement of every level 
of government and every private citizen bennett said 
calls proliferated thursday for speededup approval of the 
administration drug bill which is expected to reach the hopper in a 
week or two 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house gop leader bob 
michel rill emerged from a white house meeting and urged 
extraordinary steps to emphasize the sense of urgency needed to 
bring about congressional action 
senate judiciary chairman joseph b biden jr ddel called for 
talks with the white house to set ground rules that would put the 
bill on to use washington jargon a fast track 
whether we accept this strategy in total or whether we add to 
this strategy its all going to have to happen in the next few 
weeks biden said 
however senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and 
house speaker thomas foley dwash have not said thus far whether 
they believe action on the bill should be accelerated 
foley spokesman jeff biggs said the issue should be handled as 
expeditiously as possible mitchell said through his office that 
speededup action was under consideration 
the bush blueprint would be financed partly by cutting 716 
million in existing programs most of the money already is 
authorized for fighting drugs but about 2 billion would represent 
fresh funds 
aid to andean nations in fighting the cocaine cartel 
interdiction of drug shipments from south america tougher treatment 
for offenders and new prisons are part of the plan along with more 
education and treatment 
democrats called for new revenue to finance the drug war when 
bush announced his plan tuesday but party leaders later said there 
was no chance for approval in the face of the presidents continuing 
opposition to a tax increase 
bennetts initial tour of committees thursday was smooth for the 
most part with democrats quick to praise the bush blueprint 
rep william j hughes dnj chairman of the house judiciary 
committees subcommittee on crime told bennett the plan was off to 
a very very good start 
but his warm reception in the senate was broken when sen edward 
m kennedy dmass questioned him about the administrations 
continued refusal to ban americanmade assault rifles 
the administration barred import of a number of the 
militarystyle weapons earlier this year but it has not moved 
against domestic weapons 
kennedy said recent seizures in colombian drug raids show half 
of the guns that are used locally are being manufactured here in the 
united states of america 
bennett said he had received similar reports about the arsenals 
of colombian drug lords it is a matter of concern to us he 
said but added he would not recommend a ban on the manufacture and 
production and distribution of the weapons in the united states 
meanwhile an abcwashington post poll released thursday said 
wide majorities are willing to put up with increased searches of 
homes cars school lockers and luggage at the airport to look for 
illegal drugs 
the poll conducted by phone wednesday asked the opinions of 764 
adults selected at random the poll said 88 percent favor more 
luggage searches at airports 87 percent are for searching school 
lockers 87 percent support random police searches of cars and 52 
percent say police should be able to search homes without a court 
order 
the polls margin of error is plus or minus four percentage 
points

a former ptl budget director testified 
today that ministry founder jim bakker asked him to manipulate 
figures until he could show that one type of partnership in ptl 
could be worth 1 million to a family 
prosecutors say bakker 49 used nearly 4 million in ministry 
funds obtained from the sale of partnerships in the ministrys hotel 
to bankroll his extravagant lifestyle partners who gave at least 
1000 were told they were guaranteed a certain number of nights 
per year in the hotel at the ministrys heritage usa retreat near 
fort mill sc 
former ptl budget director mark burgund testified today that in 
1985 bakker asked him to determine how to show that one partnership 
program the silver 7000 program would be worth more than 1 
million those partnerships cost up to 3000 
jim bakker asked me to make up a chart showing the value of the 
silver 7000 membership over a period of time burgund said when 
he told bakker it would be worth 84000 over 30 years for a family 
of four bakker told him to make it for a family of five figure 
it out to make it worth 1 million burgund quoted bakker as 
saying 
burgund testified he sent a series of memos to bakker showing 
that to get 1 million of use out of a partnership a family of five 
would have to go to ptl once a year for a weeklong free stay for 50 
years and would have to use every facility at heritage usa even 
facilities not yet constructed such as a bowling alley 
bakker then used those figures in selling the partnerships 
burgund said 
but prosecutor deborah smith said even burglunds figures were 
inflated saying a family of five would actually have to stay at the 
resort far longer than five days a year for them to get 1 million 
worth of services from a partnership 
on thursday five socalled ptl lifetime partners testified that 
they paid ptl for lodging at heritage usa but then were told there 
were no vacancies when they tried to use the hotel 
there were more people than there was room said lamar 
kerstetter a retired coal miner from shamokin pa who suffers 
from black lung disease and cancer and lives on disability insurance 
bakkers lawyers asked the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 
richmond va on thursday to halt the fraud and conspiracy trial 
pending an appeal of us district judge robert potters refusal to 
dismiss the charges against bakker 
lawyers harold bender and george t davis on wednesday asked 
potter to throw out the charges against bakker citing possible 
grand jury misconduct 
defense attorneys claim jessica hahn told a charlotte radio 
station that a grand jurors approached her in a courthouse restroom 
and asked for her autograph during a break in her testimony in 
september 1987 
bakkers attorneys said the grand jurors violated their oath of 
impartiality and thus tainted the process leading to bakkers 
indictment 
bakker unveiled the lifetime partnerships program in early 1984 
telling donors he would offer 25000 partnerships in the 504room 
heritage grand hotel then under construction only half the hotel 
rooms were available for partners 
assistant us attorney jerry miller asked kerstetter what he 
expected to get for 1000 he paid for a partnership in march 1987 
the same month bakker resigned from ptl after disclosure of his 
sexual encounter with ms hahn 
my four days and three nights kerstetter responded i was 
buying a product i was buying lodging and use of the park 
thursday was the first full day of testimony after the trial 
resumed following bakkers breakdown and commitment to a federal 
prison for psychiatric evaluation last week 
lila angel 89 of atlantic beach fla and her daughter dana 
angel testified that they split the cost of a 1000 partnership 
putting the purchase on their visa cards both women are retired and 
live on social security 
lila angel testified that she expected a return for her money 
i worked until i was 77 and i save my pennies i still do that 
500 was quite a bit of money for me she said 
defense attorneys had said in opening arguments that money given 
to the ministry was in the form of donations not meant as money 
paid for a product 
william maybrey the general manager of heritage grand hotel from 
april 1984 to december 1985 testified that an oct 14 1985 memo 
disclosed 63512 lifetime partnerships had been sold 
asked by prosecutors whether 63512 partners could be 
accommodated at the hotel mabrey replied it would be impossible 
to do 
prosecutors also produced a series of witnesses thursday 
documenting purchases of luxury cars and a corporate jet by ptl or 
bakker and ptls 1984 charter of a corporate jet at a cost of 
100000 
thursday morning bakkers wife tammy criticized us marshals 
treatment of her husband while he was in their custody and read a 
phone number for the us justice department in washington 
she then urged people to call to complain because the next 
person thats treated this way could be your husband or your 
minister or someone that you love 
three special telephone lines were set up at the justice 
department and department spokesman joe krovisky said the operators 
were getting a continuous stream of calls from people protesting 
the prosecution of the former ptl leader

the irish republican army said 
friday it shot to death the west german wife of a british soldier in 
the mistaken belief she was a member of the british army 
police said the 26yearold woman identified as heidi hazell 
was shot more than a dozen times with a kalashnikov automatic rifle 
thursday as she sat in the family car in a military housing area 
just outside dortmund 
the attack was the second at a british military installation in 
west germany in a less than a week more than 66000 british 
soldiers and their dependents are stationed in west germany 
in a statement released in dublin ireland the ira said an 
ira active service unit carried out last nights shooting in west 
germany the woman killed was believed to have been a member of the 
british crown forces garrisoned in dortmund it has now emerged that 
she was the german wife of a british army staff sergeant 
as we intend continuing our campaign until the british army 
withdraws from ireland the outcome of last nights attack 
reinforces a warning we gave on aug 2 1988 for civilians to stay 
well clear of british military personnel this warning applies to 
the use of vehicles personally belonging to british soldiers and all 
modes of military transport 
the mainly catholic ira is fighting to drive the british out of 
northern ireland last week it claimed responsibility for an attack 
near muenster in which two british soldiers were seriously wounded 
west german authorities warned west germans to be on alert for 
possible ira attacks in the country saying they also could be the 
victims it was the first such warning to west german citizens about 
the ira 
federal police in wiesbaden also asked citizens to help 
authorities in their search for the ira gunmen 
the police statement said west germans living in the area where 
british forces are concentrated should be on alert for english 
speakers claiming to be tourists and renting apartments and cars 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for the federal prosecutors 
office in karlsruhe said the gunman fired more than a dozen shots 
from a kalashnikov automatic rifle at mrs hazell the car was 
parked and had british plates 
foerster said the killer fled in a car after the shooting he 
wore british military battle fatigues and had at least one 
accomplice who was in the car foerster said 
in a telephone interview with the associated press foerster said 
a kalashnikov was also used in the shooting of two british soldiers 
one week ago near muenster 
we are checking to determine if it was the same weapon as the 
one used in muenster although its unlikely foerster said

soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has written 
to pope john paul ii to arrange a historic meeting between the two 
men and discuss troubled vaticansoviet relations a senior vatican 
official said friday 
in moscow soviet sources said gorbachev is expected to visit 
italy beginning nov 25 italian officials have indicated gorbachev 
may tour several cities 
a meeting between gorbachev and polishborn john paul has been 
viewed as likely during the soviet leaders stop in italy but there 
has been no confirmation by either side 
such a meeting would be of historic proportions the first 
between the leader of the worlds 850 million roman catholics and 
the head of a soviet party that disparages religion 
john paul speaking to reporters earlier this year said he would 
be willing to receive the soviet president 
the vatican official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
gorbachev referred to a possible meeting in a letter delivered to 
the pope last month by yuri karlov an aide to soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze 
the letter said in effect lets talk business said the 
vatican official 
the letter was in response to one written by the pope to 
gorbachev and carried to moscow in june 1988 by cardinal agostino 
casaroli the vaticans secretary of state the official said 
casaroli led a delegation of top roman catholic officials to 
moscow for a celebration of the russian orthodox church the visit 
signaled an improvement in historically icy vaticansoviet relations 
further progress has been made this year capped by the vatican 
appointment of a bishop in the soviet republic of byelorussia the 
first bishop there since the aftermath of the russian revolution 
in august john paul held long talks with karlov when the soviet 
envoy met with him at his castel gandolo vacation retreat south of 
rome at that time vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the two 
discussed issues of common interest such as religious freedom and 
peace in the world with particular reference to the middle east 
chief topics for a gorbachevpope meeting the vatican official 
said would be the baltic states of latvia and lithuania where 
there are large numbers of roman catholics and the status of the 
ukrainian catholic church which is a major stumbling block to 
improved vaticanmoscow ties 
the vatican does not recognize the annexation of lithuania by the 
soviet union in 1940 and a lithuanian exile mission is accredited 
to the holy see 
the ukrainian catholic church was forcibly merged with the 
russian orthodox church under soviet dictator josef stalin in 1946 
but there is a strong underground ukrainian church and ukrainian 
faithful have been carrying out public protests seeking official 
recognition of their church 
the pope also has expressed a desire to visit the soviet union 
provided he could meet with his flock throughout the country but 
vatican officials said such a trip is not expected in the immediate 
future

today in the fatal bensonhurst racial attack authorities said 
the man 19yearold joseph serrano had been arrested on assault 
charges but he was indicted by a grand jury on murder and other 
charges said nancy young a spokeswoman for dbrooklyn istrict 
attorney elizabeth holtzman 
the additional charges were not immediately released 
indicted earlier on murder charges in the aug 23 attack were the 
suspected triggerman 18yearold joseph fama and two others keith 
mondello 18 and pasquale raucci 19 
three other young white men have been arrested for allegedly 
taking part in the attack on 16yearold yusuf hawkins but have not 
been indicted police say they expect to pick up other suspects 
hawkins was shot to death after he and three friends also black 
went to the predominantly white brooklyn neighborhood of bensonhurst 
to look at a used car and were confronted by a gang of up to 30 
whites authorities said 
meanwhile a top official for the states court system says race 
was not a factor in choosing a 70yearold black judge to hear the 
bensonhurst racial murder case 
justice thaddeus owens was selected last week by a panel of 
judges and court administrators who bypassed the normal selection 
process 
matthew t crosson chief administrator of the state court 
system said the need for an experienced judge with an ability to 
handle cases receiving a lot of publicity led the panel to choose 
owens not the fact that owens is black 
david depetris who represents fama said he might file a motion 
to block the selection not because of who was selected but because 
the way he was chosen could be a violation of his clients rights 
however albert c aronne lawyer for serrano praised the 
selection saying he had tried cases before owens and he was a 
good man and a good judge hes tough and we need someone tough who 
calls it the way he sees it

a 17yearold has been sentenced to 
eight years in prison for having sex with an 11yearold girl who 
became pregnant with twins 
it took jurors only 20 minutes thursday to find carlos johnson 
guilty of sexual battery of a child under 12 
johnson was 16 in august 1988 when he and the girl had sex at the 
walker ford community center in january the girl delivered twins 
born four months early one was stillborn the other soon died 
its true kids have sex with kids all the time but maybe once 
they see this itll stop assistant state attorney chris canova 
said 
but defense attorney greg cummings called the case a great 
injustice 
what really burns me is that the victim admits she was sexually 
active in this case we had a young girl whos not totally a 
child she knew what she was doing she and carlos had sex more than 
once voluntarily she told carlos she was 15 and she was seen 
having sex with other boys this is not the little child the statute 
was designed to protect 
but neither the jurors nor judge kevin davey agreed 
i think this business of teenagers and children having 
children is one of the biggest problems of our society along with 
the drug problem davey said 
the girl now a seventhgrader testified thursday that she and 
johnson had had sex and they had talked about it beforehand 
florida law says it doesnt matter whether a child consents 
canova had to prove only that the victim was under 12 and sexual 
intercourse occurred

president bush trying to enlist new recruits 
in his war on narcotics declared today that a nation that consumes 
as much illegal drugs as america cannot long preserve its very 
soul 
let me challenge you get involved there are so many that need 
your help bush said in a speech to a convention of the us 
hispanic chamber of commerce 
later he was to deliver another address with the same message 
before the predominantly black national baptist convention 
before an hispanic business audience that cheered his statement 
that the war on drugs can be waged without higher taxes bush struck 
back at critics who say his 79 billion strategy is underfunded and 
doesnt go far enough 
those who judge this stategy by a price tag alone dont 
understand the problem he said those critics are the same ones 
who complain they dont know how we can fund the proposal without 
higher taxes 
to some the first and only answer is to hit the working man or 
woman with more taxes bush said that is not the right answer 
discussing drug use the president said the government estimated 
that 23 million americans had used illegal drugs last year he said 
8 million americans had tried cocaine and that about 1 million used 
it at least once a week 
beyond that he said hundreds of thousands of babies were born 
to mothers who use drugs 
a nation with those numbers cannot long preserve its very 
soul he said 
bush said america must take back its streets we need more 
jails and prisons and courts and prosecutors and indeed in my 
view tougher sentences 
he called for the death penalty for the ultimate drug 
violators those that do the most to corrupt the kids in this 
country and strip them of every chance of a meaningful life im 
talking about those drug kingpins or those that kill police 
officers 
bushs trip here came amid signs that democrats are rethinking 
their strategy of attacking the drug plan 
senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden the delaware 
democrat who originally said bushs program was not tough enough 
bold enough or imaginative enough said thursday he wanted to put 
the legislation on a fast track 
bushs program seeking 716 million more than already proposed 
in his budget emphasizes a crackdown on drug users and more money 
for prisons law enforcement and treatment centers as well as more 
money to attack the problem in drugproducing countries 
white house chief of staff john sununu speaking with reporters 
en route to new orleans today said the president did not want to 
make the antidrug package it so harsh that it would suspend 
constitutional rights of citizens 
he said however he was pleased that congress seems to be 
getting into the swim of things he said the senate ought to be 
complimented for voting to cut their free mail privileges for the 
drug war 
asked whether the administration would be amenable if congress 
voted more money for the drug war than the 79 million called for 
by bush sununu said it would be difficult to do that within the 
boundaries of the budget compromise the administration has reached 
with congress 
however he said if they can find an appropriate readjustment 
of priorities in shuffling around money were not going to be 
closeminded if there are good suggestions that come from congress 
criminals in this nation must understand that if they commit a 
crime they will be caught and if caught they will be prosecuted 
and if convicted they will do time bush said wednesday in a 
speech in baltimore before the annual convention of the american 
legion 
training his fire on his critics bush said some incredibly 
say well its not enough this from the very people who oppose the 
death penalty 
its that kind of thinking thats lost too many battles 
already the president said so lets not let these critics lose 
the war

for nearly two centuries societys 
highest and mightiest flocked to this allegheny mountain resort to 
sip the natural mineral water and soak up elegance at one of 
americas oldest spas 
but the bedford springs hotel is foundering these days as its 
owners struggle to repay debts and avoid the auction block 
we have the ability to revive something historic and to spur 
the economy and that should sound like government funding would be 
available to do that said hobert hobbs 50 vice president of sky 
group international inc which owns the hotel 
unless an investor comes to the rescue the resort will be 
auctioned off sept 21 nine days before 48 million is due the 
bank the money is what was spent from a 75 million loan made in 
1987 for renovations that werent completed because of a dispute 
between owners that ended up in bankruptcy court 
local folks fear that a new owner will raze the 185yearold 
hotel or modernize it to the point that all ambience is lost 
merchants in neighboring bedford a town of about 4000 people 
brimming with antique and art shops say business already is off 20 
percent to 25 percent as a result of the hotel turmoil tourism 
accounts for about a third of the areas income according to joe 
lurie executive director of the bedford county office of economic 
development 
its like losing a big industry he said 
a few years ago nearly 200 people worked at bedford springs 
hotel a stately stretch of three and fourstory buildings on 2300 
acres in southcentral pennsylvania they tended an 18hole golf 
course tennis courts a stocked lake and hiking and riding trails 
during the maythroughoctober season 
fortyseven employees are left all but 66 of the hotels 244 
rooms are closed to guests who dine at the golf clubhouse because 
the main kitchen is shut down 
eight guest rooms were occupied on a recent weeknight leaving 
doorman joe koontz with little to do except read 
they guests ask me whats going to happen next well i dont 
know whats going to happen next said koontz 61 
bedford springs hotels troubles in part reflect those of the 
entire industry according to industry observers 
the hotel industry is in deep trouble all around the country 
big time there are 45 percent more rooms than demand in the whole 
united states its an overbuilt industry said phil goodman 
president of western media corp a marketing company in san diego 
edward watkins editor of lodging hospitality a monthly trade 
magazine estimates about 50 of the nations 45000 hotels and 
motels are oldline resorts which offer traditional types of 
recreation in a spreadout rural setting with a meal plan only a 
dozen or so are 100 years old or more 
the traditional guest they served is getting old and dying 
off he said 
the bedford springs hotel was opened in 1804 by a doctor drawn by 
the areas magnesia springs and their reputed curative powers the 
springs had been used for centuries before by indians 
the spa quickly attracted the notables of the times mrs john 
quincy adams and her daughters aaron burr and statesmen henry 
clay john c calhoun and daniel webster 
president james polk visited in 1848 followed by five other 
presidents including james buchanan who used the spa as a summer 
white house candidate ronald reagan stayed overnight in 1974 
the us supreme court met at the resort to decide a case in 
1855 the only time it ever met outside its chambers and it was 
there in 1858 that buchanan received the first transatlantic cable 
a message from englands queen victoria 
during world war ii the navy established a radio training school 
at the resort the hotel also housed japanese diplomats 
bedford springs is being considered along with state college as 
a possible summer home for the pittsburgh symphony orchestra 
hobbs and community leaders hope the orchestras interest will 
prompt the bank to grant a delay on payment of the loan 
were still confident something good is going to happen 
hobbs said was it yogi berra who said it aint over til its 
over well it aint over til its over

officials said friday they expect 
thousands of east german refugees to leave for the west within days 
from tent camps summer cabins and other makeshift lodgings where 
many have spent weeks 
one sign of an imminent diplomatic solution was the departure 
from the west german mission in east berlin with promises of help 
in attempts to emigrate of 116 east germans who had been inside 
more than a month 
an estimated 6500 east germans who fled their strict communist 
homeland are in hungary awaiting passage to west germany which 
gives east germans automatic citizenship and help in starting new 
lives more than 300 are in bonns embassy in prague capital of 
czechoslovakia 
another 6000 east germans escaped through hungary this summer to 
austria officials of the austrian red cross said friday nearly 100 
had arrived overnight apparently unwilling to wait for the mass 
migration 
flight through hungary began after its liberal communist regime 
decided in may to remove barbed wire and other barriers from the 
border with austria few east germans are allowed to visit the west 
but trips to neighboring hungary have been easy to arrange 
rezso nyers president of hungarys communist party said in 
response to questions from reporters friday the east germans would 
be able to leave in a short time 
i cant say what a short time is whether two or three days or 
a week he said when pressed for a more precise response 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister said in 
a television interview i have the deepest trust in the hungarian 
government that it will find a humanitarian solution from what 
weve heard we can expect a solution within the next few days 
wolfgang wagner a west german relief official in charge of the 
budapest camps told reporters we see light at the end of the 
tunnel 
a few days ago hungarian officials indicated the refugees might 
not leave for weeks 
hungary has appeared caught between the two germanys anxious to 
prove to bonn that it is committed to western concepts of human 
rights but worried about angering the orthodox leadership in east 
berlin 
it has a longstanding agreement with its soviet bloc ally to 
return any east germans caught trying to flee to the west 
there has been no public explanation of the delay in what would 
be the first case of an east bloc country helping citizens of 
another escape the west 
the 116 east germans left the west german mission in east berlin 
after being promised extensive legal counsel in their quest to 
leave the country mission spokesman eberhard grashoff said 
he said they were given no promises they could emigrate but left 
after talks between a senior west german official and wolfgang 
vogel an east german lawyer who often has arranged for east germans 
to leave 
in budapest east german diplomats continued efforts to woo back 
some of the thousands of young workers most of them skilled who 
fled their homeland 
dieter grahmann of the east german embassy claimed some had 
expressed interest in returning in exchange for safe jobs and 
guarantees of no reprisals but he did not give figures 
in his traileroffice outside the zugliget refugee camp grahmann 
listened to fellow east germans explaining why they had left 
the worst thing for us is that we cannot live the way we want 
to that the party always tells us what to do said a man from 
leipzig 
an angry woman cut in with who among the east german 
leadership asks whether policies are made for us the people or for 
the politicians

antiapartheid activists claimed 
friday that 29 people were killed during police action on election 
day and they produced grieving relatives to respond to government 
charges they lied about the death toll 
law and order minister adriaan vlok accused anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu and the rev allan boesak president of the world 
alliance of reformed churches of lying when they blamed police 
thursday for more than 20 deaths during antielection protests 
the two activists held a news conference in which they said the 
death toll had increased to 29 and the injuries to 200 in nine black 
and mixedrace townships around cape town weeping women described 
how police had shot their children 
the evidence points to the fact that the violence in all these 
areas was instigated by the police said boesak he called on 
acting president fw de klerk to fire vlok 
tutu called for all cape town residents to gather at st georges 
anglican cathedral next wednesday the day the new parliament 
convenes for a march into the city to express outrage at what is 
happening 
you must condemn what the police have done and you must say to 
our people you are sorry you must express your condolences to 
those who have been bereaved tutu said in a statement addressed 
to the acting president 
de klerk expected to be chosen for a fiveyear term as president 
by an electoral college thursday has yet to issue any public 
statement about the cape town violence 
vlok said in a statement that 26 policemen were injured in unrest 
late wednesday and early thursday following elections for the white 
mixedrace and indian chambers of parliament blacks are excluded 
from parliament and militant leaders of all races urged a boycott 
of the elections for the two nonwhite chambers 
vlok said boesak and tutu are deliberately misleading the world 
about the true facts surrounding the events in the western cape 
they tried to allege that innocent and peaceful persons have been 
shot dead by the police in cold blood 
evette otto and jemima miller two mixedrace women told the 
news conference that is exactly what police did 
mrs miller said her son patrick 13 was on his way to a shop 
with a friend wednesday and was two doors away from his house in 
bellville when a police van came around the corner she said people 
started running but the boys didnt think it was necessary 
police started firing mrs miller alleged and a bullet went 
through patricks head he is in unstable condition and doctors are 
unable to operate because his brain is swelling she said 
mrs otto said her 16yearold daughter five months pregnant 
was shot to death at pointblank range by a uniformed policeman as 
she stood on a street in kalksteenfontein 
mrs otto did not say she witnessed the shooting but she said 
her daughters body showed she had been shot through the chest at 
pointblank range and the ammunition had exited through her back 
tutu said he was deeply hurt that we should bring our people in 
this way to seem to be making a display of our pain just in order 
for certain people to be made to believe that what we say happened 
has in fact happened 
vlok expressed his deepest condemnation about the lies and the 
manner in which the two church leaders have attempted to make 
political gains from the unrest 
according to vlok police are aware of 15 unrest deaths in the 
cape town area wednesday night 10 of them attributed to factional 
fighting between blacks in the township of khayelitsha he said the 
other five deaths were being investigated 
cape town attorney essa moosa gave a breakdown of the 29 deaths 
which he said was based on bodies in mortuaries and hospitals moosa 
said a conservative figure for injuries was 200 
most deaths were caused by the police moosa said he 
acknowledged there had been factional fighting in khayelitsha but 
said there was reason to believe one faction came out of police 
vans 
iris jantjies a mixedrace woman told the news conference she 
had also seen policemen shooting without reason in khayelitsha 
and they had taken her 25yearold son matthew away after he was 
shot she said she did not know whether he was alive and that police 
would not tell her where he was taken

on friday st joseph county quit 
collaborating with cupid 
district court administrator david recher said he stopped 
performing 10 nofrills civil marriages because of an overburdened 
and underfunded court 
recher said he usually performs about 100 weddings a year 
prompting weary court personnel to refer to the ceremonies as the 
countys 1000ayear headache 
personnel shortages and an increasing criminal caseload have 
forced more than one lovestruck couple to cool their ardor on 
folding chairs in the courts lobby while recher attended to 
criminal cases 
from now on recher said couples will have to take their rings 
and rice to neighboring counties 
st joseph county magistrates have been performing ceremonies for 
about 20 years although state law does not require the service 
recher said his ceremonies are usually brief with the paperwork 
taking more time than the i dos 
if theyre in a really big rush i just ask them if they accept 
each other without any coercion or constraint and pronounce them 
married recher said 
ive had guys come in to get married in dirty oily tshirts 
right from work and get irritated if it takes too long because they 
want to get back to work 
the magistrate said he might resume the rites if voters on 
tuesday approve a tax increase that leads to reinstatement of a 
second fulltime magistrate

the senate finance committee agreed tentatively 
friday to slash the surtax that finances catastrophic health 
insurance for retirees and to reduce coverage for prescriptions and 
doctors fees 
the panel under pressure from older americans who dont like the 
new program is still debating whether workers and their employers 
should pay higher taxes to help buy the insurance for retirees 
i think we made major progress sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
the committee chairman told reporters after the panel worked behind 
closed doors to change the yearold program its coming on along 
in a bipartisan way 
bentsen indicated the committee may complete work on the program 
by the middle of next week although most members of the committee 
want to continue catastrophic insurance as does the bush 
administration there are indications a stiff fight to kill the 
program will be waged on the house and senate floors 
the program aimed at ensuring that retirees are not wiped out 
financially by an illness requiring longterm hospitalization was 
enacted with great fanfare as a logical expansion of medicare it 
was innovative in that the coverage would be paid for by the same 
group of citizens retirees who would reap the benefits 
now two groups of retirees are raising such a fuss about 
catastrophic insurance that major changes in the program are assured 
most of the complaints are from the 40 percent of retirees with 
the highest incomes they pay an income surtax of up to 800 a year 
to finance the program but want all taxpayers not just retirees 
to pay for catastrophic 
the second group of protesters includes federal retirees and 
others who already have catastrophic coverage through another 
government plan or a private medigap policy they say the new 
program offers them nothing 
the law requires every person eligible for medicare to pay for 
catastrophic coverage 
bentsen said the finance committee reached a consensus on these 
major points 
the income surtax which pays about twothirds the cost of 
catastrophic coverage will be reduced significantly below the cost 
of a private medigap policy the surtax rate now 15 percent of a 
retirees income tax liability over 150 will be reduced as will 
the 800 maximum annual surtax 
the flat fee paid by almost all catastrophic beneficiaries now 
4 a month will not be increased above current law 
the ceiling on the amount of doctors fees a beneficiary must 
pay out of pocket before catastrophic coverage kicks in will be 
delayed a year to 1991 and will be raised above the current 
ceiling of 1370 
the share of outofpocket outlays for prescription drugs a 
beneficiary must bear before catastrophic coverage begins will be 
raised significantly present law puts the deductible at a level 
high enough that only 27 percent of the 33 million medicare 
beneficiaries would qualify for reimbursement the finance committee 
would reduce coverage so that no more than 168 percent would 
qualify 
they will formally vote on the provisions in later committee 
meetings 
bentsen said the committee reached no consensus on whether 
retirees should be allowed to drop out of catastrophic coverage if 
they also agree to give up basic medicare part b coverage for 
doctors fees 
also bentsen said it is not clear whether the committee wants 
nonretirees to share the costs of catastrophic coverage for 
retirees 
one option under consideration would raise to 60000 the maximum 
amount of a workers earnings that are subject to the 145percent 
tax that finances basic medicare hospitalization benefits the 
present taxable limit is 48000 the levy is collected as part of 
the social security payroll tax withheld from paychecks 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine a member of 
the committee said he thinks the modifications would be acceptable 
to most senators but the furor over the financing mechanism 
illustrates the difficulty lawmakers face in passing such 
legislation he told reporters 
on balance i think it makes more difficult the enactment of 
such programs because of the inevitable and substantial feeling that 
we adopted a very good program and all weve gotten is a bunch of 
flak he said

trade between the united states and 
east germany remains at a trickle and is fraught with obstacles and 
restrictions us executives say 
but many representatives of us companies attending this 
autumns leipzig international trade fair say business ties are on 
the increase and that it is best to get an american foot in the door 
of a market that some day may mushroom 
more than 60 us companies or their european affiliates are 
represented at the eightday trade fair that ends sunday booths 
manned by us companies displayed a variety of products from grains 
to medical supplies 
tom praster a us embassy economics adviser said the major 
problem in useast german trade is the communist countrys lack of 
hard currency 
east germans prefer to barter their own products for westernmade 
goods he said 
countertrading is a big factor in many deals here youve got 
to take something in return and that is often a problem because 
its sometimes hard to find markets for some of the countertrade 
things praster told the ap 
us trade officials say formidible government bureaucracy also 
hampers larger deals 
often the products are purchased by the east german foreign 
trade office and then turned over to the end user when its time to 
service the machine they have to repeat that process praster said 
the people who are using the equipment the hospitals the 
farms or roadbuilding companies cant go directly to the 
manufacturer and ask somebody to come in and repair it 
despite the low volume of trade between the two countries most 
us businesses say their presence at the fair is important 
tom payne a marketing consultant for california raisins says he 
expects the small market for his product in east germany and eastern 
europe to grow 
were here because everybody expects change in the east bloc 
we want to get in on the ground floor 
we believe in time this market can be as good as some of the 
west european countries payne said 
although east germans do sell cheaper raisins imported from 
turkey and iran in regular grocery stores they import highquality 
california raisins to make products for export or for sale in hard 
currency stores at home payne explained 
they use them to make dresdener stollen fruit cakes which 
are exported mostly to western europe but also to the united 
states he said 
but east germany bought only 20 tons of california raisins at 
about 1400 a ton last year its only a small market so far 
its still a development project said payne

ron stetson is used to some pointed attacks 
but this week he uncovered the big sting 
a pest control expert stetson was called in to remove a 4foot 
wasps nest teeming with as many as 5000 wasps from harriet and bud 
morrisseys attic 
stetson and his technicians zapped the giant nest with five cans 
of wasp freeze which renders insects unable to fly then 
injected bug poison into the hive itself to kill the colony 
they returned the next day to haul the nest away but in the 
process it broke revealing still buzzing insects and larvae 
ive never seen anything like it said stetson who has been 
in the pest control business for 7 years i couldnt begin to 
guess how long it took to build 
stetson applied a powder that kills larvae for six months 
provided a 30day warranty and told them to call back if there was 
any more trouble 
i thought how will i know if theres any more trouble she 
asked i dont think im going to crawl up there

a rubber duck race has turned into a 
floating fundraiser because the original idea ran afoul of state 
gambling laws 
the organizers delta gamma lincoln alumnae had planned for 
people to pay to sponsor rubber ducks and for prizes to be awarded 
to the sponsors of the first fake fowls to cross the finish line 
but deputy tax commissioner roger hirsch said the star city duck 
dash set for sept 24 would have violated state law on raffles and 
lotteries 
you can race all the ducks you want but you cant gamble on 
the outcome hirsch said 
the only races nebraskans can gamble on legally are run by horses 
at licensed race tracks he said 
so hirsch and representatives of the alumnae agreed to a new 
approach to the race of 4000 rubber ducks in salt creek each duck 
will wear a band with the name and serial number of the sponsoring 
organization and a ticket number people will pay 5 to sponsor a 
duck 
after the race is concluded hirsch said some lucky person is 
going to wade into salt creek and draw the lucky duck 
we will consider the widdle band around the widdle neck of the 
widdle duck to be a ticket hirsch said

the government said friday it is expelling 
an oregon missionary the latest salvo in a 3yearold dispute that 
has included allegations american missionaries plotted to overthrow 
the government 
the order came after the missionary richard hamilton was 
interrogated friday about a recent meeting with a controversial 
kenyan bishop who accuses government officials of corruption and 
increasing authoritarianism 
immigration officer frank kwinga refused to say whether that 
meeting sparked hamiltons expulsion but said the 51yearold 
director of the east african christian mission in kenya will be 
required to go 
kwinga said hamilton and his wife jane should have left the 
country in july 1988 when their mission was deregistered he would 
not say when hamilton would be required to leave or whether the 
order also applies to his wife 
all organizations have to be registered in kenya a oneparty 
state where the hamiltons have worked 15 years among 
povertystricken peasants 
in november 1987 the hamiltons were threatened with deportation 
after the government accused them of involvement with an alleged 
plot to oust president daniel arap moi seven other american 
missionaries were deported before the plot was found to be a 
baseless story engineered by a disgruntled kenyanborn priest living 
in the united states 
a year earlier the kenyans detained two americans on hamiltons 
mission on charges they tried to import guns and radio transmitters 
one of the detained missionaries lyle hutson 63 also from 
medford had a heart attack and died in police custody 
the mission said the suspect shipment were air rifles and pistols 
and that the radios were needed for communication 
mrs hamilton in a telephone interview from her home in western 
kitale town said her husband is being used as a scapegoat in the 
dispute 
she said their work permits were invalidated when the mission was 
deregistered but that they received verbal assurances from 
officials they could continue their development work in the arid 
west pokot region while authorities considered an appeal of the ban 
we assumed we were okay said mrs hamilton 
however hamilton on thursday night was ordered to accompany 
criminal investigators to nairobi 
mrs hamilton said her husband spent friday being interrogated by 
officers who asked him repeatedly about a sept 1 meeting with 
bishop alexander muge who repeatedly has criticized mois 
government 
she said their mission was banned last year after a local 
official who believed them involved with his political enemies 
complained to authorities their organization somehow was involved in 
muges claims that people were starving in west pokot the charges 
embarrassed the government 
the meeting sept 1 was to discuss whether muges church would 
act as an umbrella organization under which the hamilton mission 
could be reregistered mrs hamilton said 
she said the couple did not know muge prior to the meeting

attorney general dick thornburgh told skeptical 
lawmakers friday that modeling the justice departments organized 
crime strike forces after antidrug units under the control of 
local us attorneys will put more heat on the mob 
thornburgh said his plan to reorganize the 14 organizedcrime 
strike forces would end bureaucratic turf wars that have hurt 
coordination of federal law enforcement 
to end the turf battles is at the very heart of what the 
president has directed this attorney general to do thornburgh 
told a joint hearing of the senate judiciary and governmental 
affairs committees 
you cant have turf battles when you have only one turf the 
attorney general said 
but thornburgh faced tough questioning about the plan from 
senators mostly democrats who argued that placing the strike 
forces under us attorneys would dilute the justice departments 
commitment to fighting the mob 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said plan will send a clear 
message to the criminal syndicates that the heat is off 
kennedy argued that thornburgh was reorganizing the strike forces 
merely to assuage the egos of us attorneys uneasy about 
justice department lawyers working down the street but not 
accountable to them 
isnt that what this is really about kennedy asked 
thornburgh who was once us attorney in pittsburgh 
its about the uneasiness of an attorney general who doesnt 
feel the best management model is in place thornburgh replied 
thornburgh at one point conceded that local us attorneys 
unwilling to carry out the organizedcrime mission could hurt the 
program 
but the attorney general said he had powers of persuasion to 
exert to remove us attorneys who are not up to snuff 
i believe i have the confidence of the us attorneys i 
believe we are dedicated to the same goal 
the attorney general said the reorganization is designed to deal 
with the changing nature of organized crime since the strike forces 
were set up in 1967 
the traditional mafiastyle crime families have been joined by 
international drug cartels street gangs jamaican posses and other 
organizations he said 
strike force offices have been slow to pick up on these 
emerging groups the attorney general said 
the 13 organized crime drug enforcement task forces set up during 
the reagan administration is the model for this consolidation 
thornburgh said 
the task forces headed by us attorneys were praised this week 
in president bushs drug strategy as a model in interagency 
coordination 
it is significant i believe that this model has been utilized 
to attack our no 1 crime problem drugs rather than the 
independent and separate strike force model thornburgh told the 
lawmakers 
transportation secretary samuel skinner a former us attorney 
in chicago supported the plan saying we will not take the heat 
off organized crime we will increase the heat on organized crime 
but philip b heymann a harvard university law professor who 
headed the justice departments criminal division during the carter 
administration objected to the plan likening it to disassembling 
a racing car and replacing it with an edsel 
thornburgh is barred from doing anything until oct 1 by an 
appropriations bill rider enacted last june that forbids any justice 
department reorganization during the fiscal year which ends sept 
30 
some lawmakers have threatened to extend the ban if thornburgh 
does not agreed to abide by occasional objections to reorganization 
plans a proposition the attorney general rejects 
but sen sam nunn dga an outspoken opponent of the plan 
seemed to signal he wouldnt support a move in congress to block its 
implementation before thornburgh left nunn told the attorney 
general that his permanent investigations subcommittee would closely 
monitor the reorganized strike forces 
nunn who had denounced the proposal when thornburgh unveiled it 
last spring said at the hearing this is the first time i can 
remember that government officials seem determined to reform a 
program that everyone agrees is a tremendous success 
sen strom thurmond rsc who had initially urged thornburgh 
not to merge the strike forces said he now supports the plan 
adding congress should not be in the business of micromanaging 
the department of justice

the christian government of gen michel 
aoun urged the united states on friday to bring back its diplomats 
calling their evacuation a misguided reaction to rumors they were in 
danger 
the cabinet expresses its regret because the us 
administration based its decision on illusions rumors and erroneous 
information a statement from aouns threeman christian cabinet 
said 
it called on the united states to reconsider the pulling out of 
its diplomats from lebanon in order to preserve bilateral 
relations 
the statement appeared to mark a partial backing down by aoun in 
his war of words with washington although it was unclear to what 
extent this might be because it was issued by the cabinet rather 
than aoun in person 
aouns cabinet is one of two vying for power in lebanon 
earlier in the week aoun said us ambassador john mccarthy 
would only be welcomed back if he presented his credentials to the 
christian cabinet and recognized it as the legitimate government 
that demand was not reiterated in the new statement 
mccarthy arrived in lebanon a year ago and did not present his 
credentials in an obvious effort to avoid recognizing either the 
christian or moslem governments 
also friday the wife of missing briton jack mann one of 16 
westerners held hostage in lebanon said she had been told he died 
and that she believed the report mann disappeared may 12 as he 
drove to a bank in syrianpoliced moslem west beirut 
a police spokesman meanwhile said mortar and tankcannon 
clashes between syrianallied forces and christian troops raged 
around the douar hills which command one of the main routes leading 
to the beleaguered christian enclave northeast of beirut 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations said 
no casualties were reported from the fighting mainly because it did 
not target populated areas 
by police count at least 830 people have been killed and 2462 
wounded since the latest round of fighting broke out march 8 
the cabinets statement was issued after a twohour meeting at 
the bunker under the bombravaged presidential palace in suburban 
baabda east of beirut 
a reliable christian source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said aoun considers the us evacuation a move directed against 
his rule 
the diplomats were evacuated wednesday a few hours after proaoun 
christian youths besieged the embassy compound in beiruts northern 
suburb of aukar 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads the syrianbacked 
moslem cabinet vying for power with aouns expressed regret 
over the pullout in a statement broadcast by the moslem voice of the 
nation radio 
us state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler on thursday 
said the evacuation was motivated by what she called a threat by 
aoun to take americans hostage 
in an interview published sept 1 in the french daily figaro 
aoun was asked whether the united states was putting pressure on 
france not to aid him 
he replied they put pressure on everyone and claim in addition 
to have so acted because they have hostages being held in 
lebanon 
as if the war were being waged without hostages or victims if 
i understand well it would be enough that tomorrow i take 20 
americans hostage so that the united states stops putting pressure 
on my friends aoun added 
aoun speaking at a news conference thursday said the evacuation 
was based on hearsay from reporters and false interpretations of 
newspapers such as the french newspaper figaro 
an aide to aoun speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
generals remark to figaro is in no way a threat 
the general was simply implying that the american 
administration is obsessed with the hostage issue the aide said 
there are 16 westerners held hostage in lebanon mainly by 
proiranian shiite moslem factions eight are americans the hostage 
held longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
none of lebanons kidnap groups has specifically identified mann 
75 as a hostage but a previously unknown faction the cells of 
armed struggle claimed that it kidnapped an unidentified briton in 
beirut the day mann disappeared 
manns wife sunny said she received a telephone call monday 
from an unidentified man who told her i have bad news about your 
husband 
she said she later met the man at a shop in west beiruts hamra 
commercial thoroughfare and he told me that jack is dead she 
said the report seems correct

a 22bed hospital 350000 in debt has 
closed and the nearest emergency medical care for residents of 
impoverished tunica county is 36 miles away 
that hospital is not a luxury its an absolute necessity given 
the demography in that county said marilyn farray a lawyer for 
several indigent residents who fought to keep tunica county hospital 
open 
we may be able to gauge it in the loss of lives farray said 
tunica county hospital probably will reopen but therell be blood 
on the floor 
a shortage of emergencyroom physicians hastened the decision to 
surrender the hospitals license and close thursday said tharon 
lee president of tunica county hospital inc which has operated 
the countyowned hospital since june 1986 
the hospital had treated few patients other than in the emergency 
room since april when the two physicians then living in the county 
one of the poorest in the country resigned from the staff and 
stopped admitting people 
the board of supervisors of the county of about 10000 people 
will meet soon to discuss its options said board president paul 
battle he said he expects the board to terminate its contract with 
the nonprofit hospital corporation 
we dont have any choice battle said 
the board then would be free to review proposals submitted by 
others to manage the hospital said jim cox the boards special 
counsel 
lee however said he informed the state department of health on 
wednesday that the corporation will try to get its license back when 
physicians become insured for emergency care or when an outside 
party provides funding 
it would take a john d rockefeller to run just the ambulance 
service and emergency room lee said but he said four or five 
parties are interested 
lee estimated the hospitals debt at 350000 which accumulated 
as patients in the county had trouble paying their bills and doctors 
stopped sending patients there fearing the quality of care had 
dropped 
when it becomes common knowledge you have financial problems 
every vendor thats involved gets nervous lee said 
cox said the hospital corporation not the county is responsible 
for that debt 
the county has a year to get the hospital reopened said steve 
egger branch manager with the health departments licensure and 
certification division 
it will have to start from scratch again like a new hospital 
coming into the program egger said 
the county has taken over the hospitals ambulance service 
emergency calls are being routed to nursing director billie 
russells home patients usually are taken 36 miles south to 
clarksdale or 40 miles northeast to memphis tenn 
were trying as hard as we can to set up some sort of emergency 
service center russell said 
battle is confident the hospital will reopen 
you can rest assured well have a hospital and an ambulance 
service battle said

the state department responded favorably friday 
to a cuban government statement that the last of the remaining cuban 
troops in ethiopia will be withdrawn starting on saturday 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler estimated the cuban presence there 
at between 2500 and 3500 and said their withdrawal would be 
significant and positive 
cuba dispatched more than 12000 forces to ethiopia in 1977 to 
help the marxist government put down a crossborder incursion from 
somalia the dispute centered on conflicting claims to the ogaden 
region of ethiopia 
the cuban action soured what had been a promising start toward a 
more normal relationship between the united states and cuba 
the two countries opened diplomatic missions in each others 
capital in september 1977 but with the dispatch of the troops to 
ethiopia progress toward improved relations was halted 
ms tutwiler refused to speculate on what a complete withdrawal 
of cuban forces from ethiopia would mean for uscuban relations 
late last year cuba agreed to withdraw its forces from angola over 
a 27month time frame and has pulled out a significant number of 
troops since then 
on a related subject ms tutwiler said the administration was 
encouraged by the start of peace talks in atlanta between 
representatives of the ethiopian government and a rebel group which 
has been seeking independence for the northern territory of eritrea 
the talks were arranged by former president carter 
we hope that the discussions that have begin in atlanta will 
lead to a just and durable settlement on terms acceptable to both 
sides ms tutwiler said

one half of the world cannot understand the 
pleasures of the other jane austen wrote in the village where she 
spent her last years her brothers descendants are living those 
words 175 years later squabbling over a house she loved 
the writer was a keen observer of families misunderstandings and 
money and the tiff has thrown a bit of vintage austen into the 
peaceful world of her devotees one austen scholar said she would 
have been amused 
on one side is richard knight president of the 1200member jane 
austen society and owner of the 50room chawton house inherited by 
janes brother from the knight family who had adopted him 
richard knight plans to offer chawton house where he was born 
for sale next week on a leasehold of up to 90 years the british 
system of leasehold permits the sale of property for a specified 
amount of time after which it reverts to the original owner 
henry rice a distant relative and his supporters had hoped to 
make the house in the village of chawton into the worlds first 
research center on the author of emma and pride and 
prejudice 
they have raised nearly 15 million to buy the house which miss 
austen visited from her nearby chawton cottage but they say knight 
refused to consider the offer 
rice and his friends hope to collect 62 million more for 
repairs and other work but cannot meet knights price for the house 
of 23 million 
we were very disappointed said rice a retired farmer who is 
the greatgreatgreat grandson of the authors niece and chairman of 
the jane austen center trust formed to set up the research center 
we had hoped particularly as hes president of the jane austen 
society he would give serious thought to our offer rice said in 
a telephone interview 
knight says he wants to keep the house in the family and does not 
mind the idea of the center but must must sell because he cannot 
afford the upkeep he said rices group did not make the offer until 
after the june 30 deadline he set 
i have to bear two things in mind he told the associated 
press i want to help jane austen and on the other hand i have 
to look after my house and my family 
chawton cottage which jane austens brother edward gave her 
after inheriting it from the knights is a museum run by a private 
trust not connected with the family the trust refused comment on 
the affair 
she lived in the cottage for most of the six years before her 
death in 1817 at age 42 there she either wrote or rewrote her 
major novels which combine witty insights into human nature and 
family life with social criticism and satire that sometimes is sharp 
some contemporaries criticized her work as limited but the 
oxford companion to english literature says she has been venerated 
since 1870 
she was a ministers daughter the sixth of seven children and 
the companion says her life is notable for its lack of events 
it notes that she never married and traveled little 
most of her life was spent in hampshire the county southwest of 
london where chawton is situated 
brian southam an expert on her work and a member of the jane 
austen center trust said he thought she would be entertained by the 
ruckus 
she would be amused because she was amused by all sorts of 
mercenary matters and doubly amused because it looks like a 
difference in the family he said 
rice also saw irony in the situation but said he thought it 
would sadden miss austen as it did him 
i think shed be disappointed to see her brothers descendents 
scrapping over the last piece of inheritance he said but then 
managed a laugh and added maybe shed write a good short story on 
the matter

a scuba diver who said he was sucked 
1650 feet through a pipe at the st lucie nuclear power plant has 
settled his lawsuit against florida power and light co 
both parties jointly filed a stipulation that the case be 
dismissed with prejudice which means lamm cannot refile robin 
blanton an attorney for the utility said 
the parties agreed not to discuss terms of the settlement 
but the diver bill lamm of vero beach said thursday that 
attorneys had told him he had a difficult case because he didnt 
suffer damages 
almost everyone said that if i could get 5000 or 10000 i 
should grab it but he added that the settlement was nowhere 
near that amount 
several weeks after lamms ordeal the utility announced 
structural problems with the concrete slabs that cover the mouths of

slabs creating a whirlpool at the mouth of the pipes

the lawyer representing purported colombian 
cocaine cartel moneylaunderer eduardo martinez romero is no 
stranger to publicity in fact it appears to seek him out 
ed garland 48 said he was contacted by martinezs family while 
martinez was on his way to atlanta from colombia this week aboard a 
drug enforcement agency plane apparently garland said a lawyer 
friend of his in miami made the referral 
im just a defense lawyer and ive been practicing law here 
for 25 years he said thursday i had no prior contact with 
him 
garland was at martinezs side when the colombian appeared 
thursday before a us magistrate to answer charges of 
moneylaundering and conspiracy to defraud the government martinez 
is accused of being the finance minister of the medellin cocaine 
cartel allegedly the largest cocaine distribution group in the 
world 
after the hearing garland wasted no time in setting the stage 
for his defense of martinez if he takes the case for the duration 
i think it will be extremely difficult for him to get a fair 
trial garland said my understanding is that he wasnt afforded 
any judicial process he was just picked up and brought here 
over the years garland has represented numerous people charged 
with drug offenses ranging from former atlanta falcons running back 
and broadcaster harmon wages to john paul sr and john paul jr a 
worldclass auto racing team accused of conspiring to smuggle 
marijuana 
a few years ago garland was convicted of criminal contempt in 
albany after telling a newspaper reporter outside the courtroom 
that a judge was holding a sham proceeding against his client 
that cost him 500 but the conviction was eventually overturned by 
the georgia supreme court 
garland who attended law school at the university of georgia 
told an interviewer in 1982 that he doesnt mind taking on the 
government 
my belief is if its just me against the us government its 
a fair fight he said the system is balanced in favor of the 
state and against the accused 
famed defense lawyer f lee bailey once said garland was in the 
top 25 criminal defense attorneys in the nation 
although many of his clients have been connected to drug money 
garland says he doesnt accept fees tainted by drugs if he knows 
about it 
you have to be concerned that you are not dealing with drug 
money or money thats been tainted he said thursday there are 
very set ethical rules on that and i observe those rules

a federal appeals court friday awarded 861600 
in attorneys fees to former justice department official theodore 
olson who was the focus of an independent counsels investigation 
in an environmental protection agency case 
olson had sought 125 million for his lawyers who successfully 
defended him in a probe that began in january 1986 with a 
preliminary investigation by the justice department 
independent counsel alexia morrison investigated olson from april 
1986 until last year to determine whether the former assistant 
attorney general had testified falsely or obstructed congress in 
1983 when a congressional panel was seeking documents in the epa 
controversy 
in awarding less than requested an appeals court panel that 
appoints independent counsels said the law firm of jenner amp block 
billed olson at its premium rate but should have billed him at its 
normal rate that is some 5 to 20 an hour lower the court also 
disallowed nearly 100000 in requested fees for items such as the 
preliminary probe by the justice department and the preparation of 
the fee application to the court 
morrison concluded the justice department may have obstructed 
congressional inquiries by withholding documents about the 
toxicwaste cleanup superfund but that there was no evidence olson 
was a participant in any such obstruction

the great montana centennial cattle drive 
a raucous remembrance of american frontier settlers ambles through 
city streets to its last roundup at the billings stockyards saturday 
after herding 2700 bawling longhorns across the prairie 
the procession with 100 drovers tending the herd and 200 
covered wagons and 3000 dusty riders trailing behind headed 
toward its final camp friday many participants in the sixday 
60mile drive believed they were making history as part of the 
wests last great cattle drive 
id hoped to see a few more cows and not so many people said 
janet kuni of garden grove calif but this still kind of choked 
me up a little bit im never going to see anything like tonight 
ever again 
the drive the biggest spectacle in montanas celebration of its 
birthday as a state commemorates the great cattle drives of the 
last century which began when nelson story brought the first herd 
of texas longhorns to montana in 1866 
mike story nelson storys greatgreatgrandson still ranches in 
montana near yellowstone national park and was among the drovers 
heading the procession 
but the drives end will bear no resemblance to nelson storys 
arrival in unsettled montana 
at least some of the wagons and cattle will parade through 
billings streets on their way to the public auctions yards heading 
down three lanes of a sixlane thoroughfare 
the journey started monday on the banks of the musselshell river 
in roundup the drive enjoying early fall weather of warm days and 
brisk nights rolled south on us 87 through the bull mountains 
then on the prairie 
the pace of the drive was brisk until thursday when wagons 
spread out across the plain as many as 20000 people took advantage 
of the only opportunity to see the drive actually crossing the 
prairie and 5000 had to be turned away from a thursday night 
country music concert for lack of parking authorities said 
red paint in the dirt marked the rows where cars and buses could 
stop and watch the fivemile long train of cattle and wagons a 
milelong plume of dust rose from the wagon train on the sunny fall 
day later creating a glowing sunset over the bull mountains 
this is great said bill toothman who traveled with his wife 
violet from west virginia to see the cattle drive we saw it on 
the today show and knew we had to be here so far its been 
everything wed hoped for

soldiers fatally shot a 13yearold palestinian 
during a stonethrowing protest friday and three arabs suspected of 
collaborating with israeli authorities were found dead in the 
occupied territories 
the army said it had arrested four arabs in the slaying of one of 
the alleged collaborators 
also friday a syrianbacked palestinian faction claimed 
responsibility for firing rockets across the jordanian border into 
israel a day earlier 
in the gaza strip town of khan yunis troops clashed with 
stonethrowers and akran zaki hamdan 13 was killed the army and 
hospital officials said 
hamdans death brought to 560 the number of palestinians killed 
by israeli soldiers or civilians since the start of the uprising 
against israeli occupation nearly 21 months ago thirtynine 
israelis have been killed 
the deaths of the suspected collaborators raised to 110 the 
number of palestinians killed by fellow arabs most have been 
accused of collaboration 
the slayings came despite an appeal by underground uprising 
leaders in their latest leaflet they asked palestinian activists 
not to be too quick to kill suspected collaborators 
cocern about security on the usually quiet israeljordan border 
rose this week following the rocket attack thursday and a guerrilla 
attack five days earlier in which two israeli soldiers were killed 
israel radios and newspapers said military officials believed 
syria was behind both attacks 
the first attack was claimed by the syrianbased taalat yakoub 
faction of the palestine liberation front the rocket attack was 
claimed friday in damascus by the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine headed by george habash 
zeev schiff a military analyst for the haaretz daily said syria 
may be using the border attacks to punish jordans king hussein for 
allowing iraq to move weapons through jordan to christian forces in 
lebanon the christians are battling syrias army 
schiff also said the syrians are trying to stir up trouble 
between israel and jordan 
in the occupied territories friday 14 palestinians were shot and 
wounded in stonethrowing clashes with israeli troops including an 
11yearold boy hit with a bullet in the head in the west bank 
village of tubas arab reports said 
the army announced a raid on the village of beit dajan also in 
the occupied west bank and said a great number of palestinians 
were arrested when israel used helicopters to block suspects from 
fleeing into surrounding hills 
the army said last month it would begin using helicopters in 
village raids aimed at rounding up activists in the uprising 
late friday 30yearold ahmed izat imran was found beaten and 
stabbed to death under a tree near the village of rujeib in the west 
bank arab sources said 
imran reportedly was abducted from his car thursday night by 
masked youths a search was launched by relatives who later found 
the body reports said 
in the occupied gaza strip the two alleged collaborators who 
were killed were identified as niman abu hilal 30 who was fatally 
beaten at his home in rafah by masked youths and jasser al krinawi 
24 whose body was found stuffed in a well in the magazi refugee 
camp 
the army said four arabs were taken into custody in connection 
with the krinawi case

at bethesda naval hospital after complaining of discomfort doctors 
found no evidence of malignancy 
sept 7 1983 reagan having grown noticeably hard of hearing 
was seen wearing a small hearing aid in his right ear when he 
appeared before a group of business and education leaders he has 
attributed his hearing loss to the firing of a handgun too near his 
ear on a movie set many years ago reagan later began wearing a 
hearing aid in the left ear as well 
may 18 1984 a small polyp was discovered in the presidents 
colon but an examination showed the polyp was noncancerous and it 
was not removed 
march 11 1985 the white house disclosed that doctors examining 
reagan earlier that month found evidence of blood in his stool and a 
growth in his lower intestine a statement said tests of occult or 
hidden blood in the feces were positive but that physicians 
believe this may be from the polyp or from diet and will be 
monitored 
march 29 1985 reagan suffered a burst blood vessel in his left 
eye causing it to fill partially with blood and appear red white 
house spokesman larry speakes said no treatment was needed

said the cancer had not spread beyond the tissues that were removed 
aug 1 1985 the white house responding to questions said an 
irritated patch of skin had been removed from reagans nose two days 
earlier a statement said the tissue was submitted for routine 
studies for infection and it was determined no further treatment is 
necessary four days later he told a news conference that the 
pimple had been skin cancer 
jan 17 1986 reagan had three small polyps removed from his 
intestine during a sixhour visit to bethesda in his first major 
post cancer colonoscopy checkup they were described as very 
small measuring 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters in size 
a shaving of facial tissue from a growth on the right side of 
reagans face was also taken lab tests showed that the three polyps 
and facial tissue were benign 
june 21 1986 in a fivehour visit to bethesda reagan had two 
small polyps removed from his colon the growths ranging in size 
from 1 millimeter to 15 millimeters were benign

examination of his nose from which he has had two small skin 
cancers removed 
jan 4 1987 reagan had four benign polyps removed from his 
colon by doctors at bethesda and the presidents physician army 
col john hutton said tests show no evidence of a recurrence of 
the cancer found in july 1985 
jan 5 1987 reagan underwent successful prostate surgery the 
surgery which removed nearly an ounce of tissue was to relieve 
what a spokesman called mild recurring discomfort apparently 
due to an enlarged prostate a gland surrounding the urethra at the 
base of the bladder 
june 26 1987 reagan had two small polyps removed from his 
colon during an examination in the physicians office in the white 
house they were found to be benign dr hutton said a routine 
prostate exam was also performed as a followup to the presidents 
january surgery and it was found to be entirely normal 
jan 7 1989 reagan underwent surgery on his left ring finger 
to correct a curvature known as dupuytrens contracture a common 
but deforming condition that caused his finger to fold inward 
july 4 1989 reagan an accomplished rider was thrown from a 
horse while visiting a mexican ranch near cananea about 30 miles

a 19yearold reputed gang leader who pleaded 
guilty to car theft and robbery has been sentenced to go to school 
instead of jail 
the alternative sentence a suffolk superior court judge imposed 
thursday infuriated prosecutors who said it would send the wrong 
message to innercity gangs but a defense lawyer said it would give 
the defendant who dropped out of school in 10th grade a chance to 
turn his life around 
judge cortland a mathers warned christopher chaney that if he 
does not finish high school and go on to junior college hold a job 
after school and stay out of trouble for five years he will be sent 
to prison for four years 
if you slip up you will go to concord state prison the 
judge said you would get absolutely no consideration from me if 
you come in here before me again 
police said chaney was secondincommand of the humboldt street 
gang one of the toughest groups in the citys crimeinfested 
roxbury section chaney pleaded guilty to six charges of robbery 
car theft and receiving a stolen car at the time of the crimes he 
was on probation for assault with a deadly weapon and receiving 
stolen property police said 
in my opinion this was the wrong person to give a break to he 
committed six crimes in six months said assistant district 
attorney daniel conley 
the prosecution had recommended chaney receive a 20year prison 
sentence and serve two years mathers gave chaney a choice of 
serving two years or accepting his proposal 
that was a sentence i think the judge is trying to be 
innovative but i dont think hes being realistic said first 
assistant district attorney paul leary 
i think that the sentence imposed sends out the wrong message 
to the decent people in the community who are being terrorized by 
these gang members leary added 
chaneys courtappointed lawyer marjory german argued that 
chaney if given a chance could become a role model for other young 
black men 
we have heard from police and prosecutors that the only way to 
deal with these young black men is to lock them up ms german 
said the black community is tired of this tired of having young 
black males taken away from them 
the only way out of this vicious cycle for the community for 
all of us is in education we know that locking up young black men 
has not worked weve known that for years it breaks up families 
she said 
deborah a ramirez a professor at northeastern law school in 
boston said alternative sentences are becoming increasingly common 
for people who have no prior criminal records did not commit 
violent crimes and are lowlevel drug users and victims rather 
than dealers and kingpins 
but she said chaney did not fit those categories and would almost 
certainly have received a jail term if he had been prosecuted in 
federal rather than state court

the 35 signers of the 1975 helsinki 
agreements on european security have agreed in principle to the 
first exchange of information about their military programs a us 
representative said friday 
john j maresca added however that nato and the warsaw pact 
still disagreed on whether naval and air forces should be included 
maresca is chief us delegate to the 35nation talks on enhancing 
security in europe 
i believe that these negotiations are now well positioned to 
move forward he told fellow negotiators at the beginning of the 
third round of talks however we must be realistic 
the common ground which has emerged over the first two rounds 
can only lead to an early positive conclusion if proposals which are 
unlikely to attract consensus are put aside this will undoubtedly 
be the most difficult task before us he said 
a copy of his speech was made available to the associated press 
soviet negotiators insist that naval and air forces be included 
but nato says they never were meant to be part of the negotiations 
and would further complicate an already complex task 
nobody can conduct a war in europe with naval forces war 
can take place only on land maresca told a news conference after 
the closed negotiating session 
maresca said de facto agreement has been reached in some areas at 
the talks which involve the 16 members of the north atlantic treaty 
organization the sevennation warsaw pact and 12 countries that are 
neutral or profess nonalignment 
running parallel in vienna are natowarsaw pact negotiations on 
reducing conventional forces in europe which resumed thursday 
the principle of a regular exchange of information has now i 
believe been broadly accepted but still to be worked out are how 
to set up a data bank and what information to share on troop 
deployments weapons procurement and other military subjects 
maresca told the reporters 
a breakthrough has been made with acceptance in principle that 
there should be such an exchange he said this represents an 
important step forward which can only have a positive effect on the 
range of arms control talks currently under way 
nato suggested such an exchange at negotiations in early june 
maresca said there also appeared to be agreement in principle for 
a seminar on military policies which he described as the first 
multilateral governmenttogovernment exchange on military policies 
ever held

launch a 10year un program to end illiteracy a handicap 
affecting onefourth of the worlds people 
at un headquarters she joined families from dozens of nations 
celebrating international literacy day and looking ahead to 1990 
designated international literacy year by the general assembly 
mrs bush bantered with rex and rita saurus the dinosaur 
puppet mascots of the read americawin america foundation used to 
encourage family reading

when they visited her and president bush during their recent 
vacation in kennebunkport maine 
we all read together all 11 of them and they read to each 
other she told the bugeyed orange puppet 
since 1980 mrs bush has been an active advocate of reading 
programs traveling extensively to support their efforts 
ninetyeight percent of illiteracy is found in third world 
nations but even in developed countries more than 100 million 
children of primary school age do not go to school 
in highly industrialized countries about 10 percent of adults 
are functional illiterates unable to cope in complex society 
particularly when technological change forces them out of unskilled 
jobs 
according to the un educational scientific and cultural 
organization africa has the highest rate of adult illiteracy at 54 
percent followed by 36 percent in asia and 17 percent in latin 
america

the chief regulator of national banks proposed 
a new capital rule friday that he says will discourage banks from 
making risky investments but a rival regulator accused him of 
trying to weaken the standard for most banks 
comptroller of the currency robert l clarke whose agency 
regulates about 4000 federallychartered banks proposed a 3 
percent minimum capital standard or leverage ratio as part of a 
larger riskbased capital rule that takes effect at the end of 1990 
capital put at risk by bank and sampl owners acts as a buffer 
absorbing an institutions losses before federal deposit insurance 
kicks in one of the key reforms in savings and loan legislation 
enacted last month was an increase in sampls required capital levels 
current rules require commerical banks to hold 6 percent capital 
against their loans and other investments however under new rules 
taking effect dec 31 1990 banks will have to work up to 8 percent 
capital 
but they wont have to have hold any capital against such nearly 
riskless assets as cash and government securities and they will get 
a break on capital for investing in residential mortgages 
to prevent banks from using the riskadjustments to severely 
reduce their overall capital clarke on friday proposed a 3 percent 
minimum standard or leverage ratio 
however federal deposit insurance corp chairman l william 
seidman whose agency insures bank and sampl deposits is pushing for 
a 6 percent leverage ratio as a floor beneath the 8 percent 
riskbased standard 
seidman speaking to a group of lawyers and accountants said 
weak standards helped cause the savings and loan crisis and clarkes 
proposal would in effect weaken the standard for 90 percent of the 
nations banks 
its rather clear in my mind that changing standards to 
reduce capital did not work out well in the last experiment when we 
tried it seidman said referring to a regulatory decision in the 
early 1980s to reduce sampls capital 
however clarke maintained his proposal was stricter than current 
rules and said setting the leverage ratio too high would negate the 
riskadjusted standard removing the incentive banks have to move 
into less speculative investments 
he told reporters at a briefing that his position is supported by 
both the treasury department and the federal reserve board which 
regulates bank holding companies 
under the comptrollers proposal about 800 of 13500 state and 
federal banks nationally will have to raise capital or restructure 
their portfolios compared with 475 that are short now clarke 
estimated more than 1000 would fall short under seidmans proposal 
the three bank regulators the comptroller the fed and the fdic 
have traditionally coordinated their capital policies clarke said 
a common standard is desirable but he was not committed to 
achieving an agreement before adopting rules for national banks 
probably by the end of the year 
that raises the possibility that stricter rules would apply to 
statechartered banks whose primary regulator is the fdic putting 
the state banks at a competitive disadvantage 
the debate among banking regulators is further complicated by the 
new sampl law requiring that sampl capital standards be no less 
stringent than bank standards 
sampl regulators estimate that about 1400 of 2700 solvent thrift 
institutions would fail a 6 percent leverage ratio while only 600 
would miss a 3 percent standard

two masked bandits apparently got away with 
nothing more than a certified mail pickup in a holdup in which an 
armored car guard was slain and two other men were wounded 
authorities said friday 
police and the fbi continued hunting for the robbers who fled on 
10speed bicycles following thursdays robbery at bank of americas 
world headquarters 
the mail consisted of paperwork possibly some negotiable bonds 
and possibly a small amount of currency said police spokesman 
dave ambrose its not a major loss 
this was not a classic armored car robbery said fbi 
spokesman chuck latting everything i see after 20 years as an 
agent says they made a grave mistake 
if caught and convicted of murder the two men could receive the 
death penalty 
the bandits confronted and shot brinks inc guards joseph 
arriola 53 and clifford spencer 24 after they had made their 
delivery thursday morning to a bank on the lower level of the 
52story building according to ambrose 
arriola and spencer were shot in the head at very close range 
beyond the view of a video camera facing the bank lobby robert gee 
a 57yearold san franciscan was shot in the mouth as he tried to 
help the felled guards arriola died 
the robbers described as two white men with muscular builds 
escaped into the citys crowded financial district on bicycles 
which police recovered about 10 blocks away five hours later 
some investigators who had said the heist had been well planned 
and well orchestrated said friday they were puzzled by the attack 
that apparently netted so little 
latting pointed out that the bandits confronted the guards after 
they delivered money to the bank targeted a bank in the heart of 
the citys chronically congested financial district and could not 
have carried a large amount of cash away on bicycles 
all that doesnt add up he said adding that authorities are 
considering all potential motives 
brinks has offered a 100000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of the suspects 
spencer was in serious but stable condition friday at san 
francisco general hospital said hospital spokeswoman gloria 
rodriguez the guard underwent surgery for paralysis to his left 
side but rodriguez did not know if it had succeeded 
gee was in good condition with a fractured tooth and a cut 
tongue the spokeswoman said

will have to parade around palatka for four consecutive saturdays 
wearing placards proclaiming their crime 
it is a felony punishable by five years in prison andor a 
5000 fine to molest crab pots the signs say i know because i 
molested one 
stephen michael kittredge a 23yearold insurance salesman from 
jacsonville was one of four men caught raiding traps in the st 
johns river 
too much beer and too little common sense were to blame he said 
it was memorial day weekend we were just a bunch of guys 
having a good old time he said we were probably a little bit 
drunk we were wrong we readily admit we were very wrong 
kittredge john shiver snelling 24 gregory coleman dyer 24 
and david todd harris 23 avoided criminal prosecution by agreeing 
to prosecutors demands that they march with the placards 
the signs must be on poster boardsize placards and readable from 
100 feet 
but the fisherman who lost about 25 crabs said the punishment is 
not enough for his loss 
im still so mad i could slap one of them and not flinch 
said robert scholl who has been crabbing for 17 years 
each of the four men also must pay scholl five times the cost of 
the damage to the traps and the lost crabs the amount has not been 
determined 
the punishment reminiscent of the scarlet a adulterer 
hester prynne had to wear in nathaniel hawthornes novel the 
scarlet letter was concocted by state attorney john tanner it 
was accepted by the men in a deferred prosecution agreement that 
does not need the victims approval

new jersey must bow to the laws of love a 
federal judge ruled friday in striking down a state rule forbidding 
marriage between police officers and municipal court clerks working 
in the same town 
in sweeping language us district judge nicholas h politan 
gave his blessing to the union of joseph and marie hughes of north 
arlington hughes a detective is an 18year veteran of the town 
police force he met mrs hughes a municipal court clerk since 
1981 in the courts hallways 
they married in july 1988 and informed state court 
administrators who told them one would have to resign the couple 
sued and were allowed to remain in their jobs pending a court 
decision 
the rule was designed to prevent a conflict of interest but 
politan rejected that justification 
no law regardless of intent should have a chilling effect 
upon marriage the judge wrote in his opinion the court should 
encourage legitimate marriage not discourage it 
such broad brush regulations suggest mechanical 
computerlike answers to human problems of constitutional 
dimensions 
mrs hughes said more than 10 couples with similar problems 
across new jersey had contacted her about the case 
its going to make a lot of people out there happy she said 
at the courthouse after picking up the opinion with her lawyers she 
said she knew of clerks who had resigned or taken demotions over the 
law 
dorothy crissey president of the state municipal court clerks 
association said the group supported the couples fight new jersey 
has about 1000 municipal clerks and deputy clerks 
you have an awful lot of people who have met and fallen in love 
and have not been able to a lead a normal life she said 
michael l diller the deputy attorney general who handled the 
case for the state did not immediately return a telephone message 
the rule set by the administrative office of the courts says no 
spouse parent or child of a police officer can be a municipal clerk 
or deputy clerk with exceptions for officerclerk relationships 
that began before the rule took effect in 1977 
politan said the rule violated the hughes constitutional rights 
to due process and equal protection he recognized the states 
interest in preserving conflictfree appearances but said the right 
to marriage outweighs the rule he also noted that a court clerk 
could easily step aside from a case involving a spouse 
james katz lawyer for millvilles court clerk and a city officer 
who live together awaiting another federal judges ruling on their 
challenge of a related rule preventing cohabitation said politans 
opinion would help their case 
more importantly its sending a message that the court 
administrative office should keep its eyes and hands out of the 
bedrooom he said

the economic slowdown caught up with american 
consumers in july as they paid off 280 million more in credit than 
they borrowed the government reported friday it was the first 
reduction in consumer debt in 2 years 
but analysts predicted the decline in borrowing was temporary 
and considering other reports indicating continued although slower 
ecnomic growth should pick up in the months ahead 
it does confirm the economy slowed down in july said john 
silvia an economist and vice president at kemper financial services 
in chicago but thats past history a temporary thing 
the federal reserve board said consumer credit in july declined 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 05 percent down from 
junes 47 percent gain but even the june advance was revised 
downward from 51 percent falling from 299 billion to 272 
billion 
the july decline was the first since january 1987 when consumer 
debt fell 163 billion or 34 percent 
despite a general economic slowdown due to federal reserve 
efforts to stem inflation consumer spending which accounts for 
twothirds of all economic activity has continued at a relatively 
fast pace 
borrowing kept up with consumer credit rising 73 percent in may 
after gaining 48 percent in april 66 percent in march and 95 
percent in february 
consumer credit increased 85 percent over all of 1988 
suggesting the july debt decline was temporary silvia said 
employment growth income growth consumer confidence surveys all 
indicate continued consumer growth 
silvia said the commerce departments report on august retail 
sales next friday will give us a better feel they should be up 1 
percent 
sandra shaber of the futures group in washington also foresaw a 
pickup in consumer credit saying auto sales had begun to rise in 
july and rose a hefty amount in august 
auto loans which fell for the second straight month contributed 
most to the july credit cutback the fed reported they were down 6 
percent following a 23 percent decline in june 
the central bank said that borrowing for auto purchases dropped 
146 billion in july after declining 549 million a month earlier 
auto loans had risen 45 percent in may and 33 percent in april 
borrowing for mobile homes continued its descent down for the 
sixth consecutive month loans declined by 60 million or 3 percent 
on an annual basis that followed drops of 134 percent in june 21 
percent in may 28 percent in april 82 percent in march and 29 
percent in february 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate also 
dropped down 26 million a decrease of 02 percent that compared 
with a 25 percent advance in june and a 72 percent gain in may 
the category of debt that includes credit cards continued to rise 
but at a slower pace than in previous months it was up 80 
percent to 127 billion revolving debt had advanced 201 percent 
to 312 billion in june after increasing 13 percent in may and 11 
percent in april 
the various changes left total consumer debt in july at a 
seasonally adjusted 70057 billion

its almost like the 10 most wanted people in the world said 
betty lichenstein a holyoke school committee member on the list for 
52 delinquent tickets for a total of 1040 
lichtenstein said she tried to work out a payment plan with 
officials after appearing on the list about a month ago but was

appearance

200000 has been collected in unpaid fines since the start of the 
fiscal year

a minister testified friday he felt 
robbed and cheated when he bought lifetime partnerships from 
television evangelist jim bakker for lodging in a hotel that was 
never built 
after bakkers trial recessed for the day the same judge 
sentenced two former bakker aides to up to 18 years in prison and 
fined them 500000 each for tax evasion 
the rev alan foor pastor of the united church of christ in 
beavertown pa testified at bakkers trial that he was a monthly 
contributor to bakkers ptl but became angry when he learned how 
well bakker lived 
foors testimony wrapped up this weeks court proceedings on 
charges that bakker used nearly 4 million in ministry funds to 
finance an extravagant lifestyle prosecutors say bakker used funds 
from the sale of partnerships in his hotels 
partners who gave at least 1000 were told they were 
guaranteed a certain number of nights per year in a hotel at the 
ministrys heritage usa retreat near fort mill sc 
when court recessed for the day at lunch bakker and his wife 
tammy waved to a crowd of 300 people outside the courthouse 
im going to get some rest bakker said thursday was the 
first full day of testimony after the trial resumed following 
bakkers breakdown and commitment to a federal prison for 
psychiatric evaluation last week 
bakkers former personal aide david taggart was sentenced to 18 
years and five months in prison and fined 500000 his brother 
james taggart ptls former interior decorator was sentenced to 17 
years and nine months and fined 500000 they were convicted in 
july and faced up to 25 years in prison and fines of 1 million each 
white collar criminals seem to get away with extremely light 
sentences us district judge robert potter said before imposing 
sentence its time we do something about that 
the taggarts were convicted of evading taxes on 11 million in 
ptl funds that they used to pay for personal luxuries such as a 
trump tower apartment in new york jaguar cars cartier watches and 
gucci items 
the taggarts left the courthouse without speaking to reporters 
in 1986 foor said he saw bakker on the ptl club television 
show touting the tower club and the victory warrior memberships 
foor testified that on june 18 1986 he sent 1000 charged on a 
credit card saying that was the last day of a promotion offering 
two memberships for the price of one 
the way i understood it i was buying into a time share for 
four days and three nights each year foor said but he said he 
never was able to use the lodging because the hotel wasnt completed 
foor said he became angry when ptl sent him a letter asking that 
he buy another partnership 
foor said he disagreed with bakkers rationale of blaming his 
problems on the devil 
how dumb does he think people are foor wrote in a letter to 
ptl in april 1987 about a month after bakker resigned from ptl 
because of a sexual scandal 
he wrote that he earned 18000 a year and loved and forgave the 
bakkers but added until i see a better and more honest use of my 
money i will withhold my contributions 
he said he got a response from ptl asking him to call but he 
decided later to file a claim with us bankruptcy court as a 
number of other partners did 
outside the courtroom foor said he felt sorry for the bakkers 
my heart goes out to them he said 
but he quickly added that if someone commits a crime he has to 
pay his dues 
the biggest thing i wanted to hear was jim and tammy to say 
that they made a mistake foor said i never heard that i 
feel i was duped 
in richmond va a federal appeals court friday denied bakkers 
motion for a stay of his trial the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals also rejected bakkers motion to dismiss the indictment 
against him

police completed an investigation friday of six 
israelis suspected of training gunmen for colombian cocaine barons 
army radio said several may be charged with illegally exporting 
military expertise 
conviction carries a maximum jail sentence of three years 
adi gonen a national police spokesman confirmed the 
investigation was over but would not disclose its findings he said 
the file would be delivered to prosecutors sunday 
army radio said the police file included recommendations that 
several people in the case be tried for exporting military knowledge 
without a license 
a senior police official told the associated press privately 
earlier this week at least some of the men probably would be tried 
three are senior army reserve officers 
he said police had found no evidence the israelis were involved 
in colombias narcotics underworld 
police began the investigation aug 27 at the urging of defense 
minister yitzhak rabin after reports filtered out of colombia that 
israeli officers may have trained assassins for drug bosses 
rabin has said the men from a private firm called hod hahanit 
or spearhead had no government license to sell their expertise 
abroad 
yair klein a reserve lieutenantcolonel who heads the company

more automated recordkeeping is needed to keep 
futures markets honest but not at the expense of the traditional 
trading methods of shouts and hand signals a government watchdog 
agency said friday 
the general accounting office said the systems used for keeping 
track of trades on the nations commodities markets are 
fundamentally inadequate to detect and deter wrongdoing 
last month more than 40 traders and brokers on the chicago board 
of trade and the chicago mercantile exchange were indicted on a 
variety of charges that the had schemed to defraud customers 
among the schemes alleged were falsifying trading records to 
conceal the execution of trades at noncompetitive prices or ahead 
of a customers trade order 
most of the types of abuses alleged in the justice department 
indictments could also have been detected and documented with 
independent precise and complete timing of trades richard l 
fogel an assistant comptroller general with the gao told the 
senate agriculture committee 
at issue is the audit trail a term describing the 
reconstruction of any given transaction or put more simply 
determining who bought what from whom and when they did it 
the gao an investigative agency of congress visited the two 
giant chicago exchanges as well as the two largest in new york the 
new york mercantile exchange and the commodity exchange 
while all four try to track trading activities in each system 
opportunities exist to manipulate the timing and therefore the 
sequencing of trades said fogel 
on three of the four exchanges much of the record keeping is 
left to traders and brokers themselves 
are the audit trail systems in place at the major us 
exchanges are fundamentally inadequate to police the trading floors 
against abuses asked sen patrick leahy 
i think it is yes said fogel noting that there is no 
guarantee that information about the timing of when a broker gets an 
order or executes it 
but fogel said computerization doesnt necessarily spell the end 
of the hurlyburly method of trading in the exchange pits by shouts 
and hand signals known as open outcry 
i think thats a question the exchanges themselves need to 
answer he said adding i dont personally believe that the 
government should dictate how the exchanges want to trade 
the two chicago futures exchanges the largest in the world have 
been criticized for not keeping a closer watch on traders while the 
commodity futures trading commission which oversees the futures 
markets has been accused of doing so with too light a touch 
the cftc which is up for reauthorization at the end of the 
month has implemented rules requiring the exchanges to be able to 
reconstruct a trade to within one minute of its occurence but the 
exchanges say their systems are effective between 84 percent and 90 
percent of the time

the independent students association 
applied again on friday for legal status with the right to strike 
but the provincial court delayed a decision until sept 23 
prosecutor jan szewczuk said he had no objection to the 
registration and lawyers for the students noted that president 
wojciech jaruzelski said conditions should be created to allow the 
association to be legalized again 
the free union movement solidarity and the students association 
known by its polish initials nzs were recognized legally after 
their formation in 1980 but were outlawed in 1982 under the martial 
law crackdown 
nzs was denied registration last may 23 although solidarity and 
rural solidarity the independent farmers union regained legal 
status following april accords reached in roundtable talks 
between communist authorities and the thenopposition 
lawyer piotr andrzejewski representing the students said after 
the hearing friday i think that the decision can be only one 
registration of nzs on the basis of the rights it possessed before 
the introduction of martial law and it is going to put an end to 
the results of martial law 
but if the decision is negative it will be at the start of a 
new academic year and it will be a conscious creation of political 
instability in poland 
the sticking point is the students demand for the right to 
strike 
the court said polish law had not been revised to permit 
including a strike clause in the nzs charter although there is a 
proposal to do so 
szewczuk asked the threejudge panel to reverse its may decision 
recognizing a new legal initiative exists based on mutual trust 
between authorities and organizations 
polands new prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki comes from 
solidarity 
nzs with a strong and vocal following among college and high 
school students nationwide responded to the may rejection with 
strikes including one at the 16000student warsaw university 
solidarity leader lech walesa has asked for a moratorium on 
strikes to give mazowieckis government time to organize an economic 
recovery plan it is the first government in the east bloc in four 
decades not to be led by a communist 
at a may congress the students rejected dropping the strike 
provision 
walesa has said that the communists broke a pledge by not making

the national association of manufacturers one 
of the nations oldest and largest trade groups called friday for 
congress and the bush administration to remove restrictions on trade 
with the soviet union 
specifically the group said the soviet union should be granted a 
waiver under the 1974 jacksonvanik law which imposed high tariffs 
on imports from any nation that does not allow its citizens to 
emigrate freely 
the soviet union because of its resistance to jewish emigration 
has been among 15 nations on the restricted list including latvia 
lithuania and estonia which are soviet states 
while ideological differences can be important they should not 
preclude mutually beneficial commercial relations the 
manufacturers said in a statement recent events suggest that 
there is now genuine opportunity to improve us economic relations 
with the soviet union 
it said waiving jacksonvanik named after the late sen henry 
jackson dwash and former rep charles vanik dohio would be a 
first step to a new bilateral trade agreement granting the soviet 
union mostfavorednation trade status 
several major jewish organizations including the world jewish 
congress have come out in favor of granting the waiver 
only 914 jews were allowed to leave the soviet union in 1986 
according to the national conference on soviet jewry which has

to provide an account of rabins session with baker she said no 
details were ever given about oneonone meetings with foreign 
visitors

by shamir to hold elections among palestinians on the west bank and 
in gaza the united states which endorses the plan as a step toward 
peace talks has been unable to sell the plan to the plo 
without the coming out of a partner there is nothing more for 
the initiaitve rabin said israel is going to stand on its

brazil will ship some of the bones of 
nazi war criminal josef mengele to west germany to compare their 
genetic code with that of mengeles son the head of brazils 
federal police said friday 
federal police chief romeu tuma said four teeth three ribs and 
several other bones taken from mengeles remains would be submitted 
to a deoxyribonucleic acid dna test in frankfurt west germany 
the genetic code contained in the dna will be compared to that 
of mengeles son rolf who has agreed to submit himself to the test 
by donating some of his blood tuma said 
tuma who was to fly to germany on saturday with the bones said 
the dna test was requested by frankfurts district attorney the 
test is considered positive proof of identity 
tuma said the test would confirm once and for all that the bones 
are those of the infamous angel of death of the auschwitz death 
camp in poland where hundreds of thousands of prisoners were killed 
during world war ii 
that should put to rest any lingering doubts that anyone may 
have that the remains are mengeles the police chief said 
he said he did not know when the test would be completed 
mengeles remains were dug up on june 6 1985 from a grave in 
the cemetery at embu 17 miles from sao paulo 
witnesses said mengele lived in brazil for 18 years and drowned 
on feb 7 1979 while swimming at a beach resort near sao paulo 
on june 21 1985 an international forensic team concluded the 
unearthed skeleton was mengeles within a reasonable scientific 
certainty 
on march 27 1986 after mengeles dental xrays were discovered 
in sao paulo us forensic scientist lowell levine said the remains 
may now be identified as belonging to josef mengele with absolute 
certainty 
the bones have been kept at the sao paulo morgue since being 
removed from the grave

the united states and south korea reached 
tentative agreement friday on a treaty to end south korean 
harvesting of salmon that us fishermen say has cut into their 
catches off the northwest and alaskan coasts 
the agreement was initialed by negotiators from both nations but 
still has to be formally signed 
it came two weeks after president bush warned the koreans they 
faced a possible ban on shipments of their fishery products to the 
united states if an agreement was not reached by the end of 
september 
earlier this year drift net treaties were negotiated with japan 
and taiwan whose fleets along with the one from south korea fish 
the international waters in the north pacific 
ed wolfe the state departments ambassador for oceans and 
fisheries said the treaties provide for a cooperative enforcement 
program designed to minimize interception of usorigin salmon and 
a cooperative monitoring program designed to assess incidental take 
of a wide variety of marine resources 
under international law only american fishermen are allowed to 
catch salmon spawned in the united states 
the korean agreement grants us enforcement officers 
unrestricted authority to board and inspect korean drift net 
vessels to search for evidence of catches of fish spawned in the 
united states wolfe said 
in addition all korean drift net vessels will have to be 
equipped with satellite transponders by the 1990 fishing season 
these would allow us officials to keep track of the location of 
vessels to ensure they dont fish outside designated areas 
in exchange the koreans will be allowed to fish an expanded area 
of the north pacific in may 
more than 700 vessels from japan korean and taiwan have been 
using drift nets in the north pacific ostensibly to catch squid 
but us fishing groups claim they are actually fishing for 
salmon that spawn in north america and swim the pacific ocean 
salmon runs in alaska washington state and oregon have already 
suffered as a result of the catches the american groups say 
environmentalists also complain that use of the drift nets which 
they call walls of death result in the deaths of thousands of 
marine mammals and seabirds annually

national drug policy director william bennett 
responded i agree with the sentiment when a senator told him 
friday that law enforcement officials should have the authority to 
use force to bring down drugcarrying planes 
bennett testifying before a senate committee also restated the 
bush administrations position that there are no plans to send us 
fighting troops to colombia to fight the cocaine cartel and said 
that was unlikely to change 
he said that if there were a request from colombia for us 
forces it would have to be considered but it appears unlikely that 
will happen because colombian president virgilio barco does not want 
foreign fighting troops in his country 
if there were a change in policy the decision would be made by 
president bush in consultation with congress bennett said in his 
second day of appearances before lawmakers to promote the antidrug 
proposals bush unveiled tuesday 
at one point in the hearing sen mitch mcconnell rky 
provided a videotape of an airplane with packages being dumped out 
of it he said federal officials had identified it as air delivery 
of cocaine from south america 
mcconnell said that demonstrated the need for legislation he has 
sponsored to provide american law enforcement officials with 
authority to use force as a last resort to bring down such aircraft 
i agree with the sentiment expressed senator bennett said 
it is analogous to not identical to but analogous to it 
seems to me the authority we give a police officer in the inner 
city in this country to stop someone from speeding away in a 
fourbyfour bennett said 
unless we are going to engage in some kind of class 
discrimination i dont know why the airplane is not subject to some 
kind of rules as well as the recently purchased fourbyfour in 
southeast washington he said 
sen joseph biden ddel told bennett that if such a plane were 
discovered and could not be stopped any other way then as a last 
resort i think we should blow it out of the air 
meanwhile after sen john kerry brought up the issue the 
internal revenue service confirmed that there have been recent cuts 
in a miamibased program operation greenback designed to 
ferret out money laundering by narcotics traffickers 
kerry dmass said he was disturbed by reports of a scaling 
back in the program operated by the irs and the justice department 
i have heard of it said bruce karnes an aide to bennett but 
he said he had no details 
apparently there have been some cutbacks internal revenue 
service spokesman john hanlon said he said details of the operation 
would not be available immediately 
as for sending troops to colombia bennett said in response to 
questions from sen paul sarbanes dmd there is no thinking of 
such actions at this time 
his comments to the senate foreign relations committee were in 
line with earlier statements from the white house that the 
possibility of such a move was remote 
he said there was no certainty that military advisers if sent 
would be able to stay clear of hostilities 
bennett also told senators the administration is looking at the 
idea of a multinational strike force to combat drugs 
kerry asked why such a unit was not part of the drugfighting 
strategy made public by bush bennett said it remained unclear that 
the idea was a good one 
barco as you know doesnt want an american strike force he 
said he doesnt want an international strike force he doesnt 
want any kind of strike force 
bennett expanded on his testimony of thursday that colombian 
cartel leaders will not face the death penalty if extradited here 
and convicted of capital crimes he said that was because the us 
extradition agreement with colombia provides that those sent here 
for trial will get no harsher penalty that the maximum sentence in 
that nation which is 30 years in prison 
if the choices are no extradition to the united states or 30 
years then i think we should go with 30 years bennett said 
he said he would like to change the extradition agreement to 
remove the restriction against use of the death penalty

a top state department official called on china 
friday to take steps that will prevent the khmer rouge rebels from 
ever imposing it murderous rule on cambodia again 
richard solomon the assistant secretary of state for east asian 
affairs also said the soviet union must restrict its military aid 
to cambodia and use its influence to promote genuine national 
reconciliation in that country 
solomon spoke to an international symposium on the future of 
usindochina relations in los angeles copies of his remarks were 
made available by the state department 
solomon rejected the argument of many analysts that the united 
states should acquiesce in the continued rule of the 
vietnamesebacked hun sen government in cambodia rather than press 
for a comprehensive settlement among all contending factions 
he called this approach seriously flawed on several counts 
first he said a regime imposed and sustained by foreign force 
of arms lacks legitimacy 
in addition he said there is little basis for the assumption 
that hun sens unproven forces absent their vietnamese protectors 
who are due to leave at the end of september can eliminate the 
khmer rouge this he said is a goal that eluded vietnams powerful 
army for a decade 
solomon said the united states has neither the political position 
nor the resources to promote a peaceful settlement in cambodia but 
added that the same cannot be said for the soviet union and china 
the soviet union as the primary supporter of vietnam and hun 
sen must restrict its increasing flow of arms into cambodia and 
bring hanoi to see that its own interests will not be served by 
another cycle of warfare in indochina which certainly will be the 
case if it seeks full power for hun sen in the absence of a process 
of political reconciliaiton he said 
in return hanoi and hun sen and the international community 
have a right to expect china to equally restrict the supply of 
arms to the khmer rouge 
indeed beijing has an obligation to take active measures that 
will prevent the khmer rouge from again imposing a murderous rule on 
the cambodian people 
solomon spoke against the background of a failed effort at an 
international conference in paris last month to achieve a political 
settlement in cambodia to coincide with the withdrawal of the 
vietnamese troops 
he suggested that the key issue is whether the various cambodian 
factions can join together in a process of national reconciliation 
he said the united states will use its influence to move events 
in this direction and china and the soviet union must do the 
same 
moscow in particular must accept and act on the reality that 
without some willingness by vietnam and hun sen to compromise on 
powersharing there can be no negotiated settlement no respite 
from armed conflict he said

a prosecutor said friday he probably will seek 
supreme court review of an appeals court ruling that overturned the 
conviction of former white house political director lyn nofziger 
all nine judges on the us court of appeals this week rejected a 
request by independent counsel james mckay for a rehearing of the 
june 27 decision that set aside nofzigers convictions for illegal 
lobbying 
independent counsel james mckay said in a brief interview that 
his offices present inclination is to ask the supreme court to 
take the case 
in its 21 opinion overturning nofzigers conviction the court 
had said that for nofziger to be found guilty of illegal lobbying 
prosecutors were required to prove he had known that what he was 
doing was illegal 
i think that the majority opinion in this case is clearly 
wrong appeals court judge harry edwards said in a statement 
tuesday with which three of his colleagues concurred 
edwards said however that the full appeals court wasnt the 
proper place to hear the matter and that any further consideration 
of this case must be by the supreme court concurring with edwards 
were chief judge patricia wald abner mikva and ruth b ginsburg 
all four judges are carter administration appointees 
the other five judges currently on the appeals court are laurence 
silberman james buckley stephen williams douglas ginsburg and 
david sentelle all are reagan administration appointees 
edwards was the dissenting vote in the june 27 decision and said 
at that time that his colleagues had twisted the meaning of the 
ethics in government act under which nofziger was convicted 
nofziger was convicted on feb 11 1988 of illegally lobbying 
the white house on behalf of scandalplagued wedtech corp a 
maritime workers union and fairchild corp he lobbied for an army 
engine contract for wedtech for the placement of civilian sailors 
on navy vessels and for continued air force buying of an antitank 
aircraft made by fairchild

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
friday that the goals of the strategic defense initiative are sound 
and should not be scaled back 
his views were contained in a state department statement issued 
after a reporters question prompted by a published interview with 
vice president dan quayle in which he said that thenpresident 
reagan in making his original sales pitch for the star wars 
program in 1983 had resorted to political jargon and had 
stretched the capability of the proposal 
baker in the state department statement quoted president bush 
as saying 
we are vigorouly pursuing sdi our goals for sdi and our 
approach in the defense and space talks are sound and remain 
unchanged 
baker said the soviets should understand our insistence on 
investigating fully the feasibility of advanced strategic defenses 
hours after the quayle inteview bushs spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said that bush and quayle were in step on sdi and that 
bush still has not given up the plans goal of perfecting a space 
shield against all incoming nuclear missiles 
in the published interview quayle said reagan had talked about 
this impenetrable shield that was going to be completely leakproof 
i believe that in the semantics of lets say political jargon 
that that was acceptable but it clearly was stretching the 
capability of a strategic defense system 
under bush quayle said the program has been redefined and put 
into missions requirements doctrine and strategy much differently 
than we did in the early 1980s 
now he said in the interview the emphasis is on a program to 
help protect the united states against the accidental launch of a 
limited number of nuclear missiles rather than an allout 
boltoutoftheblue attack 
the issue of arms control and the antiballistic missile treaty 
of 1972 which banned most antimissile defenses are likely topics 
for discussion when baker meets with soviet foreign minister eduard 
a shevardnadze in jackson hole wyo sept 2223

politician of the extreme right was forced to resign as vice 
president of the academy of fine arts 
pierre arpaillange the minister ordered the state prosecutor to 
investigate remarks attributed to autantlara in fridays edition of 
the monthly magazine globe 
his statement said the investigation could lead to charges of 
racial injury racial defamation and inciting racial hatred 
autantlara 88 stirred condemnation thursday when the magazine 
quoted him as saying french politician simone veil who survived a 
german concentration camp had been missed by the nazis 
in the interview was quoted as accusing ms veil 62 of 
exploiting her experience for political gain 
she plays the violins with that but she came back eh he 
was quoted as saying and shes doing very well so when they talk 
to me of genocide i say that in any case they missed old lady 
veil 
he was asked to give up the vice presidency of the academy of 
fine arts by the groups permanent secretary marcel landowski

statements and joined fellow members in demanding autantlaras 
resignation from an assembly of artists in love with moderation

parliament for the extreme rightwing national front without saying

veil were shocking and completely open to criticism but

determine whether to take action against the globe 
while not denying the remarks autantlara said earlier friday he 
reserved the right to sue the globe he said his telephone 
conversation with a globe reporter did not constitute an official

afghan guerrillas said friday they had 
captured four security posts and three tanks in an advance on the 
governmentheld garrison town of khost near the pakistan border 
the reports contradicted the afghan government which said 
thursday the moslem guerrillas had lost a twoweek fight to take 
khost 
a spokesman for guerrilla commander jalaluddin haqqani who is 
reported to lead 3000 of the ussupported guerrillas said 
thursday they had khost and were within three miles of it 
the guerrilla news agency midia said the mujahedeen as the 
guerrillas are called destroyed a sovietmade antonov26 transport 
plane in a rocket attack on the khosts airport wednesday 
the kabul regime can only supply by air it said all roads 
leading to khost have been cut off 
haqqanis spokesman who known only as mohed said fifteen 
soldiers surrendered and handed over some heavy guns on thursday 
three mujahedeen were killed and 14 were wounded but we dont 
know how many regime troops were killed 
he said the guerrillas captured three tanks as they overran four 
posts which he identified as walim ghubao mirbao and bak 
there is no way to verify the contradictory claims often made by 
afghan officials and insurgents in the 11yearold civil war 
lt gen abdul haq ulumi secretary of the sovietbacked 
governments supreme defense council told reporters thursday the 
army had retaken all the positions it had lost since the guerrillas 
began their khost offensive aug 24 and the battle was completely 
over 
the town in paktia province is the governments easternmost 
garrison 12 miles from the pakistan where most of the guerrillas 
are based its capture would clear the way for a guerrilla assault 
on the provincial capital gardez 48 miles to the northwest 
the guerrillas have not captured a city since the soviet union 
withdrew its military forces feb 15 after nine years of involvement

a senior iraqi official was quoted friday 
as saying the united states was providing cover for syrian attempts 
to partition lebanon and only force would make the syrians withdraw 
from their warracked neighbor 
the londonbased newsletter mideast mirror quoted first deputy 
premier taha yassin ramadan of iraq as saying in an interview that 
during iraqs 8year war with iran israel was in the background 
and america providing cover 
the same thing is happening in lebanon where the leading role 
is being played by syria and israel but the american cover is much 
clearer and more candid than it was in the war with iraq 
in iraq the aim was to partition the country and in lebanon 
they have the same goal 
ramadan was interviewed thursday in belgrade at the summit 
conference of nonaligned nations a copy was telexed to the 
associated press in bahrain 
lebanon has been torn by 14 years of civil war 
iraq has backed gen michel aoun in recent fighting in lebanon 
between his christian forces and moslem militias backed by syria 
the christian army is also fighting the estimated 40000 troops 
syria has in lebanon 
iraq and syria are bitter political foes ruled by rival wings of 
the baath party syria backed iran in the iraniraq war which was 
halted by a ceasefire in august 1988 
the newsletter quoted ramadan as saying we in iraq say that 
neither an arab resolution nor an international resolution will get 
hafez assad out of lebanon only force can get him out crawling on 
his knees 
assad is the president of syria 
ramadan was quoted as saying iraq supported peacemaking efforts 
in lebanon by an arab league committee but doubted it would make 
headway in ending the war since syria refused to agree to a 
timetable for withdrawing its troops 
let them try we are confident that hafez assad will not leave 
lebanon as a result of a resolution he merely wants to play for 
time 
the foreign ministers of saudi arabia morocco and algeria are to 
meet in jiddah saudi arabia next wednesday they will appraise the 
chances of their three leaders trying once more to end the fighting 
in lebanon and outline a plan for national reconciliation to avert 
the threat of partition

a year after radiocarbon tests found the shroud of 
turin to be only 700 years old a participant in a shroud symposium 
said friday the bright light of the resurrection may have altered 
the aging process 
many of the questions boil down to this said jacques evin 
an engineer at the radiocarbon laboratory of lyon in the event of 
the resurrection of christ would there have been a sufficient burst 
of light to alter the process of carbon decay 
the paris international scientific symposium on the shroud of 
turin gave shroudies dedicated students of what is purported 
to be the burial cloth of jesus christ their first chance to 
contest the findings issued in october 1988 
it is a most unusual object and its an object that means a lot 
of things to a lot of people said professor michael tite of the 
british museum research laboratory at the end of the twoday 
gathering anything you do with it is bound to cause controversy 
tite was at the heart of the debate last year he headed one of 
three laboratories that said the shroud was made about 700 years 
ago 13 centuries after the death of christ scientific teams from 
the university of arizona and university of zurich also participated 
rather than resolving questions of the shrouds authenticity the 
radiocarbon tests appear to have become a new source of argument 
the 14yardlong cloth bears a faint yellowish negative image of 
the front and back of a man with thorn marks on the head 
lacerations from flogging on the back and bruises on the shoulders 
suggestive of accounts of christs crucifixion 
it has been kept in italys cathedral of turin since the middle 
ages when creation of false religious relics was widespread the 
nowretired roman catholic cardinal there anastasio ballestrero 
invited scientists last year to test samples the size of postage 
stamps with radiocarbon dating techniques 
datings by the laboratories ranged from 1260 to 1390 ballestrero 
eventually endorsed the results but said the shrouds significance 
as an object of deep religious faith was unchanged 
few symposium participants contested the test results but evin 
and others questioned whether the cloth had been altered somehow to 
produce an inaccurate reading 
tite was skeptical of evins theory 
it seems to me a slight coincidence that if there was a burst 
of radiation it would have been just enough to date the cloth to 
the 14th century he said 
some of the 100 spectators cheered when one of their number 
insisted the scientists had tested a piece of the cloth near a seam 
that was restored in the 16th or 17th century 
we do not have a pure specimen he declared it was 
contaminated there were threads from the 16th century extending 
into the main part of the shroud i think we may be dealing with a 
clever forger who rewove the threads 
tite said the results would have been affected only if 6070 
percent of the cloth were rewoven 
john jackson 43 of colorado springs colo said density 
measurements of the frontal image on the cloth appear to show a body 
was lifted through it but he stopped well short of calling the 
phenomenon evidence of the resurrection 
i dont want to get into too much speculation on the religious 
implications said jackson who has studied the shroud for 15 
years if the shroud is medieval then this image was formed then 
im also open to the fact that if someone else can explain this 
image in a conventional way then that should take priority over

the official economic daily newspaper denounced 
former party chief zhao ziyang on friday for encouraging a market 
economy and emphasized that china will not abandon the communist 
system of public ownership 
on the same subject hardline premier li peng stressed friday 
that public ownership always will dominate chinas economy but li 
said private entrepreneurs will continue to supplement the 
publicowned economy and provide jobs 
a commentary in the economic daily said zhao put too much 
emphasis on privatization 
it said some chinese supporters of western ideas gradually are 
trying to convert chinas economic structure to capitalism 
they aim to disintegrate public ownership pushing 
privatization to be a major aspect of chinas economy step by step 
until the whole economy is privatized the article said 
zhao advocated gradually reducing state controls over the economy 
and encouraged private enterprise he was ousted after the june 
military crackdown on a prodemocracy movement 
zhao also backed agricultural reforms allowing families to 
contract land and sell crops on the free market after fulfilling 
state quotas for grain 
farmers also have been free to start their own businesses 
rapid growth of private enterprise has produced a moneyed class 
and increased income gaps 
the latest issue of the weekly magazine beijing review said 
private ownership would polarize the rich and the poor while the 
overwhelming majority of people would again be plunged into the 
plight of being exploited and oppressed 
the economic daily and china daily approved of capitalisms 
advanced management systems but denounced such elements as 
exploitation of workers and unequal distribution of wealth 
capitalists are more interested in profiteering than adjusting 
production to economic laws they said 
public ownership supporters argue that collectivism can integrate 
market demand with centralized plans respond to consumer needs 
improve production quality and enable the government to regulate the 
economy 
the beijing review cited the 100000worker capital iron and 
steel co as a successful example of a large staterun enterprise 
because it registered 20 percent increases in annual profits and tax 
payments in recent years 
chinese economists have stressed no campaign will be undertaken 
against the nations 194 million private entrepreneurs although 
officials have announced stronger measures to combat tax evasion and 
illegal selling practices 
china daily in july said privatization would cause a widening gap 
in different regions and that surplus labor has become a serious 
social problem 
millions of migrant workers have descended on southern canton and 
other urban centers hoping for jobs but ending up straining social 
facilities

bands of masked men with guns and 
firebombs rampaged friday through medellin the home base of 
colombias largest cocaine cartel and police said nine official 
vehicles were burned 
they did not report any injuries but said the gangs suspected of 
being the cartels hired thugs stopped the official vehicles 
including trucks and vans and set them afire in sporadic attacks 
throughout the day 
there were these other developments 
the army said it had arrested a pilot nicolas gonzalez cardona 
who flew cocaine to the united states for pablo escobar colombias 
most notorious cocaine baron 
police said one of escobars top aides was released because they 
had no arrest warrant or us extradition request for the suspect 
they reported that luis fernando galeano berrio was released from a 
bogota jail thursday 
a newspaper poll indicated more than 75 percent of colombians 
support the governments 3weekold war on drug traffickers but 
oppose the presence of foreign soldiers to help in the fight 
in a telephone interview with the associated press police col 
oscar pelaez carmona said galeano was released because police 
holding him lacked the required legal papers including an arrest 
warrant and an extradition request from the united states 
the missing paperwork was supposed to have accompanied galeano 
when he was transferred from a medellin army base to a bogota jail 
in washington a spokesman for the drug enforcement 
administration frank shultz said galeano was not wanted in the 
united states and there were no charges against him there 
pelaez said galeano was arrested a month ago in medellin and was 
held for three weeks at an army base in medellin and brought last 
week to bogota 
galeano was captured days before the government began a 
nationwide drug crackdown launched after terrorists assassinated on 
aug 18 sen luis carlos galan a presidential candidate and 
antidrug crusader 
a us official in colombia said the crackdown on drugs had cut 
the cocaine trade by up to 50 percent but that much of the 65 
million worth of military airplanes and hardware donated by the 
united states was not suited to the job 
in response to a question the official said the eight a37 
warplanes cannot be used to bomb cocaine labs and the only way to 
employ them may be to help force down suspected drug flights 
all of this stuff came from stockpiles the military had it is 
hard to take stuff out that stockpile and make it applicable to 
antinarcotics work he said 
gonzalez cardona a pilot who allegedly ferried cocaine to the 
united states was being held in medellin the 4th army brigade in 
medellin announced 
it said gonzalez cardona was a pilot in the service of 
narcotics trafficer pablo escobar making international flights on 
one of the medellin cartels main routes for distributing cocaine 
between colombia and the cities of miami and new york among 
others 
the medellin cartel is believed to supply 80 percent of the 
cocaine consumed in the united states 
gonzalez cardona was arrested in a roundup that followed the aug 
17 assassination of col waldemar francklin quintero medellins top 
police official 
escobar who is in hiding tops the list of drug figures wanted 
in the united states he is said to head a 3 billion worldwide 
cocaine empire 
colombia has offered a 250000 reward for information leading to 
his capture 
the government of president virgilio barco began a nationwide 
crackdown following the assassination of sen galan 
barco declared a state of siege and said he would extradite drug 
figures wanted in the united states millions of dollars in 
possessions of drug lords have been seized and hundreds of people 
have been rounded up but top drug lords remain at large 
the man who reputedly laundered hundreds of millions of dollars 
for cocaine cartels eduardo martinez romero was the first person 
extradited to the united states under the current crackdown he was 
being held under tight security in atlanta pending a monday hearing 
the poll by the bogota newspaper el tiempo the caracol radio 
network and a private consulting firm showed 758 percent of those 
questioned in four cities favored the governments actions and 24 
percent opposed the remainder had no opinion 
colombians also were overwhelmingly in favor of extraditing drug 
figures and the seizure of their bank accounts and property 
but colombians opposed 80 percent to 20 percent the presence of 
foreign military personnel in colombia to aid with the crackdown 
the pollsters did not give their polling techniques or the polls 
margin of error 
president bush approved the special military aid for colombias 
antinarcotics forces and sent transport planes helicopters and 
fighter jets to colombia last week 
the pentagon said up to 200 us military personnel would have to 
come to colombia to set up the equipment and show colombians how to 
use it 
the us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
friday in bogota that the military equipment shipped to colombia so 
far was merely symbolic and not adequate for antidrug 
operations 
he said the crackdown is not running out of gas and estimated 
it has cut the drug flow in colombia by maybe 25 to 50 percent

a federal appeals court friday upheld the 
transportation departments random mandatory drug testing program 
covering 30000 employees including air traffic controllers 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia said in a unanimous opinion the extraordinary 
sensitivity of the bulk of the employees in the program 
justifies the invasions of privacy entailed by conducting random 
drug testing 
the american federation of government employees had appealed a 
us district court dismissal of its court challenge to the program 
the union had filed suit in an attempt to block testing not based 
on suspicion of drug use saying such a practice violated the 
prohibitions of the fourth and fifth amendments against searches 
without probable cause and selfincrimination 
the union attacked drug testing of motor vehicle operators 
hazardous material inspectors and aircraft mechanics at the federal 
aviation administration appeals court judge david sentelle noted 
all three job categories should be included because of their 
importance to public safety 
we have found the privacy interests of employees occupying the 
three specifically challenged positions outweighed by the 
departments compelling interests in preventing drug use among such 
personnel said the judges 
the faas 12000 air traffic controllers belong to a different 
union the national air traffic controllers association and were 
not a party to the case 
also subject to the random drug testing are electronic 
technicians aviation and railroad safety inspectors and civil 
aviation security specialists 
the appeals court decision represents a great victory for the 
department transportation secretary samuel skinner said in a 
statement the public expects and deserves a drugfree and safe 
transportation system skinner said

it at her and demanded all her money and jewelry 
i kept saying oh come on and thought he was kidding the 
woman told the post then he put the gun to my head and i knew he 
wasnt playing

duct tape leaving only her nose exposed 
im going to kill you she remembered him repeating 
the assailant then guided her into the basement raped her and 
pushed her into a dark crawl space 
i waited until it was quiet she said when it was i 
thought he was gone i couldnt get the tape off i couldnt find 
the end so i couldnt see 
she said she felt her way to the crawlspace entrance and realized 
the man was standing just a few feet away he hit her on the head 
with a hammer and she collapsed and played dead 
thats when he slashed my arms and legs with a knife i guess 
he thought i would bleed to death she said i acted like i was 
out cold

with furniture she said she also heard him set a couch on fire just 
outside the door 
the woman said cut the tape away from her eyes and ripped her 
shirt to shreds to stop the bleeding from knife wounds on her arms 
legs and hands while choking on the smoke from the fire 
when i was lying on the ground i just figured i was going to 
die whether i wanted to or not but i thought hes not going to get 
out of this scotfree 
she wrote donnie next door with her bloodsmeared finger on 
the floor the wall and on a cardboard box 
then she put her shoulder to the door wedging it open far 
enough to squeeze out 
she used the knife to break a basement window climbed out and 
scaled a 6foot fence a neighbor called police and firefighters 
the woman underwent surgery for severed tendons in her hand she 
said she has regained the use of some fingers and the prognosis for 
her recovery is good 
but i feel safe in here she said i dont think id ever

conservative economist milton friedman on 
friday attacked president bushs thousand points of light idea 
of national service as utterly unnecessary and compared it to 
one of adolf hitlers programs 
the nobel prizewinning economist in an interview before a forum 
of scholars and politicians at the hoover institution at stanford 
university said the idea of universal national service is more 
wasteful government spending 
friedman said bushs proposal and several other bills introduced 
in congress this year are smaller versions of universal national 
service plans that have been suggested before and which he claimed 
bear an uncanny resemblance to the hitler youth corps 
strictly voluntary programs like the red cross or boy scouts 
are splendid but these national service proposals arent voluntary 
as far as the people paying for it friedman said 
rep dave mccurdy dokla chief sponsor in the house of the 
nunnmccurdy plan for national service defended the concept of 
young americans devoting time to working for others 
the proposal is based on the premise that our young people must 
move beyond the decade of me first attitudes of the reagan era and 
the lingering aftereffects of vietnam which led many to ask what 
their country could do for them mccurdy said 
the nunnmccurdy plan which seeks to make federal aid for 
college students conditional on national service in the military or 
in civilian work programs is among several national service bills 
introduced in congress this year 
friedman said the president is proposing a much more modest 
program than nunn and mccurdy but said i still think its a 
misguided proposal the fact that you do something bad on a small 
scale doesnt make it good 
president bush proposed creating an agency called youth engaged 
in service to america and has set up an office of national service 
in the white house with 14 fulltime staffers bush proposed funding 
that office with 25 million a year for the next four years and 
hopes to match that amount with private funds 
bush also has called for a points of light initiative foundation 
and named new jersey gov tom kean to head a committee to advise on 
how the foundation should be set up 
the president hopes all americans and all american institutions 
will become involved with some kind of community service said 
tracey taylor staff assistant for the office of national service at 
the white house 
williamson evers a national fellow at hoover and conference 
chairman said the twoday forum is meant to air and thrash out 
the issues 
among the other speakers were former rep pete mccloskey 
rcalif lutheran theologian richard john neuhas political 
scientist benjamin barber and cato institute senior fellow and 
former reagan administration adviser doug bandow

prime minister rajiv gandhi on friday 
said his government has reached agreement with sri lanka to withdraw 
42000 indian soldiers sent to that island nation to end ethnic 
violence 
the accord was reached with sri lankan officials during this 
weeks meeting of nonaligned nations in belgrade yugoslavia press 
trust of india reported 
the news agency quoted gandhi as saying the accord is a good 
agreement covering all aspects of the withdrawal of indian troops 
in northeast sri lanka 
india has withdrawn about 3000 troops since june 29 following 
appeals by sri lankan president ranasinghe premadasa gandhi 
initially rejected premadasas demands for a troop pullout saying a 
rapid withdrawal would worsen the ethnic violence 
a clash was averted when india agreed to a token withdrawal june 
29 but the countries had failed to agree on a timetable for a 
complete pullout gandhi did not elaborate on what had been 
negotiated 
sri lankan officials have gone back to colombo with the points 
of agreement for consultation with president ranasinghe premadasa 
gandhi was quoted as saying by united news of india 
india and sri lanka agreed on major issues he said without 
elaborating uni reported 
the government says 17000 people have been killed in a 
secessionist war by tamil rebels and a backlash by sinhalese 
radicals protesting the governments peace overtures to the tamils 
india deployed its first troops in sri lanka on june 30 1987 to 
disarm tamil rebels who had agreed to surrender under an 
indianbrokered peace accord but the domimant rebel group the 
liberation tigers of tamil eelam reneged and began attacking indian 
soldiers 
more troops were sent as the fighting escalated premadasa asked 
for a withdrawal to appease sinhalese radicals after the tigers 
agreed to peace talks 
extremist sinhalese launched a campaign of assassinations and 
terror to protest the indian presence which they say compromises 
sri lankas sovereignty 
india got involved because of pressures from its own tamil 
minority 
authorities in sri lanka said friday that 19 people had died in 
ethnic violence since wednesday 
cpl tissa rupasinghe opened fire on his fellow soldiers thursday 
night while they slept at the deraniyagala camp 35 miles east of 
colombo said the officials 
they said three soldiers were killed and two injured in the 
attack and the 26yearold corporal fled with an automatic rifle 
they said the soldier was suspected of being a member of the 
peoples liberation front an antigovernment guerrilla group trying 
to overthrow the government 
officials blamed the sinhalese militants for most of the other 16 
deaths reported 
they said the victims included a government official who was not 
identified and four children who died when a bomb exploded in a 
house in diganhena village about 85 miles south of colombo 
they said one of the victims a 16yearold was suspected of 
being a member of the peoples liberation front and had brought the

the surgery that removed a small puddle of old 
blood from the brain cavity of former president reagan was among the 
simplest of the procedures that could have been used according to 
surgeons familiar with brain operations 
a spokesman for the former president said doctors at st marys 
hospital removed a subdural hematoma after drilling a single burr 
hole in reagans skull 
dr henry brem an associate professor of neurosurgery at johns 
hopkins hospital in baltimore said before the surgery that if 
doctors in the course of the procedure were able to find and drain 
the fluid from a single hole then the operation could be 
accomplished quickly and easily 
he said that typically the patient would be placed under general 
or local anesthestia and that an incision would be made through the 
scalp to the skull then a hole would be drilled giving surgeons a 
view of the dura a tough membrane that covers the brain 
theyll open up the dura and let the fluid out and that would 
be the end of it the surgeon predicted just hours before the 
operation based on a statement released by reagans spokesman 
that apparently is what happened 
brem was not involved in the care and treatment of reagan but 
did describe how such surgery is accomplished on most patients 
he should do extremely well he said patients usually do 
beautifully in something like this 
doctors at the mayo clinic discovered the subdural hematoma 
during a routine examination of the 78yearold former president 
they attributed the collection of fluid on the top right side of 
the brain to a riding accident last july reagan was visiting a 
ranch in mexico when a bucking horse threw him to the ground he was 
examined at an army hospital but declined to remain overnight after 
treatment for bruises and scrapes the following day reagan was 
reported to be sore but in excellent condition 
brem said that a collection of fluid in the brain cavity is 
plausible after such an accident even though there was no 
obvious head injury 
dr edward laws chairman of neurosurgery at george washington 
university hospital in washington said it would not be surprising 
if the jolt from a fall particularly with an elderly person would 
cause a collection of fluid on the brain 
this is usually because a little blood vessel gets torn and 
causes some blood to leak into the space over the surface of the 
brain he said as it dissolves it collects more fluid and 
expands 
he said it is common practice to remove such fluid collections 
even if they are causing no problems 
they usually continue to enlarge and could ultimately cause 
symptoms said laws he called the surgical procedure routine 
laws said that when blood leaks in the brain cavity it can remain 
there and slowly change from a bright red to a black or even yellow 
fluid 
if left untreated the fluid pool could cause further bleeding 
and pressure which could begin to damage brain cells 
neither brem nor laws personally knew any details of the reagans 
medical treatment and they could not be reached for comment after 
the former presidents surgery 
earlier laws who once worked at mayo predicted that the 
simplest procedure possible would be used 
my guess is that they will just make a couple of small openings 
in the skull and allow the fluid to drain out he said before the 
operation thatll take about an hour and a half 
according to the spokesmans statement the surgeons actually 
used only one drill hole and completed the procedure without 
complications in just over an hour 
the statement said no further treatment is anticipated 
suggesting as laws had predicted before the operation that reagan 
should be good as new

prime minister tadeusz mazowieckis nominee 
for foreign minister told a hearing committee friday that poles 
forced to remain in the soviet union after world war ii should be 
able to return the government news agency pap said 
two other cabinet nominees were rejected but most nominees were 
approved on the first day of hearings of a solidarityled government 
that will end four decades of communist control of foreign affairs 
the news media and economy 
eight committees of the sejm or lower house of parliament held 
hearings all day further sessions were planned through the weekend 
to get ready for the vote tuesday on mazowieckis proposed 
government 
pap said that krzysztof skubiszewski a littleknown independent 
named to be foreign minister said polands foreign policy must not 
depend on any one political party and also that it was necessary to 
make possible the return of poles kept in the soviet union after the 
war 
he made the remarks to the committee responsible for contacts 
with poles living abroad which along with the foreign affairs 
committee approved his nomination pap said 
pap said mazowiecki elected aug 24 nominated 19 people 
thursday and four friday mazowiecki is expected to outline his 
governments program in a speech tuesday he also plans on having a 
final list of nominees then 
it appeared solidarity would control 13 posts including prime 
minister on the 24member council of ministers or cabinet 
the communist party would have four the united peasant party 
four and the democratic party three 
but government and legislative sources said more posts could be 
added 
late friday the parliamentary commission for food and 
agriculture voted against the nominations of czeslaw janicki of the 
peasant party and of artur balazs of solidarity television news 
said 
janicki an agriculture professor was nominated for the combined 
post of deputy prime minister and agriculture and balazs as minister 
without portfolio for rural and civic issues 
tv said voting was secret and gave no reasons for the rejections 
but a peasant party statement had supported kazimierz olesiak 
the incumbent agriculture minister and a peasant party leader 
balazs nomination involved a power struggle between rural 
solidarity and the peasant party 
the committee votes do not oblige mazowiecki to withdraw 
candidates 
besides not getting the foreign ministry the communist party was 
denied the powerful post of chairman of the radiotv committee that 
will go to a solidarity supporter not been named 
skubiszewski an adviser to roman catholic church leader cardinal 
jozef glemp was considered a compromise between solidarity and the 
communists both of whom wanted the post 
the prosolidarity daily gazeta wyborcza called skubiszewski a 
neutral but mazowiecki was overheard telling lawmakers the nominee 
had been a solidarity member 
skubiszewski told the hearing any disputes between poland and its 
warsaw pact neighbors had to be solved peacefully and relations 
among pact countries must be based on mutual obligations 
among the candidates questioned friday were 
gen czeslaw kiszczak mazowieckis predecessor and candidate to 
remain head of the interior ministry and a deputy prime minister 
solidarity activist jacek kuron the minister of labor nominee 
aleksander bentkowski the peasant party parliamentary floor leader 
nominated to head the justice ministry 
leszek balcerowicz a solidarity candidate for deputy prime 
minister and nominee for the finance ministry 
the delay in providing the list caused confusion as the communist 
party newspaper trybuna ludu gazeta wyborcza and pap all published 
different lists 
according to pap solidarity will run six government ministries 
and solidarity members were nominated to five other cabinetrank 
positions 
jerzy osiatynski a solidarity legislator nominated as head of 
the central planning office and balazs joined nine other solidarity 
members nominated thursday 
that list gives solidarity 12 votes on the council of ministers 
counting mazowiecki if skubiszewski votes with solidarity as seems 
likely in crucial matters solidarity would command a 1311 edge on 
the council 
only one woman was among the nominees soliaritys izabella 
cywinska a theater director as culture minister 
the communists polish united workers party which had directed 
the government since 1948 has received nominees for four ministries 
besides kiszczak minister of defense gen florian siwicki would 
retain his job and communists would receive the transportation 
ministry and foreign trade ministry 
several nominees have been victims of government repression 
kuron spent nine years in jail and henryk samsonowicz the nominee 
for minister of education was fired as warsaw university rector 
because of his solidarity sympathies 
as soon as it is approved the government will face an economy 
ravaged by inflation a chronic shortage of basic goods low 
productivity and a foreign debt of 39 billion

shipping company officials to a shipchristening in west germany

the twinengine convair 440 turboprop plane belonging to the 
norwegian airline partnair was en route from oslo norway to 
hamburg west germany it crashed in the skagerrak strait a heavily 
traveled shipping route that borders norway denmark and sweden 
rescue officials said 32 bodies have been recovered and 
helicopters and about 30 vessels including a west german warship 
and fishing trawlers were searching the 55degree water for other 
victims 
there are no survivors the plane disintegrated said kurt 
rasmussen an official at the danish sea rescue center at karup on 
denmarks jutland peninsula we just found the main wheel floating 
and the nose cone 
there were 50 passengers and a crew of five aboard partnairs 
managing director syvar leivestad told reporters in oslo 
the passengers most of them top management and half the staff of 
the wilhelmsen lines shipping company were chosen by lottery for a 
trip that was meant to be a reward company officials said all were 
norwegian the norwegian ntb news agency said 
rescuers said most of the bodies were found within a radius of a 
few hundred yards which would appear to indicate the plane did not 
explode in air 
it would be pure speculation to say what caused the crash but 
whatever it was it must have happened very suddenly said rolf 
grimsrud director of the norwegian civil aviation technical 
division 
it could have been an explosion due to sabotage or something 
else or it could have lost a major surface such as a wing or the 
tail he said 
grimsrud said the pilots did not send a distress signal even 
though the plane was flying at a high enough altitude that they 
normally would have had plenty of time even if the engines failed 
the plane which took off from oslos fornebu airport was flying 
at 23000 feet when air controllers at copenhagens kastrup airport 
lost contact with it swedens national news agency tt reported 
it went down 18 miles north of hirtshals on denmarks northern 
coast according to the rescue center at karup the crash site is 
190 miles northwest of copenhagen 
it was the worst crash in norwegian aviation history prime 
minister gro harlem brundtland issued a condolence message and other 
party leaders suspended the campaign for mondays general election 
a norwegian commission will investigate the accident because it 
happened in international waters said commission member ragnar 
rygnestad 
we will try to recover the flight recorder which can tell us a 
lot about what happened right up until the accident he said 
wilhelmsen lines owner wilhelm wilhemsen said no passenger list 
would be available until it was released by danish authorities who 
are in charge of identifying the bodies 
the norwegian news agency ntb reported a search vessel carrying 
32 bodies arrived at denmarks north sea port of hirtshals 
wilhemsen said all of the passengers were employees of his firm 
including 48 from the wilhelmsen lines headquarters that employs 110 
people 
the plane built by the general dynamics was 35 years old its 
engines were refitted about 20 years ago 
partnair chief pilot per erik ingjer said he brought the plane 
from canada to oslo one week ago where it had undergone a fiveweek 
comprehensive maintenance check including an oldage inspection 
i tested it and there were no problems the pilot said 
leivestad said the plane had flown four or five troublefree flights 
since then 
an official of wilhelmsen said the company had chartered the 
flight for a christening in hamburg ntb reported he was not 
identified by name 
the west german navy training ship deutschland and the tender 
werra picked up 14 of the bodies according to the west german naval 
command in gluecksburg other ships and rescue helicopters were at 
the scene around nightfall 
the crash site is near shipping lanes leading from the north sea 
into the baltic 
leivestad said the pilots flying the charter flight were among 
the companys most experienced

twenty decapitated bodies have been found 
floating in a river near a jungle camp used by us antidrug agents 
but the grim discovery will not affect the bases operations a us 
embassy spokesman said friday 
the headless cadavers also without hands and feet were seen in 
the huallaga river near the usbuilt base at santa lucia 270 
miles northeast of lima 
gene bigler us embassy spokesman said agents of the us drug 
endorcement administration and peruvian police began launching 
antidrug operations from the new base thursday he said there were 
no plans to withdraw us personnel because of the bodies 
bigler would not say how many agents and contract pilots had 
moved into the base or give details on the operations 
the dea pulled out of the huallaga valley in february after a 
contract helicopter pilot was wounded in the leg by a bullet 
the discovery of bodies in the jungle is not a great novelty 
bigler said were fully aware that there is a threat and we make 
every effort to protect our people 
its a war and there is a risk 
perus armed forces are battling maoist shining path guerrillas 
who often work in alliance with drug traffickers in the upper 
huallaga river valley one of the worlds largest sources of coca 
leaf the raw material for cocaine 
the army launched an offensive against the guerrillas in the 
upper huallaga valley in july and since then some villagers have 
claimed civilians disappeared after being detained by troops 
military authorities in lima said they had received no report on 
the cadavers 
bigler said it was not known who the victims were but because 
of the removal of the hands theres speculation they may be 
traffickers 
he said removing the hands would make identification of the 
bodies difficult but he did not elbaorate 
bigler said the bodies had been seen at the beginning of this 
week and not on thursday as a dea spokesman in washington reported 
the dea spokesman frank shults said friday we have no idea 
if this was meant to be a signal to anybody to what purpose and to 
whom there was no note no messenger no nothing no one knows what 
to make of it 
he added it was an unfriendly message to be sure 
the embassy spokesman said the bodies apparently were seen over a 
period of several days 
an associated press reporter who visited the region last week was 
told by a village official in la morada 15 miles upstream from the 
santa lucia base that decapitated bodies were seen shortly after 
army troops took away 18 villagers for questioning on aug 19 
on monday an old woman saw two headless bodies beside the 
trail to the river said the official who asked not to be 
identified out of fear for his life the next day three bodies 
without heads came by in the river and on wednesday five more 
bodies 
army units have been blamed for the deaths of numerous civilians 
in counterinsurgency campaigns in the mountainous region of ayacucho 
southeast of lima where the shining path began its revolt in 1980 
in august londonbased amnesty international issued a report 
accusing perus security forces of massive human rights violations 
in the fight against leftist rebels 
it said a pall of terror had settled over much of peru 
because of violence by both the rebels and government forces 
assassinations and sabotage by the guerrillas has been met with 
abductions torture and killings of suspects by security forces the

president bush buoyed by a poll showing high 
public approval for his antidrug policies said friday the nation 
is fighting for its very soul in the war on drugs 
speaking to a meeting of the us hispanic chamber of commerce 
the president cited statistics that last year 23 million americans 
had used drugs at least once in the previous month and that during 
the year 8 million people had used cocaine 1 million of them once 
a week or more 
he added 
last year hundreds of thousands of babies were born to mothers 
who use drugs babies born desperately sick weeks or months 
premature 
a nation with those numbers cannot long preserve its very 
soul 
later in a speech to the national baptist convention here bush 
said that the drug crisis and other problems facing the nation are 
all related to another serious problem the decline of the most 
basic institution of all the decline of the american family 
we must work together to save the american family he said in 
a crusadelike call to give children the love and support that will 
prompt them to choose education over the easy money of crime 
how can you teach respect for a hardearned dollar when that 
easy drug money flourishes out there on the streets he asked to 
applause and how can you persuade young men and women to have 
faith in themselves when their mother and dad have lost all faith 
bush flew to new orleans a day after a washington postabc news 
poll showed broad public support for the 79 billion antidrug 
strategy he unveiled tuesday 
bushs two appearances here were part of his campaign to rally 
public support for his drugfighting strategy 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters that 
september is the critical month for the campaign as the 
administration works to gain support while congress is working on 
the federal budget 
the white house was clearly pleased at the poll results showing 
75 percent of those surveyed approved of bushs handling of the drug 
crisis and 82 percent approved of the proposals he announced tuesday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater passed out copies of the 
poll to reporters flying with the president to new orleans circling 
the most positive results 
he did not circle a finding that three out of four people do not 
believe bush is going far enough to attack the root causes of the 
drug problem 
but fitzwater did say we appreciate the fact that people want 
to keep the pressure on us well be working to make it tougher 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people was among those saying the 
presidents plan does not go far enough 
weve got to convince him that you cant win a war unless 
youre willing to spend the money you cant win a war with a 
whimper hooks said after hearing bushs speech friday whatever 
it costs will be small compared to the price of defeat 
bush in his remarks to the business group addressed that 
criticism saying those who judge the strategy by its price tag 
alone dont understand the problem he said he said his plan is a 
comprehensive program that touches every aspect of the drug 
problem 
nobody believes it will be easy bush added 
however he said later in his speech to the baptists realize 
that nobodys going to do it exactly my way i would be very close 
minded if said you cant have this change or another 
he continued to reject any idea that taxes be raised to pay for a 
broader drug war 
the american people know that to some the first and only answer 
is to hit the working man or woman with more taxes that is not the 
right answer he said to applause from the hispanic audience 
sununu addressing criticism that bushs package is not tough 
enough to reign in drug trade and curb illegal drug use told 
reporters that bush did not want to make the antidrug effort so 
tough that it would take away peoples constitutional rights 
i dont think it would have been appropriate to propose a 
suspending of constitutional rights i think the president wants to 
go as far as he can without such action sununu said 
despite early democratic criticism the chief of staff said he 
was pleased that congress seems to be getting into the swim of 
things 
the senate ought to be complimented for voting on thursday to 
cut 45 million from it own funds to spend the money on the drug war 
as to the administrations position should congress approve more 
money for the drug war than the 79 billion bush proposes sununu 
said that would be difficult given the constraints of the budget 
compromise the administration reached with congress earlier this 
year 
sununu added however that if they can find an appropriate 
readjustment of priorities in shuffling around money were not 
going to be closeminded if there are good suggestions that come 
from congress 
bushs program seeking 716 million more than already proposed 
in his budget emphasizes a crackdown on drug users and more money 
for prisons law enforcement and treatment centers as well as more 
money to attack the problem in drugproducing countries

thieves with a penchant for travel recently 
returned a wooden rabbit used as lawn ornament along with 48 photos 
showing the rambling rabbit in such faroff locales as reno nev 
and the virgin islands 
the rabbit was taken last december from the lawn of harry and 
louise wests reistertown home it reappeared in august propped on 
the windshield of the couples car next to a bag of photographs 
there are all kinds of pictures one where hes building a sand 
castle one where hes looking at the bus station one at the 
airport said louise west 68 it was gone about a year and just 
about two weeks ago my husband went out to get the sunday paper and 
it was sitting on the car 
we were angry for a while but then we just forgot about the 
missing rabbit said west 67 the rabbit really got around in 
those eight months and even had been given a name by its 
kidnappers 
mrs west said the location where the photograph was take was 
written on the back of each picture and the initials sbr 
presumably for stolen bunny rabbit were written in the margin of 
one 
the rabbit went west to utah kansas city mo and reno then 
back east to sample the bigcity life of new york philadelphia and 
atlantic city nj 
photographs were also taken at the wright brothers museum in 
kitty hawk nc floridas disney world annapolis md bermuda 
and st thomas 
the welltraveled hare was even photographed with baltimore mayor 
kurt schmoke who is shown holding it in his right hand 
how in the world the person got the mayor to pose with the 
rabbit i cant imagine west told the carroll county times 
but schmoke never saw or touched the rabbit his press secretary 
clinton coleman said friday 
the mayor has never seen the rabbit hes never held onto that 
rabbit before coleman said apparently its somebodys idea of 
a joke 
in one photograph a woman wearing sunglasses is holding the 
rabbit but mrs west said she did not recognize her 
two of them are a photograph with a girl in it and another is a 
scuba diver a girl mrs west said but we dont know who did 
it really its not anybody that i recognize 
the rabbits rambles were similar to the journey earlier this 
year of grumpy one of seven lawn dwarfs who disappeared from the 
front of a saugerties ny couples home on march 16 
the 80pound lawn ornament returned april 26 with an 
accompanying envelope containing 35 photographs of his travels 
which included visits to new yorks yankee stadium colorado the 
carolinas texas and st louis

more than half the money to pay for president 
bushs war on drugs would be cut from programs that primarily assist 
lowincome families and less than onefifth would come from defense 
a private research group said 
the center on budget and policy priorities a 
foundationsupported nonpartisan group generally identified with 
liberal positions said 410 million or 55 per cent of the 751 
million in cuts would come from lowincome programs 
the center also argued all those cuts would reduce or terminate 
programs while the only cut from the pentagon budget would merely 
force postponment until a future year of the purchase of a 132 
million communications system 
the organization analyzed proposed reductions in funds for public 
housing juvenile justice and assistance to recent immigrants 
it took issue with bushs statement in his speech tuesday that he 
is targeting 50 million to fight crime in public housing projects 
to help restore order and to kick out the dealers for good 
the president failed to note that funds for these efforts would 
come from cutbacks in funds for the basic operation of such 
projects the center said 
specifically the president proposes cutting by 50 million the 
amount that the house of representatives has recently appropriated 
for fiscal year 1990 federal subsidies for the operation of public 
housing projects 
thus on the one hand the president is proposing to rid public 
housing of drugs by providing the funds to hire additional security 
guards and support innovative drug reduction programs the group 
said on the other hand the presidents proposal will allow 
for further physical deterioration of the housing conditions which 
in turn could hamper drug eradication efforts 
the report also criticized bushs proposal to cut 40 million 
from grants to states for juvenile justice and juvenile deliquency 
prevention programs the reagan and bush administrations have sought 
to eliminate the programs on grounds their goals including keeping 
young prisoners separate from adults have been met 
but the center said 1987 justice department figures show only 
about half the states in full or substantial compliance with the 
separation of prisoners the house has approved 69 million for the 
programs which bush wants reduced to 29 million 
the largest reduction proposed to fund the drug strategy the 
center said is a 320 million cut in grants to states for 
financial medical and education aid to 3 million recent immigrants 
who gained temporary legal status under the 1986 immigration reform 
act 
the administration says the appropriation can be safely reduced 
because states have been slow to spend 16 billion already 
appropriated the center agreed states have been spending the money 
more slowly than expected but quoted the congressional budget 
office as saying all of the appropriated funds would be used by the 
end of 1994

hurricane gabrielle churned north toward canadas 
maritime provinces with 100mph winds friday after brushing by 
bermuda and tropical storm felix was expected to be gobbled up by 
the bigger storm 
swells of 20 feet hit the eastern tip of bermuda causing damage 
to a house thursday as winds on the fringes of gabrielle gusted to 
35 mph said the national hurricane center in suburban coral gables 
they were right on the edge of the hurricane so they really 
didnt get very much at least in terms of wind and rain said 
meteorologist jack beven the seas and waves are something else 
entirely 
marine traffic was idled in bermuda as the storm stirred up 
10foot swells even in harbors heavy surf from new england to 
central florida also was blamed on gabrielle 
at 1030 pm edt the center of gabrielle the second hurricane 
of the season to approach bermuda was located near 378 north 
latitude and 597 west longitude or about 425 miles south of sable 
island nova scotia 
the center is already east of the easternmost longitude of nova 
scotia which should keep hurricanestrength winds away from 
canada beven said it may come closer to newfoundland than nova 
scotia although at this time were not predicting it to go over 
either one 
the hurricane was moving north at 12 mph but forecasters 
expected a turn to the northnortheast in the next day 
a gradual decrease in strength and forward speed is projected in 
the next day or two but gabrielle which peaked at 135 mph should 
keep hurricanestrength winds of at least 74 mph for at least three 
days beven said 
meanwhile felix which has rumbled around the atlantic as both a 
storm and a weak hurricane was expected to rapidly weaken in the 
next 12 to 24 hours as gabrielle cuts into it 
felix also was expected to lose all tropical characteristics the 
hurricane center said it would issue no more advisories on the 
system 
at 6 pm edt felix was located near 45 degrees north latitude 
and 43 degrees west longitude or about 500 miles east southeast of 
cape race newfoundland and moving to the northeast at 15 mph 
five hurricanes have formed in the current atlantic hurricane

the bush administration the most powerful 
opponent of gov mario cuomos plan to tear down the shoreham 
nuclear power plant got permission thursday to join the state court 
fight against the governor 
state supreme court justice f warren travers ruled that the 
federal department of energy was an interested party in the case 
through its ownership of the brookhaven national laboratory on long 
island 
travers noted that brookhaven lies on 5000 acres of federal land 
and that the doe intends to purchase 41000 megawatt hours of 
electricity from lilco this year at a cost of more than 3 million 
here where doe is a landowner and user of power provided by 
lilco the court in its discretion determines that doe should be 
allowed to and is granted permission to intervene the judge said 
in new york the state supreme court is a triallevel court 
cuomo spokesman gary fryer said the decision was not surprising 
but said the bush administration was obviously trying to defend 
their ideological interests here regardless of the cost to the 
ratepayers of long island 
cuomo has argued that operating shoreham or simply mothballing 
it as the bush administration has suggested would be more 
expensive than tearing it down 
the bush administration which is also battling the shoreham 
agreement before the federal nuclear regulatory commission has said 
it would be foolish to dismantle a completed nuclear power plant 
under the shoreham deal negotiated by cuomo and long island 
lighting company officials the state will buy the 55 billion 
finished plant on long island from lilco for 1 and have it 
dismantled at lilcos expense 
in return lilco gets at least a decade of annual electric rate 
increases of about 5 percent each the shoreham project had taken 
lilco to the brink of bankruptcy and lilco customers already pay 
among the highest rates in the nation 
should the agreement be completed it would be the first time a 
completed nuclear power plant was torn down without going to full 
power the pact already has been approved by the required state 
agencies and by lilco stockholders 
cuomo and local long island officials have argued that shoreham 
shouldnt operate because the suffolk county area couldnt be safely 
evacuated in an emergency 
the doe is joining a lawsuit filed against the shoreham agreement 
by the conservativeoriented atlantic legal foundation the lawsuit 
asks travers to rule that cuomos shorehamclosing deal is illegal 
the lawsuit argues among other points that cuomo usurped the 
power of the state legislature in negotiating the shoreham deal

the government began presenting 
evidence thursday in an 810 million civil suit against ferdinand 
marcos the first case against the ousted president to be tried in a 
philippine court 
the suit is among 35 civil actions filed by the government in 
1987 to recover the billions of dollars marcos and his associates 
allegedly embezzled before he was ousted in 1986 and forced into 
exile in hawaii 
solicitor gen frank chavez said he hoped the trial would 
convince courts in switzerland and elsewhere to speed up proceedings 
to recover money that marcos allegedly stashed abroad 
government lawyers said they will show that marcos and his wife 
imelda owned properties worth far more than they could afford on 
income declared in tax returns 
eliseo pitargue intelligence chief of the bureau of internal 
revenue testified that between 1960 and 1984 the couple declared 
total assets of 657000 
the government claims marcos and his friends embezzled up to 10 
billion 
president corazon aquino has refused to allow marcos to return to 
the philippines citing national security marcos is reported in 
critical condition at a honolulu hospital where he has been 
confined since january with heart kidney and lung failure 
marcos and imelda were indicted by a us federal grand jury in 
1988 on racketeering charges but they have not been criminally 
charged in the philippines because the constitution allows them to 
return to face their accusers 
meanwhile a marcos spokesman returned to the philippines on 
thursday after quitting his job and giving up an appeal for asylum 
in the united states 
guillermo gemmo trinidad 45 arrived on a flight from 
honolulu officials said there were no charges pending against him 
trinidad entered the united states in march 1986 on a tourist 
visa one month after marcos was ousted in a popular uprising and 
forced into exile in hawaii 
after the immigration and naturalization service began 
deportation proceedings against him in january for overstaying his 
visa trinidad applied for political asylum claiming his life would 
be in danger in the philippines 
his attorney ronald oldenburg said trinidad withdrew the 
application for political asylum tuesday and the us granted him a 
voluntary departure order meaning the deportation proceedings would 
be suspended 
also thursday mrs aquino said there would be no whitewash 
of a congressman accused of gun smuggling she defended her brother 
against rumors he was involved 
customs agents at ninoy aquino international airport seized 314 
handguns and rifles from baggage allegedly belonging to rep nicanor 
de guzman and businessman ponciano datu who arrived tuesday on a 
flight from san francisco 
de guzman a member of the proaquino struggle of the democratic 
filipino party denies the weapons were his de guzman went on 
indefinite leave without pay thursday pending the outcome of the 
investigation 
i will be sharing with you whatever reports come in to assure 
you that definitely there will be no whitewash mrs aquino said 
at a news conference 
mrs aquino also said her politically powerful brother rep jose 
cojuangco jr assured her that he was not involved in gun 
smuggling as some manila newspapers alleged 
opposition politicians and several newspapers claim mrs aquinos 
relatives are guilty of the same brand of influencepeddling that 
was rampant under marcos

a former ptl board member testified 
thursday he didnt know about hush money paid jessica hahn until two 
months before bakker quit the television ministry over the sex and 
money scandal 
i never knew the name jessica hahn until january 1987 ernie 
franzone of fort lauderdale fla said at bakkers federal trial on 
fraud and conspiracy charges 
other testimony centered on cash flow problems at the ministry 
including problems at its flagship hotel at the same time bakker was 
insisting on such touches as a 15000 chandelier despite millions 
of dollars that were pledged daily 
ptl paid ms hahn 265000 in 1985 to keep quiet about her sexual 
encounter with bakker on dec 6 1980 at a florida hotel bakker 
resigned in march 1987 as ptl chief the hahn payment was made by 
ptls builder who then added the amount to his bill 
bakker 49 is being tried on 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
prosecutors say bakker used nearly 4 million in ministry funds 
obtained from the sale of partnerships in the ministrys hotel to 
bankroll his extravagant lifestyle 
thursdays was the first full day of testimony after the trial 
resumed following bakkers breakdown and commitment in a federal 
prison for psychiatric evaluation last week 
us district judge robert potter let the trial resume wednesday 
and denied a defense motion for a mistrial after a government 
psychiatrist that bakker had suffered a panic attack last week 
but was competent to stand trial 
bakkers lawyers asked the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 
richmond on thursday to halt bakkers trial citing possible grand 
jury misconduct 
the lawyers claim ms hahn told charlotte radio station wrfx that 
grand jurors approached her in a courtroom restroom and asked for 
her autograph during a break in her testimony in september 1987 
bakkers attorneys contend the grand jurors violated their oath 
of impartiality one of the lawyers harold bender said he had no 
word on the status of the appeal 
bakker was composed during thursdays testimony taking notes and 
talking with his attorneys as witnesses testified as he left the 
courtroom late in the afternoon bakker waved to supporters and 
said im looking for the weekend 
franzone regional manager of the company that managed bakkers 
heritage grand hotel said he wouldnt have approved bonuses for 
bakker his wife tammy and former ptl executive vice president 
richard dortch had he known about ms hahn dortch has been 
sentenced to eight years in prison and fined 200000 for his guilty 
plea to four fraud and conspiracy charges 
that would have been the red light for me franzone 
testified i would have taken another look at whether i would have 
stayed on the board 
franzone also said he never remembered voting a bonus for bakker 
of more than 100000 although the boards minutes show bakker 
frequently received bonuses double that amount 
but he said he approved bonuses up to 100000 because i 
believed ptl was in good financial condition so many things were 
positive about ptl so much was being done so well 
franzone also said he never was told that bonuses were usually 
doubled so the recipients could pay the income tax on them 
in other testimony lamar kerstetter a retired pennsylvania coal 
miner said he purchased a family fun partnership from ptl in 
march 1987 the same month that bakker resigned 
assistant us attorney jerry miller asked kerstetter what he 
expected to get for his 1000 payment to ptl 
my four days and three nights of free lodging kerstetter 
responded i was buying a product i was buying lodging and use of 
the park 
after discovering that the free lodging offer was good only for 
the uncompleted towers hotel rather than the ministrys heritage 
grand hotel in fort mill sc kerstetter asked for a refund he 
said he got a letter dated about the time the ministry filed for 
bankruptcy saying he could not get a refund immediately because ptl 
was in a crucial period in its transition 
dana angel of atlantic beach fla and her mother lila angel 
89 testified that they jointly bought a lifetime partnership in 
1986 putting 500 each on their credit cards so she and her mother 
could spend a week at the heritage grand hotel 
lila angel testified that she enjoyed going to heritage usa but 
that she expected a return for her money 
i worked until i was 77 and i save my pennies i still do 
that 500 was quite a bit of money for me she said 
the prosecution also presented witnesses who testified about 
bakkers buying habits 
frederick gunzel who operates an air charter service said he 
was hired to fly bakker and his wife tammy from charlotte to palm 
springs calif and back at a cost of 102000 in july 1984 
ron shue a salesman for beck mercedes in charlotte said he sold 
two 1987 mercedes 560sl sedans to bakker one for 61191 and the 
other for 59000 he said a used 1985 mercedes station wagon was 
purchased for the bakkers children at a cost of 28000 
earlier a former ptl bookkeeper testified that during one week 
in 1986 ptl raised 17 million and deposited more than 365000 in 
cash donations 
delores jones who kept the weekly ledger of contributions 
beginning in 1981 said the ministry collected 20000 in cash from

on sept 30 1987 wright investors service 
published a rare special report warning that stocks were overpriced 
and headed for a sharp and substantial decline 
in some ways said wright an international firm based in 
bridgeport conn the current situation is comparable to that 
which preceded the great stock market crash of 1929 
barely two weeks later on oct 19 1987 the market collapsed 
again 
this week wright issued another special report to document our 
view that a stock market correction one stopping far short of the 
decline witnessed two years ago but significant nevertheless does 
indeed lie ahead 
the firm which handles portfolios in the billions of dollars and 
advises the trust departments of many banks prides itself on 
objective analysis rather than opinion which is often the staple of 
brokerage house forecasts 
in 1987 for example it observed that the priceearnings ratio 
of the standard amp poors composite index was exceptionally high at 
22 higher even than the 199 prior to the 1929 crash and it noted 
that the dividend yield of the sampp 500stock index of 26 percent 
was approaching the 3 percent of 1929 
this weeks report offers this rationale 
1 stock prices are too high relative to both historical 
valuations and the current level of interest rates 
2 the us economy is in the process of slowing 
3 corporate profit growth is about to come to a halt 
conclusion this combination of factors suuggests to us that a 
significant reversal of the stock markets recent gains may be under 
way before 1989 is over 
partly obscuring the current vulnerability wright says is the 
fact that priceearnings ratios at 14 are not exceptionally high 
still they are higher than the post1950 average of 12 based on 
the sampp 500stock index 
what happens when profits decline already wright points out 
growth of real profits after taxes excluding profits from 
inventory inflation and adjusted for depreciation have slowed 14 
percent from the 1986 peak 
the special report states that stock prices appear in their worst 
light when matched against corporate book values both the dow jones 
industrial average and the sampp 500 are now priced at 24 times book 
value 
wright comments that since 1930 the market has been priced 
higher relative to book value only once in the summer of 1987 just 
before the stock market crash 
while some analysts minimize the significance of book values 
some of which have been distorted by corporate repurchases of 
shares wright calls attention to a recurring phenomenon for 40 
years two times book value has put a ceiling on prices 
such factors become even more significant as the economy slows 
adjusted for inflation retail sales are only 1 percent ahead of 
last years pace factory orders are down manufacturing activity 
has leveled off 
wright also refers to the money supply in support of its 
conclusions despite recent easing the money supply fell 25 
percent in the year ended june 1989 since 1954 declines of that 
magnitude have been followed by recession 
corporate profits offer little support for the market already 
profit growth has slowed real profits after taxes excluding 
profits from inventory inflation and adjusted for depreciation are 
well below their peaks 
since 1986 wright observes real corporate profits from 
operations have declined 14 percent in its opinion further 
deterioration is likely 
since stocks often interact with the level of interest rates on 
bonds wright examined that too and found it negative 
to bring stock and bond prices into relationship with averages 
over the 19691988 period wright believes one or a combination of 
these would have to occur 
1 a corporate earnings rise unlikely of 12 percent to 15 
percent 
2 a reduction of bond yields by about one full percentage point 
3 a fall off in stock prices of more than 10 percent 
in summary wright is telling clients that the returns on stocks 
are likely to be negative over the next 12 to 18 months and that 
they might be better off in longterm bonds 
by then the old relationships of the various averages are likely 
to be restored then wright says we anticipate the start of a 
new bull market

this is one of a series of periodic reports 
looking ahead to western europe in 1992 when the 12 nations of the 
european economic community remove their trade barriers and 
interlock their policies and goals 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
some 70 years after the habsburgs 
hohenzollerns and romanovs lost their rule over more than half of 
europe aristocrats from portugal to the balkans see a greater role 
for the nobility after 1992 
that is when the 12 nations of the european economic community 
open their borders to each other take down old trade barriers and 
become more closely linked 
more than 200 princes counts and other bluebloods from 11 
countries gathered here recently for the 12th congress of the 
information and liaison commission of european nobility associations 
to redefine their mission in the modern world and they had a lot to 
say about their places in europe after 1992 
addressing the congress at an uppercrust oporto hotel baron 
bernard snoy of belgium said noble traditions of cosmopolitan 
spirit courage selflessness and the motto jamais mediocre 
never mediocre meant ancient families should provide social moral 
and cultural leadership 
he added that 1992 will be a unique occasion for our 
families to rediscover their identity and renew their raison 
detre 
the congress was conducted in french 
snoy noted proudly that a dozen nobles already are members of the 
518member european parliament and many are fully integrated in 
other eec institutions such as the court of justice and the 
european investment bank 
count richard coudenhovekalgeri born of austrian and japanese 
parents in bohemia now part of czechoslovakia produced the first 
modern project for a united europe in his book pan europe 
published in 1923 in 1946 he founded the european parliamentary 
union a precursor of todays european parliament 
otto von habsburg son of emperor charles and the empress zita 
the austrohungarian monarchs succeeded kalgeri as president of the 
paneuropean union in 1973 
habsburg who was reelected to the european parliament in june 
favors the adoption of eec passports for people of the 12 member 
nations belgium britain denmark france west germany greece 
ireland italy luxembourg netherlands portugal and spain 
he maintains eec must expand and keep its doors open to all 
european peoples 
said prince johannes zu loewensteinwertheimrosenberg president 
of the west german association of aristocratic unions as europe 
grows together aristocracy definitely has something to contribute 
weve always been more european than narrowly nationalist 
loewenstein whose ancestors hobnobbed with modern germanys 
founding father prince otto von bismarck cited the habit of 
frances king louis xiv of inviting english gentlemen to supper 
even when the two countries were at war 
he noted that the habsburg emperor franz joseph even lent 
serbias chief of staff his personal carriage to leave austria when 
they went to war in 1914 
a landowner and consultant for a private bank in frankfurt in 
west germany the silverhaired loewenstein said german nobility are 
careful not to make potentially controversial political statements 
he refused to comment for example on the question of reunification 
of germany 
standing next to blue and gold heraldic tapestries outside the 
congress hall the russian prince serge obolensky sipped from a 
longstemmed glass and pondered the changes in the soviet union 
which his family fled in 1920 when he was 2 years old 
he said he is not too optimistic about president mikhail s 
gorbachevs glasnost and perestroika reforms 
twice in soviet history weve seen major attempts at reform 
one was the new economic policy in the 1920s and the other was 
khrushchevs attempt in the 1950s both failed he said 
referring to the late soviet leader nikita s khrushchev 
im still waiting to see real signs of change ive been 
waiting for over 60 years 
the year 1992 also marks the 200th anniversary of the final 
demise of the french monarchy following the 1789 revolution king 
louis xvi was executed in january 1793 along with his austrian 
wife marie antoinette 
modernday aristocrats loewenstein says must serve as a social 
example because of their educational and economic priveleges 
while german aristocrats make up about 08 percent of the 
countrys 61 million people they account for 15 percent of 
toplevel banking executives and 8 percent to 10 percent of the 
countrys politicians he said 
in britain where the royal family and pageantry are part of 
national life a sunday times magazine study found that of the 
countrys 200 richest people were 11 of the 25 dukes six 
marquesses 14 earls and nine viscounts queen elizabeth ii is by 
far the richest with assets worth 8 billion 
in a recent interview gerald cavendish grosvenor the sixth duke 
of westminster and reputedly britains richest man with about 5 
billion said if you are given a lot i think you should give a 
lot back 
he added that it was a sense of duty that pushes him to spend 
onethird of his time supporting some 150 charities

the sexual revolution had arrived at a small 
knickknack stand outside moscows kiev train station but not to the 
liking of a middleaged woman 
what a disgrace she snapped shaking her finger at the 
girlie photos that were attacting a crowd 
why theyre only soviet women the vendor retorted 
no theyre not soviet women soviet women are always 
covered she declared and marched on 
because of people like that soviets are full of taboos the 
vendor shouted after her 
the exchange typified the small storm of controversy these days 
over the wave of what is being called erotica a rash of 
posters playing cards and calendars that would raise no eyebrows 
these days in the west 
a reporter for the communist party newspaper pravda in 
novosibirsk was outraged that kiosks in that siberian city were 
plastered with photos of naked women aimed at the dubious tastes 
of young and aging sex maniacs 
such decadence and vulgarity compromise the openness fostered 
by the kremlins reforms yuri solomenko wrote 
on the contrary argued natalia rtishcheva in an article 
published in the weekly literaturnaya gazeta supporting steamier 
love scenes 
finally weve proven that soviet people have a sexual 
imagination she wrote and our men and women do occasionally 
get into bed intending to do more than read a tome of their favorite 
poet 
all pornography has long been banned in the soviet union 
although a black market in smuggled videos and magazines flourishes 
love scenes in soviet movies never went beyond staid embraces and 
the heroic figures of official soviet art were always decorously 
clothed 
rtishcheva said her mother started to cry after watching little 
vera the movie that shocked soviet viewers last year with a sex 
scene that would barely get an american movie an r rating 
there was nothing to comfort her with she wrote in the 
literary journal the times of shy kisses and the embarrassed 
ladies of the comedies of the prewar period have truly passed 
in august the hot movie in moscow was interdevochka 
intergirl a sympathetic portrayal of a prostitute who plies 
her trade for foreign currency marries a swede and escapes her 
sordid hotel life only to be tortured by nostalgia and her past 
reputation 
crowds pack the theater to see hookerwithheart tanya zaitseva 
played by yelena yakovleva strut in skimpy underwear and suffer 
the lucrative advances of a japanese businessman 
the kremlins new tolerance along with its economic reforms 
brought about the surge of softporn the main producers of 
fleshshot postcards posters and calendars are cooperatives the 
private businesses created to fill gaps in consumer demand 
the producers sensed a hot market and turned out nudewithsnake 
posters available around moscow and girlie playing cards on sale 
next to kitsch paintings at the capitals main art fair at izmailovo 
park 
artists at izmailovo and along the arbat pedestrian mall are also 
turning out a great many idealized nudes that would look equally at 
home on black velvet at an american flea market 
the vendor outside the kiev train station copies pictures from 
western skin magazines and pastes them to cardboardandfelt wallets 
that he can then sell for a hefty 13 people complain about the 
prices he said but they buy 
in another example of the new soviet permissiveness moscows 
arbat restaurant features male and female dancers with nothing but 
gstrings in a suggestive pasdedeux on a recent evening the show 
was in such demand diners could gain entrance only by bribing the 
doorman 
nudity in the theater is also on the rise and leningrad now has 
a modern dance group that residents refer to as the erotic 
ballet 
the trend of sexual glasnost openness has its legitimate side 
as well it answers not only the hunger for sexual excitement but 
also the need for basic mastersandjohnsontype sexual information 
a recent article in the popular medical journal your health 
provides graphic tips on female sexuality and how couples can 
improve their bedroom lives its pragmatic approach bears little 
resemblance to soviet health magazines traditional reliance on 
vague abstractions about socialist families when giving sexual 
advice 
even works by sigmund freud long condemned as bourgeois 
reactionary ideology and left unpublished are coming out in record 
number printed both by cooperatives and by the state publishing 
committee goskomizdat 
although there is still virtually no sex education as such a 
powerful publicity campaign against aids is under way 
a recent interdevochka screening was preceded by a 
hardhitting documentary on aids aimed at young people but it did 
not offer any hints on how to obtain condoms and disposable needles 
which are in such short supply they are in demand on the black 
market

arleigh burke has slowed his pace from the 
boilerbursting speeds that got him the nickname 31knot burke 
in world war ii but the retired admiral still feels a sailors tug 
toward the sea at age 87 
the first ship in an advanced class of guided missile destroyers 
will be christened with burkes name next saturday at a maine 
shipyard and the former chief of naval operations under president 
eisenhower is eager for a sea trial 
theyve already promised me that i can take her to sea 
someday burke said in an interview it isnt that i want to 
make sure the ship is up to snuff i want to see if im still up to 
snuff 
the arleigh burke is one of only three navy vessels to be named 
for a living individual also honored before their deaths were 
former rep carl vinson dga and adm hyman g rickover 
burke shrugs off his wartime exploits as commander of the 
little beavers destroyer squadron which fought 22 combat 
engagements in the pacific in a fourmonth period and his prescient 
actions as chief of naval operations for an unprecedented six years 
19551961 
the nicest thing about the navy is that people give credit for 
things that were done by a lot of other people said burke you 
suddenly realize when you get to be an old man that what youre 
getting credit for is what other people did 
it was in the battle of cape st george in the solomon islands 
that burke gained the 31knot nickname as he pushed his squadron 
forward on thanksgiving day 1943 to keep the japanese from 
evacuating buka island 
burkes message to us transports lying ahead stand aside 
im coming through at 31 knots 
when the battle was over the squadron had sunk three japanese 
destroyers in what the naval war college later called an almost 
perfect action 
in his postbattle report burke attributed the success of the 
operation in part to the luck of good timing and said the battle 
should clearly demonstrate that the fortune of war is a fickle 
wench and that results hang by a narrow thread 
the little beavers so named because burke trimmed each ship with 
an insignia representing a red ryder comic strip character by that 
name were credited with destroying one japanese cruiser nine 
destroyers one submarine several smaller vessels and about 30 
enemy aircraft from november 1943 to february 1944 
one young ensign who went on to become a vice admiral raymond e 
peet recalled of burke the squadron would have gone any place 
with that man if he were going to take us to japan we were all 
ready to go he was that type of leader 
in march 1944 burke was assigned as chief of staff to rear adm 
marc a mitscher commander of the carrier task force that executed 
attacks on iwo jima okinawa and tokyo mitscher who initially had 
misgivings about taking on a nonaviator as chief of staff later 
praised burke as the most outstanding tactician and the most 
experienced officer in the american fleet 
burke recalls that he made it a point to prove himself as an 
aviator while assigned to the task force saying i felt i couldnt 
be chief of staff to an aviation outfit unless i could fly 
he flew combat missions and was aboard two ships the bunker 
hill and enterprise that were hit by japanese suicide planes in 
the okinawa campaign 
over his wartime years burke was honored with 13 decorations 
including the navy cross two distinguished service medals two 
legions of merit and the silver star medal 
after the war burke found himself engaged in new battles at 
home he fell into disfavor with some pentagon officials for his 
role in the 1949 admirals revolt against plans to place more 
emphasis on the air force b36 bomber 
his name was stricken from a naval promotions list and restored 
only after intervention by thenchief of naval operations adm 
forrest sherman 
in 1955 burke reluctantly agreed to serve as eisenhowers chief 
of naval operations when he was tapped over 92 more senior officers 
burke expressed concern he had been selected because they 
thought i might be a pushover but his cno predecessor and 
longtime friend adm robert b carney assured him that if that 
were the case they are due for a hell of a surprise 
as cno burkes priorities included pushing for new 
antisubmarine technology upgrading the us submarine fleet 
developing new missile systems including one that became the polaris 
missile reinforcing the navies of us allies particularly japan 
and improving communication and morale within the navy 
twice he argued against reappointment to another twoyear term 
and twice he agreed to stay on at eisenhowers insistence when 
president kennedy offered him a fourth term burke insisted on 
retiring at age 59 
following his retirement burke served on the boards of numerous 
corporations and worked with organizations such as the boy scouts of 
america he and his wife roberta whom he married the day he 
graduated from the naval academy in 1923 had no children 
looking back over his military career burke recalls most fondly 
his first command the destroyer mugford in 1939 
a ship to a sailor particularly a first ship is always the 
most memorable one he said the first time a man is skipper of 
a ship he thinks that there is no ship like that before thats ever 
been made

with the fall tubewatching season at hand its 
perhaps fitting that on wednesday abc news the koppel report 
special will devote a primetime hour to what television hath 
wrought 
some americans will say tv hath wrought many awful shows way too 
many commercials and way way too many promotions for more awful 
shows 
but ted koppels television revolution in a box isnt about 
that rather it concerns the worldwide impact of new technology 
portable satellite dishes videocassette recorders and camcorders 
on newsgathering global politics and history itself 
he calls it the democratization of television a wide range 
of viewing options not possible in the oldtech days when power over 
what viewers were offered largely was restricted to government or a 
few megabuck conglomerates 
ironically that democratization has in a sense made possible 
what once was the unthinkable in network news at least where koppel 
is concerned 
had abc news president roone arledge turned down koppels 
proposal for what became wednesdays report the nightline 
anchorman says the program still could have emerged elsewhere on 
tv although not on a rival network 
and even with abc airing it koppel still can eventually sell the 
program domestically even to cable companies and overseas a year 
after its abc broadcast he says 
the reason koppels abc contract signed last year in which his 
own company koppel communications inc produces the koppel 
report specials in cooperation with abc news as the credits 
say 
the deal was made public when signed but it still strikes some 
as unusual as if say a mildmannered reporter for a great 
metropolitan newspaper got a new contract in which the founder of 
clark kent communications inc would henceforth produce features 
for the daily planet 
koppel himself says he thinks his abc deal is unprecedented 
under its terms he says he makes koppel report proposals to 
arledge if the abc news chief says no dice koppel is free to take 
the idea elsewhere 
but the freedom is restricted unlike the network entertainment 
side of things there in an unusual move nbc recently asked 
abcowned abc productions to create and produce for it a primetime 
drama series 
im precluded by my contract from selling to nbc cbs cnn and 
fox koppel says referring to both koppel reports that have 
been or will be made and reports proposals that abc news turns 
down 
with programs his company makes for abc he says the network 
owns the rights for a year and can air the shows twice during that 
time on the first anniversary of a given programs broadcast both 
its domestic and overseas rights revert to his company he says 
the company already has sold one report overseas last 
aprils special on drugrelated crime in urban ghettos that used the 
nations capital as its focus and was called dc divided city 
japans nhk network bought that one he says he doesnt know 
what accounted for nhks purchase but they were enormously 
interested in it they were the ones who came after it the most 
anxiously 
koppel who has been with abc news for 26 years thinks its very 
likely that others in network news eventually will do as hes done 
form news production companies of their own 
the fact of the matter is there are now so many potential 
customers out there for programs its not that the audience is 
getting any larger but the number of customers for programs is 
getting larger 
it harks back to what hed been saying earlier he says 
referring to the technological change in television that has widened 
both viewing choices and program markets 
twenty years ago he said alluding to the three major tv 
networks you only had three customers and if you wanted to sell 
something else on television where were you going to sell it

each include a novella and a series of short stories they were 
published in english by china books and each sells for 1695 
for westerners the books reveal in fascinating detail the rigors 
of daily life in a society that only recently has begun to open 
itself to outside scrutiny both women have the ability to express 
the anger humiliation and fear experienced by many during the 
cultural revolution and the newfound optimism in the days since 
both authors have paid dearly for this expertise 
nineteensixtysix was the hardest time recalls cheng my 
family was raided and my grandmother died from a heart attack right 
after the raid the cruelest part was that they not only raided your 
familys house they also forced you to accuse your parents and your 
family members to show your own attitude 
she said her husbands grandparents also faced this 
humiliation 
the red guards forced them to eat human waste she said 
they couldnt take it and they committed suicide by turning on the 
gas stove after they died nobody would even dare to take care of 
their bodies because they were so afraid of getting involved and 
getting persecuted the bodies remained unmoved for three days 
chengs own father who had worked in hong kong for a german 
company before 1949 was accused of being a spy 
i was so afraid he would commit suicide too that i would wait 
for my father every evening for him to come back she said 
the political movement after 1966 was so intense it filled 
every minute of your life people didnt talk to each other about 
other things 
wang was so young when the cultural revolution began that she and 
her classmates were at first naively pleased their classes had been 
interrupted she remembered going to her principal with her friends 
to ask if they could be allowed to join the revolution 
my mother warned me at that time not to be so active in the 
cultural revolution because even though i was allowed to join i 
wouldnt be allowed to be a red guard because my father had been 
denounced as a rightist she said 
wangs father a theater director had been named a rightist in 
the 1957 movement her mother had been a popular writer and thus 
had shared in many privileges denounced after 1966 young wang 
suddenly realized her own parents might be targeted as 
counterrevolutionaries 
we raided our own house and threw out all the books we had 
she said we waited a long time but the red guard never came 
later on my sister and i went to a village my mother went to a 
school to be reeducated my very young brother stayed in shanghai 
with the cadre 
in the books we find families who have to bid goodbye to sons 
and daughters heading for faroff army posts mothers who struggle 
to put food on the family table neighbors who try to get past class 
conflicts of the past and reflections of the romance that has 
blossomed openly between the young since the cultural revolution 
ended 
this reforms of the past several years have allowed both writers 
to travel read the literature of other nations and rediscover 
classical chinese literature which was unavailable during the 
cultural revolution 
for example the authors say that the unbearable lightness of 
being is currently one of the most popular novels in china young 
people enjoy reading jd salinger just as they do in the united 
states they said 
both women expect the reform movement to continue 
if i compared what is going on in china with what happened 
before the cultural revolution its two worlds said cheng of 
course there are some chaotic situations but i dont think that 
means the reform is bad 
wang added although people complain about inflation if you 
said ok go back to what you had before 1966 nobody would go 
back

the federal governments plan for a 9percent 
sales tax is bringing more than the usual number of protests from 
the canadian grassroots some analysts say the tax could cause 
tremendous upheaval in the economy 
there has to be a better solution said gus karagianis who 
has a placard outside his fruit king produce stand inviting 
passersby to sign a taxrevolt petition 
he showed off about 3200 signatures he said he had gathered in 
three weeks 
being a storeowner im capable of voicing my opinion he 
said regardless of whether it does any good or not just voice 
your opinion 
petitions some of them sponsored by newspapers telephone hot 
lines the inevitable slogan tshirts and buttons and even a tax 
protest song have sprung up since finance minister michael wilson 
announced the details in august of the proposed goods and services 
tax that would take effect in 1991 
the tax would replace an existing hidden 135percent 
manufacturers sales tax that the government says damages the 
canadian economys ability to compete the current tax for example 
applies only to goods manufactured domestically and not to imports 
wilson said the new tax would be revenue neutral for the 
government as compared to the current system but would raise the 
consumer price index by 225 percent in 1991 
the new tax would be felt by consumers for many goods and 
services not now covered from new houses to restaurant meals and 
even postage stamps 
basic groceries virtually all of the items sold in karagianis 
store would not be affected but the 33yearold shopkeeper said he 
believes that any measure that cuts into consumers spending power 
ultimately hurts his business 
you can only tighten the belt so much he said 
basic groceries prescription drugs health and dental care 
educational services day care and legal aid would be among the few 
categories left untouched by the new tax 
the edmonton sun newspaper in the western province of alberta 
said it has gathered from readers more than 15000 taxprotest 
coupons addressed to wilson there are a number of individuals and 
organizations who started petitions managing editor randy 
mcdonald said its been more of a grassroots thing 
taxes traditionally have been higher in canada than in the united 
states 
mcdonald said tax freedom day when citizens can stop thinking 
that their money is going to the government already is calculated 
for albertans as july 15 or 16 it was may 4 this year in the united 
states 
i think its just a matter of enoughs enough mcdonald said 
the toronto sun the edmontons suns sister newspaper in 
canadas largest city said it has taken in 138000 taxprotest 
coupons so far 
no central place has tabulated the number of canadians signing 
petitions or expressing opposition to the tax plan in other ways 
but critics of the plan say they hope that evidence of 
widespread visible discontent will persuade the government to alter 
or scrap the plan they note that it wont take effect until 1991 
when the next national election will be on the horizon and unpopular 
measures might be harder to take 
prime minister brian mulroneys progressive conservative party is 
in the first year of its second consecutive majority term another 
election will not have to be called for at least three years 
we are bringing in the new goods and services tax not because 
it is easy but because it is right mulroney told his partys 
recent convention 
wood gundy inc a prominent investments firm said in its highly 
publicized analysis of the tax plan that the inflationary impact 
would lead to higher interest rates and add to the federal budget 
deficit 
it said the bank of canada probably would use tight money policy 
to control price pressures and that unemployment would rise as a 
result possibly to 10 percent from its current level of 75 percent 
burns fry ltd said the government should call the proposed tax 
deficit neutral rather than revenue neutral as wilson 
characterized it 
the new tax would take in 47 billion 55 billion canadian 
more than is currently received but the funds would go out for 
refundable tax credits for those with income less than 25500 
30000 canadian which would lower the middleincome tax rate 
from 26 percent to 25 percent and pay for administrative costs 
the globe and mail newspaper in toronto said in an editorial 
both on the visibility and the impact of the tax the federal 
governments projections and hopes appear unrealistic and naive 
asking retailers consumers and workers to let the system work by 
being reasonable

to some parents choice means deciding not 
only which school their child will attend but also at what age to 
start them 
take tracy hill 
by the time daughter jessica was ready to turn 6 mrs hill had 
twice tinkered with jessicas birth date to meet enrollment cutoff 
dates and the entire family was confused about when to hold her 
birthday party mrs hill knows she broke the law and asked that her 
real name not be used 
we celebrated jessicas third and fourth birthdays on sept 
8 mrs hill said with a chuckle jessicas real birthday is oct 
8 
her mother explained that she had wanted her daughter when she 
was 2 to attend a private bilingual preschool with her playmates 
but the program required that children be 3 years old by sept 15 to 
be admitted 
this year mrs hill faced another problem 
she wanted to enroll jessica in a neighborhood public school 
kindergarten but the district of columbia school system says any 
child who turns 6 by dec 31 must be placed in first grade the 
preceeding september or be labeled as a slow learner 
when i saw what the firstgraders were doing i didnt want to 
see a girl who has always loved school be put in a negative 
environment where she would be forced into reading math and other 
competitive academic work before she was ready her mother said 
so mrs hill restored jessicas real birth date and entered her 
in the kindergarten of a private 6000ayear school 
schools are more concerned about statistics exclaimed willa 
hennigan another frustrated mother who tried to enroll her son in a 
public prekindergarten program in the district when he was 5 but 
was told he must enter kindergarten or the schools computer would 
list him as an atrisk child 
i think each parent ought to determine whats best for her 
child said mrs hennigan who teaches a fifthgrade class for 
gifted and talented students in suburban virginia 
at least where public schools are concerned the age at which a 
child begins his education is becoming as controversial as 
parental choice a centerpiece of president bushs education 
initiatives that would let parents decide which public school their 
child would attend 
some educators are convinced that youngsters will be more 
successful in school if they are 5 starting kindergarten others 
scoff at the notion of arbitrary age limits and favor flexible 
curricula for various maturity levels 
we agree there is a problem in that young children are not 
succeeding in kindergarten and first grade as they should but the 
problem is with the curriculum and the strategy in the way children 
are asked to learn what is inappropriate with their age group 
said barbara willer of the national association for the education of 
young children 
susan dranitzke an educational consultant who advises parents on 
their childrens school readiness said kindergarten is more like 
first grade used to be at this point the way public kindergartens 
are its probably better to have them older 
to be eligible for public school kindergartens 23 states now 
require children to be 5 years old by sept 2 ten years ago most 
states allowed youngsters to begin kindergarten if their fifth 
birthday would fall as late as november december or january 
complicating the situation for parents in five states are laws 
requiring that their children attend kindergarten those states are 
arkansas delaware rhode island south carolina and west virginia 
the district of columbia and the adjacent maryland counties of 
prince georges and montgomery have held to the dec 31 kindergarten 
eligibility date in virginia the cutoff has been moved to sept 
30 but children with later birthdays can be tested to determine if 
they are emotionally physically and intellectually ready for 
kindergarten 
david elkind professor of child study at tufts university in 
medford mass and the author of the hurried child said 
raising the entry age of children is merely a policy solution to a 
people problem and policy solutions to people problems never work 
the need is for flexible programs in kindergarten and first grades 
raising the age is not going to do anything except raise the 
curriculum he explained we need to recognize what children are 
like at that stage and then match the curriculum to the child 
indianas new school entry age law kicks in this year with a 
september cutoff date that moves up to june 1 by the 199293 school 
year 
we are not letting our kids grow up we are pushing them and i 
dont know why said rep esther wilson a thirdgrade teacher and 
state legislator who wrote and pushed through indianas law after 
nearly six years of work 
with this bill i predict the dropout rate is going to be down 
because the majority of our boys and girls will be socially and 
emotionally ready for school said wilson 
tom schultz project director for early childhood education at 
the national associaton of state boards of education said raising 
the entry age results in a problem of equity in terms of what the 
experiences will be during that extra year out of school 
by merely raising the entry age schultz said a group of kids 
who would have gone to kindergarten will sit in a preschool at home 
or at day care another year parents vary in their aility to pay for 
and provide stimulus 
we need to help teachers find ways to deal with student 
diversity he said 
one solution schultz said would be to allow children to enter 
school the month they become 5 the problem with that he added is 
that it would be difficult for teachers to adjust to new kids 
continually arriving 
another idea is cooperative learning which places a child in 
a group of youngsters with abilities similar to his own assignments 
are given to the groups so that youngsters can teach each other as 
they work together 
susan sweitzer of the gesell institute a private educational 
organization in new haven conn said 1518 percent of more than 
16000 school districts around the nation use gesells procedures to 
assess young childrens readiness to learn 
when these procedures are properly used she said school systems 
can determine which approach is suited to the needs of a particular 
child either the traditional lockstep grade system or 
alternative programs that insert a transitional year for children to 
mature before or after first grade 
i used to feel pretty strongly that the cutoff date should be 
sept 1 or aug 31 but i have really grown to an opinion of 
encouraging districts to create options from which parents can 
choose so it doesnt really matter when the cutoff date is ms 
sweitzer said 
regardless of when a child is enrolled in kindergarten all 
states require that by a certain age children must be in first 
grade in no state however is that required date set so early 
that parents do not have the freedom to delay their youngsters 
entry into kindergarten said ms weller of the national association 
for the education of young children

for hondurans in this isolated valley 
where a nicaraguan contra army has been camped the last 
yearandahalf has meant prosperity 
business is good well sell it all krystela rodriguez 
exulted she runs a shop crammed with everything from cologne and 
shampoo to powdered fruit drinks and baby shoes 
perhaps most remarkable for her 10 by 20foot shack 80 miles 
from the nearest paved road is the refrigerator which runs on 
electricity from a diesel generator that also provides power for a 
nearby contra encampment 
a cloud is on her horizon however the accord reached by central 
american leaders aug 7 calling for the contra army to disband by 
dec 8 she still has a lot of shampoo to sell and is concerned 
about being overstocked 
theres no future here after the contras leave said vladimir 
valenzuela who runs a bustling restaurant in danli 80 miles to the 
west 
eastern honduras has always been poor and sparsely populated the 
average agricultural worker earned 3 lempiras a day less than 1 
at the black market exchange rate farms were few small ranchers 
had no way to get their products to market 
the yamales area which has no more than a few hundred residents 
in normal times was almost completely abandoned in the mid1980s 
at the height of the contra campaign to topple the sandinista 
government in nicaragua 
the nicaraguan border is less than 10 miles away and the 
sandinista army swept through more than once in search of contras 
but when thousands of contra fighters began moving out of 
nicaragua after the united states cut off military aid early in 
1988 the impact was immediate on yamales 
the united states has kept up nonlethal aid contra fighters and 
their families began to find work and there was a market for 
practically everything 
the people of eastern honduras went to work 
las trojes 18 miles to the west and danli 60 miles away 
became boomtowns where many fighters relatives settled cheap 
hotels and restaurants served truck drivers and las trojes even had 
a small casino with rudimentary versions of craps and roulette 
a lot of them are doing real well theyve got a road now 
noted israel galeano the contra chief of staff known as commander 
franklin 
the contras built and maintain the road in from las trojes now 
more roads branch off that one many ranchers in the area are 
building wood corrals to replace old barbed wire ones 
the corral started getting too full and the animals starting 
cutting themselves on the wire said mercedes martinez she and 
her husband mario have cattle and chickens and sell milk meat and 
eggs to the contras 
nicaraguans have established small businesses and farms of their 
own as well especially in the roadless mountains that stretch 100 
miles northeast along the nicaraguahonduras border to bocay jungle 
has been cleared for cattle or corn crops 
paula zentena whose husband is a contra soldier found she could 
make money by altering usprovided fatigue uniforms for the contra 
soldiers 
theyre usually too baggy for the boys she said as she ran 
off a seam on her new treadlepowered sewing machine she rents 
space in a honduran house and has two nicaraguan fighters working 
for her charging 3 lempiras to alter a pair of pants 
balancio blandon a honduran who started out with a small shop 
has been able to build a new brick store and home for himself his 
wife and their five children he also bought a canon camera and now 
runs a photo service 
he doesnt see the boom coming to an end soon especially with 
us aid continuing until february and probably longer for contra 
families and wounded fighters in the area

if things keep going the way they have been 
lately the nations mutual funds will soon become a 1 trillion 
industry 
the latest data from the investment company institute the funds 
biggest trade group show total assets of 93660 billion at the end 
of july up from 90025 billion a month earlier and 80552 billion 
in july 1988 
that left the industry nearly 10 times as large as it was just a 
decade ago with assets of 942 billion as of the end of 1979 
numbers like those stand as ample testimony to why investment 
experts have called the 1980s the decade of financial assets 
dramatic bull markets in both stocks and bonds made a big 
contribution to the funds growth in july alone for instance 
rising stock prices swelled industry assets by about 14 billion 
the financial boom also fueled a dramatic expansion in the number 
and types of funds available to investors 
at the beginning of the 80s the institute counted 524 funds with 
slightly fewer than 10 million shareholder accounts by the end of 
1988 there were 2718 funds with close to 55 million accounts 
all this naturally poses some questions how long can this kind 
of growth continue and where is it leading the nations investors 
the funds had a hot streak once before though of lesser 
proportions during the great bull market for stocks in the 1960s 
it gave way to a period of contraction and disillusionment in the 
early 1970s when the hot gogo funds of that era turned cold 
in those days however mutual funds were considered almost 
exclusively a vehicle for investing in stocks notably there were 
no money market mutual funds at all until the reserve fund made its 
debut in 1972 
today stock funds with assets of about 237 billion remain a 
significant part of the industry but money market and shortterm 
municipal bond funds at about 400 billion and bond and income 
funds at about 300 billion both outrank them in size 
that goes a long way toward explaining why the stock market crash 
of 1987 inflicted only minor damage on the industry a lot of money 
that might have simply fled the business 20 years before was instead 
switched into other types of funds 
still even with its new diversity many observers agree the 
industrys growth would likely slow or stop should the nation run 
into a spell of economic trouble on the order of the one that 
occurred in the 1970s 
stock funds as ever would be vulnerable to a bear market many 
bond funds especially those that invest in socalled junk 
bonds could fall into disfavor in a slump that caused increased 
defaults by businesses 
the many income funds that specialize in government securities 
where the risk of default is considered very slight could also lose 
a lot of their appeal if bond prices were depressed by a flareup of 
inflation and higher interest rates 
but most analysts agree that the 1980s mutual fund boom has gone 
much too far for too long to be regarded as only some temporary 
growth spurt 
millions of american investors evidently have concluded over the 
last 10 years that they want or need professional help in managing 
their finances and as demand for that kind of service increased 
mutual fund managers were right there waiting only too happy to 
meet it

last june the principal of richmond 
consolidated school could see only one way to solve his schools 
desperate money woes quit 
norman najimy made national headlines with his selfsacrificing 
solution to save teachers jobs and precious programs for 185 
children attending kindergarten through eighthgrade and the school 
committee accepted his resignation 
shocked townspeople rallied around najimy and by august this 
hamlet had saved his job 
but as a new year began last week at richmond consolidated a 
school cited repeatedly for excellence by the state and surrounded 
by yellow wildflowers and berkshire hills everyone here knew that 
neither najimy nor the school were out of the financial woods 
in all probability the summers crisis was just a taste of worse 
to come 
tighter state purse strings here in massachusetts and in other 
states mean school districts must increasingly battle budget woes 
with less hope of outside bailouts 
and massachusetts in common with a dozen other states now must 
live with tax revolt measures passed a decade ago that are now 
coming home to roost making local school tax increases hard or even 
impossible 
as the new school year began richmond consolidateds budget 
crisis has already meant a kindergarten class almost double the size 
of last year with a teacher paid just half what she earned last 
year less early remedial help for kids with reading problems 
scuttled plans for expanded foreign language instruction less music 
and art 
because of the districts deficit still about 30000 as of 
last week kindergarten teacher carole collins says she plans to 
meet with parents to ask them for paper soap tissues bandaids 
crayons and ill have to tell them that without help therell be 
no field trips and therell be fewer activities and crafts 
teacher bill kerwood set any doubters straight on opening day 
copy this class schedule off the board he told his 40 or so 
seventh and eighthgraders i would have run them off on the 
copying machine but i cant this year because of 
the budget cuts said the students completing kerwoods 
sentence 
break periods are longer this year he continued because 
of 
budget cuts 
therell be more study periods because of 
budget cuts 
the schools predicament and najimys magnanimity stunned this 
upscale town of 1600 people in one of the artsy corners of the 
nation 
in july shortly after the richmond school committee reluctantly 
accepted najimys resignation angry parents flocked to the general 
store where owner elizabeth sunny lloyderiksen circulated 
petitions demanding his reinstatement 
the towns selectmen met parents on a hot buggy august evening 
in the parking lot outside town hall the selectmen suddenly 
announced they had found money in the town budget to save the job of 
najimy a principal so respected and beloved that he got a hug from 
every single boy and girl as they entered school opening day 
a happy ending hardly 
how is morale here said mary hanson an instructional aide 
to handicapped youngsters at the school on a scale of 1 to 10 
id say it was a 1 i think things here are going to get a lot worse 
before they get better 
with the national economy showing signs of cooling massachusetts 
is tackling a deficit estimated at 170 million the state cut aid 
to richmond by 75000 not inconsiderable for a district whose 
budget is just 12 million 
when school opened last wednesday najimy and his 19member 
teaching staff sported buttons on their shirts summing up their mood 
wouldnt it be great the buttons read if schools had all 
the money they needed and the air force had to hold a bake sale to 
buy a new bomber 
sitting in his spartan cinderblock office najimy said everyone 
knew money trouble was brewing last spring when the districts blue 
cross premiums shot up by 33 percent the furnace needed repairs and 
the water system had to be replaced 
richmond high schoolers must attend classes in pittsfield about 
10 miles away because richmond has no high school pittsfield with 
financial woes of its own raised the tuitions it charges the 
richmond district by 10 percent 
making matters worse was proposition 2 a measure passed by 
irate voters in 1981 back when some derisively called the state 
taxachusetts proposition 2 akin to other tax revolt measures 
passed in other states limited to 2 percent the amount that 
property taxes could go up in a single year unless town voters 
agreed to higher rates 
richmond voters many of them affluent professionals keen on 
education approved two such tax overrides in the last two 
years school committee chairwoman janice hartford says another may 
be proposed this year if no other money is found 
the bottom line at the height of the crisis this summer for 
richmond consolidated was a 140000 deficit and few options to 
close it besides cutting staff and educational programs 
the schools instrumental music program was eliminated for now 
a 71yearold retired musician named walt lehmann has volunteered to 
teach kids without pay 
the basic skills teacher was eliminated meaning no early 
intervention for youngsters with reading or other academic problems 
najimy had hoped to extend foreign language to the early grades 
but those plans are on permanent hold 
najimy eliminated his personal expense budget and passed up a 
3000 raise this year leaving his salary unchanged at 40000 
those and other cuts reduced the deficit to 30000 the gap has 
to be closed this month or new cuts will have to be made 
so richmond consolidated is barely scraping by this fall with 
the help of parents teachers and volunteers 
townspeople have offered money for computer equipment one parent 
rototilled ground around the school for landscaping 
doesnt that make the school a shining example of the virtues of 
volunteerism what president bush has often referred to as a 
thousand points of light 
richmond superintendent george st pierre chuckled at the 
question 
volunteerism is great for about a month he said it just 
doesnt continue ask bush how many of his workers are volunteers

merger mania may drive stock prices through the 
roof but merger phobia is driving corporate executives batty 
the no 1 worry among americas bosses is that they will lose 
their jobs through mergers or acquisitions a study released 
thursday from a research organization shows 
the fear of takeovers far exceeded worries about being fired 
losing a promotion getting sick or not making enough money 
according to the study from robert half international inc 
robert half is the worlds largest recruiting agency for 
financial accounting information systems and banking the survey 
was based on interviews with vice presidents and personnel directors 
of 100 of the nations 1000 largest corporations 
respondents were asked to note their greatest fears from a list 
of typical executive suite nightmares fiftyfour percent cited the 
loss of their jobs due to takeovers 26 percent said burnout and 8 
percent worried most about losing promotions 
other concerns included being fired 6 percent failing to get a 
raise 5 percent insufficient income to meet living standards or 
financial obligations 3 percent and illness 2 percent 
corporate restructuring resulting from mergers and acquisitions 
is almost invariably accompanied by personnel changes at the 
executive level said max messmer chairman of robert half but 
the survey also illustrates just how deeply troubling the mere 
thought of a merger can be

another battle in the automotive warranty war may 
be on the horizon after a nearly threeyear ceasefire and the front 
may be on americas highways instead of at dealership service 
departments 
in early 1987 the nations big three automakers extended 
existing warranties and used the new guarantees as bait to snare 
newcar buyers 
on thursday oldsmobile took a page from the european luxury car 
makers warranty book and introduced a new threepart program for 
1990 oldsmobile buyers two days earlier toyota motor corp boosted 
its warranty on powertrain and safety equipment to five years or 
60000 miles from three years or 36000 miles 
oldsmobiles new program offers buyers a threeyear 
bumpertobumper warranty with a 100 deductible after the first 
year a chance for new buyers to return their cars within a month 
for full credit for another new oldsmobile and a roadside assistance 
plan 
during the first three years or 50000 miles whichever comes 
first oldsmobile owners will be able to telephone for help anytime 
their car is disabled for any reason from an empty gas tank to a 
major mechanical failure said oldsmobile general manager mike losh 
because of oldsmobiles sales volume the move may prompt other 
general motors corp divisions as well as ford motor co and 
chrysler corp to rethink their warranties 
what youre going to see is a big rampup in the overall 
warranty coverage on the part of everybody said analyst joseph 
phillippi of shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
improving warranties can be costly for automakers who shoulder 
most of the cost through dealer reimbursements automakers keep 
their warranty costs close to their chests since among other 
things that would give competitors a peek at their cars 
reliability 
the oldsmobile warranty announced thursday is unique in gm other 
gm divisions offer the basic threeyear 50000mile warranty with 
the exception of the cadillac allante which carries a sevenyear 
70000mile warranty 
changes in the 1990 version of the cadillac warranty will be 
announced next week when the division formally introduces its cars 
for the coming model year spokesman norb bartos said thursday 
declining to elaborate 
ford which introduces its 1990 model cars next week and 
chrysler which shows off its 1990 cars a week after that have 
basic warranties of 12 months or 12000 miles in addition to longer 
powertrain and rust protection coverage chrysler offers more 
extensive basic coverage for its larger more expensive cars 
officials of both companies said there were no immediate plans to 
change warranties 
mercedesbenz is offering a fouryear 50000mile warranty with 
a free towing provision for its 1989 and 1990 cars but the number 
of vehicles covered by that plan as well as those offered by other 
makers of imported luxury cars doesnt approach that of oldsmobile 
the oldsmobile warranty announced as the gm division introduced 
its 1990 model cars may be transferred if the original buyer sells 
the car while its covered by the basic warranty 
the warranty stems from pilot programs gm ran on the oldsmobile 
cutlass supreme and the pontiac grand prix last year said losh who 
was general manager of the pontiac division before moving to 
oldsmobile earlier this year 
he said fewer than 05 percent of the cutlass supreme buyers 
taking part in the pilot program returned their cars for other 
oldsmobiles the program also offers free overnight accommodations 
for drivers whose cars need that much time to be fixed if the driver 
is more than 150 miles from home

a government investigation of corruption in the 
stockloan industry spun off from the ivan boesky insider trading 
scandal involves several wall street brokerages according to a 
source close to the case 
a former top shearson lehman hutton inc executive dennis t 
palmeri has reached a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to 
criminal charges and cooperate in the probe which began more than a 
year ago the source said thursday speaking anonymously 
the case is said to be derived from information from boesky the 
jailed speculator who has been a major source of evidence for wall 
street securities investigations since he was ensnared in an insider 
trading probe in 1986 
stock loaning is the business of lending large blocks of stock 
for a fee usually to big investors who need stock quickly and are 
unable or unwilling to purchase enough shares 
a person familiar with the stockloan case said palmeri 
shearsons former executive vice president in charge of stock loans 
would enter a guilty plea to criminal counts by the end of october 
in a deal with the manhattan us attorneys office 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity declined to offer 
other details about the charges but the investigation was said to 
include alleged kickbacks received by palmeri while he headed the 
stockloan operation 
it also involves stockloan corruption at other major brokerages 
the source said but no other brokerage executives or other 
officials have reached plea deals with the government or have been 
identified in the investigation 
a federal grand jury last year issued subpoenas to shearson 
seeking information about palmeris trading activities shearson 
said at the time that it did not believe the firm or any employees 
were targets of an investigation 
asked for comment about the expected palmeri guilty plea a 
shearson official said the firm still does not believe it is a 
target 
the us attorneys office has requested information from 
shearson lehman hutton relating to a former employee of our 
stockloan department and we have been cooperating fully with the 
request shearson said in a statement 
palmeris attorney stanley arkin declined to comment on the 
case a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office deborah corley 
also declined to comment 
palmeri began working at shearson in 1979 he resigned june 28 
after taking a leave of absence from the firm in april because of 
the investigation a shearson spokesman said 
he had supervised a department that specializes in lending blocks 
of stock mostly to large institutional investors and speculators 
boesky had borrowed stock from shearson 
major brokerages such as shearson 62 percentowned by american 
express co maintain large inventories of stocks typically loaned 
to clients stock loans frequently are used in shortselling a 
strategy used to profit from an expected price decline in a stock 
a speculator will sell borrowed stock at a high price wait for 
the price to fall repurchase the shares at the lower price and 
return them to the lender pocketing the price difference as a 
profit 
the tactic is risky because the price might not fall and the 
borrower must return the stock within a limited time 
violations alleged by the government in other stockloan cases in 
recent years include improper payments in return for interestfree 
stock loans unauthorized stock lending and fake transactions 
shearson was censured by the securities and exchange commission 
in 1987 for alleged unlawful use of customers stock for loans 
during one week in november 1985 including 69 million of 
securities illegally loaned in one day shearson said the violations 
were technical and agreed to internal procedural changes

a coalition of environmentalists religious 
groups and investors has established a code of conduct by which 
corporations can be judged on how responsible they are toward the 
environment 
building on guidelines set 12 years ago to judge corporate 
actions in south africa the 10point valdez principles annunced 
thursday call on companies to address the effects of both their 
product and production processes on employees communities and the 
environment 
the code of conduct named after the alaskan oil spill by the 
exxon valdez tanker also asks companies to appoint environmental 
experts to their boards of directors and publicize an annual audit 
of compliance with the code 
as i talked to people this winter about this idea it was like 
striking a match to flint said joan bavaria a cochairwoman of 
the coalition and the president of franklin research and 
development a boston research firm 
bavaria told the new york times that funds that base their 
investments on social values consistently find the environment to be 
the single largest concern of their clients 
in the long term the coalition believes the most profitable 
companies are those that are willing to forego shortterm profits 
and invest according to environmental and social concerns 
the coalition for environmentally responsible economies recently 
brought pressure against exxon corp to name a director with 
environmental knowledge to its board 
the coalition is a step to bring investors who control about 100 
billion in pension funds and other vehicles together with social 
action groups that have large memberships but often lack leverage 
with corporations 
it includes the social investment forum of 325 fund managers and 
investment advisers the national council of churches interfaith 
center on corporate responsibility and 14 environmental groups 
the environmental code was inspired in part by the sullivan 
principles formed in 1977 to recommended corporate conduct for 
firms operating in racially segregated south africa

the economics ministry today endorsed 
the proposed 859 million merger of automaking giant daimlerbenz 
with a major arms conglomerate overriding monopoly concerns with 
claims that it would reduce taxes and improve us trade ties 
economics minister helmut haussmann had long indicated he would 
conditionally approve daimlers 17billionmark bid to take over 
aerospace and armaments giant messerschmittboelkowblohm 
at a news conference today haussmann said he chose to override a 
federal cartel office ruling that the takeover could give unfair 
competitive advantages to the combined corporations because of the 
considerable economic advantages of the takeover 
opponents of the merger had claimed it would create the largest 
defense contractor in the nation making it hard for smaller west 
german firms to compete for federal contracts 
daimler already the largest industrial firm in west germany 
still must approve the conditions outlined by haussmann 
the stuttgartbased automaker issued a statement saying the 
economics ministry conditions would be reviewed carefully by company 
president edzard reuter who would disclose his decision at a press 
conference on monday 
the merger would create the third largest industrial concern in 
europe with sales of 80 billion marks or 40 billion annually 
among the economic advantages of the merger haussmann said was 
that daimler would eventually be assuming the governments 37 
percent share of the european airbus industrie consortium which 
currently needs large subsidies from the bonn treasury to compete 
with other major aerospace manufacturers like boeing and mcdonnell 
douglas 
one of the stipulations attached to the takeover plan by 
haussmann was that the combined enterprises assume the airbus risks 
three years earlier than offered under the original proposal 
that would mean that mbb will take over the governments 20 
percent stake in deutsche airbus ag by dec 31 1996 
haussmann said the privatization of west germanys share in 
airbus would save the government 25 billion by the year 2000 
which would be passed on to taxpayers or added to pension funds 
this would also put us on the road to resolving one of the 
issues raised by the united states in discussion of west 
germanus trade relations haussmann told reporters 
american aerospace giants like boeing have contended that 
government subsidies for airbus gave the consortium unfair 
competitive advantages haussmann noted

the chairman of italys largest bank has resigned 
over a scandal involving unauthorized export credits to iraq granted 
by the italian banks branch in atlanta ga 
nerio nesi chairman of the stateowned banca nazionale del 
lavoro bnl and the banks directorgeneral giacomo pedde 
stepped down at an extraordinary meeting of the banks board 
thursday night the bank said in a brief statement 
the communique said that the board faced with the resignations 
of chairman nerio nesi and directorgeneral giacomo pedde expresses 
to them its most ample and full recognition for the sensibility 
demonstrated in the interest of the bank and confirms its highest 
appreciation for the activity carried out in the fulfillment of 
their respective responsibilities in the service of the 
institution 
treasury minister guido carli today quickly named replacements 
for the two top officials giampiero cantoni was named chairman of 
the stateowned banca nazionale del lavoro and paolo savona will be 
directorgeneral the government said 
the nominations require parliamentary approval bnl is 74percent 
owned by the treasury 
nesi 64 had been chairman of the bank since 1978 he previously 
held executive positions with olivetti and the staterun rai 
broadcasting network 
pedde 62 had been directorgeneral since 1987 
bnl said thursday its atlanta branch had extended at least 17 
billion in unauthorized export credits to iraq 
the board meeting came three weeks after bnl announced it had 
uncovered transactions by its atlanta branch that were not 
authorized by either the banks north american management or its 
rome headquarters 
bnl said the 2500 transactions consisted of the confirmation of 
letters of credit covering exports of agricultural products 
industrial machinery and plants to iraq bnl has said no arms 
shipments were involved 
it is the biggest banking scandal in italy since banco 
ambrosiano italys largest private bank collapsed in 1982 after 
failure to collect 14 billion in loans to dummy companies in latin 
america 
bnl said in the communique that its board unanimously expressed 
complete faith in the patrimonial solidity of the institution 
the statement said the board felt obligated to take whatever 
actions deemed necessary to defend the strength of the bank and 
would eliminate the shortcomings in the control procedures which 
have emerged in these circumstances 
earlier thursday in its first statement giving concrete details 
of the affair bnl said that the atlanta branch had executed 172 
billion in export credits to iraq the bank promised an additional 
920 million in credits and bnl is investigating whether this 
obligation was legally binding the statement said 
of the 172 billion already disbursed about 700 million are 98 
percent guaranteed by the us commodity credit corp and the 
remaining 1020 billion by the iraqi central bank bnl said 
the bank has said the letters of credit while correct 
technically exceeded the credit ceiling that bnl set for the 
atlanta branch 
the transactions were conducted by the atlanta bank manager 
christopher drogoul who has since been suspended bnl filed a 
complaing against drogoul with italian justice authorities in rome 
on wednesay 
the transactions which are believed to cover a period of three 
years were never reported on the official books by the branch 
management but were reportedly kept on a personal computer at 
drogouls home 
bnl has been under investigation by the us federal reserve 
board and georgia state banking authorities since the beginning of 
august the bank of italy the central bank is collaborating in the 
probe 
there have been reports the irregularities werent limited to the 
atlanta branch but also involved bnl branches in italy 
bnl is 76percent owned by the italian treasury while the rest 
of its voting capital is in the hands of state entities it has 
nonvoting shares quoted on the milan stock exchange 
the securities industry watchdog committee consob suspended 
trading in bnl shares tuesday after they dropped 97 percent to 
14900 lire or 1050 a share on monday down from 16500 lire or 
1180 a share on friday 
the bank has said it doesnt expect to incur any losses from the 
affair but fears have been raised that iraq whose economy was 
crippled by its war with iraq may be unable to meet its debt 
analysts said the bank may have to set aside reserves to make 
special provisions for the iraqi credit 
bnl had total assets of 88 billion at the end of 1988 and 
ranked 44th in the world according to ibca banking analysis ltd a 
london credit rating agency 
banking analysts have said the scandal wont have a major impact 
on the banks balance sheet or economic results they say the main 
damage is to bnls image at home and abroad 
numerous politicians both from the opposition and the governing 
parties have presented in parliament scores of questions about the 
scandal 
its a particularly delicate matter that involves the 
functioning of the entire banking system arnaldo forlani head of 
the dominant christian democrats said thursday

federal financing bank says it never again will loan tva its 
lowcost funds 
the federal financing bank is an arm of the treasury department 
that loans money to federal agencies such as the us postal 
service the exportimport bank and the rural electrification 
administration by buying bonds that they issue 
the bond purchases are like a private loan to the agencies since 
the financing bank keeps the bonds and receives all the interest 
paid on them their advantage is lower interest rates than those of 
bonds sold on the public market 
tva wants to pay off bonds from the financing bank that carry 
interest rates averaging about 1225 percent it says it should be 
able to float new publicmarket bonds at about 9 percent or lower 
reflecting how much interest rates have dropped since the bonds were 
bought 
the refinancing should save tva about 100 million a year for the 
next 20 years said william f malec chief financial officer of the 
knoxville tennbased agency which is the nations largest power 
company 
that in turn should help tva hold down its electric rates tva 
established by congress in 1933 to help develop the rural south 
sells power at wholesale rates to municipal and cooperative power 
companies in seven states that serve about 3 million households 
tva has borrowed exclusively from the financing bank since that 
agencys creation in 1974 and it owes it about 165 billion tva 
also has about 15 billion in public debt outstanding that was sold 
before 1974 
tvas malec decided to go to the public market for refinancing 
after the federal financing bank declined to loan it fresh money at 
lower rates ahead of the call dates of the existing bonds which are 
several years away 
but the financing bank made clear late last month in a letter to 
tva that it no longer would loan tva money should it go that route 
were in a situation where the ffb is under no requirement to 
lend to us malec said 
however malec said last week the decision over floating public 
bonds may not be that tough because the cost of the financing 
agencys funds is not substantially lower than the rate the tva 
could get in the public market 
another factor in favor of public borrowing is that it would 
allow the tva to structure bonds in more favorable terms such as 
allowing them to be called earlier than the federal bonds should 
interest rates drop 
malec said the tva expects to make its decision in a few weeks 
in the meantime us sen albert gore jr dtenn and other 
members of the tennessee congressional delegation say they will try 
to persuade the financing bank to change its stance 
theres little question tva bonds would receive a warm welcome 
from the credit market tvas old public debt holds the top rating 
from the major creditrating agencies also 17 investment houses 
submitted proposals to help bring new notes to market malec said 
of these five were selected with first boston corp chosen as lead 
underwriter 
ralph horn an executive vice president of first tennessee bank 
which helped underwrite past tva public bond issues said tva notes 
were always a hit 
the bidding was always extremely strong they got extremely 
competitive rates he said 
should tva be cut off from federal funding i think the demand 
for their securities in the public market would suffice horn said 
however a large part of tvas sterling credit rating is based on 
its ability to tap the financing bank said amelie l wogan an 
analyst at standard amp poors corp should that link be severed 
tvas rating would be reevaluated she said

irans state oil company has settled out of 
court for less than half of the 768 million it sought from ashland 
oil inc 
ashland said thursday it had agreed to pay 325 million to 
national iranian oil co to settle a 10year dispute over crude oil 
purchases from iran 
the dispute began when national iranian oil co said a subsidiary 
of ashland refused to pay for crude oil in 1979 a jury trial in the 
case was scheduled to begin monday in us district court in jackson 
both sides were ready to settle at a certain number but there 
was a lot of discrepancy between those numbers until the last few 
days said dan lacy vice president of corporate communications 
for the ashland ky company we are pleased 
ashland representatives said ashland overseas trading limited 
refused to pay for the oil because the iranian company renegged on 
the contract forcing the company to buy higherpriced oil on the 
open market ashland officials did not say why the middle eastern 
firm backed out of the contract but said the deal was broken during 
the iranian hostage crisis in 1979 
national iranian has said it stopped sending oil to ashland 
because the american firm didnt pay its bill 
the jacksonbased attorney for national iranian could not be 
reached for comment thursday 
the threeday courtmonitored negotiations for the settlement 
ended thursday afternoon lacy said court officials in biloxi could 
not be reached for comment thursday 
weve had negotiations for years this is our first 
courtsupervised negotiation lacy said 
national iranian filed a complaint in 1985 in mississippi which 
is served by ashland oil lacy said the case which had been in 
courts in england bermuda and the united states since 1980 was 
brought to mississippi where the deadline for a court appearance 
has not run out 
the iranian firm had asked for 768 million which included 
interest on the price of the oil according to ashland reports 
ashland never disputed receiving the crude oil or that it was 
obligated to pay a reasonable price for it said ashland chairman 
john hall hall who was in mississippi overseeing the settlement 
termed it fair and best for both sides 
ashland officials said there was no government pressure to settle 
the case

rjr nabisco inc has put together a good track 
record in the four months since kohlberg kravis roberts amp co bought 
the food and tobacco giant in the biggest corporate acquisition 
ever securities analysts say 
the announcement thursday that rjr nabisco would sell the fresh 
fruit operations of its del monte corp to the british conglomerate 
polly peck international plc for 875 million bolstered the view 
that the company is taking the right steps to ensure its financial 
stability 
the sale was part of a divestment plan to help defray the costs 
of the 2453 billion leveraged buyout of rjr nabisco completed in 
late april in a leveraged buyout a company is acquired with mainly 
borrowed funds which are paid back through asset sales and the 
companys cash flow 
the wall street journal reported today that rjr nabisco expected 
to sell del montes canned food business to a citicorp venture 
capitalled group for about 148 billion the journal said the 
price fell short of what rjr nabisco hoped to get for the division 
and that other segments of the company might have to be sold 
david kalis an rjr nabisco spokesman said the company had no 
comment on the report 
kohlberg kravis a specialist in leveraged buyouts said earlier 
this year that about 55 billion in rjr nabisco assets would be 
sold the latest sale puts rjr nabisco more than halfway toward its 
divestment goal 
moodys investors service inc a company that rates the 
creditworthiness of bond issuers like rjr nabisco has confidence 
in managements ability to do what they are in fact doing gloria 
vila a moodys analyst said thursday 
she said the asset sale plan is on track and that the prices rjr 
nabisco has received for its businesses were so far in line with 
expectations 
the biggest asset sale to date came in june when rjr nabisco 
sold five of its european businesses to bsn a french food and 
beverage company for 25 billion 
the company also sold its biscuit and food businesses in india 
and pakistan for 44 million to britannia industries pte ltd of 
singapore and its chun king food division for 52 million to a 
group of investors from singapore 
both moodys and standard amp poors corp another creditrating 
service lowered their ratings on rjr nabiscos bonds and other debt 
after the acquisition by kohlberg kravis it is common for a 
companys credit rating to be downgraded if it takes on a heavy debt 
load 
bond investors apparently have had few doubts about rjr nabisco 
they scooped up the record 4 billion in junk bonds issued as part 
of the buyout 
moodys did not plan any further adjustments in its rating of rjr 
nabisco debt although the service was confident that they are 
going to be able to complete their asset sales on time and at prices 
that they indicated ms vila said 
she noted that the company has had a drop in the volume of its 
domestic tobacco business which could raise concern about rjr 
nabiscos cash flow and in turn its ability to repay its debt 
however the drop in volume was being offset by price increases 
and rjr nabisco was reconsidering its marketing strategy to find a 
way to boost sales she said 
there was no connection between the falloff in volume and the 
buyout ms vila said noting that rjr nabiscos cigarette brands 
have been slipping in the united states for the last five years 
rjr nabisco got another vote of confidence recently when the 
investment firm salomon brothers inc added to its buy list the 
securities kohlberg kravis issued to shareholders as part of the 
merger deal 
the securities known as a stub are debentures or bonds 
that can be converted into stock in the future 
salomon called the stub an attractive way to participate in the 
equity of the rjr leveraged buyout 
the investment firm also was pleased with rjr nabiscos projected 
profit growth which salomon put at 15 percent 
the success of the rjr nabisco deal is crucial to the reputation 
of kohlberg kravis the leader among firms that specialize in 
leveraged buyouts 
kohlberg kravis reportedly has had trouble selling some of its 
businesses and several others either are foundering or have been 
disappointing investments 
seamans furniture co which went private in a 360 million 
buyout led by kohlberg kravis two years ago has said it must 
renegotiate debt payments partly because sales growth has not met 
expectations 
adding to the companys troubles was a lawsuit filed against it 
last month by jerome kohlberg jr one of its founders kohlberg 
alleged the firm reduced his stake in several companies kohlberg 
kravis acquired while he was a managing partner there

grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower 
in early trading today on the chicago board of trade reflecting 
some profittaking after the previous sessions rally 
soybean futures had risen to a twoweek high of 6 a bushel 
thursday on perceptions of increased foreign demand for soybean oil 
traders were disappointed late thursday to learn that the soviet 
union would not make an immediate purchase of us soybean oil 
although the soviets indicated they were interested in buying soy 
oil if prices drop 
todays early losses were limited by forecasts for a rainy 
weekend in the midwest where the corn and soybean crops are rapidly 
maturing 
the forecasts are feeding fears of corn and soybean harvest 
delays and of winterwheat planting delays 
in early trading wheat was cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 395 a bushel corn was 1 
cent lower cent higher with september at 236 a bushel oats 
were cent to cent lower with september at 135 a bushel

recordkeeping methods that would allow 
investigators to reconstruct trades on the nations commodities 
exchanges are fundamentally inadequate a senate committee was 
told today 
but officials of the general accounting office said 
computerization doesnt necessarily spell the end of the historical 
hurlyburly method of trading by shouts and hand signals known as 
open outcry 
i think thats a question the exchanges themselves need to 
answer said richard l fogel an assistant comptroller general 
with the gao the auditing arm of congress 
i dont personally believe that the government should dictate 
how the exchanges want to trade he added 
fogel was testifying before the senate committee on agriculture 
nutrition and forestry about a study of the methods used by 
exchanges to track trading and keep futures traders honest 
questions about trading practices have emerged in the aftermath of 
alleged fraud in chicagos commodity pits 
the study found exchange systems for tracking a given trade 
known as an audit trail lacking because so much of the record 
keeping is left to the traders and brokers themselves 
sen patrick leahy asked fogel if he believed the current audit 
trail systems in place at the major us exchanges are fundamentally 
inadequate to police the trading floors against abuses 
i think it is yes said fogel noting that there is no 
guarantee that information about the timing of when an order gets to 
a broker and when the order is executed by the broker 
earlier leahy the committees chairman noted that the public 
is not adequately protected audit trails are the backbone of the 
floor policing systems they must be improved substantially before 
we can guarantee the integrity of the trading pits 
fortyfive traders at the chicago board of trade and the chicago 
mercantile exchange were charged aug 2 with bilking profits from 
hundreds of customers through a series of illegal activities 
including falsified trading records 
while detecting every abuse may never be possible most of the 
types of abuses alleged in the justice department indictments could 
also have been detected and documented with independent precise and 
complete timing of trades said a report by the general accounting 
office the watchdog arm of congress 
at issue is the audit trail a term describing the process of 
determining who bought what from whom and when they did it in other 
words the ability to reconstruct precisely any given transaction 
the two futures exchanges the largest in the world have been 
criticized for not keeping a closer watch on traders while the 
commodity futures trading commission which oversees the futures 
markets has been accused of doing so with too light a touch 
although improvements in the audit trail system would aid in 
the detection of the kind of abuses weve seen in chicago said a 
cftc spokeswoman thursday evening if youre going to identify and 
prosecute this kind of activity youre also going to need the kind 
of undercover observation and surveillance we had 
the cftc is up for reauthorization this fall and a 
reauthorization bill passed by the house would require exchanges to 
reconstruct a trade to within one minute of its occurence no later 
than one year after the bill becomes law 
audit trails accurate to the nearest 30 seconds would be required 
within three years of the bills enactment 
within weeks of the indictments the two chicago exchanges 
announced they were developing handheld computer terminals to 
record floor trading 
but the gao study said the cftc has not been actively involved 
in conducting or setting guidelines for technical assessments of 
these systems capabilities to control trading abuses and automation 
risks 
the gao also said the cftc lacks the necessary technical 
resources to keep tabs on the exchanges developing technology 
the senate requested the gao study in march

the fires will again surround this 
bendoftheroad outpost in the fall to burn off the sugarcane 
greenery and expose the stalks to the cutters machetes 
but while growers in the rich mucklands south of lake okeechobee 
prepare for this ancient harvest ritual officials in washington are 
talking about a different kind of slashing for the domestic sugar 
industry 
with the sugarsubsidy program expiring next year manufacturer 
and consumer groups have begun campaigning to trim a system they 
claim unfairly restricts foreign competition and costs taxpayers 
billions of dollars by keeping us raw sugar nearly double the 
world price 
the reform effort shepherded by the wellfunded sweetener users 
association is calling for a nearly 33 percent reduction in the 
governments guaranteed sugar price of 18 cents per pound about 6 
cents higher than on foreign commodity markets raw sugar currently 
sells for about 22 cents a pound on us markets 
under the 1985 farm bill growers have been able to receive an 
18centapound loan using their crop as collateral they have 
either six months to pay back the commodity credit corp with 
interest or forfeit the sugar 
our view is simple the price is too high said thomas 
hammer president for the washingtonbased users group 
representing trade associations and major manufacturers such as 
hershey foods corp and cocacola co keeping the price high makes 
products cost more and takes money out of the taxpayers pocket 
hammer claims the program costs us consumers about 3 billion a 
year and encourages farmers in the midwest to grow more profitable 
sugar beets rather than food crops such as wheat or barley 
we callthat the 3 billion lie said barbara miedema 
spokeswoman for the florida sugar cane league inc representing 
about half the nations sugar cane growers 
ms miedema and other representatives of the nations estimated 
12000 sugarcane and sugar beet growers say the price supports and 
import quotas are necessary to balance competition from other 
countries with heavily subsidized sugar industries 
for example she said the european economic community nations buy 
sugar from beet growers at 28 to 30 cents a pounds for domestic 
consumption then dump the surplus on world markets 
the united states one of the few nations where sugar demand 
outpaces domestic production would be flooded with inexpensive 
foreign sugar if the import quotas were lifted she said the united 
states now imports about 14 percent of its sugar 
wed just be letting another domestic industry go down the 
drain she said 
the federal sugar program was adopted in 1981 following years of 
fluctuating prices which peaked at near 60 cents a pound in 1980 
further reform was taken after a flood of imported sugar in 1984 
dropped prices and growers defaulted on 77 million in loans in 
1985 the loan rate was set at 18 cents a pound and strict import 
quotas were established 
since 1981 the shelf price has remained between 33 cents and 39 
cents a pound 
each september us agriculture officials announce the expected 
domestic sugar production and set import levels the forecast for 
this season is domestic production of about 73 million tons and 
imports of about 12 million tons leading importers include the 
dominican republic philippines and brazil 
but the bush administration is now studying the quotas following 
a ruling in june by the genevabased general agreement on tariffs 
and trade that the program violated international trade pacts 
to comply with gatt the united states would have to set limits 
on domestic sugar production 
some advocates of scrapping the quotas claim it would help the 
economies of struggling caribbean nations including jamaica and 
barbados which send thousands of workers to cut cane each year in 
the united states under a special immigration policy 
meanwhile sugar demand in the united states is falling refined 
sugar consumption last year was estimated at 78 million tons down 
from more than 10 million tons in 1979 department of agriculture 
figures show use of cornbased sweeteners has more than doubled 
during the same period 
florida where growers also face legal challenges from 
environmentalists worried about chemical fertilizer runoff into the 
everglades produced about 15 million tons of sugar last year 
hawaii louisiana and texas combined for nearly 2 million tons 
minnesota leads the 13 principal sugar beet states which 
produced about nearly 39 million tons of refined sugar last year 
a report released in august by the american sugar alliance 
estimated the sugar industry including corn sweeteners generates 
185 billion a year in wages and revenue in 42 states 
the first public hearing by the house agriculture subcommittee on 
cotton rice and sugar was held last month in colorado and several 
others are planned before spring the subcommittee will then begin 
taking testimony on the farm bill in washington 
talk of change is definitely in the air but the options are so 
limitless at this point its hard to predict said jim terrill 
senior vice president at the united states sugar corp in clewiston 
the nations oldest sugar cane plant were all watching it real 
closely

smithkline beecham plc has received the 
federal governments permission to sell a hepatitis b vaccine the 
company hopes will give it a foothold in the 80 million to 85 
million market now dominated by merck amp co officials said 
smithkline officials would not disclose sales estimates for the 
vaccine engerixb which was approved for sale in europe in 1986 
and is now distributed in about 80 countries including canada and 
australia 
catherine sohn director of vaccine marketing said the vaccine 
is 20 cheaper than rahway njbased mercks recombivax its sole 
competitor in this country and is about four months faster in 
taking effect 
engerixb which will cost 149 involves three doses 
administered over two months sohn said 
but merck spokesman said gary bruell said recombivax costs 
between 128 and 148 and thus our price is comparable he said 
recombivax is administered in three doses over six months 
it is important that there is another weapon in the fight 
against this infectious disease bruell said 
the vaccine received us food and drug administration approval 
aug 28 and shipments to wholesalers began immediately the vaccine 
should reach doctors by monday sohn said 
hepatitis b strikes an estimated 300000 people in this country 
each year killing at least 5000 chronic carriers of hepatitis b 
are prone to develop liver cancer and cirrhosis 
hepatitis b is transmitted sexually or through bloodtoblood 
contact highrisk groups include homosexual males intravenous drug 
abusers healthcare workers and southeast asians 
the federal occupational safety and health administration has 
recommended requiring employers to offer hepatitis b vaccinations 
free to any workers who risk contracting the disease through their 
jobs 
oshas recommendations also include protective clothing and 
education about hepatitis 
work place exposure results in 6000 to 7400 hepatitis b 
infections each year in the united states causing up to 400

senate taxwriters swamped by complaints from 
retirees reached a preliminary agreement today on reducing 
catastrophic health insurance benefits and the taxes that finance 
them 
i think we made major progress sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the finance committee told reporters its coming 
along in a bipartisan way 
bentsen said the committee meeting behind closed doors reached 
a consensus that 
the surtax paid by the wealthiest 40 percent of retirees the 
chief financing mechanism for catastrophic insurance will be 
reduced significantly the 15 percent rate and the maximum annual 
surtax of 800 will be cut 
the flat monthly premium paid by most retirees will not be 
raised above current law 
retirees will have to shoulder a larger share of their doctors 
fees and prescription costs before catastrophic benefits become 
available 
bentsen said the panel reached no conclusion on whether taxes 
should be raised on nonretirees to pay part of the cost of 
catastrophic coverage 
the catastrophic insurance program aimed at protecting retirees 
from being bankrupted by a catastrophic illness has been under 
attack since it was enacted a year ago as an expansion of medicare 
the program is financed by beneficiaries and most of the 
complaints have come from higherincome retirees who contend they 
are bearing most of the cost of the program 
other older americans complain that they dont need the program 
or its costs because they have private insurance 
under one proposal being considered the maximum annual earnings 
on which the 145 percent social security hospitalization tax is 
imposed would be increased from 48000 to 60000 that would mean 
a 174ayear tax increase for a worker making 60000 or more and 
the same increase on the employer 
the hospitalization tax is withheld from paychecks as part of the 
social security tax 
the house ways and means committee which also has been hearing 
protests has agreed to reduce the surtax thats the main financing 
source for the program shift more of the cost to lowerincome 
retirees and require the elderly to pay a greater share of their 
catastrophic expenses before they start collecting program benefits 
bentsen and several finance committee colleagues said they would 
have no part of shifting more of the burden onto those with lower 
incomes 
i will oppose any increase in the flat premium paid by retirees 
of modest means said bentsen referring to the 4amonth fee 
assessed all but the poorest medicare beneficiaries 
the committee staff outlined several ways that catastrophic 
benefits could be reduced to lower overall costs 
about twothirds of the cost of the program is paid by the 41 
percent of older citizens whose incomes are high enough that they 
owe federal income tax of more than 150 they pay a surtax of 15 
percent of income tax above 150 about 18 million of the 33 
million medicare beneficiaries will pay the maximum surtax of 800 
this year 
a single retiree would have to owe at least 5333 in income tax 
before having to pay the 800 maximum 
the surtax rate is due to increase to 28 percent and the maximum 
surtax to 1050 by 1993 
the rest of the cost is financed through the flat 4 monthly fee 
which is scheduled to rise to 1020 by 1993 
the bush administration said it would prefer no change but 
william diefenderfer deputy director of the office of management 
and budget conceded that doesnt seem to be whats going to 
happen 
diefenderfer said repeal of catastrophic care would worsen the 
federal deficit in 1990 by as much as 7 billion because taxes 
earmarked for the program come in faster than benefits are paid out 
killing the program would automatically trigger acrosstheboard 
cuts in most federal spending 
there is considerable support in the house for outright repeal of 
the catastrophic care plan an idea that drew the support of sen 
john c danforth rmo 
i question the kind of commitment we made last year he said 
noting the program leans toward longterm hospital care 
this isnt something they older americans want danforth 
said its something they fear being hooked up to 
lifesupport equipment and the like

the bush administration says it is set to call 
for a fiveyear 19 billion program to promote advanced computing 
technology including the creation of a very highspeed network 
linking the nations supercomputers 
mary catherine english spokeswoman for the white house office of 
science and technology policy said today that a report detailing 
the computer strategy will be released officially monday 
according to a final draft of the report obtained by the 
associated press highperformance computing represents the 
leading edge of a multibillion dollar world market in which the 
united states is increasingly being challenged 
a strong fully competitive domestic highperformance computer 
industry contributes to us leadership in critical national 
security areas and in broad sectors of the civilian economy the 
document said 
the program envisions establishment of a national research and 
education network or nren which would transmit data between 
supercomputers at speeds up to 3 gigabits 3 billion bits per 
second or 2000 times faster than current computer networks 
this tremendous challenge is within the grasp of the united 
states in the next 10 years the draft report said 
in addition to linking supercomputers it said the new network 
also would tie together other computers at approximately 1000 sites 
across the country 
the nren should be the prototype of a national information 
infrastructure which could be available to every home office and 
factory the document said 
it added that wherever information is used from manufacturing 
to highdefinition home video entertainment and most particularly 
in education the country will benefit enormously from deployment of 
this technology 
the proposed program also would involve increased federal support 
for research and development work on highperformance computer 
equipment software and training 
federal spending needed to implement the program would grow from 
an estimated 151 million in the first year up to 597 million in 
the fifth year for a total of 1917 billion the draft report said 
the administration plan is similar to legislation introduced by 
sen albert gore jr dtenn who chairs the senate commerce 
subcommittee on science technology and space 
his legislation would authorize 175 billion over a fiveyear 
period for projects including establishment of a very highspeed 
national computer network by 1996 
the bill also would call for a coordinated national strategy on 
highperformance computer technology as well as increased funding 
for research and development of advanced computer equipment and 
software

dallas ap a federal judges preliminary ruling could spell 
trouble for the federal governments seizure of a number of texas 
banks including mcorp and texas american bancshares inc 
in preliminary findings issued last week us district judge 
robert porter ruled the federal deposit insurance corp had acted 
illegally in seizing 17 million owed to one of the five banks still 
owned by mcorp once the secondlargest bank holding company in 
texas 
the ruling came in a suit brought by mcorps bank in new 
braunfels and does not involve the parent company said mcorp 
spokesman joe stroop 
nevertheless stroop said mcorp has a suit pending before porter 
which makes some of the same assertions 
at issue is whether federal regulators acted properly in refusing 
to return to some otherwise solvent banks funds they had on deposit 
in insolvent sister institutions 
regulators fully repaid other creditors and porter said the fdic 
acted illegally because federal banking law requires it to treat all 
creditors equally when a bank failed 
it is still just a preliminary ruling and the judge has asked 
for additional information fdic deputy general counsel mark rosen 
said 
still the opinion could be used to decide larger cases dallas 
attorney david bryant said 
we feel strongly it is the correct ruling and that none of the 
courts that look at it will find differently said bryant an 
attorney for mcorp 
the government seized 20 of mcorps 25 banks last march 
eventually selling them to banc one corp mcorps suit claims 12 of 
those 20 were illegally forced into insolvency by the governments 
action regulators have estimated the rescue will be the second most 
expensive in the nations history 
similarly texas american bancshares has sued the fdic claiming 
some of the 24 banks seized were improperly made insolvent

plessey co plc gave up its ninemonth fight friday 
against a 314 billion takeover bid by general electric co plc and 
siemens ag of west germany and advised its shareholders to accept 
the offer 
the recommendation came after gec and siemens said earlier in the 
day that they controlled 504 percent of plessey a british 
electronics concern 
the bidders said that with the majority stake and clearance on 
all regulatory matters they were able to make their offer 
unconditional 
under the circumstances it is in plessey shareholders best 
interests to realize their investment a plessey statement said 
plessey said it will now enter into discussion with gec and 
siemens to help ensure an orderly transition 
last month the bidding consortium raised its hostile offer to 
270 pence or 416 a share valuing plessey at 204 billion 
pounds or 314 billion 
in announcing earlier friday they had won control of a majority 
of plessey stock gec and siemens extended their bid until sept 28 
which will allow for further acceptances of the offer 
during the bitter ninemonth takeover battle plessey argued that 
the bid was inadequate 
plesseys earlier offer made last year was 225 pence per share 
that offer automatically lapsed in january following the british 
governments decision to investigate the impact of the proposed 
merger on the defense electronics industry 
in august the department of trade and industry cleared the 
companies bid for plessey after it agreed to several conditions 
designed mainly to preserve competition in the defense electronics 
business 
gec agreed that it will not take any interest in the plessey 
radar military communications and traffic control businesses 
originally the companies had planned for gec to take a 35 percent 
interest in siemens defense interest 
the companies also agreed that siemens as the potential owner of 
the plessey defense companies would name only british citizens 
directors of the units and that siemens employees given access to 
sensitive plessey defense contract work would undergo uk security 
clearance procedures 
also gec and siemens have agreed to make available the 
technology of the joint tactical information distribution system a 
project on which plessey and gec were competing to other british 
companies 
apart from the defenserelated areas gec and siemens are taking 
equal shares in plesseys electronic components and other 
businesses gec is also making siemens a minority partner in its 
existing telecommunications joint venture with plessey gec plessey 
telecommunications 
as expected the bid also received final clearance by the 
european commission last week 
an earlier 12 billion pound takeover bid by gec for plessey in 
1986 failed after the british monopolies and mergers commission 
ruled that the combined group would have too large a slice of the 
defense electronics business

the newly reinstated rule requiring gulf 
coast shrimpers to put turtleescape doors on their nets drew 
scattered protests today including an apparently unsuccessful 
blockade in louisiana waters one defiant fisherman said he would 
rather set my boat on fire 
critics complain that too much of their catch escapes with the 
endangered turtles because they must use socalled turtle excluder 
devices or teds 
shrimpers in louisiana set up a 30boat blockade of a shipping 
channel this morning coast guard officials said it had little 
effect but participants may be subject to arrest if they dont 
move officials said 
and about 400 to 500 other shrimpers and supporters from 
louisiana mississippi alabama and florida displayed protest signs 
along the route of a presidential motorcade as george bush rode into 
new orleans from a nearby naval air station for speeches to two 
groups 
the protest along the motorcade route was organized by concerned 
shrimpers of america whose leaders said they had nothing to do with 
the blockade at the gulf 
coast guard cmdr max miller said ships were able to navigate 
around the blockaders but officers will order it broken up 
nevertheless 
our boarding teams will go out and board the shrimp boats and 
order them to leave the area hopefully they will heed the order if 
they dont they are subject to arrest said miller 
belle pass which runs between port fouchon and grand isle is 
used primarily by shrimpers and oil industry boats miller said 
elsewhere officials said early spot checks found that most 
shrimpers were using the turtle devides 
twelve of 13 shrimp vessels inspected for compliance in federal 
waters off the florida keys late thursday and early today had teds 
in place according to gene proulx assistant special agent in 
charge at the st petersburg office of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration 
us coast guard officials in texas and louisiana at midmorning 
were still trying to determine whether the normal number of 
shrimpers were working 
we didnt have any problems last night and none today said 
chief robert cox at the coast guard station in galveston 
sydney herndon chairman of gulf king shrimp co in aransas pass 
said use of the devises is like cutting a big hole in your net 
his 48 boats will comply with the law he said adding that teds 
threaten to drive some shrimpers out of business 
the rule requiring use of teds took effect at 1201 am today 
ending a sixweek delay prompted by shrimpers protests including 
blockades of ship channels in texas and louisiana 
some shrimpers promised to ignore the rule 
ill set my boat on fire before i pull a ted said gary 
duncan a shrimper from boothville la 
jackie taylor president of concerned shrimpers of alabama said 
the teds rule would be ignored 
if nobody pulls teds im not going to be the first to pull 
them either said brownsville shrimper harry long 
jerry sansom executive director of organized fishermen of 
florida said thursday he thought compliance with the teds rule 
would be better among florida shrimpers than those in the western 
gulf of mexico 
coast guard officials said they did not anticipate problems in 
their random boardings in which teds are not the only thing 
inspected 
its not a very popular regulation with shrimpers and thats 
not a surprise to anyone but theyre aware that its the law 
said lt pat philbin spokesman for the coast guard district 
stretching from the texasmexico border to the florida panhandle 
the commerce department on tuesday reinstated the teds rule under 
a court order to protect the turtles under the endangered species 
act 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher temporarily blocked the teds 
requirement after shrimpers along the gulf coast blockaded ports 
july 2223 to protest excluder regulations 
mosbacher allowed shrimpers instead to limit their trawling times 
to 105 minutes with the idea that most turtles wouldnt drown in 
that time a method found to be ineffective 
failure to use teds could result in a maximum 20000 fine but 
the commerce department will phase in its enforcement 
vessels cited before sept 22 will be able to settle by 
purchasing and installing excluders before oct 15 from sept 22 to 
oct 15 shrimpers can have penalties reduced if they purchase and 
install teds within 15 days 
an estimated 11000 sea turtles die each year in gulf coast 
shrimp nets including the endangered kemps ridley leatherneck and 
hawksbill and the threatened loggerhead and green sea turtles 
environmental groups hailed the commerce departments decision as 
a victory for sea turtle conservation 
the cagelike teds fit in the back section of a shrimp trawl a 
grid across the middle allows shrimp to flow through but catches 
turtles waterflow through the device helps turtles escape via a 
trap door 
shrimpers say they lose 10 percent to 30 percent of their shrimp 
through the teds commerce officials say sidebyside tests have 
shown losses of 2 percent to 5 percent 
researchers in florida reported thursday they had found five 
times more nests than they had expected of threatened loggerhead sea 
turtles in a threestate 200mile stretch of the northern gulf 
coast 
thomas j eley assistant professor of resource management at the 
university of west florida said the study supports the use of teds 
shrimpers in the region had contended it is not an important 
nesting area and the teds were unnecessary

shares in the advertising giant saatchi and saatchi 
co traded slightly lower friday on the london stock exchange a day 
after rising sharply on news that a us investment firm had 
acquired 94 percent of the companys stock 
memphisbased southeastern asset management is now the biggest 
shareholder in saatchi which has performed poorly the last few 
years 
southeastern which manages 23 billion in assets for its us 
investors said in a statement the purchase is for investment only 
and was not being made with a view toward changing or influencing 
control of saatchi 
saatchi shares were off 2 pence to 319 pence friday compared with 
an 11 pence rise thursday 
a spokesman at saatchi said the company knew about southeasterns 
interest but had not known the stake was so high until thursday when 
it was announced 
under british investment regulations share blocks of more than 
five percent must be reported to the stock exchange 
analysts in the city londons financial district said the stake 
is almost three times as large as the 33 percent held by the 
saatchi brothers maurice and charles who founded the company 
i was surprised by the size of the chunk said mark astaire 
media analyst at hoare govett i was not surprised it was an 
american institution though because they have not had the bad 
experiences with saatchi that uk firms have had so they are less 
jaundiced 
analysts said southeastern is buying at the right time since the 
outlook for the worlds largest advertising group has been expected 
to improve since june when saatchi announced it would sell its 
consulting group 
they have been weak because of the quick acquisitions of some 
large new york advertising agencies like ted bates backer 
spielvogel and dancer fitzgerald said david forster media 
analyst at kleinwort benson the quick growth has brought slack 
financial control 
but forster sees the companys finances improving 
by selling their consulting division they will be able to pay 
off their debt and have an improved cash flow forster said 
although southeasterns announcement rekindled takeover 
speculation that accompanied saatchis disappointing 1988 profit 
figures released last spring forster said a hostile takeover is 
very unlikely

the government friday quickly replaced the two top 
officials of italys largest bank who resigned in a scandal 
involving at least 17 billion in unauthorized export credits to 
iraq by the banks branch in atlanta 
treasury minister guido carli appointed giampiero cantoni as 
chairman of the stateowned banca nazionale del lavoro bnl and 
paolo savona as directorgeneral 
cantoni replaces nerio nesi and savona succeeds giacomo pedde 
they had stepped down late thursday at an extraordinary meeting of 
the banks board 
cantoni a socialist was serving as chairman of istituto 
bancario italiano a statecontrolled commercial bank in milan 
savona a republican is an economics professor at the university of 
rome and longtime adviser of carli 
the nominations require parliamentary approval bnl is 74percent 
owned by the treasury 
the resignations came three weeks after the bank announced it had 
uncovered transactions by its atlanta branch that were neither 
authorized by the banks north american management nor its rome 
headquarters 
the 2500 transactions believed to span three years were 
letters of credit covering exports of agricultural products 
industrial machinery and plants to iraq the bank has said no arms 
shipments were involved 
the bank said the letters of credit while correct technically 
exceeded the credit ceiling the rome office had set for the atlanta 
branch 
the treasury said thursday that based on available information 
bnl apparently hadnt suffered losses of assets as a result of the 
transactions 
however its statement noted the operations have resulted in an 
increase in the credit risk thanks to the concentration of 
operations toward one particular country 
on thursday bnl said its auditing of the offbalance sheet 
operations at the atlanta branch showed irregular export credits 
totaling 264 billion of this amount 172 billion already has 
been disbursed 
the atlanta branch has made pledges for the remaining 920 
million but the actual transactions still need to be executed and 
bnl said its trying to determine whether these commitments are 
legally binding 
meanwhile matrixchurchill ltd a british manufacturer of 
machine tools with possible military applications said friday it 
sold equipment to iraq on credit arranged by bnl 
letters of credit issued by the italian bank were used in an 
unspecified portion of the companys 124 million in sales to iraq 
last year matrixchurchill spokesman david phillips said 
the united states italy and britain all prohibit the export of 
lethal weapons and militarily sensitive technology to iraq 
matrixchurchill based in coventry england and controlled by an 
iraqiowned holding company makes computercontrolled lathes used 
in the manufacture of a variety of industrial and military equipment 
despite their possible military applications the lathes were 
approved for export to iraq by the uk department of trade and 
industry phillips said 
a department spokesman declined comment on the case a source 
familiar with the export regulations however said machine tools 
that arent exclusively military in application could well have been 
approved for export 
italian press reports said bnl chairman nesi had balked at 
resigning during a stormy sixhour meeting of the banks board 
thursday night and in a resignation letter expressed great 
bitterness

soybean futures prices burst through the 
6abushel barrier friday on the chicago board of trade buoyed by 
rumors of new soviet interest in buying us soybean meal and rising 
fears of a raindelayed harvest 
corn and oat futures also finished higher while wheat futures 
were slightly lower 
soybeans for september delivery had traded as high as 6 a bushel 
thursday for the first time in nearly two weeks the market pushed 
beyond that psychological barrier late in fridays session on rumors 
that the soviet union was considering buying up to 2 million metric 
tons of us or south american soybean meal for shipment this fall 
the soybean and corn markets also were supported by forecasts for 
a rainy weekend in the midwest where corn and soybean crops are 
rapidly maturing 
the forecasts are feeding fears of corn and soybean harvest 
delays and of winterwheat planting delays 
although the crops needed rain earlier in the growing season 
theres a feeling that too much rain now will be a detriment 
said ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york 
at the close wheat futures were cent to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 395 a bushel corn was 
cent to 3 cents higher with september at 239 a bushel oats were

the ivory coast brazil ghana and other major 
cocoa producers said friday they plan to ask the international cocoa 
organization next week to revive a pricesupport system that would 
raise world prices 
word of the proposal came at the end of three days of meetings 
among representatives of the 13member cocoa producers alliance 
the proposal will be presented to the ico meeting of cocoa 
producers and consumers starting monday in london 
the powers of the 41nation ico to intervene in the market to 
support a minimum price have been paralyzed since february 1988 
because of a dispute between its producer and consumer members over 
the minimum price a proposed new stockpiling scheme should defend 
and a lack of cash to finance it world cocoa prices have been 
depressed by five consecutive years of surplus crops and earlier 
this year prices hit a 13year low the surplus has hurt the 
economies of major cocoaproducing nations such as the ivory coast 
on the new york coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange the spot price of a 
metric ton of cocoa traded this week at 1077 near the decade low 
of 1048 said exchange economist vic demayo in 1983 a metric ton 
of cocoa sold for 2800 he said 
the ivory coast the worlds biggest producer whose international 
debts total more than 14 billion is spearheading efforts to revive 
the cocoa organization cocoa is the source of 30 percent of the 
foreign exchange earnings of ivory coast and is an even more 
important earner for ghana 
world production in the 198889 season is put at a record 24 
million tons thanks to record crops in the ivory coast and malaysia 
and a big recovery in ghanas harvest 
traders have put the surplus over consumption at an alltime high 
of 300000 tons which would lift seasonend stocks above one 
million tons for the first time ever 
introduction of a proposed new stockpiling scheme under which 
producers would receive financial help from the organization to 
store up to 120000 metric tons of surplus beans has been blocked 
by lack of cash and a dispute over the minimum target price 
the cocoa organization is owed about 115 million by its producer 
members with the ivory coasts debt 70 million the biggest 
followed by brazil with 17 million 
i cannot say that we will guarantee to pay all our debts but 
something will be offered on that said one producer 
traders said if the pacts control function is revived at next 
weeks meeting this would boost the chances of a decision to extend 
the accord with its regulatory power intact for one or two more 
years 
if there is no extension the 250000ton stockpile already held 
by the cocoa organization will have to be liquidated under current 
rules within 4 12 years from september 1990 
delegates said that if next weeks talks fail prices would come 
under renewed pressure

eastern airlines pilots said friday they have 
chosen a gladiator to lead them after ousting the union leader 
who a month ago suggested they end their strike 
skip copeland an eastern captain based in new york was chosen 
by acclamation friday to take over the union leadership on 
thursday the pilots executive council voted to recall chairman 
jack bavis 
copeland a 27year eastern veteran and a union activist is 
considered a hardliner on the strike and far less conciliatory than 
bavis 
it was meant to be a positive move said raymond wright the 
eastern pilots unions vice chairman its been a long hard and 
tedious fight with a new guy you can have vim and vigor 
i believe the body is under the clear impression that over the 
next few weeks were on a backstretch wright said by telephone 
from washington where the executive council met they wanted a 
gladiator a hardcharger 
eastern meanwhile asked the us bankruptcy court to extend by 
60 days the sept 15 deadline for eastern to file a disclosure 
statement for its bankruptcy reorganization plan the disclosure 
statement will contain details on easterns financial position 
including 5year projections the company said friday 
miamibased eastern has been under chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection since march 9 five days after the start of the strike by 
pilots machinists and flight attendants the airline filed a 
proposed reorganization plan on july 21 the disclosure statement 
will describe how eastern intends to emerge from bankruptcy 
the rankandfile pilots sentiment turned against bavis after he 
proposed aug 6 that they consider ending the strike local chapter 
straw votes showed overwhelming opposition to halting the strike 
now in its seventh month 
bavis an eastern pilot since 1966 and official for years with 
the national air line pilots association became the eastern pilots 
union leader in 1986 
bavis didnt immediately return telephone messages left at his 
virginia home 
eastern machinists union leader charles bryan declined comment 
saying he didnt want to discuss another unions internal politics 
bryan and bavis had been on cool terms for years 
earlier pilots union and management officials said they have 
scheduled negotiations for monday their first talks in six weeks 
the pilots requested the talks before the national mediation 
board in june while the airline made a similar request in july 
pilots union officials believe the company is trying to rush through 
the federally mandated bargaining process so it can put aside the 
pilots contract 
jack mogus of the eastern pilots executive council said the 
talks in washington dc will probably end in an impasse and that 
eastern will ask the national mediation board to set a 30day 
coolingoff period after which eastern could impose its own 
conditions on pilots who have crossed picket lines 
the pilots who crossed picket lines are still covered by the alpa 
contract with eastern 
but eastern spokesman robin matell said we look at this as an 
opportunity to resolve our differences with the pilots union 
eastern previously dropped an attempt to have the pilots 
contract terminated in bankruptcy court 
more than 300 pilots crossed picket lines in the week after bavis 
and other union officials urged ending the strike other local union 
officials have been replaced since then 
the pilots union along with the machinists and flight 
attendants says easterns management is dismantling the airline and 
a change in ownership is needed 
eastern is trying to rebuild without its unions more than 650 of 
3600 alpa pilots at eastern have crossed picket lines since the 
strike began joining some 1000 newly hired pilots eastern 
recently announced it had stopped hiring new pilots 
eastern on thursday boosted its daily schedule to 601 flights and 
reported a 754 percent average load factor for august 
company spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the load factor was a 
record for eastern in the month of august she said percentage of 
capacity filled for august 1988 flights was 682 percent 
eastern had nearly 1100 daily flights before the strike eastern 
added about 200 flights thursday as announced earlier with most 
additional flights out of the atlanta hub that has been the focus of 
easterns rebuilding efforts 
eastern says it will be up to 700 daily flights on oct 1 and 800 
flights by years end when it hopes to emerge from bankruptcy at 
twothirds its prestrike size

the stock market edged upward today struggling 
to pull out of its weeklong slump 
analysts said traders spirits got a small lift from declines in 
openmarket interest rates 
but they said doubts persisted about the chances for any 
concerted move in the near future by the federal reserve to relax 
its credit policy further 
that view in turn has reinforced suspicions among many market 
participants that stocks might be due for a pullback after their 
strong advance through the first eight months of the year 
brokers say the markets rise to record highs in late august also 
may have touched off some selling by investors looking to get out 
even after suffering large paper losses in the crash of 1987

three senior executives of arbys inc said friday 
the fast food chain is in a crisis and called on the companys owner 
and its new president to restore stability while dealing with a 
hostile buyout bid by a franchisee group 
the statement by the executives came three days after president 
len roberts was fired in a clash with miami financier victor posner 
the chains principal owner over posners refusal to consider the 
200 million buyout offer 
posner on wednesday hired manhattan restaurant baron irving riese 
to succeed roberts who enjoyed great popularity among the chains 
franchisees 
rieses appointment drew fire immediately from the afa service 
corp an organization owned by arbys 500 franchisees that holds 
marketing and advertising rights to the company trademark 
we have a franchise system or several major franchisees in 
revolt and we need to get back a stable business climate said 
russ cooper the chains executive vice president for franchising 
and development 
we are asking our new president and owner to establish that as 
soon as possible cooper said by telephone from arbys 
headquarters in atlanta 
cooper joined frank belatti executive vice president for 
marketing and kam nassar executive vice president for finance and 
administration in issuing a statement friday pledging to employees 
and franchisees that they will ultimately resolve the current 
crisis 
after speaking with mr riese the afa board and many groups of 
employees it is clear everyone is very much interested in helping 
to keep this great company moving forward despite the differences 
which existed the statement said 
cooper said the companys problems have resulted in a 
questionable investment climate that could hurt the companys 
growth 
meanwhile posner released a letter to franchisees maintaining he 
would not sell the company which he acquired in 1984 as part of 
chesapeake financial corps 400 million purchase of royal crown 
companies inc posner controls dwg corp which owns 60 percent of 
chesapeake 
the 2100restaurant chain had total revenue of 1538 million 
and an operating profit of 207 million last year 
rb partners ltd a group of franchisees operating more than 
500 arbys restaurants wants to buy out the chain contending that 
posners legal and financial difficulties threaten the companys 
future 
posner pleaded no contest two years ago to federal income tax 
invasion and was sentenced to five years probation on the condition 
that he pay all his back taxes penalties interest and court costs 
he also was ordered to create a 3 million fund for the homeless 
a spokesman in new york for rb partners said friday the group 
is continuing its effort to gain control of arbys 
victor posners statement has to be taken in view of his past 
actions said the spokesman who asked that he not be identified 
we would assume he would naturally try to mollify the franchisees 
and then go about a divideandconquer strategy 
cooper belatti and nasser signed a statement with roberts 
earlier this week that was critical of posners response to the rb 
partners offer that statement preceded the firing of roberts 
asked if their differences with posner had been ironed out 
cooper said weve all been asked to stay we said we wont 
abandon the franchisees or the employees

ski industry businesses have joined forces 
for the first time to promote the sport among the estimated 35 
million americans who like the outdoors but never have donned skis 
the campaign will include network television advertisements and 
efforts by the countrys 450 ski areas to make skiing a more 
comfortable experience from squeezing on boots to swishing down the 
bunny hill 
for every 100 people who learn to ski theres probably a pretty 
high percentage probably at least a third who never return maybe 
its as high as 50 percent now why arent they returning said 
bill stenger general manager of jay peak ski area in vermont and 
chairman of the national campaign task force 
the anxiety some beginners feel when staring up a ski slope may 
be one reason for the dropout rate so is money 
the average daily expense for an outofstate skier in vermont 
for example including a lift ticket food lodging and equipment 
rental averaged almost 70 a day this past season a state survey 
shows 
ski gear can cost hundreds of dollars a pair of skis can easily 
exceed 500 and lessons can range from about 25 an hour for a 
group class to about 45 for individual instruction in many areas 
but industry officials are hoping to help wouldbe skiers 
overcome their reluctance by presenting skiing as fun and more 
affordable than they might think 
its an image campaign designed to show skiing is for families 
individuals for young for old full of fun and enthusiasm that 
people should give it a try stenger said 
the ski it to believe it campaign is sponsored by the national 
ski areas association which represents 450 ski areas in the us 
and canada and ski industries america which represents 600 
manufacturers and distributors of skiwear skis bindings boots 
poles and ski accessories 
the groups plan to merge creating one large organization called 
the united ski industries association 
the campaign was inspired partly by the golf industry which 
estimates 400 new courses will have to be built each year for the 
next 10 years to meet growing demand that industry contracted with 
mckinsey amp co a new york management consulting firm to prepare a 
longterm plan for such growth 
the ski industry has enough facilities it just wants more 
customers figures compiled by the nsaa show the number of skier 
visits has grown less than 6 percent over 10 seasons to about 5334 
million this past year one skier visit represents one person 
visiting a ski area for any part of a day 
golf is on a tremendous roll and theres no reason skiing 
shouldnt be stenger said 
the ski industry also used mckinsey to determine the potential 
market 
they defined an estimated 35 million people whose lifestyles 
matched up to current skiers said kathe dillmann of the 
springfield massbased nsaa so our target is this 35 million 
americans who should have some propensity for skiing if theyre 
active and like the outdoor arena we think they should consider 
skiing and we just havent approached them correctly 
the campaign a first for the industry began in september with 
some preliminary promotion the tv ad will air on the major networks 
nov 222 and jan 828 at a cost of 55 million 
shot last year at vail colo it will feature ski scenes and a 
theme song 
it shows moderate skiers and good action shots and 
learntoskiers there are some high mountains but not many mostly 
its just closeups of a lot of funlooking average people having a 
good time dillmann said 
another 15 million will be spent on print and radio ads as 
well as public relations and special promotions the campaign also 
may include newspaper ads to promote a national learntoski day on 
jan 19 when beginners can rent equipment take lessons and ski for 
free at participating areas 
ski businesses have been asked to give a percentage of last 
years sales to finance the campaign dillman said most of the money 
has been raised 
state ski associations will pick up the ball with local campaigns 
tailored to their areas at the same time ski areas will try to 
make the ski experience less frightening for the newcomer 
if we are successful in getting the attention of the 25 to 30 
million americans who have the potential to ski were going to have 
to be more sensitive in our rental shops our ski school stenger 
said 
all resorts are looking very hard to make sure theyre making 
it less confusing easy fun for a person to reach what i call the 
comfort zone of skiing where they know where they are and are not 
confused said bobby foster director of marketing for the 
waterville valley slope in new hampshires white mountains 
stenger said the ski areas in north america still have room for 
more participants especially if skiers try some of the less popular 
resorts 
in vermont if you get outside the top few resorts theres 
lots of availability in terms of space except for christmas week 
he said i would hope that with increased volume we would be able 
to see rates stabilizing thats a doubleedged sword for me because 
i know that price is one of the major deterrents to people skiing 
and we need to find ways of making skiing affordable we hope 
stabilized rates are a part of that

avon products inc disclosed on friday it may 
sell its giorgio beverly hills and parfums stern fragrance 
businesses suppliers of some of the countrys hottest selling 
scents 
no final decision on whether to divest the subsidiaries has been 
reached said james e preston the big cosmetic companys chairman 
and chief executive officer but avon has hired the investment 
banking firm morgan stanley amp co to help it explore the possibility 
of a sale and evaluate alternatives 
proceeds from a possible sale would go toward reducing avons 
debt which at midyear totaled about 1 billion preston said in a 
statement 
giorgio and stern acquired by avon in 1987 for a total of about 
345 million comprise the big beauty products companys retail 
division the division sells fragrances at department store counters 
and through other retail vendors instead of through avon sales 
representatives 
in the first half of this year giorgio and stern contributed 
four of the 10 best selling fragrances in the united states giorgio 
beverly hills red oscar de la renta and uninhibited by cher 
according to avon 
avon estimates that sales of its retail fragrance companies will 
exceed 300 million this year which would be less than 10 percent 
of avons total revenue giorgio has about 280 employees and is 
based in santa monica calif and new yorkbased stern has about 480 
employees 
selling its retail fragrance business has long been seen as one 
of several things avon could do in its effort to enhance 
profitability 
as one element in that strategy the company has been in the 
process of selling off its health care services businesses to 
concentrate on its core beauty and personal care directselling 
operation 
in the second quarter avon earned 395 million on sales of 778 
million compared with a loss of 825 million and sales of 704 
million a year earlier 
avon the worlds biggest direct sales company was motivated to 
speed up its financial turnaround earlier this year when it received 
unwanted attention from several suitors 
the most recent pursuer was minneapolisbased investor irwin l 
jacobs on aug 3 avons board rejected jacobs proposed 
41ashare or 285 billion bid 
earlier in may avon had doled out a rejection to directsales 
rival amway corp which had offered 21 billion avon also brushed 
off tentative advances from mary kay corp parent of the 
doortodoor cosmetics company 
both jacobs and amway had said that if they prevailed in 
acquiring avon they would sell off avons retail fragrance 
operations 
jacobs who holds about a 10 percent stake in avon met with 
preston in august and after the meeting avon said the two discussed 
business plans 
andrew shore an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc said 
jacobs interest in avon probably helped persuade the company to 
seriously consider selling its retail perfume lines to bolster its 
balance sheet 
i wouldnt be surprised if this was a decision that was helped 
by mr jacobs and mr prestons meeting a few weeks ago said 
shore 
analysts said selling the holdings would be a smart move for 
avon the announcement failed to spark enthusiasm in the stock 
market however avon closed unchanged at 3625 on the new york 
stock exchange 
jack l salzman analyst at goldman sachs amp co said i think 
its a positive move for avon 
wall street estimates of how much avon might hope to get for 
giorgio and stern ranged from 350 million to more than 450 million 
one analyst said it would be reasonable for a buyer to pay 50 
percent above this years projected sales of 300 million for the 
subsidiaries meaning the price of giorgio and stern would be at 
least 450 million 
names mentioned as potential buyers included unilever the 
britishdutch consumer products giant and shiseido cosmetics 
america ltd the us arm of the big japanese beauty and personal 
products company 
unilever which over the summer completed the acquisition of the 
faberge and elizabeth arden fragrance toiletries and cosmetics 
lines for 155 billion is known to be interested in building its 
presence in the prestige end of the perfume business 
avons chief preston said in an interview in the spring that 
several parties had approached him expressing interest in buying 
giorgio and stern on friday an avon spokesman refused to comment 
on who might be interested

whitecollar swindlers with organized crime 
connections defrauded dozens of thrift institutions and fueled the 
multibilliondollar savings and loan crisis the authors of a new 
book on the collapse said friday 
inside job raises new allegations of mob involvement in sampl 
fraud in the 1980s and accuses key politicans and federal regulators 
of stonewalling closer examination of thrifts to protect personal 
perks 
blaming 1982 federal deregulation that allowed thrifts to broaden 
activities from home loans to real estate development and other 
risky ventures the book says fraud and not economic problems such 
as the texas oil bust were at the root of the crisis 
deregulation was the best thing to happen to the mob since 
prohibition said book coauthor stephen pizzo a reporter for 
national thrift news they were watching this right from the 
start 
he added you take fraud out of the equation and there probably 
would have been no savings and loan crisis 
the book cites sampl frauds with links to the five big new york mob 
families gambino genovese lucchese bonnano and colombo as well 
as the civella family in kansas city peter milano gang in los 
angeles and carlos marcello in new orleans 
pizzo estimated that organized crime figures were involved in 
about 20 percent of savings and loan frauds since 1982 
the thrift mess cannot be described as primarily related to 
organized crime said rep jim leach riowa a house banking 
committee member who has read the book yet the organized crime 
element is real and has to date been badly underestimated 
the government has taken over close to 500 thrifts in the last 
two years the 10year cost of bailing out ailing thrifts is 159 
billion under legislation signed last month by president bush 
inside job also names las vegas casino owners thrift deposit 
brokers and a former mob stockbroker who received a new name after 
testifying against other organized crime figures but reemerged as a 
major sampl swindler 
the evidence was overwhelming that the mafia was actively 
looting sampls in various widely disparate locations at the same 
time in the same ways often using the same people the authors 
write 
the book to be published by mcgrawhill this month was written 
by pizzo national thrift news reporter paul muolo and mary fricker 
an editorial writer for the santa rosa calif press democrat 
among its other charges 
federal home loan bank board regulators repeatedly failed to 
contact the justice department about possibly starting criminal 
investigations of frauds and then refused to share information on 
sampl frauds it also says that federal officials repeatedly denied 
knowing of any mob connections to sampl frauds 
top fhlbb officials delayed implementing supervision for some 
thrifts that eventually collapsed 
political intervention by several congressmen and senators who 
had received donations from thrift executives significantly slowed 
down regulatory response to this looting 
william fulwider a spokesman for the treasury departments 
office of thrift supervision which replaced the bank board said 
theyre not the first and probably wont be the last to criticize 
what weve done here 
the staff made what it felt were the best decisions for the 
industry and the federal savings and loan insurance corp and the 
board acted accordingly he said i think theres an awful lot 
of trying to find a simple answer to all the problems of the thrift 
industry 
the authors said their investigation began three years ago after 
pizzo uncovered names of mobrelated figures in the collapse of 
centennial savings amp loan of santa rosa officials there have been 
indicted for money laundering 
this looting of savings and loans was done by a network of 
people who knew each other fricker said its not just 
something that happened in individual towns around the country

corn and soybean harvests and delaying the planting of winter wheat

new york

energy futures prices rose sharply in brisk 
trading friday supported by internal market influences and reports 
suggesting demand for oil is strong 
crude prices which got a lift from strength in the gasoline 
market broke through what analysts said was a key technical barrier 
of 1950 
on the new york mercantile exchange the october contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil 
jumped 34 cents to close at 1975 a barrel after rising 13 cents in 
the previous session 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery gained 146 
cents a gallon to finish at 5709 cents a gallon while heating oil 
for delivery next month advanced 124 cents to 5674 cents a gallon 
analysts attributed much of the buying activity to technical 
factors but some activity in the crude pits stemmed from price 
fundamentals they said 
people are buying crude because its underpriced in relation to 
gasoline said james steel an analyst with refco inc so 
refiners will keep buying in order to turn it into gasoline at a 
profit 
reports this week from the american petroleum institute and the 
department of energy on weekly inventories continued to be bullish 
for the oil market because they suggested that demand remains 
strong said madison galbraith senior energy specialist with 
merrill lynch energy futures 
the api reported a 58 millionbarrel reduction in gasoline 
stocks and a 15 millionbarrel drawdown in crude stocks the drop 
in gasoline inventories was larger than the market had expected 
while the crude figure was in line with projections 
the market is being driven by good fundamental support 
galbraith said demand is better than anyone expected and crude 
has broken through a key 1950 barrier 
energy brokers said rumors also added some spark to fridays 
market including unsubstantiated reports of problems at some us 
refineries 
gasoline futures benefited earlier this week from concerns about 
possible tightening in supplies after a fire at shell oil cos 
martinez calif refinery and one at ashland petroleum cos 
refinery in st paul park minn 
an unfounded rumor circulated in the financial and oil markets 
that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev had died but analysts said 
that had nothing to to with a late surge in oil futures prices the 
rumor was denied by the white house and soviet embassy in washington 
we heard that rumor but did not see any of our clients buy 
based on that rumor said larry lawrence manager of options and 
technical analysis for elders futures inc this was not a big news 
day and people did not expect the strength in prices so people are 
stretching for reasons

campeau corp the debtladen canadian developer 
and owner of numerous retail businesses friday proposed a major 
financial overhaul that includes the sale of bloomingdales one of 
the best known store chains 
bloomingdales chairman and chief executive officer marvin s 
traub said he is in the preliminary stages of putting together a 
buyout proposal 
wall street analysts said campeaus willingness to part with 
bloomingdales underscored the severity of the financial 
difficulties facing the company 
the decision to sell bloomingdales also was viewed as a bitter 
irony for campeau chairman robert campeau who about 18 months ago 
gained control of bloomingdales parent federated department stores 
inc after a prolonged takeover battle that included skirmishes 
with retailer rh macy amp co inc 
bloomingdales a unit of federated was widely assumed to be the 
top prize that campeau sought the 67 billion campeau paid for 
federated left the company deeply in debt and hobbled it 
financially analysts say 
in announcing the restructuring proposal friday campeau said the 
plan was designed to begin the process of significantly reducing 
the companys indebtedness and addressing certain of the companys 
working capital needs 
the plan will be brought before campeaus board of directors at a 
meeting sept 12 at the companys toronto headquarters 
among elements of the plan the board will consider is a possible 
infusion of funds from torontobased olympia amp york developments 
ltd which currently holds an 118 percent stake in campeau 
olympia amp york has discussed lending 250 million to campeau to 
meet cash needs at federated and campeaus allied stores corp 
division campeau said 
the investment banking firm first boston corp has been hired to 
seek possible buyers for bloomingdales campeau said 
bloomingdales chief traub is interested in a buyout of the 
wellknown chain he has headed since 1978 he said in an interview 
friday that he began making arrangements with merchant bankers and 
lawyers after discussing the idea with robert campeau and other 
campeau executives at a dinner meeting in london about a week and a 
half ago 
its in the early stages said traub adding that a change in 
bloomingdales ownership isnt likely to occur before the end of 
this year 
traub highly regarded in retail circles for his merchandising 
expertise helped give bloomingdales a special cachet that has 
turned it into a prized property 
this value was cited as a reason why campeau chose to put it on 
the block 
as a highly valued franchise that promises to yield significant 
proceeds bloomingdales offers the best opportunity to most 
effectively reduce the companys leverage with a single 
transaction federated said 
walter loeb an analyst with morgan stanley amp co inc said 
obviously theyre trying to expeditiously sell one of the assets 
bloomingdales is the most saleable 
bloomingdales would be the last thing he robert campeau 
would want to sell said loeb but hes selling it first because 
he no longer has the kind of options he was expected to have 
david poneman an analyst with sanford c bernstein amp co said 
selling bloomingdales isnt surprising because it fits into a 
pattern campeau has followed 
the company divested two premier properties that like 
bloomingdales had attractive intangible features making them more 
valuable that they would be just judging by their cash flows said 
poneman the two were brooks brothers and ann taylor clothing chains 
some analysts had speculated that campeau eventually might run 
into trouble trying to cope with the debt it accumulated in taking 
over federated and allied campeau bought allied in december 1986 
for 34 billion 
moving to counter the criticism in january campeau took out 
prominent advertisements saying nothing succeeds like success 
and touting the companys achievements because we have achieved 
so much in this last year it has been difficult for some to track 
and monitor our progress the ad said 
in late april campeau announced a corporate realignment and the 
replacement of several executives at the time retail analysts 
described the changes as housekeeping matters and said campeau 
seemed to be coping with the debts accumulated over the past few 
years 
but in an intensely competitive retail environment campeaus 
stores apparently couldnt generate adequate amounts of cash to meet 
their parents debtservicing requirements analysts said 
with bloomingdales now on the block several long established 
retail names are for sale earlier this summer the us division of 
australias hooker corp filed for protection from creditors under 
chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code and put its b altman amp 
co and bonwit teller department store chains up for sale 
bloomingdales founded in manhattan in 1872 operates 17 stores 
in new york new jersey connecticut massachusetts virginia 
maryland pennsylvania florida illinois and texas

united airlines machinists union said friday its 
officials have been contacted by two buyout specialists seeking to 
buy ual corp the parent of united and a prime takeover target 
one of the specialists later denied that it had approached the 
machinists but a machinists leader stood by the unions position 
if those contacts develop into an offer it could jeopardize the 
675 billion deal that pilots and management have proposed for 
buying the nations secondlargest airline a separate machinists 
bid could also drive a wedge between two of the industrys most 
powerful unions 
billionaire texas investor robert bass and takeover firm kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co both mentioned in previous speculation about a 
ual takeover are seeking meetings to discuss whether the machinists 
would be interested in supporting their bids said spokesman james 
conley of the international association of machinists in washington 
the contacts were preliminary and no possible purchase price was 
disclosed conley said he would not say whether further meetings 
had been scheduled or indicate whether the machinists would support 
either party 
but a kohlberg kravis spokeswoman in new york who asked not to 
be identified said late friday that the firm hasnt met with the 
machinists about ual and isnt interested in bidding for it 
john peterpaul general vice president of the machinists 
insisted that kohlberg kravis had discussed that subject about a 
month ago with the unions financial advisers 
spokesmen for ual the pilots union and bass declined comment 
friday on the overtures to the machinists 
last friday the pilotmanagement group made its proposal to buy 
chicagobased ual topping a 619 billion sweetened offer from los 
angeles oilman marvin davis under the pilotmanagement bid british 
airways plc would own 15 percent of uals stock for an investment of 
750 million the employees would agree to unspecified wage 
concessions in exchange for 75 percent of the stock 
the machinists cooperation is crucial to the success of the 
pilotled bid but the machinists had expressed doubt about that 
plan conleys hint of a separate bid appeared aimed at putting 
pressure on ual management and the pilots to address the machinists 
concerns about job security and high debt levels 
the machinists representing 25000 of the airlines 70000 
employees contend that the pilotmanagement bid is too high they 
favor recapitalization as a means of fighting takeover bids for ual 
the machinists posture appeared to strengthen the chances that 
davis could succeed in his rival bid 
there have been rumors that davis has started selling his stake 
in the company an indication he might scrap his takeover effort 
ual stock which fell 512 a share thursday on the davis rumor 
lost another 150 to close at 28025 friday on the new york stock 
exchange 
the transportation department has indicated it may move soon to 
curb leveraged buyouts and foreign investments in the nations 
airline industry 
pat friend president of the association of flight attendants 
representing 12700 workers at united said friday the flight 
attendants are still considering the pilots proposal 
we have not committed ourselves either way she said 
the flight attendants have been trying to negotiate a new 
contract for nearly two years and ms friend said participation in 
a buyout would have to include a new contract 
the bidding for the coveted ual began several weeks ago with an 
offer by davis driving up the companys stock on speculation that 
higher offers would emerge 
bass is a leading corporate dealmaker with interests in oil 
financial services real estate publishing and investments in 
several wellknown companies 
kohlberg kravis is a new yorkbased investment house that helped 
pioneer the takeover strategy known as the leveraged buyout in 
which companies are bought with borrowed money repaid through 
earnings or asset sales of the target company
