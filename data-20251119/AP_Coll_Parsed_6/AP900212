a bill to limit smoking in this tobacco state 
won preliminary approval in the house of delegates on monday but 
it is a weaker set of regulations than contained in legislation 
supported by health groups 
the bill would require establishment of nosmoking areas in 
state and local government buildings it would allow local 
governments to impose stricter rules against smoking but would 
limit local efforts to ban smoking in small businesses in theaters 
and on public transportation 
the bill passed in a voice vote monday and was due for a final 
house vote tuesday was approved over the objection of health 
lobbyists and legislators who backed a bill calling for stricter 
smoking regulation 
nevertheless some in the house worried about reaction in a 
state whose economy was built on tobacco 
seldom in my career have i built my own political gallows and 
provided the rope said delegate charles r hawkins a republican 
from tobaccogrowing pittsylvania county if i vote for this i 
might be doing that 
if its approved in the final house vote the bill would have to 
be reconciled with a more stringent bill recently approved by the 
senate 
in addition to requiring nosmoking areas in government 
buildings the bills main impact would be to set standards for 
local nosmoking ordinances 
local governments would be allowed to demand nosmoking areas in 
restaurants and ban smoking in elevators schools indoor service 
lines and school buses 
but local ordinances couldnt regulate smoking in businesses 
with less than 10000 square feet of floor space socalled mom 
and pop stores nor could they regulate smoking in privately owned 
meeting rooms in theaters or on public transportation 
the bill also doesnt address smoking in private work areas 
the rejected rival bill similar to that already approved by the 
senate would have allowed workers to declare their areas 
smokefree by a twothirds vote

president bush saying nobody wants to 
threaten the soviet union said monday that a united germany 
belongs inside nato but western forces might not be deployed in 
what is now east germany 
bush applauded what he called the bottom line spelled out by 
west german chancellor helmut kohl on the future of germany nato 
membership 
bush also expressed my appreciation of chairman mikhail s 
gorbachevs statesmanlike view that decisions regarding german 
unity should be left to the people of germany 
but the official east german news agency reported monday that 
gorbachev told east german leaders flatly that a united germany 
cannot belong to nato 
the news agency adn quoted gorbachev as telling hans modrow 
east germanys communist premier that he had clearly told kohl 
that a united germany staying within the structure of nato cannot 
be accepted 
national security adviser brent scowcroft said monday night 
thats not exactly what secretary of state james baker was 
told during his visit to moscow last week it was not really as 
positive as that scowcroft said after a state dinner for the 
president of the congo 
kohl said earlier that he had gotten the green light for 
unification from gorbachev during a weekend visit to moscow 
keeping germany inside nato would afford the most stability for 
both east and west in europe bush told a news conference 
us officials disclosed in ottawa that secretary of state james 
a baker iii had been discussing a us plan for the unification of 
germany with the foreign ministers of britain france west germany 
and the soviet union before and during his european trip 
the socalled twoplusfour plan would call for leaders of 
the east german government that emerges from march elections to 
meet west german leaders to make plans for the political legal and 
economic structures of the new country 
the two germanies operating as sovereign states also would 
have the power to determine the size of the german army 
afterward the united states the soviet union britain and 
france the big four victors over germany in world war ii 
would discuss such security issues as german membership in nato 
at the nato foreign ministers meeting in ottawa which eastern 
bloc countries are attending as observers baker took up the matter 
with his soviet counterpart eduard shevardnadze on monday and 
scheduled further talks with him on tuesday 
britain and france have endorsed the idea and the soviets are 
quite interested said a state department official who spoke on 
condition that he not be identified 
there might be some flexibility obviously on the deployment 
of nato forces inside what is now east germany bush said 
i think chancellor kohl is absolutely correct and we ought to 
support him nato membership said bush who will confer with 
kohl at camp david on feb 2425 
bush said nato membership for a new united germany is the 
most reassuring and stabilizing concept both for the west and 
in terms of how the eastern europeans will eventually look at it 
maybe not today 
theres some flexibility on deployment of nato forces into 
eastern europe nobody wants to threaten the soviet union said 
bush 
bush conferred this past weekend at camp david with nato 
secretary general manfred woerner who said afterwards that a way 
will be found to keep germany inside nato while recognizing the 
legitimate security interests of the soviet union 
one possibility woerner said would be not to extend natos 
military reach over the region that is now east germany 
asked if germany would be less threatening in an alliance rather 
than neutral bush said i think so the germans are good 
nato partners now and theyll be good nato partners then he said 
east germany is part of the warsaw pact 
bush said many europeans would be concerned by a neutral 
nonaligned germany its a concern that would be allayed by 
having a unified germany inside of nato said bush 
in ottawa meanwhile shevardnadze told a group of british 
correspondents i am not saying neutrality is the only way but 
it is the best way 
shevardnadze also said the big four might have to take up the 
issue of german reunification there is room for negotiation 
among the four powers shevardnadze said 
bush said he did not think a meeting of the four powers was 
needed at this juncture at some point clearly the four 
powers will have to have some say

looking for a present for the valentine who has 
more than everything how about an eyelid tuck or liposuction 
but at anywhere from 600 to 8000 cosmetic surgery may be too 
pricey so how does 85 a month sound for the woman or man of 
your dreams 
buyer beware 
it really is a medical procedure and all surgery has problems 
its not buying a fur coat warns dr r barrett noone a 
director of the american board of plastic surgeons which certifies 
doctors in the speciality 
dont bother lee goldsmith a physician and practicing 
lawyer says to those thinking of cosmetic surgery its an 
abused unnecessary procedure 
goldsmith only sees the failures in his new yorkarea law 
practice such as the a woman who came in after an implant with 
one breast going up and one going down and the surgeon was going 
to charge her to do it over 
but successes outnumber horror stories in the 
multibilliondollar industry an estimated 1 million to 3 million 
image enhancement procedures a year in the united states 
cher had her nose refined several years ago it looked too 
big onscreen and bothered me hey if i need cosmetic surgery the 
moment i need it im getting it ok she told people magazine 
angela lansbury went public last year periodic cosmetic surgery 
dating to 1966 has helped keep her a leading lady the star of the 
tv series murder she wrote said she decided to talk about it 
because cosmetic surgery shouldnt be just the secret of 
actresses and socialites now that its available to anyone who 
wants it and can afford it 
supporters call that accessibility democratic critics call it a 
problem 
medicine goes madison avenue with the kind of advertising 
previously reserved for the abcs automobiles beer and 
cigarettes says the staff of a house subcommittee preparing a 
bill to set some standards on how doctors can advertise such 
procedures and where they can perform the operations 
cosmetic surgery is a dangerously underregulated medical 
field said rep ron wyden dore who chaired hearings last 
spring that prompted his panel of the small business committee to 
draft the regulations 
the panel found that cosmetic surgery is often performed by 
unqualified doctors in underequipped facilities the staff report 
estimated that 3 million cosmetic operations are perfomed a year 
95 percent of them in doctors offices where crucial emergency 
equipment is often lacking some say the 3 million figure is way 
too high but theres no way to know for sure 
men accounted for nearly 30 percent of the 1988 patients for 
doctors in the american academy of cosmetic surgery and 22 percent 
of facial surgery by those in the american society of plastic and 
reconstructive surgeons 
earpinnings or croppings are big with males who had 53 
percent of those procedures reported for 1988 by the plastic and 
reconstructive surgeons group a further breakdown shows that 53 
percent of the total ear procedures was done on children age 12 or 
younger men had 23 percent of the eyelid surgery 12 percent of 
the facelifts and 13 percent of the liposuction fat removal 
the consumers dilemma and everyone seems to agree the 
consumer can get caught in the middle is that any licensed 
physician can do cosmetic surgery or brain surgery for that 
matter but the demand doesnt seem to be so high 
physicians have responded to the demand not created it 
says dr richard caleel president of the american academy of 
cosmetic surgery 
the demand or the money has induced doctors who are certified 
in gynecology ear nose and throat or whatever to turn to the 
more lucrative work a top plastic surgeon can do 16 operations a 
week at 3000 to 4000 a pop goldsmith says 
doctors can legally advertise perform operations any place they 
choose and call themselves board certified without designating the 
speciality 
this has set up a feud involving doctors trained in plastic and 
reconstructive surgery and those trained in some other specialty 
who turned to cosmetic work those who square off for or against 
advertising and those who like goldsmith say the risks of such 
elective surgery are just too great 
pity the poor consumer 
there are some very serious abuses going on out there says 
dann murphy a staff investigator for wydens committee people 
being blinded lost limbs serious scarring 
it goes well beyond a turf battle among the various medical 
groups she says and blames a big part of the problem on people 
lured into doctors offices by ads suggesting they need 
something they didnt know they wanted 
goldsmith is upset by the ads to put it mildly there is a 
tremendous selling of plastic surgery going on and much of it is 
being done by individuals who dont have the necessary skills 
advertising lets people know that techniques have improved that 
a hospital stay isnt necessary that face fixes are affordable 
that its not just for the rich and famous and quite frequently 
that one can charge it 
profiles amp contours with clinics in new york and connecticut 
runs fullpage ads with the headline look like a million for a 
couple of thousand it goes on to say you can get liposuction or 
breast enlargement for as little as 85 a month 
the groups 18page booklet with the picture of a young model 
on the cover says cosmetic surgery is not about vanity or 
selfindulgence its about feeling better about yourself as 
plastic surgery grows in awareness and acceptance it will gradually 
become as common as eyeglasses braces and hearing aids and be 
just as useful it says 
the booklet has a section on choosing a plastic surgeon that 
includes tips supporters and critics can agree on interview 
surgeons check out the hospitals theyre affiliated with make 
sure they have the proper credentials 
those on the centers mailing list got a letter recently 
offering an interest rate thats just 12 percent we can also 
help you by deferring your first payment till after the holidays 
costs range from 600 to 8000 
i call that seduction thats not the way medicine should be 
practiced noone says of ads that promise facelifts for a small 
monthly payment 
people need to know whats available says caleel who practices 
in chicago and is a professor of surgery at the chicago college of 
osteopathic medicine 
if a child is born with protruberant ears having those ears 
repositioned can be very beneficial they can be a type of stigma 
in our society he said its very rewarding to see a woman in 
her 50s get her first short haircut because she finally had 
surgery to correct large ears shed been ashamed of

when nelson mandela dignified but fists 
clenched high in exultation walked out of south africas victor 
verster prison the major us networks and cnn and south african 
tv aired it live 
the dramatic moment doubtless was taken for granted by younger 
viewers used to instant tv newsby satellite in the slow old days 
the moment would be shot on film and wouldnt reach the us for 
hours or maybe a day 
still its how you tell the story that counts not how you show 
off your technosmarts 
and on that basis abcs coverage of the mandela story this 
weekend was easily the best in all respects in reporting the 
story in giving it perspective and in showing with a minimum of 
extraneous chatter the drama of the moments before during and 
after mandelas release 
ted koppel who went to south africa last monday and on 
wednesday anchored the first of three nightline broadcasts 
there smoothly and knowledgeably anchored abcs sunday coverage 
from cape town 
nbc anchorman tom brokaw he and koppel were the only us 
network anchors at saturdays news conference in which president 
fw de klerk said mandela would be freed also was in that city 
on sunday 
neither was physically present at the deceptively 
pleasantlooking prison grounds for the release however they 
worked from other locations while cbs anchorman dan rather worked 
out of johannesburg more than 800 miles away 
sundays live pictures from the prison entrance and the crowd 
and security police around it were provided on a pooled basis by 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp 
koppel and abc wisely concentrated on scenes of the prison 
entrance and the crowds there showing the long wait the patience 
of those come to see a man imprisoned 27 years ago for choosing to 
fight apartheid 
brokaw and rather on the other hand tended to fill the wait 
with interviews of various south african figures going more for 
the analytical than the personalall that was well and good 
journalistically speaking 
but given the drama of main event at hand it came across as 
awfully dry stuff 
abc and nbc also broadcast portions of the lowkey 
straightforward running commentary of sabc announcer clarence 
keyter which gave us viewers a sense of what kind of coverage 
south africans were getting on staterun tv 
all the networks had crews in soweto televising the reactions 
of a crowd of joyous blacks in front of mandelas home there 
but abc in a literal case of oneupsmanship also had a 
chartered helicopter flying over the area showing the scene from 
the air giving viewers an idea of the size of the crowd which 
seemed to fill perhaps two blocks 
this may be an era of the portable anchor but the story proved 
a longdistance scramble for rather and to a lesser extent 
brokaw 
brokaw in new york when nbc was tipped that mandela might be 
released this weekend made a mad dash for the airport thursday and 
flew to south africa a spokeswoman said 
rathers trip was just as hurried but far longer after more 
than a week of anchoring from moscow he had returned on friday to 
new york a spokeswoman said but he roared right out again 
saturday morning to johannesburg 
only abc anchorman peter jennings was able to rest at home here 
but he had a few air miles logged too according to a spokesman 
jennings after a week in cambodia working on a special flew to 
moscow last week to anchor part of world news tonight from 
monday through wednesday then he returned here 
he wouldnt have found abc news president roone arledge here 
though a spokesman said arledge had flown to south africa to help 
direct abcs coverage

carrie stringfellow cant remember what 
happened to her six months ago when she was nearly embalmed after 
being mistaken for dead that doesnt stop her from joking about it 
i said when i die im going to stay dead she said 
laughing during an interview last week at a nursing home 
but her experience was no joke to state officials who are 
tightening up the rules defining who is qualified to declare a 
person dead 
ms stringfellow who is 88 years old and blind appeared to 
lose consciousness on aug 5 at a springfield boarding home where 
she was a resident the owner robbie caldwell said ms 
stringfellow had no pulse 
when dennis l porter director of the dennis l porter funeral 
home arrived to pick up the body ms stringfellow was slumped 
over in a chair and appeared to be dead 
porter took ms stringfellow to his funeral home and was 
preparing to move her to the embalming table when she uttered a 
sound he said it was a very eerie feeling 
i heard that the man had taken me to embalm me was getting 
his tools ready i started talking and he broke and run she 
said in the interview i laughed about that 
ms stringfellow was hospitalized for about a week and then 
transferred to odd fellows rebekah home a nursing center where she 
still resides 
she said she was told about the incident by a doctor a few days 
later 
he told me they had me dead she said i said what he 
said yeah they had you dead sure enough i said i aint 
dead i must have been off in a trance or something like that i 
didnt believe it i didnt pay him too much attention 
but she believed a nephew who confirmed the incident the next 
day 
in the wake of the incident ohio attorney general anthony j 
celebrezze jr asked a clark county court to keep the boarding home 
from being operated as a nursing home the action was dropped after 
ms caldwell agreed to remove residents who required skilled 
nursing care 
the case also led to a review of state medical rules requiring 
only that a competent observer personally examine a body before 
death is pronounced 
we felt very strongly that competent observers should be 
more definitely defined as someone who has the proper medical 
training said kay reitz an aide to state sen david hobson who 
has led the reform effort 
a rule was drafted for the state medical board defining 
competent observers as registered nurses licensed practical 
nurses emergency medical technicians paramedics interns and 
residents clinical fellows and licensed embalmers and funeral 
directors who complete courses in patient assessment 
board spokeswoman lauren lubow said the board is expected to 
vote on the proposed rule soon possibly in march 
ms stringfellow said she isnt angry or upset about what 
happened to her 
i couldnt blame them for thinking i was dead she said 
she said she isnt frightened by what happened but guesses that 
people probably have been embalmed alive before 
if he ever started to work on me i would have been dead 
she said thank god i wasnt dead that time 
ms stringfellow spends her time listening to television 
talking with friends and visiting with family barbara trimble 
director of the nursing home said ms stringfellow has a good 
number of visitors 
shes a riot said ms trimble shes wonderful

a kindergarten teacher near retirement 
breaks up a fight among her pupils and ends up on floridas 
computer list of confirmed child abusers 
a father of seven twice named his schools teacher of the year 
brings in clothes for a needy student other teachers find the girl 
trying on a blouse in the cloakroom of a nearby classrooom and he 
ends up on the list 
those were two horror stories a teachers union attorney told 
a task force formed to study how the state handles child abuse 
accusations against parents teachers and other caretakers 
both teachers cleared their names but not before they like 
other innocent teachers were hurt by the system said elizabeth 
dufresne an attorney for united teachers of dade 
we have had in dade county in the last two years six teachers 
lose their homes while suspended without pay three marriages 
break up an entire emotional deterioration of one teacher who 
ultimately was justified on every single ground ms dufresne 
said 
the last example was a kindergarten teacher planning her 
retirement after 37 years in the classroom the woman who broke up 
a kindergarten fight literally couldnt handle being accused 
ms dufresne said 
last year in dade county 57 teachers faced abuse investigations 
after breaking up fights she said 
ms dufresne was one of several education representatives at 
public hearings throughout florida in recent months to urge the 
task force to recommend that lawmakers change the way the florida 
abuse registry works 
access to the registry is limited to health and rehabilitative 
services investigators police and prosecutors who use the 
computer list to keep confirmed abusers out of caretaker jobs such 
as work in daycare centers public schools do not use the list for 
screening the task force wants to change the system so they will 
but teachers like any other caregiver including parents can be 
put on the list 
educators say the registry violates the constitutional rights of 
the accused listing them as confirmed abusers without a hearing 
and even in some cases listing them for incidents of 
schoolsanctioned paddling appeals cost thousands of dollars and 
take months often while a teacher is suspended without pay 
confirmed abusers remain on file for 50 years indicated 
abuse cases for seven years and unfounded reports for a year 
last week the task force decided to recommend changing the 
confirmed classification to proposed confirmed while people 
accused of abuse go through an administrative appeals process 
lasting no longer than 140 days 
the panel also decided to propose changing some indicated 
case classifications to indicated undetermined perpetrator 
ms dufresne cited the case of the teacher who brought in the 
used clothes for a 12yearold girl whose home was damaged by fire 
after trying on a blouse in the teachers absence the girl who 
was in a class for children with emotional and learning problems 
was found getting back into her own clothes 
the student said the teacher who gave her the clothes neither 
watched her try them on nor touched her but after two hours of 
questioning she said she had been fondled ms dufresne said 
the story changed again when ms dufresne was taking a 
deposition for criminal charges that had been brought against the 
man the girl got details mixed up and became upset ms dufresne 
told the task force 
she started crying the attorney said she said they all 
just wanted me to say something i tried to say what they wanted me 
to say thats all 
by that time the teacher had been out of the classroom for eight 
months the union had spent more than 30000 in his defense and 
he had spent 5000 
although the panel considered several aspects of child abuse it 
focused on the concerns of teachers and administrators who make up 
only a small percentage of those reported to the state and 
confirmed as abusers 
in fiscal year 198889 132805 abuse or neglect reports were 
made to the states abuse registry according to bj cosson 
director of florida protective services system which runs the 
registry 
only 796 of the reports involved public school employees most 
of whom were teachers and just 68 of those cases were 
confirmed cases of abuse 
linda harris an hrs attorney defended the system as 
constitutional arguing that classification as a confirmed abuser 
is not final until after the appeal process is concluded 
teachers arent being singled out she said 
that was the special interest group that got heard from the 
most said 
michael b demaria a psychologist specializing in child abuse 
said he sympathized with teachers but was concerned with the 
emphasis on adults rights as opposed to protection of children 
we dont want to throw out the baby with the bath water he 
said

soviet submarines have illegally 
entered swedish waters in dramatically steppedup operations since 
mikhail gorbachev came to power according to a study released 
sunday 
in one case a soviet minisubmarine got as far as stockholm 
harbor coming within a mile of the neutralo countrys royal 
palace said the rand corp report strager than fiction soviet 
submarine operations in swedish waters 
despite what appears to be real soviet progress in domestic 
reform and arms control this is still going on and why the swedes 
continue to permit it i dont know said gordon h mccormick 
who wrote the report based on public documents and swedish sources 
the report was sponsored by the us air force 
the intrusions have harmed gorbachevs attempt to change his 
countrys image in the west but he is unlikely to scale back 
operations unless he can demonstrate they are causing greater 
difficulties for the soviet union in the west than has been the 
case so far mccormick said 
soviet submarines have penetrated swedish waters since world war 
ii but before the 1980s there were never more than four probable 
intrusions a year and those usually involved one submarine at a 
time in outer coastal waters the report said 
since 1980 swedish sources indicate that an average rate of 
between 17 and 36 foreign operations are being conducted per year 
depending on the degree of probability that is assigned to each 
underwater contact the report said 
in addition the new operations utilized multiple submarines 
minisubs and combat swimmers and penetrated much deeper into 
swedens coastal defense zones including harbors of major naval 
bases the report said 
some intrusions made international headlines 
in the 1981 whiskey on the rocks incident a soviet 
whiskeyclass u137 submarine ran aground near the karlskrona naval 
complex moscow termed it an accident and after a confrontation 
that lasted 10 days the sub was released 
in 1982 multiple submarines were identified deep within the 
inner waters of harsfjarden near swedens largest naval base 
covert onshore activity also has targeted the swedish defense 
establishment 
the report cites a 1986 incident in which soviet intelligence 
agents posing as polish art dealers visited the homes of 120 
swedish pilots apparently to determine their identities according 
to swedish authorities it was part of a plan to decimate the royal 
air force in the event of war by gunning down the pilots in their 
homes 
the report said the greater frequency of submarine operations in 
sweden can be linked to soviet suspicion of its status as a neutral 
nation and the increasing strategic value of the scandinavian 
peninsula in soviet contingency war plans 
those plans apparently would involve crossing sweden to reach 
norway which is a nato member the report said

for colombians battling the drug 
establishment life is lived in a sealed guarded box breaking out 
can mean death at the hands of terrorists waiting patiently outside 
jaime pardo leal the leftist union patriotic party leader 
ventured out in 1987 only to be assassinated as he drove near his 
farm west of bogota 
so stifling had his box become that pardo said that life was 
ending for him said a friend bogota criminal court judge 
consuelo herrera 
he couldnt go to public places he felt his intimacy with his 
family was being destroyed by the presence of bodyguards and 
security measures finally he couldnt take it any more and broke 
out 
a normal reaction psychologists say for the politicians 
journalists judges and others living under death threats from the 
cocaine cartels 
often a deadly one 
herrera said pardo had begun to drive with his family to their 
farm without first telling the national intelligence police who 
had been providing bodyguards for him 
he was killed because he did not have the necessary 
protection he always said that he was not important enough for 
anyone to try to kill him herrera said in an interview 
so alarmed is the nation over death threats and the threat of 
threats that executives have become accustomed to traveling with 
bodyguards carrying submachine guns private guards wearing 
bulletproof vests and dark glasses can often be seen standing 
outside chic restaurants while their charges dine 
although herrera said she had not been threatened other judges 
have thirtysix have been assassinated over the last 12 years 
the first response by many people who have received a threat 
is to try to put it out of their mind bogota psychologist 
leonidas castro said in a recent interview 
it is most important that people at risk take an active role 
in protecting themselves that they avoid the image of themselves 
as helpless targets said castro who specializes in treating the 
stress and anxiety of highrisk officials that feeling of 
helplessness is the source for anxiety that can be as bad or worse 
than the threat itself 
many threatened colombians herrera said feel alone and wont 
talk about the problem but ive seen their worry and fear affect 
their families like a poison 
one journalist who had received several threats said that at 
first he felt the problem was not radical enough to cause him 
to change his lifestyle 
later though he relayed the threats to the intelligence 
police who said they had evidence that a contract had been put out 
on his life he left the country 
judges dont usually have that option 
for judges leaving the country or installing a home security 
system is rarely an option said herrera we will often have to 
fight a major battle just to get an extra government bodyguard for 
a threatened judge 
indeed even affording psychological help can be difficult for 
judges who earn an average of 380 a month but who would have to 
pay 25 to 100 an hour by castros estimate to see a 
psychologist 
although judges handling drug cases should take threats 
seriously colombians not directly involved with the cartels need 
not live in fear castro said 
a colombian bank president who has not received any specific 
threat can lead a perfectly normal life the psychologist said

in this textile center the solidarity 
trade union collects used clothing for the poor buys sugar 
wholesale to sell cheaply to workers and helps determine which 
managers the government should fire 
we control everything in town and are trying to get involved 
in everything said zbigniew ragan a solidarity leader at the 
stateowned revolution of 1905 textile factory which turns out 
linen fabric tablecloths and napkins that are popular in poland 
and abroad 
but he concedes that his membership is only a fraction of what 
it was during solidaritys heyday in 1981 and some workers may 
lose their jobs because of the policies of the solidarityled 
government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki 
preparing for its first nationwide congress in nine years the 
east blocs first independent trade union is striving to sink new 
roots among a work force hardhit by polands rough transition from 
communist economics 
ideally ragan and other leaders say they should be 
concentrating their energies on defending workers economic 
interests 
but for now they say polands economic crisis is too dire and 
the victory over the old communist order still too fragile for 
solidarity to flex its muscles as an aggressive trade union 
instead the union is acting as a shield to protect its 
government from workers complaints says jan zak chairman of the 
solidarity chapter at the zyrardow technical fabrics factory which 
makes synthetic fabrics for industrial uses 
solidarity in 1981 registered 14000 members in zyrardow a 
city of 41000 people 30 miles southwest of warsaw compared with 
2000 members today ragan said 
the same trend holds true nationwide in 1981 solidarity was 10 
million strong more than half of polands adult work force that 
was before the martial law that turned solidarity into a banned 
organization for eight years 
membership is expected to be no more than 25 million by the 
time of the congress april 1924 said krzysztof wyszkowski 
political editor at the solidarity weekly newspaper tygodnik 
solidarnosc that is less than the 6millionstrong unions formed 
by the communist party while solidarity was banned 
ragan and zak said the lower membership has more to do with 
apathy and finances than disenchantment with their reborn union 
many people simply cannot spare solidaritys annual dues of 1 
percent of income they contend but in any decisive conflict 
workers support solidarity 
meanwhile with a solidarity government in power and communists 
in retreat the union has greater influence than ever ragan said 
despite sharply rising prices and no wage increases workers are 
not striking against the solidarityled government zak noted but 
they do worry about job security 
there are plans for layoffs ragan said if it cannot prevent 
them solidarity hopes to find new jobs for those laid off 
while muting criticism of the government local solidarity 
officials seek other ways to help members at the revolution of 
1905 factory solidarity last year realized it could save workers 
money on sugar by buying it for them directly from a sugar beet 
refinery bypassing polands foodstore monopoly 
at the nearby linen industry development center solidarity 
chairwoman mieczyslawa jednejewska says her 48member local is 
involved in reorganizing the institute but it also collects 
clothes for the needy and makes loans to pensioners that probably 
never will be repaid 
people write us saying they dont have enough money to buy 
dinner she explains 
the upcoming solidarity congress will be the first chance to 
gauge the rankandfiles mood on a nationwide scale and the depth 
of support for chairman lech walesa and the national executive 
commission that has directed the union in recent years in the 
absence of an elected leadership since 1981 
walesa said recently he plans to step down as union leader 
solidaritys political struggle with the communists which led 
to the selection of longtime union activist mazowiecki as the east 
blocs first noncommunist leader has pushed union organizing to 
the back burner 
now many top union leaders and experts of 198081 are to be 
found not in the factories but in the government in parliament 
or in the citizens committees solidaritys political wing 
in the name of polands longterm national interests they are 
enacting a stringent program to reform the economy that strikes 
hardest at the very industrial workers who created solidarity 
walesa unites the trade union and the political currents in 
solidarity but it is becoming increasingly hard for him to hold 
the two together wyszkowski said 
although most solidarity workers still support the government 
leaders such as warsaw region chairman michal boni say the union 
must be free to work out its own identity and they do not rule 
out a quarrel with the government 
walesa himself increasingly speaks of withdrawing solidarity 
from politics and giving it a strictly trade union function to 
protect the interests of the working people 
what is not clear wyszkowski said is whether walesa wants to 
lead such a strict trade union or whether he would prefer embarking 
openly on a political career by seeking to replace gen wojciech 
jaruzelski as president 
walesa may move to belvedere the presidential palace 
leaving the trade union to protect the workers he said

the little boy cringed in fear when a 
155mm howitzer shell crashed near the battlescarred hotel dieu 
hospital the largest in christian east beirut 
his mother sitting at his bedside poured fruit juice from a 
thermos with a batman logo and tried to calm him 
dont worry camille she said its only thunder theyre 
the cannons of god they dont hurt 
but its not raining mother the boy muttered 
the comforting lie no longer works in lebanon where the shells 
have been falling for nearly 15 years of civil war between moslems 
and christians 
this time christian is killing christian as troops of renegade 
gen michel aoun battle those of warlord samir geageas lebanese 
forces for control of the christian sector 
camille is one of 150 patients crowded into the fetid corridors 
of the frenchfinanced hotel dieu 
alain tessier the hospitals french director said 190 
casualties had been brought in over the last 13 days 21 of them 
dead on arrival 
more than 450 people have been killed and 1700 wounded since 
the bloodletting began jan 30 
the hospital staff gave their blood to the wounded said dr 
pierre farah a surgeon 
some of the wounded died because ambulances could not get them 
to the hospital through the embattled streets he said 
some had lost limbs others were badly burned he said 
wearily they just got here too late 
those who make it to the hospital past the shellfire and snipers 
have to clamber up a rickety wooden ladder over the back wall 
because the main entrance is too exposed 
patients hooked to serum and plasma tubes lie on beds lining 
both sides of the corridors on the hospitals first floor and the 
undergound shelter 
among the wounded is a lebanese forces fighter whose left leg 
was blown off feb 1 by an army shell in nearby ein rummaneh 
the militiaman who did not want to give his name said i was 
crying for help but no one could get to me because of the 
shelling finally my neighbors came out of their shelter and 
dragged me in until they could find a car to take me to hospital 
the hospital has been hit by 15 shells doctors and nurses 
evacuated patients from the top two floors because they were so 
exposed 
we couldnt count how many shells fell in the gardens because 
its imposssible to climb on the roof and see there are too many 
snipers tessier said 
the hospital stands on the edge of the residential district of 
ashrafiyeh a geagea stronghold ringed by aouns troops to the 
east beiruts dividing green line to the southeast and the 
mediterranean to the north 
the hospital is running low on just about everything bread 
oxygen antibiotics and blood however tessier said the red cross 
brought 2200 gallons of water and some bread a couple of days ago 
during a lull 
hospital workers risked their lives to drive to the summer 
resort of bikfaya in the mountains 12 miles northeast of 
ashrafiyeh to get eggs and meat 
the morgue is overflowing with bodies because families of the 
slain have not been able to get through to retrieve them the 
hospitals last wellequipped ambulance was blasted by a shell on 
saturday 
all roads leading into ashrafiyeh are mined except for an 
overpass from moslem west beirut 50 yards from the hospital locals 
call it the ramp of death because anyone traversing it has to 
run a gauntlet of sniper fire 
a doctor said at least three people a day are shot on that road 
trying to get to the hospital the body of a man lies in fetal 
position beside a white mercedes another is slumped over the wheel 
of his plymouth 
other burnedout cars including a lebanese red cross van 
litter the street nobody stops to count how many dead there are in 
them drivers step on the gas on this stretch 
the international and lebanese red cross have evacuated at least 
50 wounded from hotel dieu sixteen were sent to france for 
treatment in a mission organized by bernard kouchner frances 
minister for humanitarian aid 
one was micheleen baruta who lost an eye her mother who 
worked at the hospital was killed by gunfire as she drove the girl 
to hotel dieu

the fading angular script spills across 
a brittle page of the leatherbound courthouse docket seemingly a 
mundane entry in an obscure chapter of frontier justice 
but it is signed lincoln 
the signature makes the 138yearold notation a small piece in 
the historical mosaic being assembled by researchers tracing the 
law career of abraham lincoln who was born 181 years ago today 
without exaggeration its fair to say that this is the last 
real gap in documenting the life of lincoln said cullom davis 
director of the illinois historic preservation agencys lincoln 
legal papers project 
historians are always uncovering new documents of lincoln but 
not very many whats different about this project is that nothing 
has been systematically unearthed and published about his law 
practice thats all theres left to do as far as documenting 
lincoln 
lincoln practiced law from 1837 when the 28yearold 
selfeducated attorney arrived in the muddy frontier town of 
springfield until 1861 then he turned his law practice over to 
his partner of 16 years william herndon and boarded a train for 
washington the white house and the civil war 
in 24 years as a lawyer he handled disputes about stolen hogs 
and bad debts complex appellate cases for railroads and cases 
involving the corporate giants of the frontier he took more than 
260 cases before the illinois supreme court where his was among 
the dominant practices of the time and gained a reputation as a 
writer of forceful succinct briefs 
yet among the approximately 10000 books on lincoln few have 
given thorough accurate treatment to his legal career davis said 
popular accounts portray a humble horseandbuggy lawyer 
dispensing homespun wisdom as he rode from courthouse to 
courthouse a modern legal scholar william prosser dismissed 
lincolns practice as rather petty and uninspiring 
the lincoln legal papers project begun in 1985 and expected to 
take a decade or more seeks to assemble a copy of every obtainable 
document from cases involving lincoln an estimated 70000 papers 
the complete record will be published on microfilm for sale to 
libraries 
but assembling that record is a daunting task 
davis estimates that lincoln handled up to 3000 cases but 
fewer than 400 have been documented the paper chase is complicated 
by the brisk trade in lincoln documents since his 1865 
assassination 
lawyers have them hanging on their walls they exist in 
obscure little libraries that somehow came to own them manuscript 
dealers trade in these things all the time davis said 
persuading the owners of such documents to come forward is often 
difficult davis said because many were originally stolen from 
court files or law firms even lincolns law partner systematically 
filched documents from illinois courthouses after lincolns 
assassination though his plunder is now in the library of congress 
much of the new information about lincolns legal career almost 
certainly will be assembled by combing the files of the illinois 
county courthouses where he practiced 
the tedious search began earlier this month in the menard county 
courthouse at petersburg about 20 miles northwest of springfield 
equipped with a portable photocopier and a computerized index of 
lincolns known cases two researchers are scrutinizing virtually 
every court case from the lincoln era 
menard county is expected to be a particularly rich source 
because it includes the site of new salem the village where 
lincoln once lived the area was home to many of his friends and 
acquaintances 
when my boss asks me how long ill be here i just shrug 
said joanne wallroth a yaletrained documentary editor who 
identified 20 previously unknown lincoln cases in her first week at 
the courthouse 
a typical case from the period finds lincoln representing mentor 
graham new salems schoolteacher in a lawsuit seeking repayment 
of a debt of 1583 from one jacob bale the case dragged on for 
two years before lincoln won a judgment for his client and a fee of 
1990 for himself 
as lincolns practice grew more sophisticated so did the legal 
system because of that parallel davis said the research will 
give historians an insight on the development of the american legal 
system 
the study also is expected to uncover the ways that lincolns 
parallel careers as lawyer and politician shaped one another 
if lincoln hadnt won the presidency in 1860 and had finished 
out his life as a practicing attorney he probably would have 
gone down as one of the great practitioners of the bar in the 
mid19th century davis said 
but thats nothing compared to what he in fact became

harbor pilots at the port of los angeles on 
sunday ended a twoday walkout that had crippled the nations 
secondbusiest port agreeing to a settlement that left open the 
possibility of more talks 
the pact between the city harbor department and representatives 
of the 11member pilots union contains no salary agreement but 
scheduled a meeting tuesday on wages said port spokeswoman julia 
nagano 
the pickets are being pulled and the pilots are returning to 
work she said 
she added that no retribution would be taken against the pilots 
the pilots went on strike saturday to protest what they called 
perilous working conditions that could cause a worse oil spill than 
the one off huntington beach on wednesday that continued 
threatening the southern california coast 
they also had demanded a 50 percent pay increase port officials 
said 
only one ship steered out of the port earlier sunday as 
dockworkers honored pilots picket lines with management handling 
pilot duties another ship cancelled plans to do leave while four 
others were moored inside or outside the ports breakwater 
awaiting berthing 
under the agreement the harbor department said it would allow 
pilots to refuse to perform a ship maneuver if they feel it is 
unsafe said wallace knox attorney for local 68 of the 
international organization of masters mates and pilots 
the pilots had argued that port authorities were using 
overworked undertrained personnel 
pilots also had argued that they were making 50 percent less 
than their colleagues nationwide they had sought to eliminate the 
difference over a period of years knox said 
the city had offered a 4 percent oneyear raise 
officials from the harbor department were not available sunday 
night to comment on the terms of the agreement 
when both sides meet tuesday representatives of the 
dockworkers union and the shipping industrys pacific maritime 
association will be on hand as observers knox said 
the pilots walkout was the first strike at the port since the 
1970s when a dockworkers walkout shut down the port for more than 
a week 
the port occupies more than 7500 acres making it one of the 
worlds largest manmade harbors it handled more than 2 million 
cargo containers last year making it the secondbusiest port in 
the united states behind new yorknew jersey

as valentines day draws nigh the treacle 
begins to flow can anybody explain why lovers call each other 
sweetheart or sugar pie or honeybun or other sweet 
nothings 
why not picklepuss or liverlips 
anthropologist sidney mintz of the johns hopkins university has 
some theories on why humans evoke the imagery of sweetness to 
express affection 
possibly our fondness for sweet talk can be traced genetically 
to our primate ancestors who discovered the delights of juicy 
jungle fruits as they swung from tree to tree he says 
perhaps it is associated somehow with the infants innate love 
for the sweetness of mothers milk he says in america it might 
even be reinforced by the high sugar intake in our fastfood 
candynibbling culture 
while lecturing in paris on the link between sweetness and 
sensuality mintz says it struck me as curious that all the 
words we use to describe love and warmth and good feelings are 
derived from the sweetness end of the spectrum of taste not the 
sour bitter salty or hot 
even the word sweet has its root in the ancient 
indoeuropean word for persuade so when we sweettalk somebody 
thats what it really is he said 
sweetness is associated with the language of love in the bible 
and the kama sutra chaucer wrote of my sweet cinnamon the 
clown in shakespeares as you like it declares that honesty 
coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar 
and today goodness is seen in the car engine that runs 
sweetly and or the triumphs of walter sweetness payton the 
great chicago bears running back 
the candy associated with valentines day brings together love 
and sweetness in a very striking way says mintz who has written 
a book titled sweetness and power describing the role that 
sugar has played in modern history 
sweets have an erotic nature thats undeniable he says 
what tends to be forgotten about sugar is its intensity an 
intensity that our bodies are immediately aware of mintz says 
what do you experience with your first mouthful of a hot fudge 
sundae its not surprising that we carry it over to describe the 
intensity of love and sex 
the scrapbooks that mintz keeps in his office document the 
bizarre twists that sugarfueled passion can take 
there is a picture of etienne tholoniat a master french baker 
who created a lifelike female nude out of white chocolate with 
spunsugar hair lying on a bed of 600 sugar roses 
a clipping tells the story of a 30yearold woman in santa cruz 
calif who covered her nude body with a chocolate glaze and 
posing as a chocolate easter bunny went hippity hoppity across 
the front yard of a neighbor who had spurned her affections 
according to police the neighbor called the cops who took her 
into custody after what was described as a sticky altercation 
mintz 67 says hes been happily married for 25 years to a 
beautiful brilliant woman named jackie they met on the campus 
of yale university where he was teaching and she was a young 
graduate student 
hes called her sweetie pie ever since

in eight short weeks the new 
leadership in czechoslovakia has done more to establish new ties 
abroad than its communist predecessors did in decades 
under the guidance of former dissidents president vaclav havel 
and foreign minister jiri dienstbier officials are working on 
havels declared goal of restoring czechoslovakias status as the 
spiritual crossroads of europe 
like much of czechoslovakias revolution the process appears 
almost effortless as if planned years in advance 
dienstbier dressed in an unaccustomed suit shakes hands almost 
daily with another foreign minister he apologetically told a 
western reporter this week that march would be the best time for an 
interview hell be away in paris ottawa washington moscow and 
copenhagen until then 
rita klimova known as the voice of the revolution for her 
translation at opposition press conferences in november is off to 
washington as new ambassador 
despite being unable to travel for 20 years these people 
maintained contact in the hard times with eastern european 
dissidents or western intellectuals journalists and politicians 
in this country abounding in ironies the dissidents were better 
informed about thought abroad than other czechoslovaks 
when revolution propelled them to power it was natural that 
their friends abroad would flock to show good will toward the new 
czechoslovakia and perhaps invest in what many western business 
executives see as a coming boom in central europe 
the business and celebrity visitors ranging from british 
playwright harold pinter to american rock star frank zappa are the 
eyecatching part of the serious diplomatic business of putting 
czechoslovakia back on the world map 
havel made his first presidential visit not to moscow like his 
communist predecessors but to east berlin and munich lending 
qualified support to german unification and trying to bury the 
ghost of 1938 the munich agreement that paved the way for hitlers 
invasion of czechoslovakia 
on his first weekend in office dienstbier joined foreign 
minister alois mock of austria in cutting iron curtain barbed wire 
on their border and repeated the same liberating act with foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany days later 
last week james a baker iii became the first us secretary of 
state to visit prague since 1973 
it gave us credibility which we really need said karel 
tucek an adviser of the civic forum opposition that powered the 
revolution 
tucek especially liked bakers stress on getting the economy out 
of state hands after two months we have so many businessmen and 
investors trying to find out what they can do but we have to wait 
for parliament to pass the laws 
baker left and foreign minister moshe arens of israel arrived 
to reestablish the diplomatic relations czechoslovakia severed in 
1967 following moscows lead 
there were never so many visits in the last years as in these 
weeks czechoslovakia is again an interesting country dienstbier 
told arens with the understated humor of many of todays prague 
officials 
prague also swiftly followed hungary in establishing ties with 
south korea and emulated poland and hungary in pursuing relations 
with the vatican inviting pope john paul ii in april 
in the reshaping of eastern europe into independent nations 
acting in their own interest prague has already surged ahead of 
its neighbors benefiting perhaps from being later with its revolt 
against the old stalinist ways 
it was the strident demand from prague for the withdrawal of 
soviet troops this year that encouraged hungary and polish 
solidarity leader lech walesa to demand the same 
at last months summit of the ailing sovietled trading bloc 
comecon it was finance minister vaclav klaus who gained attention 
with his threat later modified to quit the organization unless it 
changes radically 
havel journeyed to poland and hungary to propose that the three 
countries meet to coordinate their reentry into europe 
in this effort to change relations with the east havel travels 
to moscow this month the czechoslovak leaders can draw on old 
ties with friends in poland and hungary 
all share the philosophy that powered their dissent the 
creation of a society in which each individual takes responsibility 
for his or her actions 
the effort outlined in havels new year address to bring a 
new element into european and world politics by radiating love 
and understanding also has czechoslovakia looking in less 
conventional directions than simply cultivating the west 
prague wants nato and the warsaw pact to disappear havel has 
offered to mediate between the palestine liberation organization 
the communists mideast friend and israel 
putting personal philosophy ahead of offending china he 
meditated with the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama and he 
insisted on squeezing a visit to iceland into his route to the 
white house this month 
there also is a refreshing informality to the efforts to restore 
czechoslovakias standing and infuse new life into world diplomacy 
welcoming arens dienstbier broke protocol and invited him to an 
art exhibit by a man who was his cellmate during a prison term 
why were you in prison arens politely inquired undermining 
of the republic answered dienstbier chuckling

its jan 18 2006 sarah a 77yearold widow 
living with her son in wheeling wva wakes up as a bedside video 
screen plays sequences of classical music 
she uses her videophone to activate the kitchen coffee maker 
from her bed for her son and then switches the music to his 
bedside screen and turns on a morning news show when her son 
leaves for work she goes back to watching the news which has been 
on hold since she left it 
she dons a medical bracelet and plugs it into the videophone for 
a postoperative checkup from her heart surgery 
later according to a futurist scenario envisioned by the bell 
atlantic telephone company she leaves an audiovideo message for a 
friend listens to a talking book club and when she goes to 
bed programs an emergency pager that will if need be track down 
her son by phone 
bell atlantic says the whizbang gadgets sarah will take for 
granted are technically feasible now and could be in the average 
americans home by the end of the century 
but first bell atlantic and the other regional bell companies 
say theyve got to get the government off their backs 
rep edward markey dmass took a step in that direction 
friday when he unveiled a bill to loosen the restrictions on 
information services and equipment manufacturing placed on the bell 
companies in the 1984 consent decree that broke up the american 
telephone amp telegraph co 
previous efforts to free the bells have gone nowhere in 
congress opponents fear that unrestrained bell companies could use 
their enormous resources to drive out competition by limiting phone 
access and by crosssubsidizing their new and riskier business 
ventures with their heavy local telephone earnings 
but markey whose bill joins a similar measure introduced by 
sen ernest hollings dsc says it is time to defend us 
telecommunications leadership against intense foreign competition 
markeys bill would give the federal communications commission 
the oversight powers held by us district judge harold greene who 
continues to enforce the 1984 consent decree 
greene in 1986 gave the bells permission to transmit information 
services such as videotext computer data bases financial 
information and reservation and shopping services but would not 
allow them to control the content of such services 
markeys bill would allow the bell companies among other 
things to provide through nonjoint venture subsidiaries 
distribution of information services outside their calling 
territories 
electronic yellow pages directories excluding classified 
advertising to be updated monthly for two years 
emergency public safety services such as enhanced 911 calling 
research design and development of telecommunications 
equipment and under certain conditions equipment manufacturing 
the bill contains mechanisms designed to prevent crosssubsidies 
and other anticompetitive practices but allows the fcc to waive 
the separate subsidiary requirement after three years the 
information service restrictions do not apply when a bell company 
owns 5 percent or less of an information services company 
initial reaction from the bell companies to the bill was 
cautiously optimistic bellsouth described it as another 
significant step toward bringing america up to speed in 
telecommunications while bell atlantic said it was another 
clear signal that congress recognizes the need to address 
telecommunications policy for the nation 
however gene kimmelman legislative director of the consumer 
federation of america was hesitant 
this is a valiant effort to limit ratepayer risks but it is 
not clear that the bill provides more concrete consumer benefits 
than current law were still skeptical of the need for this kind 
of legislation kimmelman said 
mci communications corp said the bill was unneeded and will 
set back americas preeminence and global leadership in 
telecommunications 
although the consent decree didnt specifically mention cable 
television in the information services ban court interpretations 
have included cable in that ban 
owning cable tv service is crucial to the bells plan to wire 
the nation with fiberoptic cable that could make a sarah 
household a reality but the cable industry is adamant about 
keeping the phone companies out of their business and the markey 
bill does not change the cable tv curbs

black hopes white fears 
these are the crucial factors that nelson mandela and president 
fw de klerk must address as they set out on a precarious path in 
the direction of democracy and reconciliation 
for south african blacks mandelas release sunday was cause for 
unprecedented jubilation hundreds of thousands danced for joy in 
the streets of their cities and townships convinced at least 
momentarily that their own political freedom was a big step closer 
many whites were far less happy liberal leaders lauded de klerk 
for boldness but businessmen and homeowners worried about a 
possible upsurge of violence police struck back hard at rowdy 
black revelers and rightwing politicans accused the president of 
surrender 
its complete capitulation said koos van der merwe 
spokesman for the proapartheid conservative party when he learned 
mandela would go free when the time comes and they want to 
enforce black communist government on the whites they will have to 
do it by force we wont accept it passively 
de klerk raised in a prominent afrikaner family that believed 
whites were destined to rule is not yet on the brink of 
capitulation his proposals for powersharing between blacks and 
whites stop well short of the oneperson onevote system demanded 
by mandela and the african national congress 
but the presidents moves in the past 10 days have taken both 
his supporters and opponents by surprise when the cautious 
lowkey politician took office in august few south africans would 
have predicted he would transform the political landscape by 
lifting a 30year ban on the anc suspending executions freeing 
prominent prisoners telling militant exiles they can come back 
home 
these moves have won an unusual degree of international goodwill 
for south africa but de klerks standing among his own white 
constituents may depend on whether the anc is willing to meet him 
part way with concessions of its own 
the presidents brother liberal political analyst willem de 
klerk has met several times with anc leaders and predicted in a 
recent article that the movement would make compromises these 
might include official renunciation of violence and modifcations of 
the ancs socialist economic policy he said 
but mandela in his first speech since his 1964 treason trial 
told a huge crowd in cape town on sunday that the time for 
compromise had not arrived he reaffirmed his support for the ancs 
guerrilla campaign and urged his followers to intensify the 
struggle on all fronts 
he declared himself a loyal and disciplined member of the 
anc and said nothing to substantiate south african press 
speculation that he might be at odds with some hardline members of 
his movements exiled leadership 
the speech was not likely to reassure uneasy whites but was 
almost certain to be wellreceived in the townships particularly 
among young militants hardened by years of street battles with 
police who might have been wondering if mandela had mellowed 
mandelas only admonition to the youths was to be disciplined 
i hope you will disperse with dignity he said at the end of 
an evening marred by clashes between looters and police not a 
single one of you should do anything that which will make other 
people say we cant control our own people 
beyond the ranks of his own followers mandela faces the 
challenge of resolving anc feuds with other black factions to its 
left and right to many he is the only south african capable of 
this task 
at the same time he could boost the ancs longterm prospects 
by persuading a significant portion of the 5 million whites that 
their future in a blackruled south africa would be secure he 
offered no specific inducements to whites on sunday but told them 
the freedom movement is a political home for you too 
mandela has stated in the past that he is aware of whites fears 
of black domination de klerk has said repeatedly that he 
understands blacks desire for full political rights 
if they can find ways to convert this awareness into steps that 
make both blacks and whites feel more confident then the new 
south africa that each man envisioned in their weekend speeches 
might possibly materialize

the soviet union should conduct a 
failsafe review of its 30000 nuclear weapons to assure none 
falls into the hands of extremists at a time of internal tumult 
the chairman of the senate armed services committee says 
sen sam nunn isnt alone in his concern 
with ethnic and political tensions straining soviet unity some 
american experts are fretting about the possibility that a nuclear 
missile could be loosed on the world without the knowledge or 
approval of the kremlin 
my worst case fear for the last several months is that we 
would wake up one morning and discover that an ethnic liberation 
front had obtained control of 100 nuclear weapons said a 
military expert on the staff of the house armed services committee 
nuclear weapons are in every soviet republic that is 
potentially rebellious said the source who asked not to be 
identified by name 
bruce g blair of the brookings institution notes that the 
soviets may have 100 or so nuclear weapons stored near baku in 
soviet azerbaijan site of recent violent clashes between muslims 
and armenians 
until soviet troops entered baku to restore order widespread 
reports had gunmen seizing arms and ammunition from soviet military 
depots 
but blair said us government officials appear not to be 
worried based largely on their belief that the soviets have a 
penchant for tight ironclad control of nuclear weapons 
the issue may soon be explored in extraordinary public fashion 
at a time the superpowers apparently are nearing agreement on 
several arms control accords 
yevgeni velikhov chairman of the supreme soviets defense 
subcommittee has proposed an unprecedented joint hearing with the 
house armed services committee to explore ways of reducing the 
danger of unauthorized or accidental launches of nuclear weapons 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house panel says he is 
open to the idea 
nunn dga said in an interview i think you have to worry 
about thousands of nuclear weapons in a nation that has a lot of 
turmoil 
but he said that in an age of terrorism he also is concerned 
about the security of us nuclear weapons he wants the pentagon 
to review controls on us nuclear weapons and says his committee 
will conduct its own review if the pentagon fails to act 
nunn wants to persuade the kremlin to review the effectiveness 
of failsafe procedures to insulate their nuclear weapons from 
the countrys political troubles the two superpowers should 
cooperate more closely on the issue because this is one area of 
technology that it would pay both sides to share he said 
in the event of instability people have to be worried about 
who would be in charge said sen richard lugar rind a former 
chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
like others lugar noted that a probable silver lining to their 
worries is the continued cohesiveness of the soviet military 
machine 
there seems to be no instability whatsoever in the soviet 
armed forces lugar said they appear to be in full control of 
nuclear weapons short or longrange 
the soviets have an intricate and extensive security system to 
protect their nuclear weapons placing missile sites in remote 
locations surrounding heir perimeters with heavy guard forces 
prepared to use deadly force installing multiple launch controls 
the official at the house armed services committee said we do 
know you cant just walk into a soviet missile silo and fire 
them but he added the equation might change if an ethnic faction 
seized control of an entire province 
for sen joseph r biden ddel chairman of the foreign 
relations european subcommittee the concern is not that a faction 
in bulgaria or east germany might obtain nuclear weapons and use 
them 
it is more in whether the military comes to conclude that 
gorbachevs policies dont make any sense he said but i have 
trouble with that scenario the soviets are so careful with their 
control of nuclear weapons

moviemaker george lucas was pretty 
much on target with indiana jones according to the former baptist 
preacher whose archaeological treks inspired the movie character 
but vendyl jones founder of the institute for judaicchristian 
research in arlington texas said the movie character has just a 
little bit more sex than i have in my life 
jones 59 said that on a trip during the 1960s a writer 
accompanied him to do research for a story it was that story that 
eventually made its way to lucas who turned it into the indiana 
jones movies 
the former pastor of dungan chapel baptist church near 
elizabethton in eastern tennessee said the movies raiders of the 
lost ark indiana jones and the temple of doom and indiana 
jones and the last crusade taught people about the ark of the 
covenant better than any preacher 
jones said he has had to contend with collapses caveins and 
bigger boulders than indian jones encountered but he doesnt know 
how close he is to finding the ark the chest containing the two 
stone tablets inscribed with the ten commandments 
he said in a recent telephone interview that the movie has given 
him somewhat of an image problem 
i dont come in with a bullwhip and a pistol i leave them 
both in my car he explained

john appleton got an unlikely replay 
when he was summoned for jury duty the defendant was the same man 
appleton helped convict during his last jury stint 14 years ago 
superior court judge james morris said appleton told the court 
during jury selection wednesday that he remembered the defendant 
james richard turner from the last trial 
what are the odds of that happening morris said appleton 
said that was the only other time he served on a jury and i 
dont believe turner has had any other jury trials since then 
morris said turner recognized appleton from the 1976 jury that 
acquitted him of contributing to the delinquency of a minor but 
found him guilty of possessing marijuana 
he said hed be willing to have appleton again as a juror 
the judge said 
however defense and prosecuting attorneys agreed to excuse 
appleton from the panel hearing assault and marijuana growing 
charges against turner 
the results were no better the second time around for turner on 
friday the jury returned a guilty verdict

when the sun beats down on this remote 
corner of maine this summer campers will refresh their parched 
throats with drinks cooled by ice cut months earlier from the 
sprawling lake glistening at their doorsteps 
steve philbrick and his hearty band of ice harvesters men more 
committed to preserving a tradition than making a buck have seen 
to that 
with 5foot steel saws iron chisels metaltipped pick poles 
and brute strength philbrick and his seven men carved 2000 blocks 
from the 2foot slab covering mooselookmeguntic lake while winter 
was in its arctic prime 
they stacked mountains of light blue ice between layers of 
sawdust in two wellinsulated icehouses which will remain sealed 
tight until blocks are removed during summer 
much of the ice will be used at the resort philbrick runs 
providing refrigeration in its kitchen and a convenient cooler for 
the guests renting cabins strung along the shore in this western 
maine community philbrick who also sells ice blocks has one of 
the few commercially viable ice harvesting operations left 
his band attack the work with vigor enthusiasm and wit 
id rather do this any day than sit in the house said ray 
christy whose housemoving business slows down during winter 
were keeping the old times flowing the tradition going ill do 
it as long as philbrick does 
its something thats not done much any more and you want to 
be part of it said bob brown a transplanted new jersey 
draftsman who also runs a local computer shop and bakery id 
rather be here sawing ice than down there making more money 
a century ago maine was famous for the crystalclear chunks it 
exported all over the world said richard judd an assistant 
professor of history at the university of maine 
around 1880 the peak of maines ice trade up to 1 million tons 
a year were cut in maine mostly from river valleys in southern 
maine the ice which made excellent ballast for clippers was 
loaded between layers of straw and sawdust and carried to ports in 
the south the caribbean south america and beyond said judd 
as ice harvesting all but vanished a few old timers who had cut 
it in their younger days passed their skills to younger men 
interested in preserving the craft 
philbrick 36 remembers cutting ice every winter during his 
youth with his grandfather ronnie turmenne who is now 85 and cut 
ice until five years ago in turmennes prime he did four or 
five times the scale of the current operation said philbrick 
i was brought up with it said philbrick 
twice a day during summer philbrick fills 10gallon pails with 
chopped ice at each of his resorts 15 cabins so guests can keep 
their drinks and snacks cool the ice also provides refrigeration 
in the main kitchen which serves three meals a day saving money 
and assuring philbrick that his coolers wont break down 
philbrick also sells ice to a local salmon hatchery that uses it 
to regulate water temperature and to anyone willing to pay 7 for 
blocks about the size of four cinder blocks 
philbrick who also works as a ski patroller says it would cost 
more to buy maintain and purchase electricity for refrigerators 
than to run his icecutting operation he says his ice business is 
profitable 
working over 60 feet of water as a light snow fell philbrick 
and his crew reenacted a scene that would have been common a 
century ago muscling saws whose 1inch teeth slashed through the 
ice 
they hang on to the traditional methods most of the way 
borrowing modern contrivances sparingly 
after plowing a broad swath clear of snow they push a 
60yearold motordriven circular saw over the ice creating a 
checkerboard pattern of 16inch squares the saw which only cuts 
about halfway through the ice used a model t engine until 25 years 
ago said philbrick 
once a sluice that will lead to a wooden conveyor is also cut 
out of the ice the brawn takes over as men saw along the lines of 
the grid through the remaining foot of ice 
as the ice blocks are chipped free by the chisels they are 
guided by men wielding pick poles to the conveyor whose oak slats 
guide the mammoth blocks to a truck 
brown grabbing the chunks with iron tongs and stacking them up 
in the truck appeared disappointed as the final blocks were guided 
from the square hole in the lake 
were about the only people left doing this he mused

rural power cooperatives are diving into 
another fray in congress over attempts to pull the plug on direct 
loans by the venerable rural electrification administration 
the rea an agency of the agriculture department has poured 
billions into financing the electrification of rural america since 
the mid1930s critics say the agencys job is done and it should 
use the commercial money market entirely 
president bushs budget proposal sent to congress two weeks ago 
continues to promote a shift from direct loans by rea to guaranteed 
loans by private lenders 
direct electric loans in the fiscal year that will begin oct 1 
would be cut to 200 million from more than 14 billion currently 
including 622 million by rea and 813 million by the federal 
financing bank 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter told reporters after the 
bush budget was released that most rea borrowers now are very 
strong and commercially powerful organizations that should be able 
to handle most of their financial needs through commercial 
lenders and guarantees 
speaking feb 5 at the annual meeting of the national rural 
electric cooperative association in orlando fla yeutter told 
more than 12000 rural leaders that bush is not trying to kill off 
the rea 
there will be no more confrontational mode he said that 
will never happen during the bush administration 
the association the washingtonbased lobby for 1000 rural 
electric systems serving about 25 million people in 46 states is 
the reas chief surrogate warrior in the annual budget battles 
bob bergland is the associations executive vice president and 
was secretary of agriculture in the carter administration he 
pledged an aggressive capitol hill campaign to block the rea budget 
cuts proposed by bush 
we will never agree to any change that will result in a 
degrading of the quality of our service or an increase in the cost 
to our consumers bergland told the groups 48th annual meeting 
the association said bush resurrected a number of budget 
suggestions offered repeatedly and unsuccessfully by president 
reagan including straightline amortization of hydropower 
project debt and market rates for power sold through us power 
marketing agencies federal power is now sold at cost

this is the big season for smuggled birds and 
the agriculture department says the public should beware 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said every year from january 
through early spring hundreds of exotic birds enter the united 
states illegally after the winter breeding season 
the most popular foreign specimens are the hookbilled 
varieties such as the yellownaped amazon often sold by street 
vendors 
these smuggled birds often carry such diseases as exotic 
newcastle without showing symptoms glosser said since 1974 
there has been an outbreak of this disease in pet birds nearly 
every year although it has not spread to commercial poultry 
flocks 
exotic newcastle disease is deadly to all birds and would be a 
major problem for the poultry industry he said 
during an outbreak during the early 1970s the disease in 
southern california cost taxpayers 56 million to eradicate an 
estimated 12 million birds mostly laying hens either died or were 
destroyed 
glosser said if exotic newcastle became established in the 
united states it could cost the poultry industry an estimated 230 
million a year and increase the cost of eggs and poultry to 
consumers 
pet dealers are putting their businesses at risk when they buy 
smuggled birds he said anyone who buys exotic birds in the 
united states should make certain they purchase them from 
legitimate sources 
purchased birds should be wearing a circular stainless steel 
usdaapproved leg band engraved with three letters and three 
numbers 
glosser said smuggled birds infected by exotic newcastle also 
may cause minor health problems for people who handle them 
including eye inflammations

brazil has made large strides in poultry 
output and selling products overseas but an agriculture department 
report says economic problems are taking some of the bloom off the 
countrys export market 
poultry production doubled in the last 10 years putting brazil 
fourth behind the united states soviet union and china the report 
said the increase was largely in response to consumer demand for 
chicken caused by shortages of red meat 
exports peaked in 1982 at 302000 metric tons and then declined 
before rebounding in 1988 the report said brazils customers 
include some targeted by us exporters including japan and the 
middle east 
trade figures cited in the report showed that market shares of 
the lucrative chicken parts export market in japan have 
increased recently for brazil thailand china and others at the 
expense of the united states 
in 1988 for example the us share of the japanese market was 
more than 45 percent last year it dropped to less than 39 percent 
although brazil is commanding a respectable share in major 
world poultry markets the current economic situation in brazil is 
hurting its poultry export competitiveness the report said 
the main factor has been the overvaluation of brazils currency 
the new cruzado by almost twice the real rate it said that is 
making brazilian chickens relatively expensive to export compared 
with selling them domestically

nato secretary general manfred woerner says a 
unified germany could be part of the western alliance without 
extending natos military reach over what is now east germany 
woerner after spending the weekend at camp david with president 
bush said sunday that a way will be found to keep germany in nato 
while recognizing the legitimate security interests of the soviet 
union 
woerner speaking with reporters at andrews air force base on 
his way to ottawa outlined a possible solution that hews closely 
to a proposal by west german foreign minister hans 
dietrichgenscher for keeping germany in nato but keeping western 
troops out of east german territory 
we can and will find solutions which guarantee these security 
interests of the soviet union said woerner 
one possibility he said is not to extend the military 
integration of nato towards the former region of the german 
democratic republic now east germany and this could be done 
without problems but the whole of germany could and should remain 
a member of nato 
both bush and woerner hailed what the white house called west 
german chancellor helmut kohls extraordinarily successful 
talks with soviet leaders in moscow 
kohl said saturday he received unequivocal assurances from 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev that moscow would respect the 
right of the two germanys to decide for themselves on the timing 
and structure of their reunification 
the white house said bush and woerner agreed that nato should 
adopt new political roles including helping shape us policies 
toward the east bloc nations now shifting toward democracy 
former secretary of state henry kissinger on nbcs meet the 
press said it was important that germany remain tied in some 
way to the western community of nations with arms control 
arrangements to provide reassurance to the soviets and other 
countries 
a neutral germany would be a disaster for europe because 
the two world wars in this century were caused by germany trying to 
conduct a totally isolated national policy in the center of 
europe kissinger said 
gennadi gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
our position is that its for the germans to decide what to do 
next if they want a reunited germany its their decision 
but he added that any german union must take into account our 
security concerns and even our psychological concerns because we 
still have memories of that dreadful terrible war we had with 
germany 
for many people in my country its difficult to understand 
that we are going to have a big germany again as our neighbor 
said gerasimov on abcs this week with david brinkley 
john herrick an assistant white house spokesman said bush and 
woerner expressed their gratification that the government of the 
federal republic of germany had affirmed that a unified germany 
would remain a member of the north atlantic alliance 
they agreed that nato in addition to maintaining the common 
defense should adopt new political roles in helping guide 
western policy toward the emerging democracies of eastern europe 
in coordinating the negotiation and monitoring of arms control 
agreements and in developing western policy for regional and 
transnational issues 
kohl will be bushs guest at camp david on feb 2425

the wild rejoicing over nelson 
mandelas release from prison was tinged with violence and racial 
confrontation that underline the problems south africa faces in its 
search for peace 
in johannesburg and other cities the happy scenes of 
celebration sunday were interlaced with moments of ugly tension 
between whites and blacks 
handfuls of blacks threatened whites and some whites hurled 
bottles and insults at blacks celebrating the release of the 
antiapartheid leader after 27 years in prison for plotting against 
the white minority government 
the worst violence came in cape town at least one person was 
killed and scores wounded in fighting between police and rampaging 
black youths who smashed shop windows and looted shortly before 
mandela addressed tens of thousands of fellow south africans from 
the steps of city hall 
many whites looked worried or scared during the weekend as they 
watched cheering and singing blacks surging through parts of 
central johannesburg elegantly dressed whites shrank back as the 
black throngs danced around them 
while most people black and white were wellbehaved a handful 
of blacks taunted whites yelling freedom is coming whites get 
out 
for some south africans the scattered incidents of racial 
tension were worrying signs of what might happen when the 
government and antiapartheid groups attempt to negotiate 
leaders on both sides have expressed fears that white and black 
extremists will provoke violence in the months ahead to try and 
derail negotiations for their own ends white extremists demand the 
retention of white supremacy while some black militants oppose a 
compromise with whites 
at the elegant carlton shopping mall three young black men 
surrounded a young white couple spitting on the frightened pair 
and shaking fists at them other blacks intervened and chased the 
taunters away 
as blacks surged through hillbrow near the city center some 
whites in apartments overlooking the street hurled empty bottles at 
the celebrants the marchers screamed insults and shook their 
fists but no injuries were seen 
frightened white motorists caught in the milling masses in the 
streets leaned on their horns or scattered the crowds by driving at 
high speed some however clenched their fists in revolutionary 
salutes 
a white man watching the celebrants from his doorstep said 
look at them look at them what is happening to south africa 
some black youths pretended to fire imaginary machine guns at 
police vans filled with white officers shadowing the celebrants 
other blacks ran up to the vans yelling get out get out 
but much larger groups of blacks shouted peace peace peace 
most blacks and whites spoke of the need to work out south 
africas problems peacefully i pray to god we have peace in 
south africa said one black marcher we must all live 
together

when sen don nickles rokla talks about 
the clean air bill he talks about the general motors plant back 
home in oklahoma city and what tougher car pollution controls might 
mean to its 20000 workers 
why should oklahoma motorists pay as much as 500 more for a car 
to clean up the dirty air over los angeles or new york he argues 
citing industry cost figures that some say are inflated 
sen jay rockefeller dwva isnt so worried about car 
pollution measures as he is about the bills proposed tough 
controls on acid rain which are expected to cost west virginia 
coal miners thousands of jobs 
ive got to represent my people on this says the senator 
who won a 100 percent approval rating from environmentalists last 
year but will fight the clean air bill anyway 
the senate bill is the tougher version of two clean air bills in 
congress the house measure more closely reflects a proposal sent 
to capitol hill by the bush administration last summer and it has 
been characterized as acceptable to industry though not 
necessarily welcomed with open arms 
in an effort to resolve some senators concerns which often 
are regional in character and cross republican and democratic party 
lines senate leaders have held intense closeddoor talks with the 
white house for two weeks in hopes of working out a compromise 
the bills strongest advocates including senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine argue that the senates tough measures 
are needed to improve the nations dirty air and safeguard the 
health of tens of millions of citizens 
im convinced that the public wants this protection says 
sen joe lieberman dconn adding that he believes citizens are 
willing to pay a little more for cars and on their electric bills 
if the result is cleaner air additional costs are balanced out by 
reductions in health costs he argues 
but the views of mitchell and lieberman like those of many 
senators on both sides of the issue also reflect their regional 
interests 
mitchells home state of maine is on the receiving end of the 
acid rain created by the release of millions of tons of sulfur 
dioxide from midwest electric power plants liebermans connecticut 
shares the acid rain problem but also has suffered increasingly 
from severe urban smog much of it generated outside the state or 
from cars traveling through 
last week mitchell announced that senate leaders had reached 
tentative agreement on key parts of the legislation including 
compromises on curbing toxic chemical releases and smogrelated 
pollution from industry in each case the democrats bill was 
weakened under white house pressure senate sources acknowledged 
but the negotiators have not yet worked out agreements on acid 
rain pollution and tougher pollution controls on automobiles the 
biggest remaining issue several senate sources suggest the auto 
pollution issue may escape a solution and have to be fought out on 
the senate floor 
one senate participant in the talks characterized the white 
house as adamant in its opposition to a second round of auto 
pollution controls beginning in the year 2003 as required by the 
senate bill 
the bush administration has argued that the socalled second 
tier automobile tailpipe controls in the senate bill would cost 
an extra 8 billion a year and similar benefits can be attained by 
phasing in alternative fuel vehicles in cities with the worst 
pollution 
the administration agrees with most of the senate bills acid 
rain proposal but that provision faces strong regional opposition 
about 14 midwest senators insist that the rest of the country 
help pay to clean up the dirtiest electric power plants which are 
concentrated in the midwest while some compromise costsharing 
programs have been floated none has taken hold 
senators from the west and new england as well as parts of the 
south argue theyve already paid for pollution controls that have 
cleaned up their plants and dont want to pay for cleanup again 
senators from states expecting growth in electricity demand 
want provisions that will allow more expansion within pollution 
control requirements

immigration officials expect their plan to 
hold up to 10000 illegal aliens in tents will send a message to 
discourage an expected surge of central americans seeking asylum 
nicaraguans salvadorans guatemalans and hondurans apparently 
forgot about the agencys last show of force a year ago along the 
mexican border says gene mcnary the new chief of the immigration 
and naturalization service 
so tents and truckloads of beds and portable toilets are 
arriving to make good on mcnarys threat to detain up to 10000 
border crashers at a remote detention camp here northeast of 
the border city of brownsville 
mcnary who last month released more than 1000 people from the 
same 347acre compound to save money now says he will spend as 
much as necessary to show wouldbe intruders they can expect to be 
detained and deported 
it will be humane but it wont be convenient mcnary said 
in announcing the crackdown wednesday it will not be as though 
youre staying at the ritzcarlton you will lose your freedom 
while youre here and we dont want to do that 
at least 11 million will go toward the initial effort of 
shifting border patrol agents and immigration examiners from other 
parts of the country and packing detainees into large vinyl tents 
with plywood floors 
the first tent to sleep up to 100 on gray metal bunk beds with 
military green blankets was ready for occupancy friday at the port 
isabel service processing center the minimumsecurity detention 
camps official title 
detainees call it el corralon the big corral because of 
the 12foothigh double fencing topped with barbed wire 
the bare expanse on a former naval air station sits in sharp 
contrast to the nearby lush laguna atascosa national wildlife 
refuge with its tropical birds and endangered ocelots 
ins officials said it probably would take at least 10 days 
before the regular redbrick dormitories fill to their 1600 
capacity making the tents necessary 
the camps population was 1033 friday including 832 central 
americans another 631 central americans were detained at five 
other centers in the lower rio grande valley 
the commissioner said steady increases in the number of central 
americans apprehended by the border patrol prompted his blitz in 
south texas the nearest us point by land to central america 
otherthanmexican undocumented aliens mostly central 
americans caught in texas totaled 829 in october and shot up to 
1860 in january according to the ins 
walner hernandez a 21yearold salvadoran detainee who came to 
this country to find work and get away from the army as well as 
antigovernment guerrillas said he thought word of the massive 
detention policy would take hold in his country 
i wrote my mother and told her dont recommend to nobody to 
come illegally to the united states hernandez said 
mcnarys crackdown is an effort to prevent a repeat of late 1988 
and early 1989 when more than 50000 central americans streamed 
across the border to apply for political asylum in south texas 
the ins had allowed asylumseekers to travel to their families 
in the united states but officials in cities with large central 
american populations such as miami and los angeles complained 
they were overwhelmed and the ins discovered that more than half 
of those given travel papers never kept the obligation to report to 
ins offices at their destinations 
so the agency restricted travel for those with unresolved asylum 
claims 
hundreds of homeless asylumseekers began camping out in a 
makeshift tent city and a condemned building in brownsville 
on feb 21 the agency announced that asylum applications would 
be processed in one day at the detention camp those not able to 
prove they were fleeing persecution a requirement for political 
asylum immediately were detained and placed into deportation 
proceedings 
since most were denied asylum under the speedy gettough 
process asylum applications dropped from more than 500 a day to 
fewer than 10 
now with so many refugees still trying to get into the united 
states mcnary decided to repeat the message to avoid a new crisis 
last time he said the ins waited too long to take action 
refugee advocates said people will come anyway to flee war 
its a lifeordeath situation said jennifer bailey a 
paralegal at a central american legalaid office in harlingen 
its not a pleasure trip up north 
but officials in the lower rio grande valley as well as miami 
welcomed the renewed border effort 
i think no better signal can be sent than that we are serious 
about enforcing the laws along our border said cameron county 
judge tony garza in brownsville

after 27 years of silence nelson 
mandela the man has replaced nelson mandela the myth 
no longer the young lion of the antiapartheid struggle he is 
now its weatheredfaced elder statesman 
but he still speaks with the authority and confidence that led 
so many of his fellow blacks to invest their political hopes in his 
leadership 
i have fought against white domination i have fought against 
black domination he told tens of thousands of supporters in 
front of city hall shortly after his release sunday 
i have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society 
and it is an ideal for which i am prepared to die he said 
millions of blacks got their first glimpse of mandela on sunday 
the government had prohibited visitors from photographing mandela 
since the 1960s and only a handful of people knew what he looked 
like 
mandela has clearly lost weight since he was jailed both his 
face and his body are leaner than when he was a sturdily built 
boxer decades ago his face is creased with two thick lines that 
frame his strong confident smile 
his full head of hair is mostly gray with a distinctive patch 
of white on the right side his voice is full and strong and he 
speaks like the lawyer he is in slow measured sentences 
i place the remaining years of my life in your hands 
mandela told his supporters in central cape town after his release 
despite his age mandelas walk is smooth and graceful and he 
appears extremely fit the result of a twohour daily exercise 
regimen that reportedly begins each morning at 330 
in his first public appearance he was dignified courteous and 
polite in a wellcut suit he looked much more a politician than a 
guerrilla leader 
nonetheless his elderly appearance probably came as a surprise 
to many south africans the majority of whom were born after 
mandela was last seen publicly in 1964 
pictures of him as a vigorous african national congress leader 
in his 40s have been widely circulated in recent years hundreds of 
people at the rally wore tshirts with that youthful face 
emblazoned on the front 
mandelas reserved even formal demeanor is likely to work in 
his favor among whites who have long been flooded with government 
propoganda portraying him and the anc as a communistled terrorist 
group 
president fw de klerk and his government now say mandela is 
committed to a peaceful resolution of the south african conflict 
and like the blacks have invested considerable hope that mandela 
can succeed in bringing people together where others have failed 
but mandela stands firm on his commitment to a oneman onevote 
democracy a system the government rejects

president fw de klerk who set 
nelson mandela free remained out of public view on the black 
leaders day of freedom and took time to ponder the political 
forces he unleashed 
anton pretorius a spokesman for de klerk said the president 
wasnt in his office sunday and did not plan to comment on 
mandelas release until later in the week 
i believe hes just trying to relax a bit today pretorius 
said of the president who has launched a series of dramatic 
reforms since assuming power in august 
he added that de klerk was keeping abreast of developments and 
probably watched the live coverage of mandelas release on 
governmentrun television 
mandelas freedom is seen as a key to bringing black leaders 
into talks on a new constitution to give political rights to the 
countrys 28 million blacks virtually all black political leaders 
rejected talks as long as mandela remained imprisoned 
de klerks decision to free mandela has brought universal 
applause from abroad at home the countrys leading black 
moderate mangosuthu buthelezi head of the zulu tribe has said he 
is now prepared to enter talks 
however de klerk may also find he has now played his best 
political card 
some measures enforcing the apartheid system of racial 
discrimination have been scrapped bans were lifted on opposition 
groups in a historic speech by de klerk on feb 2 
however the pillars of the apartheid system remain in place 
opposition demands now focus on the issues where most whites are 
most reluctant to make concessions segregated schools and 
neighborhoods and black voting rights 
de klerk also is facing a backlash from rightwing whites who 
seek a return to strict apartheid measures

unless california gets rains of biblical 
proportions in the next two months a drought will enter its fourth 
year forcing one city to outlaw lawnwatering and others to 
require serious water cutbacks 
los angeles is drafting a water conservation incentive program 
farmers in turlock are using well water to offset reservoir 
shortages and merchants along shrunken folsom lake near sacramento 
are bracing for a decline in visitors 
the states precipitation stood at 60 percent of normal on feb 
1 for the rainy season beginning oct 1 1989 the 154 largest 
reservoirs were at 74 percent capacity and the water content in the 
snow pack was at 40 to 50 percent of normal officials said 
if california has even normal rainfall in february and march 
officials will declare the fourth consecutive drought year said 
bob fingado senior engineer with the state water resources 
department 
the most critical area is californias central coast where 
cities rely mainly on reservoirs for their water the regions 
reservoirs are at 20 percent normal capacity and gibraltar 
reservoir which santa barbara uses for water is dry 
santa barbara which has already banned hosing down driveways 
and sidewalks and daytime watering plans to take more severe steps 
next month including a ban on watering lawns and strict 
restrictions on commercial water use 
youre going to see a lot of brown lawns around here said 
bill ferguson a santa barbara water conservation officer 
officials intend to cut citywide water consumption by 30 percent 
to 45 percent 
the los angeles area has largely escaped the droughts wrath 
because the region uses a variety of water sources 
still plans are being drafted to urge people to conserve water 
including a program that gives cash rebates to apartment owners who 
install lowflow toilets said dorothy jensen a spokeswoman for 
the citys department of water and power 
we are at the position where we are in short supply she 
said we are having to buy a great deal of water but were not 
to the point where were going to call for mandatory conservation 
in turlock the drought has lowered the don pedro reservoir to 
the point that farmers will be pumping ground water to meet their 
demands said russ deluca irrigation system administrator with the 
turlock irrigation district 
continued dry weather has diminished the possibility of a normal 
runoff from the sierra nevada and officials say precipitation in 
the tuolumne river water shed remains 4 inches below normal 
the drought has hurt businesses around folsom lake east of 
sacramento which last year lost an estimated 1 million visitors 
from the previous year because of the low water level state 
officials said 
santa clara county which last year ordered mandatory 25 percent 
water cutbacks for residents may be forced to resume the program 
if the water district cant recapture rain water in its nowempty 
10 reservoirs 
teddy morse a spokeswoman for the santa clara valley water 
district also noted that voluntary conservation efforts in the 
area south of san francisco not working too well 
in nevada the sierra snow pack which provides nearly all of 
the reno areas summer water has a water content more than 50 
percent below normal for early february 
last winters snowfall was about average but was not nearly 
enough to replenish lake tahoe and other reservoirs drained the 
previous two years 
not in historic time have we had four straight drought years 
in nevada state climatologist john james said this year 
water reserves are dangerously low its very difficult to make up 
the difference

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee says the bush administrations arms control position is 
being put together by carpenters rather than architects and 
lacks a broad view 
sen sam nunn dga said sunday that the administration needs 
to look at us weapons systems as they relate to arms control and 
an apparent willingness by the soviets to disarm 
its going to be awfully hard for this administration to say 
weve had a breakthrough in negotiating with the soviets were 
going to reduce arms by about 30 to 40 percent and then come up and 
say we want two missiles two of them mobile we want a new b2 
bomber we want an sdi program to go forward full steam all of 
these things at one time nunn said on nbctvs meet the 
press program 
i dont think thats going to sell he stated 
nunn said bushs armed forces modernization plans do not take 
into account some of the possibilities in arms control such as 
eliminating the mx rail mobile missile in exchange for the soviet 
ss24 which also is a based on railroad cars and moving toward a 
policy of no multiplewarhead missiles 
our arms control position is really being done by carpenters 
rather than architects he said i dont think in congress 
theres going to be a lot of receptivity to going forward with huge 
weapon systems unless there is a strategic concept that fits into 
the arms control

us officials say more than 100000 liberians 
have fled to neighboring countries in recent weeks to escape an 
army campaign to stifle a libyanbacked rebellion 
some official estimates say up to 140000 have left the west 
african country with a majority going to ivory coast and the 
remainder to guinea 
one us official attributed the exodus to excesses by both 
government forces and the rebels but andrew natsios director of 
the us office of foreign disaster assistance said the army was 
chiefly responsible 
the behavior of the army has been very disturbing natsios 
said in an interview last week it is primarily the army that is 
causing the movement of people 
he called the army a major cause of human rights abuses 
one official citing the testimony of refugees said army troops 
are arresting all young men in the conflict area and some are being 
shot 
but another us official said the flight of the liberians was 
based more on rumors of danger than on actual abuses 
both officials spoke only on condition of anonymity 
the state department said last month that us military 
officers acting at the request of liberian officials had stepped 
in to stop abuses by the government troops 
liberia a nation of less than 2 million population was founded 
a century and half ago by freed american slaves 
the united states and liberia historically have had close ties 
but the relationship over the past decade has been strained because 
of repeated allegations of rights abuses and corruption by the 
government of president samuel k doe

the galileo space ship cruised on the 
next leg of its 24billion mile sixyear trip to jupiter after 
engineers replaced faulty computer commands that made the craft act 
like a mad shutterbug 
galileo snapped 16 planned photos of venus on saturday but for 
about five hours the shutter on the spacecrafts electronic camera 
opened and closed 452 times when it wasnt supposed to do so none 
of those unintended exposures were recorded 
nasa engineers sent the 28ton galileo new computer commands 
late saturday and the camera was able to snap 38 pictures right 
on schedule of cloudshrouded venus in a series that ended sunday 
morning 
they seem to understand what happened and theyre not 
concerned about any repeats said bob macmillin spokesman for 
the national aeronautics and space administrations jet propulsion 
laboratory 
galileo is now flying back toward earth so the planet can act as 
a gravity slingshot on dec 8 to help the spacecraft reach jupiter 
in 1995 in a 135 billion mission to explore the solar systems 
largest planet 
galileo swooped about 10000 miles above the 900degree 
fahrenheit surface of venus at 959 pm pst friday in the 
missions first gravity assist maneuver venus helped increase 
galileos speed by almost 5000 mph giving it enough energy to get 
to jupiter 
after the flyby the spacecraft took 16 pictures to study 
venusian cloud and wind patterns and look for lightning the camera 
bugs then developed 
macmillin said engineers determined galileos camera and 
computer were fine and that the problem was in a computer program 
sent from earth to tell galileo what to do and when to do it 
the problem was caused by improper timing between various 
commands within the computer program macmillin said 
he said such problems are not unusual on a spacecraft as new as 
galileo the craft was deployed oct 18 from the cargo bay of space 
shuttle atlantis then launched by a solidfueled booster to start 
its looping 24billionmile sixyear trip to jupiter 
the spacecraft was programmed to continue looking back at venus 
until late this friday taking 27 more photos and using other 
sensors to detect dust infrared and visible light and 
electrically charged particles 
the pictures and measurements are stored on the spacecrafts 
tape recorder almost all of them will be sent back to earth in 
october when galileo is close enough to send scientific information 
using its small antenna 
that antenna now can be used only to help run the spacecraft a 
large antenna currently is furled to protect it from the suns heat 
after swinging past earth in december galileo will explore 
asteroid gaspra in october 1991 then make another flight past 
earth on dec 8 1992 the spacecraft may study asteroid ida in 
august 1993 before galileo deploys a 760pound probe in july 1995 
galileo and the probe will reach jupiter in december 1995 
the probe will parachute into the planets atmosphere relaying 
measurements to galileo until it is vaporized by intense heat and 
pressure galileo will swoop past the moon io and its 
sulfurspewing volcanoes then go into orbit around jupiter to 
study the planet and moons europa callisto and ganymede at least 
until late 1997

fortyfive years after soviet troops dealt a 
fatal blow to the third reich in the streets of this city germans 
are drawing up plans for bringing the capital of a united germany 
back to berlin 
west germans on sunday were caught up in reunification euphoria 
after an elated chancellor helmut kohl returned from moscow with 
what he called a green light for the unity of our fatherland 
dismissed as a nostalgic dream just four months ago german 
unification has become increasingly likely kohl says the historic 
step could come by the end of this year 
kohl led a champagne toast to germany on board his crowded 
jetliner heading back to bonn after talks in moscow with mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the west german leader made it clear that the world war ii 
allies france britain the united states and the soviet union 
will have a key role in shaping unification plans along with the 
two german states 
still west germany faces numerous financial and other 
challenges as it attempts to unite its renowned wealth with the 
nearly collapsed economy of east germany where the collapse of 
communist rule has virtually crippled the government 
the federal republic west germany is facing an economic 
adventure commented the zdf television network no one can 
predict just how much the joining will cost but its certain that 
in the areas of unemployment benefits pensions and medical costs 
west germans will be asked to make sacrifices in the billions 
the increasingly rapid turn of events has focused attention on 
berlin which many regard as the true german capital east berlin 
is the capital of east germany although the western allies insist 
that violates postwar agreements bonn is the capital of west 
germany 
after weeks of being skeptical about unification west berlins 
leftistled city government said sunday it will begin working with 
east berlin officials to prepare the entire city to become the 
capital of a united germany 
west berlin planning chief michaela schreyer announced that 
several models will be developed for the increasingly probable 
case of making the city the capital 
she said buildings must be sought for use by embassies 
government agencies and delegations from german states the stately 
reichstag building near the brandenburg gate is expected to serve 
as the parliament building 
planners in both the east and west have their work cut out for 
them 
with a total of about 3 million residents on both sides of the 
city berlin already is overcrowded and heavy smog drifts over the 
city from surrounding east germany 
housing in the west is extremely scarce and the situation will 
only get worse if tens of thousands people including lawmakers 
support staff diplomats lobbyists and national organizations 
arrive in search of places to live 
the only possibilities for suburban expansion are in surrounding 
east germany but builders would have to start from scratch there 
in constructing new homes and apartments berlin is located 100 
miles inside east germany 
the world war ii allies still have control over berlin once the 
nazi capital and later the site of the cold war showdown that led 
to the berlin wall 
ms schreyer promised to work with the allies in preparing for 
the return of the capital 
after the fall of the berlin wall it is now necessary to 
overcome the walls in our heads and to start to plan for berlin as 
a whole ms schreyer said in a statement to the news media 
sports officials are already pressing to make berlin the site of 
a future olympic games 
suggestions abound to hold international meetings and 
conferences in the city to symbolize the improvements in eastwest 
relations 
the growing focus on berlin has led to mounting concerns in 
bonn which was a sleepy rhine river city before it was turned into 
west germanys provisional capital 41 years ago with the defeat 
of the nazis 
hildegardhamm bruecher a leading member of the free democrats 
party has demanded an immediate halt to government building 
projects in bonn 
further construction in what is still the capital cannot be 
justified given the rapid pace of change in germangerman 
relations she told the bild am sonntag newspaper

world war ii veteran and purple 
heart winner anthony beggetta died expecting to be buried with 
military pomp 
but when his family tried to arrange the color guard rifle 
salute and bugleblown taps they discovered a change in policy 
at new englands main army base because of budget constraints 
my father didnt talk too much about it but he said he wanted 
a military funeral said beggettas daughter jeanne udas its 
just something we knew all our lives that he wanted 
beggetta who was 75 when he died jan 19 got his military 
sendoff when officials at the local veterans of foreign wars post 
sent a color guard 
but although the family appreciated the efforts the funeral 
wasnt of course as impressive as what my father expected or 
wanted udas said 
the problem military officials say is that the veteran 
population from world war ii is aging at a time when the military 
is under pressure to trim spending 
theres no intent to slight veterans thats not the point 
when theres less money we have to find ways to cut said 
phillip morris spokesman for fort devens in ayers 
army policy is to provide funeral details for soldiers who die 
on active duty and medal of honor winners said shari lawrence 
spokeswoman for the armys personnel command in alexandria va any 
veteran is entitled to the presence of a service representative of 
equal rank who usually presents the family with a us flag she 
said 
beyond that policy is up to individual commanders and lawrence 
said there was no centralized information on how funerals are 
handled still she said she was not aware of problems nationally 
fort devens sends out funeral details for 20year retirees and 
former prisoners of war morris said in the begettas case a 
sergeant was sent to present the flag to the family 
previously the base had responded to most requests within 300 
miles with 15man details including pallbearers a bugle player 
and a rifle group in 1988 3345 soldiers were assigned to details 
at 229 funerals smaller groups using 768 soldiers were sent to 96 
funerals he said 
we were sending them all over the sixstate new england area 
lots of them it was a drain he said 
during the first six months of 1989 118 full details and 77 
smaller contingents went out after the policy change the number 
dwindled to only 26 full funerals and 18 smaller details 
how the base came to be in the position of sending out so many 
details is difficult to tell morris said 
i think it just kind of progressed and progressed and finally 
got to the point where we were just doing all those funerals he 
said 
bill smith director of public affairs for the washington dc 
headquarters of the vfw said the problem could be that the world 
war ii veterans are growing older with an average age of 67 
he said he understands that some families would prefer the 
attention of a military base 
we are a substitute he said 
morris said he does not know how much the base is saving through 
cutting the funeral details because it involves too many variables 
at one point fort devens was on a list of bases under 
consideration for closure but it has since acquired the 
information system command 
i think its pretty obvious that we were expending lots of 
troop labor to support veterans funerals all over new england 
morris said it was one of many things that weve cut back the 
times are getting leaner and we have to do more with less

south african television today 
kept up its extensive coverage of nelson mandelas release and also 
carried detailed reports on world reaction to the event 
early morning television on staterun south african broadcasting 
corp continued to broadcast footage of mandelas stroll to freedom 
on sunday along with clips of the black leaders speech in which 
he endorsed the armed struggle against the whiteminority 
government 
sabc also carried lengthy reports from washington london and 
other major capitals on how foreign governments were responding 
south african newspapers showered the release with massive 
coverage several in johannesburg and other cities put out special 
editions with headlines like mandela walks free 
the extensive coverage by state television of a man once 
regarded as an enemy by many white south africans would have been 
unthinkable a year or two ago mandelas release was given 
unprecedented coverage by local standards 
prior to feb 2 when president fw de klerk lifted a 30year 
ban on the african national congress the speech would have been 
illegal and the sabc could have been prosecuted for broadcasting it 
sabc usually only provides live coverage of news events that are 
announced well in advance and carefully planned such as a 
presidential speech the sabc scrapped much of its afternoon 
programming sunday to show mandelas walk to freedom even though 
the event occured 75 minutes behind schedule 
the long wait was clearly a challenge to sabc reporters not used 
to doing live coverage the commentator at one point extolled on 
the virtures of victor verster prison as being probably the worlds 
most beautiful jail 
sabc reporter clarence keyter became caught up in the excitement 
of the moment repeatedly telling viewers they were about to watch 
history in the making 
this is the moment the world has been waiting for keyter 
said the sun is shining on south africa 
the coverage stopped when mandelas motorcade pulled away from 
victor verster prison en route to cape town and there was no live 
coverage of later violence in the city or of mandelas speech at 
city hall 
but this mornings news show and the sunday night main news 
devoted almost all their coverage to the release showing footage 
of black youths looting shops and broadcasting portions of 
mandelas speech

bellevue hospital where he was unconscious and on a respirator a 
hospital official said

caused the bell jet ranger 206l to go down saturday 
the pilot believes he got caught by a gust from the tail 
tailwind ghiorsi said he said he believed the right skid 
caught the water he said he heard a bang but he doesnt know 
whether it was before or after the impact 
the helicopter had been pulled from the water and would be 
studied by investigators ghiorsi said 
we havent ruled out the possibility that there was some type 
of mechanical problem he said well look at the human factor

some organizers of the sixth international 
conference on aids said they werent surprised when president bush 
turned down an invitation to speak to the group 
bush who declined to address the june conference either live or 
on videotape was booed at the 1987 aids conference in washington 
dc when he was vicepresident 
the presidents decision marks the first time in three years 
that the leader of the meetings host nation has not addressed the 
assembly 
white house deputy press secretary alixe glen said bush has 
addressed the aids issue and the need for compassion many times 
were disappointed said dr john l ziegler conference 
cochairman and a professor of medicine at the university of 
california san francisco we felt this was a real opportunity 
for the government to make a strong statement 
but stephen morin a member of the conferences community task 
force and an aide to rep nancy pelosi dcalif wasnt surprised 
i think the president has good reason for not coming he 
said neither the people of san francisco nor the scientific 
community think much of his aids policies 
bush was discussing reagan administration plans for mandatory 
aids testing of immigrants and prison inmates when he was jeered in 
1987 
us policies restricting the freedom of foreigners infected 
with the aids virus to enter the country have been criticized 
although restrictions were eased last month anyone infected still 
has to reveal their condition when applying for a visa and request 
a waiver of rules barring them from the united states 
at least 16 groups including the international league of red 
cross and red crescent societies have said they will boycott the 
conference of 12000 scientists and policymakers unless the us 
entrance restrictions are ended 
other national leaders who have spoken to the international aids 
convention include canadian prime minister brian mulroney last 
year and swedens prime minister ingvar carlsson in 1988 
although bush declined to address the gathering glen said the 
president does plan to talk to the national business leadership 
conference on aids next month in arlington va

socialist candidate hideko ito in her 
bright red signature clothes cuts a bold streak across the vast 
snowfields of northern japan 
running for the powerful lower house of parliament ms ito is 
blazing a new political trail with a mixture of fresh ideas and 
traditional values hoping to attract votes away from the 
scandalwracked maledominated liberal democratic party which has 
governed japan for 34 years 
i want to change the many years of money politics created by 
liberal democratic control she declares from atop her campaign 
van they have not created a government that serves ordinary 
people like you and me 
hideko ito mother and lawyer shell do her best is the 
repetitive refrain blared from ms itos van as it barrels through 
the icy streets of sapporo a city of 16 million on hokkaido 
japans northernmost main island 
with the ruling party at a turning point damaged by almost two 
years of scandals and unpopular tax and farm policies voters have 
a difficult choice politics as usual or the uncertainty of a 
multiparty coalition led by the socialists the largest opposition 
group 
ousting the probusiness conservative liberal democrats could 
signal more difficult trade relations with the united states 
political uncertainty has already bred instability in stock and 
currency markets in japan and elsewhere in the world 
the socialist party seeking wider appeal watered down its 
longstanding opposition to the japanus security treaty under 
which us troops are based in japan but it is clear that a 
leftistled coalition government would mean a reordering of tokyos 
relations with washington 
about 90 million people are eligible to vote in sundays 
election 
most analysts predict the liberal democrats will retain a simple 
majority of 257 seats in the 512seat lower house but a big drop 
from their current 295 seats could create a significant realignment 
of power 
polls show many voters are undecided making the last week of 
campaigning even more crucial 
the nihon keizai shimbun the leading economic daily reported 
friday that a telephone poll of 10000 people showed 324 percent 
were undecided while 341 percent said they would vote for the 
liberal democrats 209 percent for the socialists and the 
remainder for other parties no margin of error was given 
now that the recruit co influencepeddling scandal and the sex 
scandal that helped drive two prime ministers from office last year 
are out of the spotlight public anger has subsided political 
analysts say but two liberal democrats who are on trial for 
bribery for their roles in the recruit affair are seeking 
reelection reviving memories of the scandal 
the liberal democrats are attempting to cleanse the stain of 
scandal with pledges of honest politics and to dilute the 
socialists popularity with declarations that a more leftist 
government would be bad for japan 
the socialists main theme is to abolish a 3 percent sales tax 
the liberal democrats rammed through parliament the liberal 
democrats also have been hurt by making trade concessions to the 
united states on agricultural imports the socialists promise a 
more protectionist farm trade policy 
one of ms itos liberal democratic opponents incumbent shizuo 
sato 48 is just as active as she is popping up at countless 
lunar new year festivities in sapporo and visiting the citys snow 
festival a weeklong show of ice sculptures that draws more than 1 
million visitors from throughout the world 
now is the time for honest and courageous politics satos 
campaign motto says 
many people are against the sales tax and many distrust my 
party the liberal democrat tells about 40 workers at a small 
construction company i understand their distrust but if the 
party loses its majority it will be a disaster 
sato appears to be in danger of losing his seat one of three 
held by the liberal democrats in the sapporo constituency despite 
a wellcultivated image as an internationalist his campaign 
brochures feature pictures of him with henry kissinger and 
president bush he is suffering from his partys image among the 
relatively progressive voters in japans fastestgrowing city 
ms ito is expected to be a top votegetter though she is a 
firsttime candidate with no experience in government 
she is riding a wave of blossoming support for female candidates 
dubbed madonnas because of the departure they represent from 
postwar politics an allmale enclave of porkbarreling and 
backroom deals 
in a profile of ms ito on national television the 46yearold 
lawyer was heralded for studying for law exams while nursing one of 
her three children she was dubbed the red madonna of the 
snowwhite cities of hokkaido 
i think women in politics is a good thing says keiko sato 
a woman working in a convenience store its important to have 
the views of women in politics 
the liberal democrats will suffer if that view is widespread 
since the conservative party has no women representatives in the 
lower house and is backing no female candidates the socialists 
led by takako doi the first female party head ever in japan are 
backing eight women 
nationwide only 66 of the 953 candidates are women 
last july women voters and candidates made a strong impact in 
the election for the lesspowerful upper house of parliament 
costing the liberal democrats their majority in that chamber

two coldblooded suspects in 
shootings that killed a man and three girls and wounded three other 
people during a bowling alley robbery have slipped past roadblocks 
police said 
saturdays killings along with an unrelated slaying the same 
day brought the number of homicide victims in this city of 55000 
people to six this year triple the number for all of last year 
its not the city it was when i used to roam the streets 
said police capt fred rubio 
police said sunday they have had to rely on rough sketches the 
survivors and tips from the public for leads into the bowling alley 
shootings 
police said two men walked into the las cruces bowl early 
saturday and herded seven people into an office in the front of the 
building forced them to lie on the floor and shot them in the back 
of their heads 
the men then set fire to the office in an effort to cover up the 
crime police said 
the shootings killed a 26yearold man his stepdaughter his 
daughter and another young girl three others were critically 
wounded 
teams of officers were checking out about 100 pieces of 
information telephoned to las cruces police from other law 
enforcement agencies and the public but no arrests had been made 
police said 
these people are just coldblooded people rubio said 
he said police planned to give authorities in mexico copies of 
composite drawings of the suspects las cruces is 45 miles from the 
border 
but police also are checking a report that the men are from the 
las cruces area rubio said 
killed were bowling alley employee steve teran 26 daughter 
valerie 2 stepdaughter paula holguin 6 and amy houser 13 
police withheld the names of the wounded but rubio said they 
were two adults and a 12yearold child two of the wounded were in 
serious condition and the third was in good condition a spokesman 
at memorial general hospital said 
theyve got to be maniacs to do this audrey teran said of 
the men who killed her husband and children what can a 
2yearold do what threat are they to them my little girls 
my babies this whole thing is senseless 
police lt jerry fariss said he had spoken with two of the 
surviving victims 
one of them was able to give a description that tends to match 
the one weve got fariss said 
the bowling alley which also has a restaurant and bar is in a 
mixed commercial and residential area 
rubio said there were two homicides in las cruces in all of 1989 
and six so far this year 
the fifth homicide of the year a stabbing occurred saturday 
afternoon police arrested james hayes lane 30 of abilene texas 
who had recently been paroled from the texas department of 
corrections after serving time for attempted murder and car theft

kavee minwong district chief of the thai town of sangkha just 
opposite the battle zone said burmese troops began their attack 
about midnight saturday and captured the base early the next day

neither was willing to reveal the extent of their losses he said 
about 4000 ethnic mon civilians fled into thailand to escape 
the fighting and marauding burmese troops kavee said about 200 
thai civilians were evacuated to safety he said 
the official said the mon refugees would be sent back across the 
border once the fighting died down 
the karen spokesman said the bomb blast at kaw moo ra occurred 
while guerrillas were carrying captured weapons and munitions back 
to the camp

fighting and he suspected the munitions had been boobytrapped by 
the government troops

have fought for decades against central control by rangoon

the kremlin says it is ready to negotiate the 
withdrawal of its troops from poland as part of an overall cutback 
in the east bloc and is ready to begin the reductions without 
waiting for a superpower treaty 
it is of importance not to miss the historic chance and to 
supplement political detente by a relaxing of tension in the 
military field in good time the government said in a statement 
carried sunday by the official tass news agency 
the statement declared the cold war over and said it was time to 
begin the gradual dismantling of the outdated model of the 
european balance of forces 
superpower talks on cutting conventional armies in europe have 
accelerated as communist regimes have collapsed in east bloc 
countries and the governments that replaced them demanded that the 
soviet troops go home 
soviet troops put down nationalist uprisings in hungary in 1956 
and czechoslovakia in 1968 
president mikhail s gorbachev and president bush have agreed in 
principle on major troops cuts in europe and the soviet union has 
been negotiating with czechoslovakia and hungary on the withdrawal 
of troops 
if the government of the republic of poland expresses an 
appropriate desire we could discuss with its representatives the 
question of soviet troops in that country the kremlin said 
of the 575000 soviet troops in eastern europe about 40000 are 
in poland 
gorbachev has agreed with bushs proposal to set a ceiling of 
225000 troops for each superpower in europe with 195000 of them 
allowed in central europe 
following the visit of secretary of state james a baker iii to 
moscow last week gorbachev suggested the limit of 195000 be 
extended to europe as a whole 
the kremlin statement sunday said the soviet union was prepared 
to begin cutting troop strengths in the east bloc without waiting 
for an official treaty to be signed at the vienna conference on 
conventional forces in europe 
there are misgivings that the results of the vienna talks may 
lag behind the pace of reforms in europe the statement said 
as a result the soviet union and other warsaw treaty member 
states without waiting for the conclusion of vienna accords are 
already taking steps toward unilateral cuts in their armed forces 
and making them structurally incapable of attack the kremlin 
said 
the statement said withdrawal of soviet troops in east germany 
host to about twothirds of the soviet soldiers in eastern europe 
was a separate issue 
the stay of foreign troops in both the gdr east germany and 
the federal republic of germany is a special issue connected with 
the four powers obligations arising from the outcome of world war 
ii and it may be tackled only with due regard to the security 
interests of all the states concerned the statement said 
the four powers are the wartime allies who defeated nazi 
germany the united states soviet union britain and france 
the troop issue was discussed saturday during a oneday visit by 
west german chancellor helmut kohl who enlisted the support of 
gorbachev for german unification

consult with my comrades 
today the majority of south africans black and white 
recognize that apartheid has no future it has to be ended by our 
own decisive mass action in order to build peace and security 
the mass campaigns of defiance and other actions of our 
organizations and people can only culminate in the establishment of 
democracy 
the apartheids destruction on our subcontinent is incalculable 
the fabric of family life of millions of my people has been 
shattered millions are homeless and unemployed our economy lies 
in ruins and our people are embroiled in political strife

our resort to the armed struggle in 1960 with the formation of 
the military wing of the anc umkhonto we sizwe was a purely 
defensive action against the violence of apartheid the factors 
which necessitated the armed struggle still exist today we have no 
option but to continue we express the hope that a climate 
conducive to a negotiated settlement would be created soon so that 
there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle 
i am a loyal and disciplined member of the african national 
congress i am therefore in full agreement with all of its 
objectives strategies and tactics 
the need to unite the people of our country is as important a 
task now as it always has been no individual leader is able to 
take all this enormous task on his own it is our task as leaders 
to place our views before our organization and to allow the 
democratic structures to decide on the way forward 
on the question of democratic practice i feel dutybound to 
make the point that a leader of the movement is a person who has 
been democratically elected at a national congress this is a 
principle which must be upheld without any exception 
today i wish to report to you that my talks with the government 
have been aimed at normalizing the political situation in the 
country we have not yet begun discussing the basic demands of the 
struggle i wish to stress that i myself have at no time entered 
negotiations about the future of our country except to insist on a 
meeting between the anc and the government 
mr de klerk has gone further than any other nationalist 
president in taking real steps to normalize the situation however 
there are further steps as outlined in the harare declaration that 
have to be met before negotiations on the basic demands of our 
people can begin 
i reiterate our call for interalia the immediate ending of the 
state of emergency and the freeing of all and not only some 
political prisoners 
only such a normalized situation which allows for free political 
activity can allow us to consult our people in order to obtain a 
mandate 
the people need to be consulted on who will negotiate and on the 
content of such negotiations 
negotiations cannot take place negotiations cannot take up 
their place above the heads or behind the backs of our people 
it is our belief that the future of our country can only be 
determined by a body which is democratically elected on a 
nonracial basis 
negotiations on the dismantling of apartheid will have to 
address the overwhelming demands of our people for a democratic 
nonracial and unitary south africa 
there must be an end to white monopoly on political power and a 
fundamental restructuring of our political and economic systems to 
ensure that the inequalities of apartheid are addressed andour 
society thoroughly democratized 
it must be addedthat mr de klerk himself is a man of integrity 
who is acutely aware of the dangers of a public figure not honoring 
his undertaking 
but as an organization we base our policy and our strategy on 
the harsh reality we are faced with and this reality is that we 
are still suffering under the policies of the nationalist 
government 
our struggle has reached a decisive moment we call on our 
people to seize this moment so that the process towards democracy 
is rapid and uninterrupted 
we have waited too long for our freedom we can no longer wait 
now is the time to intensify the struggle on all fronts to relax 
our efforts now would be a mistake which generations to come will 
not be able to forgive 
the sight of freedom looming on the horizon should encourage us 
to redouble our efforts it is only through disciplined mass action 
that our victory can be assured 
we call on our white compatriots to join us in the shaping of a 
new south africa the freedom movement is a political home for you 
too 
we call on the international community to continue the campaign 
to isolate the apartheid regime to lift sanctions now would run 
the risk of aborting the process towards the complete eradication 
of apartheid 
our march toward freedom is irreversible we must not allow fear 
to stand in our way 
universal suffrage on a common voters roll in a united 
democratic and nonracial south africa is the only way to peace 
and racial harmony 
in conclusion i wish to go to my own words during my trial in 
1964 they are as true today as they were then 
i have fought against white domination and i have fought 
against black domination i have cherished the ideal of a 
democratic and free society in which all persons live together in 
harmony and with equal opportunity it is an ideal which i hope to 
live for and to achieve but if need be it is an ideal for which 
i am prepared to die

defense secretary dick cheney is sidestepping a 
striking snub from president corazon aquino and moving ahead with 
plans to meet top philippine military officials on the future of 
us forces in the unsettled country 
cheney here on the opening leg of a twoweek tour of asian 
allied nations did not respond to mrs aquinos refusal to meet 
with him on his first visit to her country as defense secretary 
he doesnt take it personally were still going to the 
philippines and we expect productive meetings cheneys 
spokesman pete williams said sunday 
cheney scheduled a full day of sessions with us military 
chiefs from the army navy and air force as well as touring a 
guided missile cruiser and lunching with the troops 
while cheney declined to offer a personal reaction to the latest 
rough spot in usphilippines relations he did decide to slice a 
day off his scheduled feb 1820 stop in the philippines 
the defense secretary also is slated to visit south korea hong 
kong and japan over the next two weeks to assess the us military 
posture in the pacific in the wake of calls in congress for sharp 
defense budget cuts and demands that nations hosting us forces 
increase their contributions to the mutual defense 
there are some 190000 us military personnel in the regions 
cheney is to visit 
usphilippine talks on renewing the lease on the strategically 
placed american bases clark air base and subic naval base are 
expected to begin next month 
mrs aquino in a weekend speech said she would not meet cheney 
after expressing unhappiness over us payments for the bases and 
negative us media reports about her governments efficacy in 
light of a series of coup attempts 
even though a meeting with mrs aquino had not formally been 
placed on cheneys schedule she has routinely met with such 
highranking officials 
mrs aquino met sunday with representatives of the palestinian 
liberation organization to sign an agreement to exchange diplomatic 
missions soon abdul latif abu hajleh directorgeneral of the 
plos political department said early today 
her decision not to meet with cheney is noteworthy in light of 
president bushs decision to send us air force jets to her aid 
during the latest coup attempt dec 1 
williams said cheney now plans to spend only a day and a half in 
the philippines and will meet with his counterpart defense 
secretary fidel ramos 
williams said us officials dont see mrs aquinos 
announcement as a setback and noted that the defense secretary 
hadnt intended to negotiate about renewing the lease agreement on 
the us military bases 
cheney in comments to reporters warned that the united states 
will have no choice but to leave its huge philippines bases unless 
a new agreement is reached with terms we can accept 
im not here to negotiate on the bases obviously we are 
interested in renewing the base rights agreement cheney said 
its only going to happen if both parties can reach an acceptable 
understanding it has to be on the basis that the filipinos want us 
there and in accordance with terms that we can accept 
the situation in the philippines continues to be of concern 
the secretary added echoing expressions of concern by us 
officials about dangers of renewed coup attempts and continued 
corruption in mrs aquinos government 
bush ordered f4 phantom jets into the air over manila to pin 
down rebel units during the december coup a move that later gave 
rise to complaints from mrs aquinos critics that she was beholden 
to the us government 
ramos has been seen as a presidential contender in the countrys 
1992 elections but his decision to seek us assistance during the 
coup has reportedly diminished his popularity as well 
in 1988 thensecretary of state george shultz agreed to pay 
962 million for the use of clark subic and four smaller bases 
during the final two years of the 1947 agreement 
the bush administration asked congress to provide 200 million 
in military assistance and 160 million in economic support funds 
but congress cut the figure by 96 million and us officials in 
manila have said there is no chance the reductions will be restored

inventor george de mestral whose 
velcro fastener stuck so well with the public it replaced millions 
of buttons and zippers has died at his home his wife said today 
he was 82 
de mestrals wife helen said he died thursday from 
complications of bronchitis and other lung problems he had been 
sick for about three weeks she said by telephone from their home 
in this village near lake geneva 
a swiss mechanical engineer de mestral in 1941 conceived a 
fastener using two fabric strips one covered with tiny hooks the 
other with a fuzzy web the hooks could grab 
patented after 10 years of refinement velcro entered production 
in several countries in the mid1950s the fastener which can also 
be used to replace adhesive tape soon became a worldwide success 
it is especially known in the fashion industry but it also was 
used in the us spaceship that took astronauts to the moon in 1969 
despite its hightech look velcro was inspired by nature 
a passionate hunter de mestral came home once from a day in the 
fields and found burrs stuck to his pants the idea of velcro was 
born when he examined the burrs under a microscope and found their 
surface to consist of little hooks 
de mestrals widow said she had no estimate of how much his 
invention earned

tanks of a renegade christian general 
pounded rival forces around mountain resorts today in a possible 
prelude to an offensive in the nearly 2weekold battle police 
said 
in the rainsoaked streets of east beirut soldiers of gen 
michel aoun and the rival militia fighters clashed with automatic 
weapons and hand grenades police reported 
aoun has been struggling to deliver a knockout blow by seizing 
strongholds of the lebanese forces militia led by samir geagea 
they are battling for control of the countrys christian enclave 
there was no word on casualties in the latest clashes the 
fighting has killed at least 457 people and wounded 1701 since the 
fighting began jan 30 
it has been the worst bloodletting by rival christian forces in 
the nearly 15yearold civil war that usually pits christians 
against moslems neither side has made significant gains since 
aouns troops captured a major militia base in the coastal town of 
dbaye north of the capital nine days ago 
police said aouns army was concentrating on a new front in the 
mountain province of kesrouan 15 miles northeast of beirut 
his tanks pushed into a militiaheld triangle formed by the 
resort towns of daraya kleiat and ajaltoun below the ski slopes in 
the kesrouan mountains police reported 
a spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
regulations said the hitandrun attacks appeared to be aimed at 
softening up lebanese forces defenses before a largescale assault 
to encircle the main militia stronghold at jounieh a port 12 miles 
north of the capital 
relief groups and christian religious leaders issued fresh 
appeals for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow civil defense teams 
to recover at least two dozen decomposing bodies from the streets 
but there appeared to be no letup in the fighting or sniper fire 
civilians trapped in underground shelters for most of the past 
two weeks took advantage of occasional lulls to dash across 
beiruts green line into the moslem sector 
the snipers shot a woman running ahead of me therese yakoub 
said after she sprinted 500 yards across the green line 
poor thing she has five children and she was planning to buy 
bread and powdered milk for them ms yakoub said 
president elias hrawi appealed again to the superpowers france 
and the vatican to support possible intervention by his 
syrianbacked troops to halt the fighting 
hrawi aoun and geagea are all maronite catholics the sect that 
has dominated the government army and police since lebanons 
independence from france in 1943 
aoun refuses to recognize hrawis government and considers 
himself the sole legitimate authority in lebanon he was appointed 
head of an interim military cabinet in 1988 by outgoing president 
amin gemayel until a successor could be elected 
hrawi was elected by parliament in november with a mandate to 
carry out a peace plan brokered by the arab league it gives more 
power to the moslems 
aoun rejects the plan because it does not provide for a complete 
withdrawal by syrias 40000 troops who have been in lebanon since 
1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate those forces 
control most of the country 
geagea has taken no public stand on the latest peace accord but 
recognizes hrawi

ministry spokesman said in islamabad pakistans staterun tv said 
the indian guards killed as many as six 
the trouble started after indian border guards opened fire on 
hundreds of pakistanis who tried to cross a ceasefire line 
separating pakistancontrolled kashmir from the indianheld region

pakistans top diplomat in new delhi bashir babar was summoned 
to indias foreign ministry on sunday and today and apprised of

union with islamic pakistan but has in recent years demanded 
independence and the status of a neutral country 
about 64 percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people are 
moslems making it the only moslem majority state in predominantly 
hindu indias 25 states 
nationwide moslems make up 12 percent of indias 880 million

east germany today asked the bonn government 
for as much as 9 billion in financial aid in what it called a 
contribution of solidarity to help the staterun economy out of 
its growing crisis 
as pressure toward german reunification continued to grow a 
cabinet minister in east berlin accused west germany of waging a 
psychological campaign against the government 
negotiators representing the communists their coalition 
partners and prodemocracy forces met this morning for their 12th 
session in east berlin the national discussions were broadcast 
live on east german television 
they adopted a request to the west german government for a 
contribution of between 6 billion and 9 billion a sum they said 
west german chancellor helmut kohl promised at a december meeting 
in dresden with premier hans modrow 
the negotiators rejected a bonn proposal to join the two 
nations currencies as a way to prop up the east german mark the 
move bars modrow from dealing with the issue during his trip to 
bonn which begins tuesday 
east german cabinet minister wolfgang ullmann of the democracy 
now group bitterly criticized the bonn government at the start of 
todays session 
bonn is trying to discredit the government here at home and to 
put it under international pressure ullmann said 
citing an assertion from a highranking west german official 
that east germany was near bankruptcy and considering moving up the 
election date he said west germans were waging a psychological 
campaign against modrows government 
east germanys first free elections are scheduled for march 18 
a peaceful revolution last year swept the hardline communist 
leadership from power 
ullmann also said the communist premier has had to learn about 
west germanys positions regarding unification from reading the 
newspapers rather than from the usual diplomatic channels 
the pace toward unification quickened over the weekend after 
kohl brought back from moscow what he called a green light from 
the soviet leadership 
he said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had not attached 
any conditions to approving the historic step of unification 
on sunday west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
said he hoped a final unification plan could be worked out and 
presented to a full european summit in october or november and 
unification completed this year 
he emphasized that the world war ii allies france britain the 
united states and the soviet union also would be involved in 
drafting the plan with officials of the two german states

people and their governments rejoiced worldwide at 
the release of nelson mandela but britain stood alone today in 
urging an immediate easing of sanctions to reward south africas 
white rulers 
most others said south african president fw de klerk has a 
long way to go before apartheid is abolished 
people celebrated the news sunday night in the streets of 
toronto and london in amsterdam they draped buses and trams with 
the flags of his african national congress 
in the united states which imposes some of the harshest 
sanctions of any of south africas major trading partners 
president bush telephoned mandela sunday to congratulate him on his 
release but said afterward i am not prepared to express my view 
on sanctions at this time 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said today 
that together with all countries and peoples we hail the release 
of nelson mandela 
he said mandelas release was a step that should have been 
taken long ago and he expressed hope that an end would finally 
be put to the policy of apartheid 
british prime minister margaret thatcher who has often argued 
that strict sanctions hurt south african blacks stood alone in 
saying it is now time to use encouragement in south africa not 
sanctions 
on sunday as mandela walked free after 27 years in jail mrs 
thatcher wrote to fellow leaders of the 12nation european 
community urging a more positive approach 
when people are doing the right thing boldly and courageously 
as president de klerk is it seems quite absurd to still use sticks 
to beat them with however small those sticks may be she said 
but she abruptly canceled a news conference sunday night at her 
10 downing street residence after mandela told a vast crowd in cape 
town that his african national congress should continue the armed 
struggle and sanctions should remain in place 
britain intends to press the sanctions issue at a feb 20 
meeting of groups foreign ministers in dublin ireland the main 
sanctions are bans on imports of steel iron and krugerrand gold 
coins 
the nigerian government said mandelas release was positive 
proof that international sanctions are working 
in brussels european community leaders indicated today they 
feel it is still too early to lift the mild economic sanctions the 
community imposed on south africa in 1986 
ec development commissioner manuel marin believes there can be 
no question of a lifting of the sanctions now said a community 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
foreign minister joe clark of canada said his countrys 
sanctions will stay in force until apartheid laws of racial 
dicrimination are scrapped 
in toronto crowds danced and cheered at a street party sunday 
night to celebrate mandelas freedom 
in london thousands of wellwishers held a street party sunday 
outside the south african embassy where antiapartheid 
demonstrators had manned a roundtheclock vigil since april 1986 
to demand mandelas release 
in amsterdam buses and trams carried anc flags in the city 
center thousands of people marched sunday to the leidseplein 
renamed nelson mandela square for the day 
president kenneth kaunda of zambia called on the anc to suspend 
guerrilla actions in south africa but to maintain its military 
capability in case of violence by rightwing extremists 
the time for talking has come said kaunda whose country 
plays host to the ancs exile headquarters and guerrilla bases 
but the anc said in a statement released in harare that it was 
not prepared to open talks with the government of south africa 
until it lifts a state of emergency releases all political 
prisoners and repeals all apartheid laws of racial segregation 
in harare zimbabwe president robert mugabe today hailed 
mandelas release but urged britain and other western nations not 
to reduce pressures on the south africa to end apartheid mugabe 
criticized mrs thatcher for too hasty an embrace of political 
changes in south africa 
the organization of african unity based in addis ababa 
ethiopia hailed the freeing of mandela and other political leaders 
as a significant step toward the elimination of apartheid and the 
establishment of a nonracial and democratic society 
prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan said mandelas release was 
a clear turning point that would allow south africa to move 
toward democracy japan is among countries that have imposed 
sanctions against south africa 
polands solidarity leader lech walesa called mandela a man who 
devoted his life to realizing the ideal of equality 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said mandelas

experts in ethics are questioning a federal 
experiment that denies supplemental aid to some indigent people in 
texas and four other states to determine how well they can live 
without it 
extra medicaid and childcare benefits now go to about 8000 
people in texas to encourage them to keep new jobs while about 800 
people selected at random by birth date are excluded as a 
control or comparison group 
on april 1 those extra benefits will be available to more than 
50000 people statewide but not to the 800 unlucky texans who 
face two more years without the extra help the dallas morning news 
reported sunday 
the study aims to see how well the new expanded programs wean 
people off the welfare rolls 
similar experiments are being conducted in ohio washington 
state new york and wisconsin federal officials told the newspaper 
last week 
though federal officials say denying the additional benefits to 
small socalled control groups is vital to determine whether the 
new programs work critics disagree 
people ought not to be treated like things even if what you 
get is good information said philip broyle associate director 
for medical ethics of the hastings center a new york think tank 
concerned with the ethics of experiments on people 
broyle said the study violates the kinds of federal standards 
medical experiments must meet those standards include informed 
consent that anyone in an experiment must be aware of it and of 
all its consequences and they must have the option to refuse 
participation 
neither informed consent nor the right of refusal was offered to 
participants in the welfare study officials said 
the pilot program rewards welfare recipients who find jobs or 
job training traditionally such recipients have received four 
months of free medical care plus some child care after they leave 
the welfare rolls the experimental program extended the benefits 
to one year of medicaid coverage and subsidized child care to all 
but the 800 
the theory is that the extended benefits will encourage people 
to take and stay with entrylevel jobs that are unlikely to offer 
medical insurance or child care immediately and the tax money 
saved by getting those people off welfare will more than balance 
the cost of the new program 
state officials said last week that they would try to break 
their contract with the federal government and provide the benefits 
to the 800 
were planning to argue with them said claudia langguth 
deputy commissioner for the client selfsupport division of the 
texas department of human services 
in 1988 congress decreed that people receiving benefits from 
aid to families with dependent children and medicaid and who get a 
job or job training would be eligible for the extended benefits 
beginning april 1 1990 
texas officials decided they wanted to try offering the new 
benefits a year early on a small scale 
they got federal money for pilot programs in five urban areas 
but were required to exclude about 10 percent of those eligible 
the control or comparison group to see if they stay off welfare 
without the extra benefits 
federal officials say they were aware of the ethical question 
involved in the experiment 
that issue was recognized and considered in the review of the 
texas proposal said sidney trieger director of the federal 
division of health systems and special studies of the health care 
financing administration he is in charge of evaluating the 
experimental results 
it was worth proceeding he said

scientists who have spent the past 
decade assessing the impact of acid rain on the nation will share 
their results this week with their counterparts from around the 
globe 
the national acidic rain assessment program a consortium of 11 
federal agencies was established 10 years ago by congress and has 
spent 500 million investigating the problem 
it is holding a conference on hilton head island to review data 
from the studies 
one conclusion likely to provoke controversy at the conference 
is that acid rain generally isnt harming the nations forests 
said joseph barnard a us forest service researcher who headed 
the work of forest scientists the charlotte nc observer said 
in saturday editions 
the newspaper said it obtained a report expected to be presented 
at the conference intended to summarize various scientific studies 
of acid rain the report says that ozone does far more damage to 
trees than acid rain although acid rain may be harming red spruces 
in the appalachians northward to new england 
the world resources institute a washingtonbased environmental 
group disputes the findings saying evidence is unambiguous 
that acid rain and ozone both contribute to the deaths of trees in 
the south east and west 
according to the newspaper the report also says that a national 
survey found that only 4 percent of the nations lakes and 6 
percent of the streams were acidic 
researcher lawrence baker of the university of minnesota said 
that eventually the soils will be unable to neutralize any more 
acid the question is 10 50 100 years baker said theres 
quite a bit of debate on that 
acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
that mixes in the atmosphere and can be carried hundreds of miles 
before falling back to earth as rain snow fog and dust particles 
affecting aquatic life trees and humans 
much of the pollution comes from power plants which burn high 
sulphur coal although other industrial facilities also generate the 
pollutants 
about 1000 researchers have been at work during the past decade 
compiling 28 draft studies on the impact of acid rain 
the whole purpose is to give outsiders a chance to critique 
the reports its a chance to get them out into the broader 
scientific community said chuck herrick a spokesman for the 
agency who said the review is probably the most comprehensive ever 
compiled 
later information from the technical reports will be integrated 
into a final document the computer models will be used to map 
various emission control strategies 
herrick said we will be running 30 scenarios for the future 
the assumption then is the policy people will be looking at this 
and will be able to make their decisions 
the agency itself is not mandated to make policy decisions 
simply provide policymakers with the best data possible he added 
president bush unveiled his clean air bill last year a measure 
that would sharply reduce urban smog toxic chemical air pollution 
and acid rain by the end of the decade 
bush has called for a 10 million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide 
one of the main ingredients in acid rain by the turn of the 
century 
while the administration unveiled its legislation before the 
agency assessments were released i dont know that the 
conclusion is that the administration bill is wholly lacking in 
scientific basis herrick said 
our people were extensively contacted the argument could be 
made the bill does have a scientific basis he added 
he said 600 scientists from 35 nations are attending the 
conference which opened sunday and continues through friday

americans danced in the streets and in church aisles to 
celebrate nelson mandelas release from a south african prison but 
one of his daughters said much work remains before apartheid is 
abolished 
this is only the first step a little step and we should not 
forget this makaziwe mandelaamuah said sunday in amherst 
mass where she attends boston university 
the battle is not over its only starting at a renewed 
higher level activists at events around the country rejoiced 
that the 71yearold african national congress founder was released 
after 27 years in prison but many said us sanctions against 
south africa must continue until the nations whiteminority rulers 
grant nonwhites basic rights 
by freeing nelson mandela south africa has taken the first 
step toward freeing itself said rep william h gray iii dpa 
a powerful black congressman who wrote legislation imposing 
sanctions he urged keeping those sanctions in place 
its good news its welcome news gray said but the fact 
is south africa remains a state that is not free 
i think progress has to be quick and i think my father will 
play a very specific role in bringing about peace in south 
africa said another daughter boston university student zenani 
mandeladlanini he has to be there 
he will work together with the movement she said i am 
positive about that 
but she said she was worried about the psychological effect of 
his release after so long in prison and about his safety 
in atlanta coretta scott king widow of slain us civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr said she was overjoyed by the 
release of mandela who has shown us the tremendous power of 
unearned suffering for a just cause 
i sincerely hope that the government and the antiapartheid 
movement will continue to embrace the nonviolent spirit in their 
negotiations as they seek a multiracial democracy based on one 
person one vote mrs king said in a statement 
in texas a delegate to the african national congress compared 
mandelas release to another event thought unthinkable just months 
ago 
this is like the berlin wall rick marshallgreene of san 
antonio told a rally at an austin park attended by nearly 250 
people nelson mandela is that one brick the first brick that 
is coming out and that will help dismantle that wall of apartheid 
but mario marcel salas another anc delegate living in san 
antonio who like marshallgreene is barred from returning to his 
homeland said nelson mandela has been released but nelson 
mandela is not free because nelson mandela cannot vote in the 
country where he was born 
whites joined blacks at a service at the new hope baptist church 
in evansville ind 
it was a great celebration people danced in the aisles and 
we did our best to have a kindred spirit with the people of south 
africa the rev wr brown jr said 
church services also were held in san francisco and a musical 
celebration attracted 400 people to a park across the san francisco 
bay in oakland calif 
at rider college in lawrenceville nj army gen colin powell 
the first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
mandelas release was the beginning of the end of apartheid 
seattles first black mayor norm rice declared feb 11 nelson 
mandela day new yorks first black mayor david dinkins urged 
pretoria to fulfill other promises it made earlier this month to 
replace current massive repression in south africa with truly 
free political association 
hundreds of people danced and sang in the streets of new york 
citys harlem section in a spontaneous celebration while hundreds 
more crowded the house of the lord pentecostal church in brooklyn 
for an exuberant service 
they shouted and chanted as they watched mandela begin his first 
televised address and raised their arms in a salute as he did when 
he finished 
on the side of the churchs television a sticker saying free 
mandela had been cut and refigured to say mandela free 
in cambridge mass patrick lekota a former political prisoner 
who was jailed with mandela said he had mixed feelings watching 
the release 
in a way i was relieved his release will bring stability to 
the movement and strengthen it lekota said but as i watched 
him walk down the road surrounded by police i had a sudden fear 
that anything could happen 
ms mandeladlamini attended a church service sunday night in 
boston 
she did not speak but her husband thumbuzini dlamini told the 
congregation today is a very special day for us as members of 
the mandela family a victory has been won by our people

trade minister ariel sharon the chief 
opponent of prime minister yitzhak shamir in the rightwing likud 
bloc today offered his resignation from the cabinet to protest 
government policies he said endanger israel 
sharons surprise move came during a meeting at which he and 
other hardline members of the party were expected to challenge 
shamirs plan for elections in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
sharon said he feared compromises would be made to end the 
palestinian uprising that would jeopardize israels right to keep 
the occupied lands which the likud considers part of historic 
israel 
i know and am convinced that there are other ways to quell 
this terror he said we can make peace based on our historic 
right to the land of israel 
i decided to resign from the government to continue my 
struggle for reaching our national objectives which are now 
endangered as a result of the governments policy he said 
as sharon spoke the more than 2000 delegates to the likuds 
central committee meeting rose from their chairs and several 
hundred began chanting arik arik sharons nickname 
shamir who spoke after sharon received scattered boos as he 
began his speech by saying he would consider his offer to resign 
it was not clear what the immediate effect of sharons 
announcement would be 
akiva eldar a political commentator for the daily haaretz said 
on israel television that sharon may have made the move merely to 
strengthen his position with the central committee 
sharon who was defense minister during israels unpopular 1982 
invasion of lebanon said he would resign only from the cabinet 
not from his party post as head of the central committee 
before the meeting opinion surveys in israeli newspapers showed 
shamir was expected to easily overcome sharons challenge at the 
party meeting the prime minister said he wanted a clear decision 
from the partys nearly 3200 central committee members on his 
peace moves 
i dont see any reason for a compromise shamir said on 
israel radio 
shamir has threatened to resign unless he gets majority approval 
his opponents led by sharon want to vote on details of the 
election plan in order to block possible compromises urged by the 
united states as a way to start an israelipalestinian dialogue 
us secretary of state james a baker iii has been pushing 
since december for a palestinianisraeli dialogue to get the 
stalled peace process rolling again but his efforts have been 
blocked by the likuds squabbling over tactics 
shamirs plan approved by the cabinet last may amid 
international pressure on israel to quiet the uprising calls for 
electing palestinians to negotiate a temporary peace with israel 
later talks would decide the final status of the west bank and gaza 
in the occupied gaza strip meanwhile a general strike was 
declared in gaza city following the death of a 15yearold 
palestinian from wounds he suffered in a clash with israeli 
soldiers sunday night arab reporters said 
the army confirmed the death but said it was still investigating 
the death raised to 656 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians in the 26month uprising fortythree 
israelis have died and 181 palestinians who were killed by fellow 
arabs most on suspicion of collaborating with israeli authorities

drexel burnham lambert inc said today it is in 
preliminary talks to find a major investor or merger partner after 
falling on hard times because of its criminal troubles and the 
slumping junkbond market 
in a statement drexel said senior members of the firm had 
concluded it should seek outside assistance 
the unsettled markets particularly in the highyield area 
have adversely affected the liquidity of our parent corporation 
drexel burnham lambert group drexel said 
the closely held wall street firm said the parent company had a 
condolidated net worth of more than 800 million it said the 
securities business subsidiary drexel burnham lambert inc 
continues to have good liquidity and has satisfactory excess 
regulatory capital 
drexel said it is taking appropriate action to maximize 
liquidity but did not elaborate 
drexel reported a loss of about 40 million for last year in 
which it pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid 650 million to 
the federal government to settle wideranging securities fraud 
charges and avoid a trial 
the firm had been battered by the charges in the governments 
lengthy investigation of wall street securities fraud the probe 
now focuses on the former head of drexels highly productive 
highyield junk bond division michael milken who is under 
indictment 
back before drexels troubles mushroomed milken was reported to 
reported to have received 550 million in total compensation in one 
single year 1987 
drexel also was hard hit by the collapse of the nations 210 
billion junk bond market last fall following the collapse of a 
takeover deal for united airlines parent ual corp the market has 
yet to recover and drexel had to write down the value of its 
junkbond portfolio 
drexel which pioneered the use of the highyield lowgrade 
securities remains the leader of the junkbond market and as such 
has been hit harder than other wall street firms by the markets 
slump 
the firm has reduced its work force to about 5300 employees 
from a peak of 10700 it also sold its retail brokerage business 
last year 
the past year has been an extraordinarily difficult one for us 
and our employees drexel said in announcing the 1989 loss 
drexel had long been rumored on wall street to be in serious 
financial difficulty and seeking an outside investor or partner 
such a move would conclude one of the most dramatic turnarounds 
in wall street history drexel was the emblem of the highflying 
takeoverdriven 1980s and the firm made a profit of 5225 million 
on revenue of 53 billion in 1986 
the firm earned more than 400 million in 1987 and reported a 
loss of 1667 million in 1988 which include a charge to cover the 
650 million payment to the government

for five convicts including three murderers who apparently cut 
through two sets of bars and crossed a fence to escape from a 
maximumsecurity state prison 
a sixth escapee from the overcrowded joliet correctional center 
was recaptured in chicago late sunday about 12 hours after the 
break state prison spokesman nic howell said 
the inmates apparently cut through bars on their cells broke a 
window cut through bars outside the window and crossed a fence to 
get away all without being detected howell said 
were questioning inmates and security guards to find out if 
this was a planned thing he said obviously this was a 
serious breach of security it may be a while before all our 
questions are answered 
howell said tommy munoz of chicago was captured around 530 pm 
by prison authorities who had staked out a cousins house on the 
southwest side of the city some 60 miles east of the prison munoz 
was returned to the prison where he was serving a twoyear 
sentence for narcotics violations and intimidation howell said 
one down five to go howell said weve got a bunch of 
leads were checking out everything and anything that might be 
worth counting 
the five others were believed to have headed to the chicago area 
because they also have ties there howell said 
munoz provided few clues to the escape howell said in a 
telephone interview today weve questioned him thoroughly and he 
hasnt been very helpful at all the spokesman said 
state police local law enforcement agencies and 100 corrections 
officers specially trained to deal with escapes joined the search 
he said 
searches of the prison area with airplanes helicopters and dogs 
were called off late sunday afternoon after officials determined 
the escapees had split up state trooper thomas miller said 
howell said the men were last accounted for at 455 am sunday 
and an inmate count did not come up short until 7 am

doubled up two to a cell and the other two each had his own cell 
the prison houses 1300 inmates 500 more than it was built to 
hold

jury selection began today for the federal 
bank fraud trial of us rep harold ford one of tennessees most 
controversial and flamboyant politicians and three codefendants 
ford said he was optimistic when he arrived at the federal 
courthouse for the trial beginning almost three years after he was 
indicted on 19 counts of conspiracy bank and mail fraud 
i feel like the day looks outside its beautiful ford 
said refusing to comment further 
the congressman and his codefendants are charged with 
conspiring to funnel political payoffs to ford through bogus loans 
from lending institutions once run by former tennessee bankers jake 
and ch butcher jr both serving prison terms on other charges 
the government says ford drew more than 1 million in loans from 
butcher banks though the amount of money the congressman allegedly 
received is unclear since some loans outlined in the indictment 
apparently were used to pay off others 
ford a democrat and tennessees first and only black member of 
congress is credited with running a political machine that can 
deliver the black vote in memphis he is accused of selling that 
influence to the butchers for their political and business gain 
he has faced little or no opposition for his 9th congressional 
district seat since he was first elected to congress in 1974 
ford charged with conspiracy bank and mail fraud could be 
sent to prison for up to 95 years if convicted on all 19 counts 
against him 
the trial is expected to last as long as two months 
the butcher brothers once controlled a business empire that 
included some 40 banks and savings and loans but both are now 
serving 20year prison sentences for bank fraud 
ch butcher jr has pleaded guilty to two counts in the ford 
indictment 
jake butcher who ran unsuccessfully for governor of tennessee 
in 1974 and 1978 was listed as an unindicted coconspirator in the 
ford indictment 
ford has argued since his indictment that racism and politics 
are behind his legal troubles that he was indicted by a grand jury 
in knoxville rather than memphis because eastern tennessee is 
heavily republican and primarily white memphis fords hometown 
is 50 percent black 
ford failed to carry that argument in pretrial motions and the 
6th us circuit court of appeals in cincinnati refused to consider 
it before trial 
the trial was moved to memphis from knoxville at fords request 
fords codefendants are accountant david crabtree and lawyers 
douglas beaty and karl schledwitz they are all charged with bank 
fraud and mail fraud conspiracy in addition schledwitz and beaty 
face 15 counts of mail fraud and crabtree is charged in four mail 
fraud counts

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today that us differences with moscow on troops and aircraft 
still stand in the way of completing an arms limitation treaty this 
year 
baker opening an eastwest open skies conference said that 
after his talks last week with soviet leaders other key issues are 
closer to being resolved 
but he criticized president mikhail s gorbachev for rejecting a 
proposal by president bush that would give the united states an 
edge of 30000 troops over the red army in europe 
gorbachev has proposed equal limits of 225000 or 195000 
soldiers baker said that does not take into account the fact that 
the soviets could quickly expand their forces in a crisis while 
american troops would be an ocean away 
baker also criticized the soviets resistance to imposing 
ceilings on aircraft that moscow claims have a defense role 
this was hardly a step toward arms reduction baker said 
raising the prospect of an impasse baker said disagreements 
over aircraft limits must not prevent us from signing a cfe 
conventional forces in europe sgreement this year 
bakers appearance at the conference capped a week of 
highprofile and apparently successful european diplomacy he is 
here sounding out nato allies on how to shape an accord with moscow 
to withdraw a halfmillion us and soviet troops from the 
continent 
the united states and soviet union now stand on the brink of 
treaties to slash their chemical weapons and longrange nuclear 
missiles 
if the talks with allies and a session today with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze pan out the differences between 
bush and gorbachev on troop cuts can be worked out 
us officials said baker was neutral about gorbachevs 
approach which he lauded last week in moscow and the allies took 
no immediate stand 
other administration sources said the bush administration had 
not decided on a position among the state department pentagon and 
national security council 
an agreement on a troop ceiling would set the stage for a treaty 
later this year between the north atlantic treaty organization and 
warsaw pact alliances to remove about 400000 soviet and 100000 
american soldiers from europe 
bush proposed in his state of the union speech on jan 31 a 
ceiling of 225000 us and soviet soldiers each on foreign soil in 
europe with no more than 195000 in central europe 
gorbachev countered at a kremlin meeting with baker that the 
195000 ceiling should apply from the atlantic to the ural 
mountains inside the soviet union that would mean the 30000 
troops bush wants to keep in belgium britain greece italy the 
netherlands spain or turkey all nato allies would be 
withdrawn or us forces would be reduced in central europe to 
reach the lower figure 
otherwise gorbachev said he would accept the 225000 ceiling 
but without restrictions in central europe 
that could benefit the soviets since most of their troops 
about 385000 in east germany alone are in central europe the 
soviets would be able to keep 30000 more soldiers in the central 
region than the bush plan allows 
baker told gorbachev he could not give him an answer until he 
consulted with the 15 nato allies the twoday ottawa conference 
already was scheduled to consider unarmed aerial surveillance and 
other techniques for exchanging military data between nato and 
warsaw pact countries 
the us reply is unlikely to be announced before bakers 
departure for washington on tuesday night 
the talks in moscow paid off with an agreement that bush and 
gorbachev would sign in washington in june providing for the 
destruction of all their chemical weapons in 10 years if all 
other nations capable of making poison gas sign a treaty 
that represents a soviet concession bush wants the right to 
retain 2 percent of the us poison gas arsenal until all other 
producers approve the treaty 
also shevardnadze withdrew a demand to limit all foreign forces 
stationed in europe to 300000 or 350000 that means the us 
allies could keep their troops in other western countries even 
after the united states met a treaty ceiling 
on the strategic weapons front meanwhile bakers trip cleared 
up questions about exchanging data from missile tests and how to 
identify which warplanes are carrying airlaunched cruise missiles 
an unexpected breakthrough was reached on sealaunched cruise 
missiles 
the two sides agreed there is no reliable way to keep track of 
the weapon which can be carried on submarines and aboard warships 
therefore they decided to keep it out of the treaty and make 
separate statements about their arsenals 
this removed a major roadblock to completing the treaty to 
reduce longrange missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent in time for 
bush and gorbachev to sign at their summit in washington 
between his talks in moscow and the eastwest conference in 
ottawa baker detoured over the weekend to bulgaria and romania 
where he exhorted government leaders to hold free and fair 
elections

thousands of people remain in prison eight months 
after chinas army crushed the prodemocracy movement and 
authorities continue to carry out arrests torture and executions 
a un document alleged monday 
the allegations appear in reports included in the document given 
the human rights commission by un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar the commission is to consider human rights in china 
during its current sixweek session which began jan 29 
a letter from the chinese government that is part of the 29page 
document said authorities showed utmost tolerance and restraint 
in the face of illegal demonstrations and described chinas 
actions as justified and legitimate 
ambassador li luye who signed the letter said nearly 300 
people were killed in the attack june 34 on tiananmen square 
including members of the armed forces and besides ruffians a 
small number of onlookers were shot accidentally which is 
regrettable 
some unofficial estimates put the number of unarmed civilians 
killed by soldiers in the thousands 
in august a un panel of experts instructed perez de cuellar 
to transmit information provided by the government of china 
and by other reliable sources to the human rights commission 
one reports in the document is from amnesty international the 
human rights group based in london despite the lifting of martial 
law jan 10 it said china has not announced pardons for thousands 
of people imprisoned for taking part in prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
there have been further arbitrary arrests and prisoners 
continue to be detained incommunicado without charge or trial 
imprisoned or executed after unfair trials amnesty said 
tens of thousands of people have been arrested since june up to 
10000 of them in beijing alone the organization declared 
official reports put the number of detainees throughout china at 
about 10000 
amnesty estimated at least 1000 people were killed and 
thousands injured when soldiers moved into tiananmen square 
another report from the international commission of health 
professionals for health and human rights gave graphic details of 
descriptions by witnesses of protestors being crushed by tanks 
into paste during the june 4 massacre 
a third private group the international league for human 
rights accused china of the systematic terrorizing of much of 
beijings population and purging of those considered 
sympathetic to the prodemocracy movement 
chinese justifications of its actions are invalid the 
league said it argued that the suppression flouted international 
law and thus was not the internal matter beijing claimed 
luye chinas permanent representative to the united nations 
accused a small number of western countries of violating the 
un charter by interfering in domestic affairs 
the socalled tiananmen bloodbath is sheer fabrication his 
letter said the chinese governments actions to put an end to 
the turmoil and quell the rebellion were justified and legitimate 
china is the first permanent member of the security council 
referred to the human rights commission for alleged abuses 
fortythree delegates from governments serve on the commission 
its annual sessions are attended representatives of most other un 
member states and nearly 150 private human rights groups

if the roaring crowds and the 
journalists go away nelson mandela finally may have some time with 
the wife and children who sustained him through 27 years in prison 
mandela freed sunday appears to enjoy the spotlight and 
remains devoted to the african national congress and its battle 
against white supremacy he would rather talk about politics than 
his feelings but said his family was his source of strength during 
the long and lonely years 
i have lost a great deal over these 27 years he told 
reporters monday it is not a nice feeling for a man to see his 
family struggling without security without the dignity of the head 
of the family around 
in a speech sunday night mandela said of his family i am 
convinced that your pain and suffering was far greater than my 
own 
the black nationalist leader went to prison in 1962 four years 
after marrying winnie his second wife 
they have two grown daughters zenani who studies at boston 
university with her husband prince thumbumuzi dlamini of 
swaziland and zindzi 29 an unmarried mother of three who lives 
with mrs mandela in soweto the huge black township outside 
johannesburg 
mandela also has a son makgatho and a daughter makaziwe 
mandelaamuah by his 13year first marriage which ended in 
divorce in 1957 
makgatho is a businessman in the transkei tribal homeland in the 
southeast where his mother evelyn lives in retirement from a 
nursing career mrs mandelaamuah lives with her husband and 
children in the united states where she studies at amherst college 
in massachussetts 
his wife and other relatives were with mandela at his first news 
conference conducted on the lawn of anglican archbishop desmond 
tutus home while some of the 12 mandela grandchildren splashed in 
the swimming pool 
the mandelas stayed with tutu on sunday night and after the 
news conference flew to johannesburg where they hope to live in 
the small house in soweto they had shared for a few years 
during the meeting with reporters mandela said he is not bitter 
about his imprisonment he even had kind words for his jailers one 
of whom was specifically assigned to look after him 
they understand our point of view and tried to do everything 
to make you as happy as possible mandela said that has wiped 
out any bitterness a man could have 
when things are quieter mandela said he wants to visit qunu 
the transkei village where he was raised 
i long to see the little stones on which i played as a child 
the rivers where i swam said mandela whose father was a member 
of the tembu royal clan of the xhosa tribe 
he was unfazed by finding more than 100 journalists in tutus 
gardens or by their dozens of questions which he handled with 
composure as mrs mandela sat silently beside him wearing a print 
turban and white floorlength dress 
mandela expressed humility about the huge outpouring of support 
when he was freed i am completely overwhelmed by the 
enthusiasm he said i am unable to describe my emotions he 
said 
asked whether he had persuaded the government to make recent 
concessions to blacks mandela declared it would be most 
presumptuous of me to think that ive had any influence on 
government policy

until three years ago a state legislator 
from the appalachian hills of eastern kentucky says he never gave 
much thought to aids assuming his family and friends were immune 
from a disease that he considered a bigcity problem 
state rep paul masons sense of security ended abruptly when 
his daughter belinda mason contracted the aids virus through a 
blood transfusion in 1987 
his daughters plight spurred the used car salesman from 
whitesburg to action putting him on the front lines of a fight to 
promote aids education prevent discrimination and curb the spread 
of the disease 
it really wasnt a part of my world mason said youre 
sitting in middle class america and aids is just not a part of your 
world now its something i live with every waking moment 
after learning of his daughters affliction mason said his 
apathy turned to anger he was bitter at the blood donor and health 
care officials 
you want to go after somebody with your bare hands mason 
said im not sure ill ever be able to look at my daughter 
and forgive him blood donor nobody has a right to steal part of 
me 
but mason has learned to channel his emotions in another 
direction the 1988 general assembly enacted his bill to make it 
illegal to use blood for transfusions before the blood is tested 
for aids contamination 
this year mason introduced sweeping aids legislation to foster 
a greater understanding of aids and to wipe out discrimination 
when she contracted it there was a world of discrimination out 
there and a lot in the health care field because everyone was 
scared he said in the health care field i have seen a world 
of change in attitude 
mason removed the proposals two most controversial sections 
one would have allowed a murder charge to be brought against a 
person who knowingly gives an uninformed sexual partner aids 
resulting in the partners death the second would have allowed the 
state cabinet for human resources to obtain court orders to detain 
people infected with sexually transmitted diseases in hospitals 
the bill still would require extensive education programs for 
state and local agencies and mandatory aids training for health 
professionals it also would give aids patients the same legal 
protections as handicapped people 
ms mason 31 who was appointed by president bush last year to 
the national commission on aids said her fathers bill symbolizes 
the type of government action needed to assist aids patients 
we have to stop relying on peoples good manners and have some 
solid legal guidelines on how to treat people infected with the 
aids virus she said 
mason said his bill stems from watching his daughter who lives 
in hartford ky fight discrimination 
ms mason said much of her fathers bill came two years too 
late for me but is intended to protect other aids patients from 
encountering the same hostility and hardships 
what my dad has attempted to do is to make the road for people 
who come after me easier said ms mason who found out in 
october that her infection has developed into aids 
he wasnt doing it just for his child but for the countless 
others who have contracted the disease she said 
ms mason said people suffering from the disease are engaged in 
the same fight as blacks women and other minority groups in 
seeking to end discrimination 
she is treated well when she visits home in letcher county in 
the heart of appalachia her father said but other aids victims 
have encountered discrimination there he said 
one letcher county man who is fighting aids has concealed his 
ailment from friends and neighbors telling them hes suffering 
from another disease because he fears being ostracized mason said 
that kind of points up the need for education and 
dissemination of information he said

one of poindexters lawyers richard beckler had urged greene 
to put off taking reagans testimony until the middle of the trial 
after irancontra prosecutors have presented their case 
i am not going to buy that we are going to proceed said 
greene 
seven news organizations applied to the court for permission to 
attend the videotaped deposition they are cable news network 
capital citiesabc inc cbs inc national broadcasting co the 
new york times co times mirror co of los angeles and the 
washington post 
the judge said he will rule before friday on their request but 
he said he was doubtful that the press could be there in view 
of concerns over the possibility of disclosing classified 
information during the deposition such material would be edited 
out of the videotape before it is shown in court at poindexters 
trial 
greene said he is delaying the start of the trial until march 5 
to resolve a number of issues including disagreement concerning 
some 150 classified documents that poindexter a former national 
security adviser to reagan wants to use at his trial 
regarding the disputes over classified material the judge will 
have to rule on whether the documents are necessary for the former 
national security adviser to get a fair trial if greene rules that 
they are necessary and if us intelligence agencies refuse to 
allow their declassification the poindexter trial could be placed 
in jeopardy 
as past irancontra cases have shown it is not unusual to have 
unresolved lastminute disputes over the use of classified 
material there were repeated disputes over the use of such 
material before and during the trial of former national security 
council staffer oliver north

its not a magic elixir that 
builds strong souls and guarantees immunity from sin but the milk 
produced by the popes dairy herd must certainly taste like heaven 
each morning a truck with vatican license plates delivers 120 
cartons of the milk to three local coffee bars 
within hours theyre sold out 
we dont have enough to meet the demand said the waitress 
at mirkos bar on via garibaldi who gives here name only as 
manuela it sells like hot cakes 
milk from holy cows 
actually it comes from 30 blackandwhite holsteins on a small 
farm inside the walled compound of the 17th century papal palace 
until recently this thriving dairy operation was the 
leastknown of the public services offered by the vatican which 
also runs a postal service and pharmacy in vatican city in the 
heart of rome 
the farm at castel gandolfo the popes hilltown holiday 
residence covers about 60 acres on the palace grounds and is 
surrounded by pine cypress and olive trees in addition to milk 
the farm produces eggs olive oil and other products for 
distribution at the vatican market open only to vatican employees 
and their families 
the farm has been operating since 1933 but the sale of milk to 
the public began only six years ago 
the cows produce 130 gallons of milk a day most of which is 
transported to the vatican market and the remaining 31 gallons to 
the three cafes 
few people outside of castel gandolfo knew about the milk 
operation until the rome newspaper il messaggero recently published 
an article entitled the popes milk how tasty 
since then people have been traveling 15 miles from rome to 
sample the product at the two bars in castel gandolfo and one in 
nearby albano the milk comes in distinctive yellow and white 
cartons with the label fattoria ville pontificie meaning the 
pontifical villa farm 
our regular customers are getting upset because theres not 
enough left for them any more said manuela as she served up a 
capuccino with steamed vatican milk theyre asking us to put 
aside cartons for them 
one client rita grecco said she is taking no chances 
i buy two or three liters every day she said i used to 
come in the afternoons but now i have to come early every 
morning 
the bar also receives 30 cartons of milk a day from another 
supplier but usually manages to sell only five of them manuela 
said price is not a factor both brands cost the same about 110 
dollars a liter 
even before its popularity reached outside the area the locals 
put their faith in the vatican milk when they were looking for 
products free of contamination following the 1986 chernobyl nuclear 
disaster 
the milk was considered safe because the cows were kept inside 
their barns and fed hay and fodder that had been stored in 
protective silos said saviero petrillo director of the papal 
village 
there was a much greater demand especially from mothers with 
young children he said today in an era when theres a lot of 
emphasis on ecology and the environment people are more conscious 
of products that are healthy and genuine 
vatican services seem to have a special allure for italians and 
foreigners who view the tiny citystate as a rock of efficiency in 
a land often associated with confusion and chaos 
many post their mail at the vatican knowing they can cut days 
even weeks off the delivery time of a letter abroad in 1988 the 
vatican post office helped give the citystate a 13 million 
surplus 
but does the vaticans milk taste better than others some 
customers swear it does 
its creamier said mrs grecco 
vatican officials avoid comparisons although they stress the 
cleanliness of the plant and the fact that the milk comes from a 
single herd 
we have no secret formula said giuseppe bellapadrona who 
runs the farm we just put the emphasis on quality

us sanctions against south africa were 
imposed in 1986 when congress enacted them along with specific 
criteria for ending them over thenpresident reagans veto 
the sanctions would be lifted automatically if president bush 
reported to congress that the south african government had 
freed african national congress chief nelson mandela and all 
other political prisoners 
repealed its declared state of emergency and freed all those 
detained under it 
legalized democratic political parties and political activity 
for all 
repealed the group areas act and the population registration 
act which restrict where nonwhites can live and work 
agreed to enter into goodfaith negotiations with 
representative black leaders without preconditions 
in addition the president was empowered to suspend or modify 
any of the sanctions 30 days after reporting to congress that 
mandela and other prisoners had been freed that three of the other 
four conditions had been met and that the government had made 
substantial progress toward dismantling apartheid and setting 
up a nonracial democracy 
if congress disagreed with the presidents certification it 
could head off any change in the sanctions by passing a joint 
resolution which would then be subject to a presidential veto and 
override fight if both sides chose a confrontation over the issue 
the law set immediate goals of encouraging south africa to lift 
its declared state of emergency free political prisoners permit 
free political activity and establish a timetable for ending 
apartheid 
it also called for establishment of democratic rule in the long 
term but did not lay out criteria for judging how that goal was 
being met 
among specific sanctions imposed were 
a ban on the importation from south africa of agricultural 
products textiles uranium and uranium ore iron steel and coal 
prohibition of south african airlines from operating in the 
united states and barring of any us airliner from taking off and 
landing in south africa

a massive 2inchthick blanket 
of crude oil spilled by the tanker american trader moved ashore 
today invading a 2mile stretch of beach near an environmentally 
sensitive wildlife refuge 
a 200member cleanup crew was dispatched to the fouled beach 
before dawn in an effort to mop up the black goo in what 
authorities called the most serious beach pollution since the 
400000gallon spill last wednesday 
we got hit with more oil overnight than we have in this whole 
process we got the biggest hit at bolsa chica state beach said 
tony kozlowski spokesman for the cleanup coordinators british 
petroleum which chartered the tanker 
the wildlife refuge a wetlands area used by thousands of 
migratory birds and by fish lies behind the state beach there are 
not many migrating birds there this time of year but officials 
fear an invasion of oily water could foul the area for months 
in addition to the 30footwide 2inchthick slick on bolsa 
chica the coast guard said smaller ribbons of oil 4feetwide were 
reported near the huntington beach pier 
cleanup activities at bolsa chica were suspended briefly when 
workers began complaining of headaches and nausea from the oily 
fumes the workers were back on the beach by dawn 
meanwhile there was still no decision on when the 811foot 
american trader would be moved from its offshore mooring two miles 
offshore to long beach harbor for cargo unloading and repairs 
scuba divers applied temporary patches to two holes in the 
punctured hull sunday and authorities said the vessel passed 
watertight integrity tests said coast guard petty officer 3rd 
class kristine johnson 
however the vessel cannot be moved until it passes inspection 
for cleanliness and other pollution standards she said she 
estimated that the vessel could be moved no earlier than tuesday 
but other officials said an attempt to dock it could be made later 
today 
plans called for moving the vessel into an arco dock to deliver 
the remainder of the cargo and to make permanent repairs coast 
guard capt jim card said sunday 
cleanup crews reported that the oil slick that coated 14 miles 
of shore with gooey muck was shrinking onethird of the alaskan 
crude still menaced the coast staining sand as far north as long 
beach 
before todays oily onslaught coast guard chief warrant officer 
rick meidt described the cleanup as impressive but cautioned 
its too soon to declare a victory theres 131000 gallons of 
oil in the water 
the american traders fouled no 1 tank was to be cleaned before 
the coast guard gave clearance for the ship to dock for cargo 
delivery and permanent repairs 
the tanks must be clean you dont want it to be like a snail 
leaving a trail of oil said coast guard petty officer 2nd class 
dennis hall 
on sunday morning divers temporarily repaired the hull of the 
tanker using prefabricated steel plywood and waterresistant foam 
kozlowski said 
the oil leaked from the vessel wednesday after it apparently 
punctured itself twice on its own anchor while mooring in shallow 
water at an offshore oil pipeline 
the accident remained under investigation the coast guard said 
drug and alcohol tests on the ships officers including capt 
robert laware were negative 
national oceanographic and atmospheric administration data 
showed 23 percent of the spilled crude had been skimmed or picked 
up at sea as an oilwater mixture while 43 percent had evaporated 
or naturally dissipated 
the unrecovered 34 percent had spread out on the water as a thin 
sheen and was nearly impossible to retrieve meidt said 
weve reached the point where skimming is of limited value 
meidt said though skimming will continue for several more days in 
areas where the slick appears most concentrated 
on the beaches 415 cleanup workers were assembled by british 
petroleum kozlowski couldnt say how long theyd be there 
the state department of fish and game reported 48 birds have 
been killed british petroleum officials put the number at 44 and 
said 126 birds were under care after cleaning 
two dead oilsoaked seals and one sea lion also were recovered 
but it wasnt known if their deaths were linked to the oil spill 
fish and game officials said 
calm seas and light breezes continue to help the cleanup effort 
weve been blessed with good weather in this whole process 
but rain or high wind or choppy water could cause problems 
kozlowski said weve had 3foot ribbons of oil on some beaches 
a huge wind could bring a considerable amount on shore

about 150 black students ended a fiveday 
sitin today at selma high school today then briefly joined a 
demonstration at city hall all part of a racial protest that shut 
down all schools in this landmark city of the civil rights movement 
the protesters paraded about a mile carrying a banner that said 
keep the dream alive to the city hall where they packed the 
corridors a few adults took part along with the students 
before their arrival all city hall offices were open with only 
a handful of protesters in sight when the students jammed inside 
however all offices closed except for mayor joe smithermans he 
remained with several police guarding his door 
by noon all but about 25 adult and student protesters were gone 
from city hall and offices reopened 
smitherman the same man who was mayor during the historic 1965 
selmatomontgomery civil rights march met for less than an hour 
with six student leaders and two attorneys state sen hank sanders 
and yusef salaam both of selma the meeting ended without any sign 
of progress 
hes not satisfied us there was doubletalking going on 
said one of the students malika sanders a daughter of the state 
senator 
the 150 sitin protesters had left the high school after meeting 
with sanders a protest leader and school superintendent norward 
roussell the students chanted do the right thing as they 
marched 
the departure of the protesters from the high school came as 
city leaders awaited a federal judges decision today on whether to 
order an end to the protests 
smitherman had asked us district judge charles butler of 
mobile for a court order and city attorney henry pitts had said he 
expected the request to be granted the request was filed before 
the school building was vacated 
miss sanders said the protests would continue if we can sit 
in at selma high school five days we can sit here just as long 
she said upon arriving at city hall 
she and another black student at selma high school latima 
salaam said they ended the school sitin not because of the threat 
of a federal court order but because they feared roussell would be 
fired immediately 
hes our leader he felt it was in our best interest to leave 
plus the school board would fire him if we didnt leave said 
ms salaam 
the turmoil began when six white members of the city school 
board voted feb 2 to dismiss roussell the citys first black 
superintendent the vote sparked protests leading to the closing of 
two schools tuesday and all 11 of selmas public schools wednesday 
roussell was reinstated after initial protests but students and 
other protesters want the school board to extend his contract 
which expires june 30 
ms salaam said roussell assured them that they would not be 
expelled for their occupation of the high school but he did not 
rule out lesser disciplinary action she also said he agreed to 
meet two student demands to allow them to wear african medallions 
to class and to offer afroamerican history classes 
roussell said no decision had been made on whether schools will 
reopen tuesday 
black protesters most of them students took over the schools 
cafeteria wednesday as rising racial tensions forced the closing of 
all 11 public schools in selmas 6000student 70 percent black 
system 
smitherman said the only alternative to the court order was 
turning the schools over to state control until the dispute can be 
resolved 
both black and white students are suffering at this point 
he said they are trying to force us to make mass arrests 
protest leaders at a sunday night meeting warned of possible 
economic boycotts and instructed the students holding the sitin 
at the high school not to resist if police attempted to remove them 
by force 
sanders told the crowd of 400 people gathered at the mostly 
black first baptist church that boycotts of businesses were a 
possible response to a court order 
i heard a rumor that once an injunction was issued there was 
going to be an economic boycott that was going to shut selma 
down said sanders who declined to elaborate following the 
meeting 
roussell told the crowd that he had refused a second time to 
sign an affidavit that was to be used to obtain the injunction 
roussell said he could be fired again for refusing to sign but 
im not going to leave 
on saturday protest leaders and the rev joseph lowery 
president of the southern christian leadership conference met with 
smitherman and us justice department representatives

she could do for her 12yearold english setter 
theyre good she said i eat them too 
as in the united states japanese celebrate valentines day by 
giving sweets to a loved one tokyu is hoping to expand the concept 
a bit to include animals

this is the first year we have gone all out said tokyu pet shop 
clerk yoshiko kashiwazaki pointing to a large table covered with 
heartshaped gift sets wrapped in redandyellow ribbons 
a poster showed two furry creatures cuddled up over the slogan

a coast guard monitor on duty the night 
of the exxon valdez disaster testified today he could not have 
ordered the ship to change course even if he had seen it was headed 
for a rocky reef 
gordon taylor said it would have taken the authority of a higher 
coast guard officer to order joseph hazelwood to make a course 
change 
however taylor said the matter never became an issue because 
the exxon valdez vanished from his radar screen shortly before the 
accident 
taylor said he struggled to adjust the radar but could not bring 
the ship back into his viewing range 
so when you left it was off the screen and you didnt see it 
anymore asked hazelwood attorney dick madson 
thats correct said taylor who went off duty at 1145 pm 
on march 23 
he said he notified the monitor who took over for him that the 
vessel was outbound but had disappeared from the radar 
madson has maintained that taylor and bruce blandford the 
monitor who replaced taylor at the coast guards vessel traffic 
system on the night of the exxon valdez disaster were not watching 
the radar screen 
madson says if they had alerted hazelwood that his ship was 
moving perilously close to jagged bligh reef the accident never 
would have happened 
scoring a key legal point madson won permission to raise the 
coast guard responsiblity issue after superior court judge karl 
johnstone initially vetoed the tactic johnstone reversed himself 
after considering case law on the issue 
but the lawyer was barred from exploring another matter 
whether taylor and blandford were using drugs or alcohol on march 
24 when the accident happened blood and urine tests administered 
between 15 hours and three days after the grounding showed that 
blandford had a bloodalcohol level more than twice the legal limit 
for driving and taylor showed a small quantity of marijuana in his 
system 
johnstone called the marijuana issue a red herring but said 
he would reconsider admitting the alcohol test if madson can show 
its relevance blandfords alcohol reading of 203 was recorded 15 
hours after the exxon valdez went aground in scenic prince william 
sound 
hazelwood 43 of huntington ny is being tried on a felony 
charge of seconddegree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges 
of reckless endangerment negligent discharge of oil and operating 
a vessel while intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on 
all counts is seven years three months in prison and 61000 in 
fines 
prosecution witnesses have said hazelwood spent much of the day 
before the accident drinking vodka at a bar in the port town of 
valdez but his shipmates said hazelwood didnt appear drunk and 
appeared in command of his ship 
the 987foot tanker which ripped open on the rocky reef 
spilled nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude oil killing 
thousands of birds and other wildlife and blackening hundreds of 
miles of rocky coast exxon says the cleanup has cost 2 billion so 
far

issues ranging from rudder control designs to 
the effects of airline mergers on safety are expected to come up in 
a hearing opening tuesday into last falls crash in new york of 
usair flight 5050 
national transportation safety board chairman james l kolstad 
who will conduct the fourday hearing in new york said 
crewmembers airline officials federal aviation administration 
experts and representatives of the boeing co are expected to 
testify 
two people were killed and 61 others were saved in a massive 
rescue operation after the boeing 737 airliner skidded off the end 
of a laguardia airport runway and into the east river breaking 
into pieces in an aborted takeoff 
the crash has raised several safety issues and drawn attention 
to more than a dozen reports of problems with rudder controls on 
boeing 737s 
kolstad said in a recent interview that the engineering and 
mechancial design of the rudder trim on boeing 737s will be among 
issues taken up at the hearing investigators found that flight 
5050s rudder was improperly trimmed to full left although cockpit 
recorders indicated pilots had properly checked the rudders 
position for takeoff 
pilot michael martin reported the plane was drifting to the left 
before he aborted the takeoff which was being handled by copilot 
constantine kleissas 
the plane was scheduled to fly to charlotte nc 
we feel the rudder trim system is what actually precipitated 
the usair accident air line pilots association representative 
tom kraemer said monday the pilots union and other interested 
groups will participate in the hearing 
other matters to be explored during the hearing include cockpit 
crew training and crew coordination by usair its flight operations 
and the recent merger of usair with piedmont and its impact on 
flight operations kolstad said 
the planes copilot came to usair in the merger kleissas was 
controlling takeoff of a 737 for the first time since training for 
the airliner 
the safety board chairman said the hearing also will cover faa 
surveillance of usair operations and runway design including 
whether it is advisable to install arresting gear at the ends of 
runways along with ramps for crash and fire rescue equipment 
finally the hearing will cover faa drug and alcohol rules he 
said the faa suspended the flying certificates of the planes 
pilot and copilot two days after the crash citing their failure 
to appear immediately for drug and alcohol tests after the crash 
drug tests taken 44 hours after the crash showed no trace of 
illegal substances in either man 
the safety board examines all aviation crashes determines their 
probable cause and makes recommendations to airlines 
manufacturers congress and the faa for improving safety the board 
has no regulatory power

tadzhikistan erupted in rioting today with mobs angry over rumors 
that armenian refugees were getting preferential treatment 
official sources said there were deaths and dozens of injuries 
reported 
the government imposed a state of emergency and a 10 pm to 6

armored vehicles were brought into the city center which was 
calm late today said musafar madzhidov correspondent for official 
radio and tv in dushanbe he said an unknown number of people had 
been killed and more than 70 injured 
rioting erupted after two rallies in a 24hour period over 
rumors that armenian refugees from bloody ethnic strife in the 
caucasus region were being given preference for new housing 
madzhidov said in a telephone interview 
members of the crowd shouted down with the armenians he 
said 
armenians a predominantly christian people have been involved 
for the past two years in a bloody dispute with predominantly 
moslem azerbaijanis over control of the nagornokarabakh region of 
azerbaijan 
more than 200 people have been killed in armenian and azerbaijan 
since jan 13 and president mikhail s gorbachev was forced to 
send thousands of soldiers into the southern region to impose 
control 
but until today there had been no reports that the trouble had 
spread to the predominantly moslem republics of soviet central asia 
like tadzhikistan 
the tadzhikistan communist party leader kakhar makhkamov 
appeared before a crowd that gathered sunday outside party 
headquarters in dushanbe and asked for 24 hours to investigate the 
rumors madzhidov said 
another crowd gathered today but ignored his report that all 
but one armenian refugee already had left dushanbe he said 
they pelted the party headquarters with stones breaking all the 
windows and then went on a rampage through shops located nearby 
he said 
police fired in the air to disperse the crowd but the rioting 
continued until armored vehicles brought soldiers at about 10 pm 
when the curfew was imposed madzhidov said he did not know 
exactly how the casualties occurred 
there were no reports that the violence had spread from the city 
of a halfmillion people to other parts of the republic he said 
residents of dushanbe reached by phone corroborated madzhidovs 
report but said there had been rioting in suburbs of the capital 
as well 
tass said tadzhikistan interior minister m navzhuvanov had been 
appointed military commandant of the city it did not give any

operators of an indian casino say 
they will continue to offer las vegasstyle gambling despite a 
warning from the states attorney general that such games are 
illegal 
leaders of the lac du flambeau chippewa tribe say the opinion by 
attorney general donald hanaway does not make sense in a state 
where a lottery and parimutuel betting at dog tracks are legal 
it also threatens the economic revival of the 2276member 
reservation which recently invested 134000 to remodel a grocery 
store into the lake of the torches casino in northern wisconsin 
vilas county district attorney david penn said he will use 
hanaways opinion to raid the yearold facility this week and shut 
it down 
i think the tribe realizes it is the law and it will be 
enforced in vilas county penn said 
but tribal officials said the casino which provides 18 jobs and 
grossed 43000 last month would not close voluntarily 
i will tell you right now it will hurt us economically it 
will hurt us quite a bit said tribal chairman michael allen last 
week 
hanaway ruled feb 5 that the states gambling laws enacted in 
1987 only allow bingo lottery and parimutuel betting casino 
games such as blackjack poker craps roulette and video gambling 
machines are illegal he said 
his opinion leaves enforcement to district attorneys in the 
states 72 counties any attempt to enforce his opinion is likely 
to lead to a court challenge observers said 
in the last year three indian tribes in wisconsin have opened 
casinos the lac du flambeau chippewa the lac court oreilles 
chippewa and the menominee 
state officials can regulate gambling on the two chippewa 
reservations but have no enforcement authority on the menominee 
reservation which falls under federal regulation officials said 
the lac court oreilles chippewa tribe about 100 miles to the 
west also plans to keep its casino open tom van roy district 
attorney for sawyer county declined comment monday when asked 
whether he planned to try to shut down the casino in his county 
the lac du flambeaus casino open wednesday through sunday 
offers seven blackjack tables with 50 betting limits and some 40 
video gambling machines including blackjack poker horse races a 
lottery and an electronic slot machine there is also a bingo 
parlor

the nuclear submarine tennessee 
successfully launched two trident 2 missiles just 20 seconds apart 
monday ending the navys threeyear test program for the weapons 
the two 44foot missiles were launched as the tennessee cruised 
submerged in the atlantic 200 miles off the florida coast the navy 
reported both firings were successful running the missiles string 
of successes to seven straight 
the first shot officially ended the test program the second 
qualified the tennessee to become the first submarine to go on 
operational patrol with 24 of the nucleartipped missiles 
the navy says the trident 2 priced at 265 million each is 
much more accurate than its undersea predecessors polaris 
poseidon and trident 1 published reports said the weapons 
warheads can strike within 400 feet of their targets compared with 
about 1500 feet for the trident 1 
the first launch monday marked the final test flight for the 
trident 2 completing a program which began in january 1987 with a 
series of 19 launches from land 15 of them successful nine 
submarine tests followed all from the tennessee and seven of them 
successful 
the second launch was called a demonstration and shakedown 
operation or daso which mainly tested the sub crews ability to 
safely handle and launch the missile navy spokeswoman pat hicks 
said after each daso is completed a submarine is certified for 
deployment 
the tennessee is scheduled to go on operational patrol in march 
with 24 trident 2s each capable of delivering up to 12 nuclear 
warheads to targets more than 4600 miles away 
current navy plans are to deploy a total of 24 trident 2 subs 
the pennsylvania is scheduled to arrive soon for its daso test

extraordinary session of the national congress to strengthen 
mikhail s gorbachevs powers as president

soviet the nations highest executive body unanimously favored 
the establishment of democratic presidential power in our country

government while weakening the power of the party apparatus

supreme soviet parliament to call its parent body the 2250member 
congress of peoples deputies into session in the near future but 
did not give a date the supreme soviet goes into session wednesday 
all constitutional questions such as powers of the presidency 
must be decided by the congress which meets briefly twice a year

top us and soviet trade officials began 
negotiations monday aimed at wiping away nearly a halfcentury of 
trade frictions between the two superpowers by the time of the 
bushgorbachev summit in june 
both sides expressed optimism that a new trade treaty could be 
completed by then even though the complexity of the talks was 
highlighted by the size of the delegations and the length of the 
negotiating agenda 
the us team led by trade representative carla hills and her 
deputy julius l katz included 19 officials from six agencies 
including the departments of state treasury commerce and labor 
the first round of negotiations which were scheduled to last 
through tuesday were to be followed by two more sessions in late 
february and early march the monday session included morning and 
afternoon meetings separated by a working lunch 
us officials said they hoped that all of the negotiations 
would be completed by the end of april to provide time to draft the 
final trade agreement so that it can be signed by president bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev at their june meeting in 
washington 
as the talks got under way hills told reporters that she was 
confident that the differences separating the two sides could be 
ironed out noting her soviet counterparts she said we are a 
very efficient team 
yuriy n chumakov deputy minister of foreign economic affairs 
and the leader of the soviet delegation urged reporters to hold 
their questions about the chances for success until negotiators had 
finished the initial round of talks 
hills listed as goals normalizing trade relations with the 
soviet union and facilitating trade between the two countries 
the administration hopes that normalized trade will give a boost 
to the soviet economy and provide economic support to the political 
reforms being undertaken by gorbachev 
the trade treaty would be used to grant the soviet union most 
favored nation status qualifying it for the lowest tariffs 
granted to any other country 
the soviets are anxious to obtain this benefit since their 
imports to the united states must currently bear duties as much as 
10 times higher than imports from other nations 
the higher tariffs are a result of a 1974 law known as the 
jacksonvanik amendment which was passed by congress in 
retaliation for the refusal of the soviet government to allow 
soviet jews and other dissidents to leave the country 
bush has said he will ask congress to waive the jacksonvanik 
restrictions once the soviet legislature passes a law spelling out 
its new liberalized emigration policies the new trade treaty would 
be needed to put the lower tariffs into effect 
hungary recently obtained a waiver from the high jacksonvanik 
tariffs in addition to the soviet union the administration is 
also considering granting waivers for czechoslovakia romania 
bulgaria and east germany the curbs against poland were lifted in 
1987 
one of the issues in the soviet negotiations will be how the 
waiver from the high tariffs will be accomplished the 
administration would like to negotiate a threeyear trade agreement 
with annual presidential review and waiver of the high tariffs 
the soviets would like to see the tariffs removed permanently as 
a way of building confidence among business leaders that trade 
relations will remain stable in coming years 
but congress which is following the present negotiations with 
keen interest is unlikely to go along with more than a oneyear 
waiver 
other issues on the opening agenda were us demands for 
protection of americanpatented products from piracy an 
arbitration method to settle business disputes and provisions to 
allow either country to impose temporary trade restrictions if a 
domestic industry suffers injury because of an unexpected surge of 
imports 
the administration is predicting that twoway trade between the 
two countries could double or even triple over the next three years 
with a new trade agreement although private economists doubt that 
assessment given the numerous troubles plaguing the soviet economy 
through november the united states had sold 382 billion worth 
of exports to the soviets primarily farm products while importing 
a relatively small 658 million worth of soviet products primarily 
oil platinum and consumer goods such as vodka and furs 
trade relations between the united states and the soviet union 
began deteriorating with the onset of cold war tensions following 
world war ii in 1947 president truman placed restrictions on us 
exports to the soviet union in an effort to keep militaryuseful 
technologies from falling into communist hands

cellist and conductor mstislav rostropovich in 
his homeland for the first time in 16 years said monday the 
government should drop treason charges against alexander 
solzhenitsyn and apologize to the exiled author 
it is ridiculous that a charge like this continues to loom 
over him rostropovich told a news conference the day after 
returning to the soviet union for concerts in moscow and leningrad 
rostropovich and his wife singer galina vishnevskaya were 
stripped of citizenship in 1978 four years after they were hounded 
into leaving the soviet union for giving refuge to solzhenitsyn 
ms vishnevskaya had spent 30 years with the bolshoi theater 
opera company and her husband gained international renown as a 
cello soloist and conductor with the moscow philharmonic orchestra 
he has conducted the national symphony orchestra of washington 
dc for 13 years 
in january the supreme soviet legislalature restored their 
citizenship and nullified an edict stripping them of all honors and 
medals 
when asked about the possible return of solzhenitsyn to the 
soviet union rostropovich said the writer hoped to do so but not 
until censorship of his work was completely lifted 
i think that alexander solzhenitsyn will come back but the 
soviet union must apologize for the absurd charge of high 
treason he said 
failure to repeal the charge which carries the death penalty 
runs counter to the liberalization occurring soviet union 
rostropovich told reporters 
citizenship has been restored to several prominent cultural 
figures who lost it under previous regimes and they have returned 
during the cultural thaw that prevails under president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
solzhenitsyn who depicted the horrors of josef stalins prison 
camps in the gulag archipelago was formally charged with high 
treason in 1974 stripped of citizenship and expelled rostropovich 
and his wife followed their friend a few months later 
soviet officials have said solzhenitsyns citizenship could be 
restored but only if he formally asks for it they say no request 
has been received from the author who lives in vermont 
rostropovich 62 said he and ms vishnevskaya had found their 
return a bittersweet and emotional experience 
it is a strange feeling to be back in my own country she 
said our reception was warm and affectionate but many friends 
have passed away it was very emotional 
we left here insulted rostropovich said then 
sarcastically he said the order depriving them of citizenship was 
signed by brezhnev referring to the late president leonid i 
brezhnev who did not do any damage to the soviet union of 
course 
brezhnev now is villified as a leader who brought economic and 
political stagnation during 18 years in power 
mrs vishnevskaya said she and her husband thought they never 
would return 
we were thrown out of our own house she said but now the 
government has recognized its barbaric act as unworthy and we had 
an opportunity to return 
when we were leaving rostropovich said the soviet union 
was an island of lies now is cleansing itself of these lies 
the cellist who will give concerts tuesday and wednesday at the 
moscow conservatory presented soviet health officials with 1 
million singleuse syringes monday to help in the campaign against 
aids

munich philharmonic conductor sergiu 
celibidache will give several concerts in bucharest next week after 
years of refusing to perform in his native country the state 
rompres news agency said monday 
celibidache who has been conducting in munich since 1979 will 
perform works by giuseppe verdi richard strauss johannes brahms 
and others at bucharests famed atheneum concert hall pieces 
some of the concerts will be broadcast live on eurovision tv 
network to western europe rompress said 
celibidache left romania shortly after the postwar communist 
takeover and returned for a number of performances in the late 
1970s 
but he refused to return later because of differences with the 
cultural council under the regime of nicolae ceausescu the 
communist dictator who was overthrown and executed in december 
one issue of contention was the refusal of the former council to 
allow young romanian conductors to receive stipends from 
celibidache for musical training abroad 
the council was replaced last month by a minister of culture led 
by andrei plesu a leading exdissident and art critic who had been 
banished by ceausescu to a small village in northeastern romania to 
work as a curator at a local museum

president bush today praised the release of 
nelson mandela as a dramatic sign that south africa is moving 
toward a more racially equitable society but he said it was too 
early to talk about lifting us sanctions 
by law bush told a news conference the economic sanctions 
enacted in 1986 remain on until the south africans have taken 
certain steps beyond just the release of the imprisoned black 
nationalist leader 
the president said he continues to find some of the sanctions 
counterproductive as had the reagan administration before him 
i think american jobs there make sense he said 
at the same time bush said his invitation south african 
president fw de klerk to visit him at the white house bore no 
conditions bush extended separate invitations to both mandela and 
de klerk 
i think his coming here evidences that we see in him a new 
brand of leadership the president said of de klerk 
he praised the south african leader for taking steps that move 
south africa down the road toward racial equality 
asked if he was uncomfortable by links between the communist 
party in south africa and mandela bush said too hypothetical 
whats good is hes out of there 
im not embracing every position of the anc mandelas african 
national congress bush said what im embracing is the 
concept that hes out of jail 
in any event he said i think these communist parties are for 
the most part sliding down hill whats coming uphill is democracy 
and freedom and i would hope steps mr de klerk is taking would 
enhance that view that democracy and freedom are on the move 
earlier today in a speech welcoming denis sassounguesso the 
president of the congo to the white house bush also promised that 
the united states will not overlook africa in its concern with the 
events unfolding in europe 
africas our friend and friends dont forget one another 
he said 
bush said the release of mandela after 27 years in prison is 
another important sign that south africa may soon begin negotiating 
a democratic nonracial society and at last be on the way to ending 
apartheid once and for all 
some have suggested that events in the rest of the world 
including central europe mean that the united states will no longer 
pay attention to africa i can assure and everyone in africa that 
this is not the case said bush he noted he visited africa three 
times as vice president and hope to be able to do so again 
bush praised the congolese presidents role in bringing peace to 
southwest africa sassounguesso called bush a great figure and 
heir to the legacy of two centuries of freedom he also hailed 
mandela as a great symbol of dignity for african men and said 
his release ushers in great prospects for the negotiation of the 
future of south african society 
bush telephoned the newly liberated black leader on sunday and 
invited him to visit the white house afterwards bush had only 
words of praise for both mandela and de klerk 
meanwhile in television interviews this morning the state 
departments top policymaker on africa said it may be time to 
make some gesture toward pretoria to encourage further progress 
in race relations 
the assistant secretary of state for african affairs herman 
cohen said on nbctvs today show this morning that while 
sanctions played a positive role in changing the thinking of the 
white government the main reason for changing policy down 
there is what happened internally the pressure from the black 
majority economic realities demographic realities we just helped 
nudge them along 
i think we should make some kind of gesture because when 
progress takes place we should try to encourage more progress 
cohen said 
the legislation were working under provides for relaxation of 
sanctions when there is progress i think were rapidly reaching 
that point but were not going to make any decisions until weve 
consulted very closely with the congress because its a major 
political decision the state department official said 
speaking on abcs good morning america cohen said what we 
really care about is encouraging further progress if that means 
relaxation of sanctions fine 
two lawmakers also appearing on today indicated that 
congress would move cautiously in lifting the sanctions 
i think the talk is premature and i suspect that it will 
continue for a while but people ought to consider the fact that 
the talk recently in congress was that more sanctions ought to be 
imposed said sen richard lugar rind one factor perhaps in 
the timing of all this was to avoid debate in the us congress 
rep william gray iii dpa the house majority whip said 
the law is very specific in terms of its requirement before the 
president can be making a recommendation im not sure that there 
has been a compliance with all of those requirements 
bush said he told mandela that all americans were delighted 
after these many years in jail that he was released that we were 
rejoicing at his release 
bush said he told mandela the united states wants to see a 
peaceful evolution towards a totally racially free south africa a 
society without prejudice a society of total freedom 
they did not discuss the future of sanctions 
rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on africa said south africa has not yet met 
the conditions for lifting sanctions 
we need to adopt the same standard as we adopted to 
approaching poland and the soviet union and other countries in 
eastern europe we respond positively but we do not reduce the 
pressure said wolpe 
south africas minority white population of 5 million has 
maintained control through its apartheid laws and denial of 
political rights to the 26 million black residents 
the antiapartheid act of 1986 passed over the veto of 
thenpresident reagan stipulated that before sanctions could be 
lifted south africa had to free all political prisoners and meet 
at least three of four other criteria de klerk already has met one 
of the conditions by legalizing the african national congress and 
other antiapartheid groups 
the other conditions include an agreement by the government to 
engage in good faith negotiations on south africas political 
future the lifting of the state of emergency and substantial 
progress toward dismantling apartheid

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee concerned over whose finger stays on the button of the 
soviet unions 30000 nuclear weapons in a time of internal tumult 
is proposing that the kremlin mount a failsafe review of 
controls on its nuclear arsenals 
sen sam nunn dga also wants the united states to conduct 
such an independent review of its own safeguards against the 
unauthorized or accidental launch of nuclear weapons and says his 
committee will do the job if the pentagon fails to act 
with ethnic and political tensions straining soviet unity many 
american military experts and key congressional figures are 
fretting about the possibility that a nuclear missile could be 
unleashed on the world without the knowledge or approval of the 
kremlin 
my worstcase fear for the last several months is that we 
would wake up one morning and discover that an ethnic liberation 
front had obtained control of 100 nuclear weapons said a 
military expert on the staff of the house armed services committee 
nuclear weapons are in every soviet republic that is 
potentially rebellious said the source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
its a legitimate problem to worry about he said im not 
having nightmares about it stealing a nuclear weapon is not a 
simple thing to do we know you cant just walk into a soviet 
missile silo and fire them 
but he added the equation might change if an ethnic faction 
seized control of an entire province 
bruce g blair of the brookings institution notes that the 
soviets may have 100 or so nuclear weapons stored near baku in 
soviet azerbaijan site of recent violent clashes between moslem 
azerbaijanis and christian armenians 
until soviet troops entered baku to restore order widespread 
reports had gunmen seizing conventional arms and ammunition from 
soviet depots 
its a concern people are paying attention to trying to 
monitor blair said i think the soviets themselves are so 
concerned about this problem that theyre handling it just fine 
ethic violence flared again monday this time in the 
predominantly moslem asian republic of tadzhikistan soviet 
authorities reported rioting in the capital city of dushanbe with 
mobs angry over rumors that armenian refugees were getting 
preferential treatment there were deaths and dozens of injuries 
and reports of looting before authorities declared a state of 
emergency and imposed a curfew 
the issue of control over nuclear weapons may soon be explored 
in extraordinary public fashion at a time the superpowers 
apparently are nearing agreement on several arms control accords 
yevgeni velikhov chairman of the supreme soviets defense 
subcommittee proposes an unprecedented joint hearing with the 
house armed services committee to explore ways of reducing the 
danger of unauthorized or accidental launches of nuclear weapons 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house panel says he is 
open to the idea of a joint meeting leaving the topic of such a 
session to be settled later 
nunn said in an interview i think you have to worry about 
thousands of nuclear weapons in a nation that has a lot of 
turmoil 
nunn wants the kremlin to review the effectiveness of 
failsafe procedures to insulate their nuclear weapons from the 
countrys political troubles i hope we can persuade them to do 
it he said 
the two superpowers should cooperate more closely on the issue 
because this is one area of technology that it would pay both 
sides to share he said 
in the event of instability people have to be worried about 
who would be in charge said sen richard lugar rind a former 
chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
like others lugar noted that a probable silver lining to their 
worries is the continued cohesiveness of the soviet military 
there seems to be no instability whatsoever in the soviet 
armed forces lugar said they appear to be in full control of 
nuclear weapons short or longrange 
the soviets have an extensive security system to protect their 
nuclear weapons placing missile sites in remote locations 
surrounding their perimeters with heavily armed guards separating 
weapons from launchers and triggers and installing multiple launch 
controls

president bush said today that the united 
states and the soviet union made solid progress last week 
toward arms control agreements but cautioned against hope that 
three treaties might be ready by the time of his june summit with 
mikhail gorbachev 
the president said he hoped he and gorbachev could sign a troop 
reduction agreement this year and that treaties should be 
substantially completed on reducing long range nuclear weapons 
and chemical weapons by the time of the summit he rejected 
gorbachevs counterproposal to his own initiative to cut european 
troops 
at a white house news conference that focused almost exclusively 
on fastmoving subjects of foreign affairs bush said the issue of 
german reunification was up to the german people he ruled out a 
neutral nation and said whatever emerges would have to remain a 
member of nato 
he also offered to play a mediating role in resolving south 
africas racial conflict if it seemed appropriate 
fielding questions in the white house briefing room bush was 
asked about nelson mandelas declaration that armed struggle 
against the white minority in south africa should continue he said 
he would discourage violence and said the south african leader 
freed sunday after 27 years in prison had said such actions 
should be defensive 
weve always advocated nonviolence and i think the united 
states ought not to move away from that he said 
bush ruled out a partial lifting of sanctions against south 
africa saying he was barred from taking that step despite 
mandelas release asked about mandelas alliance with communists 
bush said he saw communism sliding downhill throughout the 
world with democracy on the ascent 
bush said he believed both mandela and south african president 
fw deklerk had accepted his invitations to visit the white house 
in principle but that no date was set for either to visit 
asked whether he expected to play a major role in the discussions 
between mandela and the south african government bush said 
if such a role would be productive i certainly would but i 
have the feeling they feel that can talk to each other without 
the us catalytic role but sure if we could be helpful in a way 
of that nature then sure 
in an opening statement bush tossed a bouquet at gorbachev and 
his communist colleagues in moscow embracing their movement 
toward pluralism last week when the communist party endorsed a 
plan to give up its monopoly on power in the soviet union 
bush who had called for deep force cuts in europe nonetheless 
rejected gorbachevs counterproposal that would have left both 
sides with 195000 troops in europe to attain this level 
gorbachev wanted the united states to recall 30000 troops in 
countries great britain italy greece and turkey not covered 
under the original negotiations 
the president said the disagreement didnt amount to an impasse 
in the negotiations saying this is the way it works 
bush hailed gorbachevs declaration that germans should decide 
their own fate and said the time was not yet right for a meeting 
of the four nations who hold occupation rights as a result of world 
war ii the soviet union the united states france and england 
the president also said that if east germany was to join west 
germany in a unified nation the new germany should be a member of 
nato he said there was flexibility on where western troops could 
be positioned within the new country 
bush opened his news conference by saying he wanted to 
commend the developments in the soviet union last week in which 
the communist party was stripped of its automatic leading role in 
governing the country 
he noted solid progress by secretary of state james baker 
iii in his talks in moscow he said the talks had covered 
conventional arms control long range nuclear weapons nuclear 
testing and chemical weapons as well as issues such as central 
america and afghanistan 
he said the talks had accomplished much of what he and 
gorbachev had hoped for when they set up the negotiations at their 
malta summit last december 
i am confident that if we continue this kind of momentum 
the june summit will be a major success he said 
at the same time bush said im not sure there will be three 
treaties to be signed by the time we have this summit but i think 
theres going to be progress toward all three 
he said the goal was to get the agreement signed on reduction of 
conventional forces in europe 
on other issues bush 
said he would decide shortly whether to permit the sale of 
leases for offshore drilling on the california coast he said that 
despite last weeks tanker spill ill be damned if i think we 
ought to shut down offshore drilling everywhere 
said he would tell the presidents of colombia peru and 
bolivia at a drug summit this week that the united states was 
making major efforts to cut down the on the demand for cocaine in 
this country 
said a long list of proposed military base closings was drawn 
up without political favoritism and urged congress to drop the 
age old adage cut here cut there but dont cut in my 
district

a special state environmental panel on monday 
called for increased public disclosure about operations at the 
rocky flats nuclear weapons plant 
in order to be a responsible neighbor to millions of people 
living nearby the rocky flats plant must be open and honest about 
its operations and their impact and be willing to listen and 
respond to the communitys concerns said state rep sam 
williams chairman of the rocky flats environmental monitoring 
council 
gov roy romer and us rep david skaggs appointed the 
11member council in january 1988 to promote communication between 
the plant and concerned public agencies and the public and to 
monitor environmental safety and public health concerns 
the plant 16 miles northwest of denver manufactures highly 
radioactive plutonium detonators for nuclear weapons 
it has been under investigation by a federal grand jury since 
shortly after a raid on june 6 1989 by scores of fbi and 
environmental protection agency agents investigating allegations of 
illegal radioactive waste storage and disposal 
plutonium operations at the plant were suspended in november by 
energy secretary james watkins until health and safety concerns are 
met no startup date has been announced but sources have said 
plutonium processing could resume in late spring or summer 
the doe also transferred management of the plant to egampg a 
major defense contractor from rockwell international on jan 1 
the council noted in its report that improved communication is 
critically needed doe and its contractors have historically 
demonstrated a reluctance to share information about the general 
operation of rocky flats about incidents and problems that have 
occurred and about anticipated future problems this lack of 
openness has aggravated public mistrust of the plant and its 
possible impacts upon the environment and public health safety 
melinda kassen a senior attorney for the environmental defense 
fund said the report contains nothing new or revolutionary 
the report serves as an exclamation point at the end of whats 
already been said kassen added 
kassen said the bush administration did not include funding in 
its budget proposal for the plants fiveyear plan for 
environmental restoration new initiatives for waste management and 
corrective activities for complying with existing legal 
requirements 
among the reports recommendations 
full funding of health studies to assess the effect of plant 
discharges on the community and reactivation and expansion of a 
study of effects on rocky flats workers 
minimum level plutonium processing until a previously initiated 
safety review is completed and all suggested corrective actions are 
implemented 
strict air emission monitoring 
issuance of publicinformation papers by the rocky flats plant 
openly discussing tough issues facing the plant 
placement of various oversight responsibilities for nuclear 
weapons plants outside the department of energy 
formal agreement not to permanently dispose of any wastes at 
rocky flats and to put a premium on eliminating offsite discharges 
of hazardous materials

here is a transcript of president bushs news 
conference monday at the white house 
bush good afternoon well this has been an extraordinary and 
positive week in eastwest relations and in the soviet union 
progress was made at the central committee plenum on moving the 
soviet political system toward pluralism and genuine respect for 
the views of the soviet electorate i commend this development 
which demonstrates once again why our administration has supported 
chairman gorbachevs efforts to extend glasnost and perestroika 
through the soviet union 
secretary bakers visit to moscow made solid progress in pushing 
the ussoviet agenda forward in preparation for the june summit 
here we made important headway on conventional arms control 
start nuclear testing and chemical weapons and continued to 
explore ways to reduce our differences on regional issues 
especially concerning central america and afghanistan 
all in all secretary bakers talks in moscow accomplished much 
of what chairman gorbachev and i intended when we set the goals for 
this meeting during our discussions at malta i am confident that 
if we continue this kind of momentum in our bilateral relationship 
with the soviet union the june summit will be a major success 
and finally i want to congratulate chancellor kohl for his 
successful visit to moscow his visit reflects the accelerating 
pace of german selfdetermination and the statements on german 
unity on the soviet side by the soviet side were most welcome 
and we support chancellor kohls position that a unified germany 
should remain a member of nato let me also express my appreciation 
of chairman gorbachevs statesmanlike view that decisions regarding 
german unity should be left to the people of germany 
i made a statement this morning on the wonderful news of the 
release of mr mandela so i will leave that to the question 
period but terry i understand you have the first question 
q yes mr president what is your reaction to mr gorbachevs 
counterproposal for troop cuts in europe and in the wake of 
secretary bakers visit to moscow what do you think the likelihood 
is that therell be three treaties to be signed this year 
chemical strategic and conventional 
bush well i let me take the last one first im not sure that 
there will be three treaties to be signed by the time we have this 
summit but i think theres going to be progress towards all three 
and its still our goal to get that agreement signed 
on the troops where gorbachev wanted to have either 195000 or 
225000 were going to stay with our proposal because we dont see 
this linkage to that degree were talking about the forward 
deployment there in europe the 195000 and thats what were 
challenging him to reduce and weve got a big ocean between us and 
western europe 
and so the argument that we should always have a linked 
reduction is one that i want to get away from now weve i think 
weve made some real progress on this and i was very pleased with 
his reaction to our proposal but i dont think we need to have 
exact linkage from this point on 
q well if youre rejecting his counterproposal is there an 
impasse now 
bush i wouldnt call it an impasse you know this is the 
way it works when youre discussing these arms control things no 
i dont think weve got an impasse 
q with the breakup of the soviet empire and you want germany to 
remain in nato whos the enemy 
bush what was that 
q whos the enemy who are they supposed to be fighting against 
bush who 
q the nato troops us troops in germany 
bush the us troops are there as a stabilizing factor nobody 
can predict helen with total certainty what tomorrow is going to 
look like ive been wrong youve been wrong hes been wrong 
shes been wrong on how its going and we dont know 
q but hasnt the soviet union 
bush and our may i finish please 
q ok 
bush our european allies want us there i have a feeling that 
some of the eastern europeans want us there because they know that 
the united states is there as a stabilizing factor and we will be 
there for a long time to come hopefully at significantly reduced 
numbers 
q may i just add mr president that theres a wide perception 
that your whole military budget is out of sync that youre tone 
deaf into whats been happening and that there is a possibility of 
this money going for distressing domestic need 
bush i dont think that perception is widespread with the 
american people i think the american people want a cautious 
approach to this i dont think any of us think we can see with 
clairvoyance as to whats going to happen the day after tomorrow 
and we are reducing our defense expenditures weve sent a budget 
proposal up there that makes good sense 
youre right some of the democrats are jumping all over us but 
thats all right that just goes with the system 
the main thing is the europeans our staunchest allies want us 
there because they see the us as a stabilizing presence and so 
were going to remain there now as i say i hope negotiations go 
so well that we can have substantially reduced numbers over the 
years

an inmate whose drug convictions were 
overturned last month is near death after an 11month hunger strike 
and will be forcefed while prosecutors appeal his case his 
attorney said monday 
rene acuna 37 of detroit has dropped to just over 100 pounds 
and a prison doctor says his weakened heart may fail said paul 
denenfeld legal director for the michigan chapter of the american 
civil liberties union 
acuna is still imprisoned because he is unable to meet a 
100000 bond 
i think at this point what we are seeing is an example of how 
the justice system can break down denenfeld said 
we have three appeals court judges saying the man should never 
have been in jail in the first place we think it is outrageous 
that he is still in jail he should already be out 
department of corrections spokeswoman gail light said doctors 
began forcefeeding acuna at 11 am monday after receiving 
permission from his courtappointed guardian anna sossa 
i can generally say the doctors believe this is a 
lifethreatening situation and they need to get some nutrition down 
him again she said 
acuna weighed 180 pounds when he began his hunger strike march 
3 shortly after he was convicted the convictions carried 
mandatory terms of life in prison without parole 
he refused to resume eating after the michigan court of appeals 
threw out his convictions for lack of evidence in a ruling released 
jan 23 
the cuban immigrant said he will not eat until he can return 
home to sossa his longtime companion and his two daughters 
he is at the duane l waters hospital next to the state prison 
of southern michigan in jackson unable to post a 100000 bond 
while the macomb county prosecuting attorneys office appeals to 
the michigan supreme court 
carole murray chief of the drug unit in the prosecutors 
office said the appeal was filed friday 
sossa said she agreed to permit the forcefeeding because prison 
doctors threatened to go to court to have her removed as guardian 
and because she fears for acunas life 
hes really in bad shape if he dies now after he has won his 
appeal what are we going to get nothing she said i dont 
want to give macomb county prosecutor carl marlinga the pleasure 
that he dies 
after the appeal bond was set feb 1 acuna refused his regular 
diet of water and coffee with sugar and refused to be weighed 
denenfeld said acuna weighed 107 pounds before the appeal bond 
hearing and may be just over 100 pounds by now he said 
prosecutors accused acuna of serving as a lookout for a 1988 
drug buy during which undercover agents bought cocaine acuna has 
denied any involvement 
the appeals court reversed acunas convictions of delivery and 
conspiracy to deliver more than two pounds of cocaine and refused 
to order a new trial 
acuna was forcefed last fall after his weight plunged below 107 
pounds and gained about 20 pounds but resumed his hunger strike 
after the nasal feeding tube was removed

blacks could hold the key to a resurgent 
buffalo says the author of a study released monday that is billed 
as the most comprehensive ever done of a single black community 
blacks began migrating to buffalo in large numbers around 1940 
just about the time when the citys industries began a slump from 
which they never really recovered said the study conducted by the 
state university of new york at buffalo 
at that point when thousands of new residents were pouring 
into buffalo the citys economy was beginning to change 
researcher henry louis taylor jr told a news conference the 
jobs that lured black people to buffalo were disappearing almost as 
fast as they could get them 
the buffalo labor force is old he said there is no 
population younger than the africanamerican community if you 
train them you solve one of buffalos major problems 
the unemployment rate among blacks in buffalo was 26 percent in 
1940 16 percent in 1960 and 21 percent in 1980 a consistent 8 
percent higher than the citys overall unemployment rate for those 
years said taylor director of sunybuffalos center for applied 
public affairs studies 
the study addresses housing education crime and the quest for 
community among the citys 94262 blacks 
university officials said it was the most comprehensive study 
ever of a single black community the buffalo urban league and the 
common council which commissioned the study plan to use it for a 
range of policy issues 
the report suggests that the east side where 84 percent of 
buffalos black residents live should become one of the citys top 
priorities for economic and social reform before it becomes a 
disaster area like the slums of chicago or detroit 
taylor said city leaders should officially designate the east 
side as a development zone the target of a coordinated effort to 
transform it into a wholesome community or in taylors words a 
renaissance city 
leroy coles the urban leagues president said it will be hard 
to persuade city leaders that the east sides rebirth should be a 
priority 
city hall it seems to me has to become more concerned about 
the growing population suffering from a number of things this 
report speaks to coles said the report is a good way for 
white folks to begin to understand that this is not only about our 
problems but about theirs as well 
the report says that while many buffalo blacks own their own 
homes the homes are likely to be shabby and the owners are 
unlikely to have enough money to fix them up properly 
blacks are more likely to be arrested than whites of the same 
age for all crimes except surprisingly drug offenses the report 
said 
at the same time there are encouraging signs such as the fact 
that the east side contains a broad crosssection of middleclass 
and workingclass blacks and a large array of community 
organizations taylor said

conservative african leaders 
responded to nelson mandelas release by calling monday for closer 
ties with pretoria which is wooing black africa with cheap goods 
and promises of aid 
hardline states such as nigeria and zimbabwe issued predictable 
statements endorsing sanctions and urging no leniency toward the 
pretoria government 
but gabons president omar bongo basking in the euphoria 
surrounding mandelas release sunday after more than 27 years in 
prison declared it a triumph for dialogue over cannons and 
guns 
we need to review our relations with south africa to 
reestablish diplomatic ties even if we do not send ambassadors 
bongo said in a radio broadcast 
his declaration indicated a growing chasm in black africas 
often hypocritical stand on south africa 
most african countries trade with pretoria but few openly 
acknowledge the economic links made more attractive recently by the 
weakened south african currency and some states overvalued 
currencies particularly those frenchspeaking africa 
the ivory coast reported to be considering diplomatic relations 
with pretoria urged a new approach to president fw de klerks 
government 
the time has come for africa to end its current opposition to 
the south african goverment and to encourage and support the 
efforts of president de klerk said foreign minister simeon ake 
president felix houphouetboigny sent a telegram to mandela 
appealing to him to negotiate with de klerk and implicitly chiding 
the newly released leader for his endorsement of violence against 
apartheid 
the whole world and all africa is counting on you to work 
through dialogue toward a triumph for the noble cause of peace 
equality and brotherhood boigny said 
he also praised de klerk who visited the ivory coast in 
december 
history will pay you homage for the personal part you have 
played in the changes that give great hopes to all south african 
people for the building of a great and democratic nation 
houphouetboigny said 
other african countries welcomed mandelas release but joined 
his african national congress in warning that much work lies ahead 
nigerias military government said mandelas release is 
positive proof that concerted pressure on the apartheid regime 
including mandatory sanctions continue to have the desired 
effect 
zimbabwean president robert mugabe urged the world not to be 
deceived into believing de klerk has yet tackled the substantive 
issues of apartheid 
mugabe like the leaders of nigeria sierra leone and liberia 
said mandelas release must be followed by freedom for all 
political prisoners the lifting of emergency regulations and the 
repeal of all racist laws 
a liberian government statement said pretorias action 
accentuated the need for continued international pressure on south 
africa 
but it welcomed mandelas release from an imprisonment it called 
a violation of his fundamental human rights 
liberia itself is drawing increasing international criticism for 
human rights abuses that culminated in january with the alleged 
killings of at least 500 civilians by troops fighting to put down 
an ethnic rebellion the killings have caused some 144000 refugees 
to flee the country 
as the world celebrated mandelas release sunday the west 
african state of senegal which boasts it is a democracy quickly 
detained opposition leader abdoulaye wade as he returned home from 
a sixmonth exile 
wade claims his senegalese democratic party won february 1988 
elections in which president abdou diouf claimed victory for his 
socialist party 
some western countries accuse african governments of similar 
hypocrisy in their calls for sanctions against south africa

q mr president does the release of nelson mandela and the 
other steps announced by president de klerk in south africa alter 
in any way your views toward united states economic sanctions 
which of course the reagan administration and you as a part of it 
were never very enthusiastic about 
bush what do you mean in the sense of altering my views as to 
what we ought to do in the future 
q well as to whether they work or not 
bush well i dont know that one can attribute all the change 
in south africa to sanctions now weve got some sanctions on 
there and by law they remain on until the south africans have 
taken certain steps and i think that you know somebody asked me 
about this yesterday i said well i cant judge frankly i 
think some are counterproductive i happen to think american jobs 
there make good sense and i dont think they perpetuate the status 
quo but i think whats really changed is the mindset of the south 
african leadership and i think that we ought to give mr de klerk 
certain credit for being able to look much more realistically about 
political change and hopefully more favorably about a society 
that eventually eliminates this racism that is equated with 
apartheid 
q well would you be willing to push for the lifting of any of 
the sanctions before all of the conditions set forth in the law 
have been met 
bush we cant do that im bound by the law and what i do want 
to do is discuss these provisions with mr mandela and with mr de 
klerk and ive invited both of them to come here and i also want 
to see them continue to talk with each other and then out of that 
i think well have a much more realistic picture of what the united 
states might do in the future 
q nelson mandela continues to call for armed struggle to 
overturn apartheid when he comes to the white house would you 
urge him to adopt the nonviolent tactics of martin luther king 
bush yes i would but what i and i hope i didnt misread it 
i read his statement to be more on the defensive side when i looked 
at it this morning but i yes weve always advocated 
nonviolence and i think the united states ought not to move away 
from that 
q if i can followup on the question of the sanctions are 
there things that you can do for the south african government apart 
from lifting sanctions you realize that by law you cant lift 
sanctions unilaterally are there other things you can do other 
than just asking de klerk to come to washington 
bush well i would say out of the meeting with mr de klerk i 
would have a clear perception of what other things might be i 
think having him here is a major step i think its a very 
important step and so i would simply have to defer on that 
question until i have a chance to talk to him 
q mr president there are those who say keeping on with 
sanctions that now is more of a time than ever to keep all the 
pressure on and if not keeping the pressure on even go one step 
further i wonder if you intended your invitation to mr de klerk 
as a reward for what hes done given that no south african 
president has ever been here before and secondly do you think 
its time regardless of what you think of sanctions to reward 
them in some other way 
bush reward 
q reward south africa 
bush well i dont know about rewards i think his coming here 
evidences the fact that we see in him a new brand of leadership a 
man who is making dramatic changes in south africa the freeing of 
mandela clearly is a very positive sign and so i think theres 
much more to be done but there are things that he has done that i 
think deserve our support and id say appreciation because i 
think these steps hes taking move south africa down the road 
towards racial equity 
q mr president on germany would you be willing to consider a 
situation where a united germany was not necessarily a full member 
of nato 
bush no i think that chancellor kohl is absolutely correct and 
we ought to support him nato membership and i think its 
stabilizing i think its good there might be some flexibility 
obviously on deployment of nato forces but in terms of membership 
i think that is the most reassuring and stabilizing concept i 
happen to believe that is the most reassuring and stabilizing in 
terms of how the eastern europeans will eventually look at it 
maybe not today 
q but you mean the same kind of membership that west germany 
now has 
bush sure yeah but as i theres some flexibility on 
deployment of nato forces into eastern europe nobody wants to 
threaten the soviet union as i was trying to say to helen the 
us presence is a stabilizing presence 
q mr president on the de klerk visit that now seems to be 
almost a fait accompli are there any conditions on that does he 
have to lift the state of emergency and in your conversation with 
him did he tell you when he would do that

the washington senate on monday narrowly 
passed a measure allowing sex offenders to choose castration in 
exchange for reducing their sentences by as much as 75 percent 
the bill was approved 2523 and sent to the house where speaker 
joe king said the measure probably wont come up before next year 
we just dont know if were ready to experiment on the public 
yet king said 
the measure and other legislation aimed at repeat sex 
offenders is the legislatures reaction to recent crimes 
including the sexual mutilation of a 7yearold tacoma boy 
senate critics accused backers of the bill of showing blood 
lust and said such a law would dump unrepentant sex criminals 
back on the streets years earlier than if they were to serve full 
prison terms they predicted the courts would throw out such a law 
but sponsors said studies have shown castration to cut repeat 
crime by 75 percent or more 
mutilation is too good for these people said sen brad 
owen it should be mandatory for these creeps 
no one mentions cruel and unusual punishment of the 
citizens agreed sen bob mccaslin 
both houses have approved tough sexcrimes legislation suggested 
by a citizens task force appointed by gov booth gardner informal 
negotiations are under way to iron out the differences 
that legislation includes stiffer sentences a procedure for 
civil commitment of incorrigible sex offenders and more services 
for victims 
sen ellen craswell sponsor of the castration bill and her 
senate allies contend those efforts arent enough 
surgical castration does affect violent behavior the lowering 
of testosterone level affects violence said craswell referring 
to a male sex hormon she said she prefers life sentences for sex 
criminals 
foes of the castration bill said it wont survive constitutional 
scrutiny on 8th amendment grounds of cruel and unusual punishment 
they noted the south carolina supreme court so ruled in the case of 
three rapists offered the option in exchange for suspended 
sentences 
craswells measure includes provisions for court hearings before 
to castration to ensure the offender understands the legal 
medical emotional and psychological consequences of surgical 
castration 
the bill would allow a 75 percent reduction from what the 
sentence normally would be under the standard sentencing range used 
by judges across the state 
gardner all but promised a veto if the measure should make it to 
his desk studies dont prove castration is an effective deterrent 
and early releases for sex criminals could make the assault rate 
even worse he said 
in the mutilation case earl kenneth shiner who had a history 
of violence to young people was convicted last week of attempted 
murder rape and assault and could be sentenced to 99 years in 
prison

bush there are no conditions on my invitation if thats the 
question absolutely not 
q well would he come if the state of emergency has not been 
lifted he hasnt done that 
bush i dont know i dont know whether he would or not 
q you didnt discuss that 
bush no i didnt discuss any conditions i said i want him to 
come you have freed nelson mandela you have taken certain steps 
that are positive and we want to see more we want to see you go 
further but youre welcome and thats the way 
q mr president do you have any second thoughts about the trip 
last week im especially thinking of the war games with the soviet 
tanks particularly when your views on the defense budget are well 
known and the central committee was meeting at the same time 
bush no i think it was a good trip and ive read some 
ticktock inside here but it doesnt bother me a bit i think that 
those people that were there understood that that training has 
applications elsewhere weve seen recent areas where military 
force was used because it was well trained and so i stand by that 
was a very good trip you see i support our defense budget i 
think it makes sense and the fact that weve got some critics up 
there that dont like it thats too bad i think the american 
people want to see us stay strong 
q what signal does that send to mr gorbachev however you 
just praised a few minutes ago 
bush well it sent a pretty good one i guess because we came 
out of that meeting with some forward motion and i salute him i 
cant say the trip to the state of californias desert had a heck 
of a lot to do with it but if youd listen to some of the critique 
from capitol hill youd have thought it had been a disaster and 
yet ive told you weve just completed one of the most successful 
ministerial summits that weve had with the 
soviets so you cant the critics up there on the hill cant 
have it both ways 
q i just wanted to follow up on the east germany question you 
said you thought that the eastern europeans would ultimately come 
to see this alliance with nato as a positive thing too are you 
suggesting sir that there is something less threatening about a 
germany that is in alliance in the alliance rather than a neutral 
germany 
bush i think so because i think that a germany inside the nato 
alliance theyre good nato partners now and theyll be good nato 
partners then and theyre very closely linked to the united states 
and i think thats a very good thing 
q can i just turn that around do you think that a neutral 
germany does pose a threat and potentially could be dangerous 
bush well i know thats the concern of many europeans but 
its not the concern that its a concern that would be allayed by 
having west germany having germany a unified germany inside of 
nato 
q mr president you indicated you dont think the conventional 
talks are at an impasse would you be willing to consider an 
arrangement an agreement in which the us was able to keep extra 
troops in europe but at a number somewhat less than the 30000 
bush well weve made our proposal our allies i dont make 
these proposals without consulting the allies and theres 
agreement that these are the proper levels its a level that has 
been scrubbed by our military and i think theres a happiness in 
our own military about this for this time in history i think its 
the right level and so were not out there trying to trade that 
away 
q mr president you said you talk often about the importance 
of free markets to democracy but nelson mandela supports the anc 
view about nationalizing the south african industries including 
banks and mines how do you feel about that and does that pose a 
problem for real democracy in south africa 
bush we are not for nationalizing we are for privatization 
across the were for free markets and so if we have a 
difference there thats fine well discuss it with him but im 
not about to embrace the idea that what we want to do is go down to 
more socialism when socialism is folding folding its hand and 
going over to the other side all across the world i mean you see 
this so this is this is you know a difference that we if 
thats his view why certainly were not going to embrace that 
q is that a severe obstacle though to having a successful 
democracy there 
bush privatization of all the i mean nationalization of all 
the i dont necessarily associate nationalization socialization 
of industry the goods and services produced belonging to the 
state i dont see that as particularly helpful towards democracy 
if thats what you mean but what i think and what i do agree with 
mandela is is to try to get a society that is that is not a 
racist society doesnt support a concept of apartheid 
q on south africa the question is how far how willing are 
you to become personally involved your administration become 
personally involved in facilitating negotiations between mr 
mandela and president de klerk are you ready to play a role like 
president carter did in the camp david accords on the middle east

the massive landidling conservation reserve 
program will boost farm income and improve environmental quality 
through the end of the century an agriculture department report 
said monday 
but consumers will pay somewhat higher food prices as farmers 
take up to 45 million acres of highly erodible cropland from 
production under 10year contracts the report said 
the crp was authorized by the 1985 farm law and signups so far 
have resulted in about 34 million acres an area almost the size of 
michigan 
consumer food costs will climb by 127 billion to 252 
billion over the life of the crp peaking around 1995 the report 
said food cost increases will be less than 1 percent in any 
given year 
under the plan farmers agree to take fragile highly erodible 
land from crop production and plant it to protective grass and 
trees 
in return the government helps pay the cost of the initial 
plantings and then pays the farmer annual rent during the 10 years 
of the contract the payments average about 50 per acre annually 
the report prepared by the departments economic research 
service was based on an assumption that the maximum of 45 million 
acres would be enrolled in the longterm program 
however congress set a minimum of 40 million acres to go with 
the maximum of 45 million acres and administration officials have 
indicated the minimum will be the target 
robert j gray a private conservation specialist and 
consultant said 45 million acres had been thought a reasonable 
goal for the crp he said 5 million acres probably could be added 
to the minimum 40 million through tree plantings in shelterbelts 
windbreaks and other projects 
i would prefer 45 million acres no question about it gray 
said in a telephone interview he said he had not seen the new usda 
report 
the report said that 45 million acres in the crp for 10 years 
increases commodity prices and reduces environmental problems 
linked with soil erosion 
further it added the price increases and production cuts 
cause ripple effects in the farm sector agricultural industries 
and other segments of the economy related to us agriculture 
farm income based on present values will rise by 92 
billion to 203 billion between 1986 and 1999 from higher 
commodity prices and lower production costs the report said 
landowners who plant trees as the cover crop on approximately 35 
million crp acres will gain 41 billion to 54 billion in 
wealth 
environmental benefits were estimated at 6 billion to 136 
billion mostly in offfarm areas being affected by agricultural 
soil erosion the value of improvements in surface water quality 
from the crp ranges from 19 billion to 53 billion 
wildlife habitat improvement was valued from 3 billion to 47 
billion and wind erosion abatement was projected at 400 million 
to 11 billion 
a 45millionacre crp will cost the federal government 215 
billion to 228 billion in rents bonuses costsharing and 
technical assistance the report said most of these costs are 
offset by savings in price and income support payments to farmers

andy rooney said monday he appreciates what 60 
minutes anchorman mike wallace said on the show about his 
suspension from cbs but added that it was nothing like the 
offcamera endorsement he got 
i got great support from mike on friday rooney said in a 
telephone interview it was just wonderful i wish the statement 
on 60 minutes had been as good as he was in person 
rooney said the statement by wallace made during the regular 
sunday 60 minutes broadcast was written by 60 minutes 
producer don hewitt 
the noncommittal statement acknowledged rooneys suspension and 
said his colleagues looked forward to his return 
rooney at first declined to say what he thought of the statement 
but then added i thought it would have been nice if it would 
have been stronger in my support 
rooney was suspended last week for three months by cbs news 
president david burke after a gay magazine the advocate quoted 
him as saying blacks have watered down their genes because the 
less intelligent ones are the ones that have the most children 
the 69yearold humorist denies having said it the telephone 
interview with advocate reporter chris bull was not taperecorded 
rooney says the support hes received from colleagues and 
strangers alike has been incredible 
a cbs spokesman said the networks audience services unit has 
received about 2600 phone calls backing rooney and 45 supporting 
his suspension 
its like being at your own funeral people i didnt even know 
liked me have come to my support rooney said 
people are beginning to see that it was a statement made by 
people with a cause who were out to get me and got me he said 
rooney had angered the gay community when he said on a dec 28 
broadcast that many of the ills which kill us are selfinduced 
he then cited too much alcohol too much food homosexual unions 
cigarettes 
rooney a cbs employee for 40 years and 60 minutes humorist 
since 1978 said he accepted the suspension because he had no 
choice 
i have my money but i like my work i did not want to 
lose it if that was weak of me of the alternatives this was the 
lesser 
asked what his professional relationship with higherups would 
be when he returned rooney said they were awfully nice to me i 
dont know it would be difficult in relationship to mr burke if 
hes still there it would be hard 
rooney said he went to cbs saturday to pick up some reference 
books and paperwork but has not been in the office otherwise i 
dont know that i couldnt but i havent it just seems like bad 
taste 
he said its not easy for me to go out these days and added 
that he was being hounded by supermarket tabloids and tacky tv 
shows 
rooney said he would use the suspension to work on a new book 
about his experiences as an army reporter during world war ii 
write his twiceweekly syndicated newspaper column and concentrate 
on losing weight

bush if such a role would be productive i certainly would but 
i have the feeling from the talks with both men just the short 
phone conversations with both mr de klerk and mr mandela that 
they feel they can talk to each other without the us catalytic 
role but sure if we could be helpful in a way of that nature we 
certainly would 
q mr president there are some people who are questioning the 
need for a conventional forces treaty at all at this point the 
argument being that were at a situation in which the east european 
countries are going to invite all the soviet troops to go home 
anyway and all that wed be doing is codifying the soviet presence 
that isnt even wanted in eastern europe whats your response to 
that argument 
bush id say its very interesting and it may well be that the 
pressure on the soviets will have them withdraw to lower levels i 
dont think theres great sentiment in the warsaw pact countries 
for a continued soviet presence and that im not sure that it 
would negate the need to have an agreement i think the soviets 
would like to get our commitment too but you see those troops 
are not wanted in eastern europe anymore our troops are wanted by 
the free world and i suspect cant prove it that some 
countries in the warsaw pact countries today would see us not as a 
threatening presence but as a stabilizing presence 
q but is it possible the soviets might use the treaty as an 
excuse to keep troops where theyre not even wanted 
bush i dont think they can do that i think theyve got a 
problem with a treaty a cfe treaty with us and others but they 
also have the problem of opinion inside these countries and they 
have enormous budgetary problems that make things very difficult 
q mr president what was your reaction to the rather effusive 
embrace of the south african communist party and the presence of 
the communist party flag on the balcony when mr mandela made his 
speech yesterday 
bush i didnt notice that but you see i think these communist 
parties for the most part are sliding downhill and i think 
whats coming uphill and triumphantly so is democracy and 
freedom and i would hope that the steps that mr de klerk is 
taking and has suggested be taken would enhance the view that 
democracy and freedom are on the move 
q to follow up sir if mr mandela persists in allying himself 
with the communist party would that change your view of his 
bush too hypothetical i mean whats good is that hes out 
there been in jail a long time and an interesting question back 
here but im not embracing every position of the anc or of some of 
the positions that are represented here today as mr mandelas 
positions what i am doing is embracing the concept that its good 
that hes out of jail and that its good that the south africans 
seem to be moving towards a more equitable society 
q do you think its time for a conference of the four powers on 
germany 
bush no not at this juncture i know that idea has some 
credibility right now but i think its moving along pretty well 
and we have always favored the self determination and but the 
germans have to sort this out at some point clearly the four 
powers will have to have some say theres no question about that 
whether its two plus four or what the formulation is we are not 
locked on that at all 
q if gorbachev continues to insist on german neutrality mr 
president do you think that could create a dangerous impasse that 
would spawn a neutrality movement in west germany 
bush not necessarily but i think that weve seen the soviet 
unions position change on the whole concept or the whole 
acceptability of german reunification it wasnt so long ago that 
mr gorbachev and the soviet system were positioned very 
skeptically about any reunification and thats what was so 
symbolic about the kohlgorbachev meeting and so important about 
it and i might say that its a very emotional day for people in 
germany gdr and frg highly emotional brother separated from 
brother cousin from cousin and all of this now with the chance to 
have a peaceful reunification

soviet leaders called monday for a special session 
of congress to strengthen the office of president a move that 
would solidify mikhail s gorbachevs hold on power 
the development coming on the heels of a landmark communist 
party meeting at which the party agreed to give up its 
constitutional monopoly on power would strengthen the government 
and further erode the party apparatus that has ruled the country 
for 72 years 
gorbachev now holds the offices of party generalsecretary and 
of president the new powers being proposed for the president would 
make it more of a westernstyle office 
tass said the presidium of the supreme soviet the countrys 
highest executive body unanimously favored the establishment of 
democratic presidential power in our country 
the statement did not say whether the president should be 
directly elected by voters but one of gorbachevs key allies on 
the communist party politburo said last week that a nationwide 
popular election might be possible 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze speaking at the 
threeday meeting last week of the partys policymaking central 
committee said a new draft of the soviet constitution now being 
written could include direct and general elections for president 
of the country 
gorbachev ducked the question of whether he would run for 
president if the office were up for national balloting 
lets wait and see he told reporters on hand for his 
meeting friday with us secretary of state james a baker iii 
the partys central committee approved the idea of a strong 
presidency at its meeting last week 
but in the text of its new platform released monday night in 
moscow the party leadership left open the question of how the new 
stronger president should be selected 
it said a strong presidency is necesary to ensure stability 
make reforms irreversible make all government institutions 
democratic ensure law and order and represent the soviet union 
abroad 
another key gorbachev ally on the politburo alexander n 
yakovlev said gorbachev was seeking election of a president to a 
fixed term and would empower the president to choose the cabinet 
gorbachev is now serving a fiveyear term as chairman of the 
presidium of the supreme soviet informally referred to as 
president but his real power base remains the party which he 
leads as general secretary but the party post has no certain term 
and in recent weeks party reformers have expressed concern that he 
could be ousted by hardliners opposed to his dramatic reforms 
the party platform called for consolidation of the positions 
and prerogatives of the council of ministers or cabinet but it 
was not clear what would happen to the post of premier that job 
now is held by nikolai i ryzhkov 
the party central committee decision last week cleared the way 
for eventual establishment of opposition political parties the 
party leadership will call on legislators to remove the soviet 
constitutions article 6 which establishes the communist party as 
the leading and guiding force in soviet society 
tass said the presidium headed by gorbachev would ask the 
supreme soviet or legislature to call its 2250member parent 
body the congress of peoples deputies into session in the near 
future no date was proposed 
the supreme soviet reconvenes on wednesday and is likely to 
follow the recommendation of its presidium 
all constitutional questions such as powers of the presidency 
must be decided by the congress which is supposed to meet briefly 
twice a year 
under reforms pushed through by gorbachev in december 1988 the 
president is chosen by the congress 
the presidium said it called for the convening of congress 
because of the debate going on in soviet society about the role of 
the communist party and political reforms 
government leaders want the congress to consider a variety of 
other issues concerning the soviet political system the ownership 
of property and strengthening the soviet government the tass 
report said

eritrean rebels said monday they sank nine 
navy vessels and captured 46 tanks in three assaults on the red sea 
port of massawa in northern ethiopia 
the eritrean peoples liberation front said 21 crew and a large 
but unspecified number of army personnel also were taken prisoner 
during the siege 
the rebels said fierce fighting was continuing in a separate 
attack they launched sunday east of karan 55 miles west of massawa 
it was not possible to independently confirm the rebel claims 
made in a statement issued in khartoum sudan where the eritrean 
front maintains an office 
in addis ababa the government issued no more information on the 
fighting after saying sunday its troops and the rebels were 
battling for control of massawa 
however the government did not directly deny a saturday night 
claim by the rebels that they had captured massawa one of the 
countrys only two ports 
the rebel statement monday said government troops were 
withdrawing from the city but made no mention of whether they were 
being evacuated by sea or were fleeing into the arid countryside 
in their saturday broadcast the rebels claimed to have seized 
control of the 40mile road that connects massawa and eritreas 
capital asmara 
if the rebel claim is true asmara would be virtually cut off 
from addis ababa except by air another rebel group the tigre 
peoples liberation front cut the southern road to addis ababa 
more than a year ago 
the eritrean front did not specify the types of nine vessels 
sunk or tanks captured but the londonbased international 
institute of strategic studies says ethiopia has two frigates and 
21 patrol craft some carrying missiles and torpedoes 
the rebels are known to have speedboats with cannons and machine 
guns 
the eritrean front offensive began thursday after a lull lasting 
nearly a year late last year the rebels held peace talks in 
atlanta and nairobi with former president carter mediating 
both parties agreed to meet again and seek an end to the 
28yearold war africas longest but set no dates 
the renewed fighting around massawa effectively halted relief 
operations by the united nations which hoped to ship most of 
700000 tons of food through the port in the next few months to 
northern drought victims mainly in eritrea and its southern 
neighbor tigre 
the eritrean offensive came as the government appeared to be 
regaining ground the tigrean rebels captured when they swept out of 
their strongholds in tigre in late august and moved south and west 
into wollo showa and gonder provinces 
the tigre and eritrean fronts have different goals but have 
coordinated their attacks in the past the eritreans want 
independence for their province while the tigreans seek president 
mengistu haile mariams ouster and the establishment of a 
government patterned after that of albania the last hardline 
marxist state in eastern europe 
most of ethiopias soldiers are poorly paid conscripts who are 
often shipped to front lines with little training the army 
suffered a leadership crisis last may with the arrest of virtually 
all top commanders following an abortive coup against mengistu

president bush expressed concern monday about 
reports of new restrictions china is imposing on students who want 
to study abroad 
i thought that was counterproductive very much so bush 
said at a news conference that dealt with a wideranging array of 
topics 
china is requiring students to spend five years working in china 
or to pay large sums of money to the government as a deposit before 
they go abroad 
the chinese state education commission in promulgating the 
rules recently said it was acting to ensure that students return 
home rather than staying abroad once their education is complete 
bush said he was disturbed by reports of the move 
i feel that student exchanges are very good things to have 
between our countries bush said i know that some visas have 
recently been given to students so id want to check the statement 
against the reality 
bush last month won a veto battle with congress over legislation 
that would have guaranteed visa rights for chinese students now in 
this country who are afraid to return home 
bush said no chinese student who fears recriminations at home 
will be deported but he said passage of the legislation would have 
antagonized chinese leaders and could possibly have erson the 
longestheld western hostage we are at a loss to understand 
why he is being held 
as all governments have made clear that they are not prepared 
to barter his release we urge all those who have any influence 
with his captors to join in urging his release the commission a 
private organization said in a statement 
the call by the genevabased commission coincided with a trip to 
geneva by peggy say andersons sister who has long campaigned on 
his behalf 
her meetings with international organizations launched a 
threeweek tour of europe and the middle east for talks with global 
leaders in a new effort to win his release 
the jurists commission winner of several international human 
rights awards appealed on humanitarian grounds to those who are 
holding him to set him free 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press was kidnapped on a beirut street march 16 1985 like most 
of the 17 other western hostages in lebanon he is believed to be 
held by proiranian shiite moslem extremists 
the international commission of jurists appeal also urged 
freedom for all other hostages in lebanon it specifically 
mentioned the latest two emanuel christen and elio enrique health 
professionals working for the allswiss international committee of 
the red cross who were kidnapped last october 
my heart goes out to the families of the swiss hostages 
said say of cadiz ky i know they share our sense of outrage 
and frustration 
say held talks monday with international commission of jurists 
and red cross officials she also met morris abram the us 
ambassador to the un human rights commission and other 
international bodies in geneva 
she next meets pope john paul ii in the vatican on wednesday 
continuing what she calls a journey of peace reconciliation and 
hope 
say also will also be visiting the archbishop of canterbury 
robert runcie in london the european parliaments committee on 
human rights in strasbourg france and un educational 
scientific and cultural organization director federico mayor in 
paris 
she said she also hopes to see soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and iranian leaders 
iranian officials have not responded to efforts to arrange a 
meeting sheikh mohammad hussein fadlallah the spiritual head of 
hezbollah believed to be an umbrella group for shiite moslem 
kidnappers refused to meet outside lebanon 
say who has traveled widely to seek her brothers release is 
being accompanied by her husband and ap executives

and so i dont want to buy into any real hypothesis on what 
might happen but i think we ought to applaud the fact that the 
soviets demonstrated a real flexibility on this question that we 
didnt think they had a few months ago 
q can i just follow do you now think then that german 
reunification is unstoppable and that gorbachev will backoff his 
demand 
bush well i think again id just refer it to the will of the 
people there and it seems to be moving very fast in that direction 
q so what is your visceral reaction to the resignation of ariel 
sharon and its effect on the peace process and is this part of a 
pattern of the hardliners losing out around the world 
bush you know i just heard about this and i have to 
understand more about what went on there but mr shamir was a 
proponent of these talks and if this clears the way for the talks 
to go forward that would be in keeping with us policy 
q when you talked with mr de klerk and mr mandela did you 
talk about democracy and freedom did you make the point that in 
our understanding of democracy the majority rules 
bush we didnt go in yeah 
q i especially was wondering about de klerk or will you talk 
with him about that when he comes 
bush i am sure we will and with mr mandela but that did not 
come up in these conversations none o the detail here on the 
various sanctions or anything of that nature came up 
q is that what you would tell him its de klerk im speaking 
of 
bush well lets wait and see what happens when he gets here 
q sir we have a big problem in this country with the bases 
that we have being closed and the tens of thousands of personnel we 
have to let go out of the military and out of the civilian roles 
too i wonder if you would be for taking these military bases and 
turning them into prisons rather than building new prisons and if 
youd be for using the extra housing for the homeless 
bush well sarah let me say this that when military bases 
close various communities historically seem to prosper and i 
think of one in waco texas where a base was closed it was oh 
years ago all kinds of speculation that this would be the end of 
the world and then gradually found out that it doesnt work that 
way and so i think there will be socially redeeming uses for 
these benefits that municipalities and county governments and 
others may these bases that these entities may want to use them 
for and so i would say that its a good question because we can 
say to others this is not the end of the world but let me say on 
base closings i these suggested closings were made without 
political favor and i would hope that we could get the congress 
convinced that the ageold adage cut here cut there but dont 
cut in my district could be laid aside now and i hope that 
thats what will prevail i said out there in san francisco that 
instant doves become feathery instant hawks on base closings if 
only its in their district and i want to see that change and 
ive got to convince these folks that we are not doing this in some 
vindictive political way were doing it to try to accommodate to 
what will be a new kind of defense force in this country 
q mr president i wonder if you could clarify your position on 
your hopes for the june summit is it your view that it may be 
possible there if not necessarily to sign formal treaties but to 
substantially complete the cfe and the start and even maybe the 
chemical 
bush chemical id hope wed be substantially completed is a 
good way to phrase it 
q you your assistant secretary for africa seems to suggest 
that some sort of gestures were now needed toward south africa has 
there been any discussion of that or have you pretty much ruled it 
out any concrete move until the state of emergency is lifted 
bush well we have certain provisions in the law that have to 
be met but i would hope people would see the invitation to mr de 
klerk as a certainly as a gesture but one that will have after 
the discussions with him i think considerable more substance too 
q can you support a situation back to germany where there is 
membership lets say political membership in nato but not a 
military relationship that exists now with the possibility of no 
foreign troops on german soil and a unified germany 
bush i dont think were contemplating a neutralized germany 
and i have stated my position in terms of the alliance and thats 
the way we view it and im sure thats the way our allies look at 
it 
q could i ask how since you had mentioned that unification is 
a matter to be left to the german people if there were some 
referendum where they wanted a configuration without foreign troops 
on german soil how would you deal with it 
bush i would cross that bridge when i came to it but i would 
point out that helmut kohl to his credit is not considering that 
q mr president in a different hemisphere over the past 
couple of months when asked why youre going to cartagena this 
week youve said want to show support for the government down 
there now as youre just a couple of days away do you expect to 
do anything more than that than show the flag do you expect 
anything concrete to come out of it perhaps increased use of 
military down there

a manhunt for five men including three 
convicted murderers who escaped from a maximumsecurity state 
prison focused on the chicago area monday 
a sixth escapee was captured late sunday near his cousins home 
in chicago and the five still at large described as extremely 
dangerous were believed to have also headed for the city said 
corrections spokesman nic howell 
the inmates who escaped sunday from the joliet correctional 
facility may have ties to chicago or may simply hope to lose 
themselves in the large metropolitan area he said 
we have no reason to think that these guys are out of state or 
are not in the general vicinity of chicago howell said but 
authorities have no specific leads he said noting the recaptured 
inmate had provided little information 
nothing has panned out yet howell said 
early sunday morning the inmates apparently cut through bars on 
their cells broke a window and cut through bars outside it then 
climbed a low fence and fled the northern illinois prison 
undetected howell said 
about 100 corrections officers and officials were involved in 
the case either helping with the search or the internal 
investigation and security review at the prison 
the prison houses 1300 inmates 500 more than it was intended 
to hold but howell said he didnt know if the crowded conditions 
contributed to the escape 
the six prisoners were last accounted for at 455 am sunday 
the escape was discovered when a headcount came up short at 7 am 
howell said 
the men escaped from segregation cells where they were being 
kept because of disciplinary problems he said four of the men 
were doubled up two to a cell and the other two were alone in 
their cells 
tommy munoz of chicago was captured just after 530 pm sunday 
by prison authorities who had staked out his cousins house on the 
citys southwest side about 40 miles east of the prison howell 
said 
munoz was returned to the joliet where he was serving a 
twoyear sentence for narcotics violations and intimidation the 
spokesman said 
still at large were 
daniel johnson 24 of burns tenn imprisoned for murder 
james f allen 40 of chicago imprisoned for three murders 
dave rodriguez 21 of chicago imprisoned for murder 
terry w colburn 21 of bloomington imprisoned for burglary

the family of robert schmertz a former owner of 
the boston celtics basketball team has been awarded more than 5 
million because of schmertzs death due to negligence following 
brain surgery 
almost 13 years after the malpractice lawsuit was filed a jury 
in manhattans state supreme court awarded 4 million to schmertzs 
widow phyllis who lives in florida 
the jury also awarded 500000 to each of his two mentally 
handicapped children ronald and jane who live at the woods school 
in langhorne pa and it gave 50000 to his third child nancy 
who lives in manhattan the children are schmertzs from a previous 
marriage 
the award will be paid by columbiapresbyterian hospital where 
schmertz 48 had surgery july 15 1975 for cranial bleeding due 
to a congenital condition said steve mangione spokesman for 
schmertzs lawyer thomas moore 
the hospitals lawyer luke pittoni could not be reached for 
comment monday but mangione said hospital lawyers said they would 
appeal the verdict 
schmertzs operation was a success but the jury found that the 
anesthesiologist dr richard matteo and others were negligent 
because they failed to monitor schmertzs heart and breathing 
properly in the recovery room mangione said 
shortly after entering the recovery room mangione said 
schmertz vomited and aspirated the vomit into his lungs further 
compromising his breathing he lapsed into a coma and died july 23 
eight days later mangione said 
the hospital said it was unable to produce records and xrays 
that documented what happened to schmertz mangione said 
he said moore felt it was more than a coincidence that the two 
crucial xrays and the documentation were missing 
however on the eve of the trial columbiapresbyterian brought 
in a videotape of the schmertz operation which the hospital said 
would show that the surgeon james macmurtrey caused schmertzs 
death mangione said 
but moore observed that the hospital had been using that video 
for 13 years to instruct surgical residents in how to perform 
correctly the procedure done on schmertz 
macmurtrey was eventually removed from the case as a defendant 
the jury ruled friday following a threeweek trial and two days 
of deliberations 
schmertz owned the celtics from 1972 to 1975 mangione said he 
was also a part owner of the hartford whalers and a cofounder of

a national dairy organization said monday the 
bush administrations farm bill proposals would mean hardships for 
milk producers and consumers 
the bush proposal announced last week would continue the 
agriculture departments current basic milk price support formula 
but also seeks more flexibility in adjusting supports in line with 
market conditions 
this plan would only create more instability in the dairy 
industry with wilder swings in consumer prices and the loss of 
dairy farmers throughout the country said tom camerlo president 
of the national milk producers federation 
camerlo said in the federations newsletter that the plan 
amounts to even more and deeper price cuts for dairy farmers 
than allowed by the current law

bush well i do think that we want to support mr barco a 
courageous leader and i think going there will certainly indicate 
how strongly i feel about that but i think there will be more than 
that come out of it i hope we can get agreement in terms of 
support for the antinarcotics efforts in these three countries 
peru bolivia and colombia 
what was the last part 
q anything in particular like the increased use of the 
military the plan that seemed to have been scuttled earlier to use 
us warships off the coast of colombia 
bush well what happened on that plan was some mischievous 
stories that suggested blockade so one of the things ill try to 
do because there was never any intention of a blockade 
absolutely absurd and yet that threw a panic amongst many of the 
colombians who said we dont want a blockade off our coast 
and that wasnt what ever had been intended but in terms of 
interdiction what id like to convince them is that we can be 
extraordinarily helpful particularly to colombia in their 
courageous fight against narcotraffickers by a sophisticated 
interdiction effort 
q mr president on the same subject some observers and some 
headlines recently have talked about were winning the war on 
drugs and i believe your last statement you said were just 
starting on the war on drugs 
bush starting to win 
q were starting to win 
bush combine the two statements well meld them 
q what as you head for the drug summit what will you tell the 
other leaders about the status of the war on drugs in this country 
bush ill tell one of the points ill emphasize at the 
beginning is look i know you three leaders think that this is all 
the fault not entirely but a lot of the fault because of the 
demand in the united states and let me assure you were not just 
talking about interdiction were not just talking about anticrime 
aspects of this in the united states were talking about major 
efforts on the demand side a major initiative and a lot of it 
most of it is out in the private sector in the schools to educate 
people against the use of narcotics because they think that its 
all that the united states is causing all this problem 
its changed a little bit because some of them are beginning to 
see user problems inside their own countries or neighboring 
countries or countries that have crossed the ocean even so i 
think weve got to convince them that we are going out on all 
fronts and i think i can do that 
q as a followup sir theyre from what weve have heard 
going to ask you for more money for crop substitution to 
substitute other goods for the coca crop down there will the us 
put its money where its mouth is on that 
bush well well listen to what they have to say on it but 
they should ought not to be condoning the growth of crops that 
are illegal in some areas and certainly crops that are clearly 
used in the cocaine trade and so thats a moral question id try 
to put it on that kind of emphasis and then see what we can do 
over here in terms of trying to help financially 
q you said that eastern european countries want the soviet 
troops to leave and youve also pointed to the progress in talks 
about conventional force reductions but the fact of the matter is 
virtually all those soviet troops are still there now in eastern 
europe 
bush yes 
q can you point to any real progress on the ground in terms of 
any changes in soviet troop deployments in eastern europe and to 
what extent do you see the continued threat for reversals 
politically inside the east bloc that could cause those troops to 
continue to be deployed 
bush to be wanted i cant see a political change inside the 
eastern european countries that would have an invitation go out to 
please remain i dont see any politics or any political changes 
that would make me think that that is a likely a likely scenario 
right now but and i do think that you put your finger on 
something they have not i dont know i was looking for brent to 
see if any have been pulled back at all 
gen brent scowcroft yes they have 
bush and he says some have so well have to get you the 
information on exactly what withdrawals have taken place 
qmr president do you have a date for the summit with mr 
gorbachev yet 
bush i dont think weve set the exact date 
q mr president when you won the china veto vote you said 
there were signs things were easing up in beijing now they say 
they want before students can leave the country to study abroad 
theyll have to spend five years at work isnt this backsliding 
or is there some evidence that you have that things are easing up 
in china 
bush well im disturbed by that statement i dont like that 
statement because i feel that student exchanges are very good 
things to have between our countries i know that some visas have 
recently been given to students so id want to check the statement 
against the reality i know that some students over there have been 
issued visas to come to the united states but i saw the statement 
and if you just want me to comment on the statement i thought that 
was counterproductive very much so 
q mr president has the current oil spill in southern 
california in any way changed your thinking about the wisdom of 
further development of offshore oil lease sales and what is your 
timetable for when youre going to make the decision on those lease 
sales

president bush said monday that he hasnt 
decided whether to open new tracts off california and florida to 
oil drilling but he defended offshorewell safety and said the 
country needs oil 
i have said that were not going to have drilling in highly 
environmentally sensitive places but ill be darned if i think we 
ought to shut down all offshore drilling everywhere bush said at 
a news conference 
he questioned the logic of drilling opponents in california who 
believe their case was bolstered by last weeks oil spill off 
huntington beach when a tankers anchor gashed a hole in its side 
a freighter or tanker has a hole punched in it and i see a 
whole bunch of guys jumping up and down saying this proves you 
cant have any offshore drilling said bush a former oilman 
im not sure i understand the connection 
i dont see that a spill from a tanker really has much to do 
with whether you can drill an offshore well safely because its 
going on all the time 
this country depends on it we depend on offshore oil 
domestically for our own energy requirements he said it 
reinforces my view that weve got to be very careful about leasing 
in sensitive areas even though theres no connection between a 
tanker spill and a drilling of a well 
bush said he had read the recommendations of an administration 
task force on whether to lift the moratorium on drilling in 
sensitive tracts off the coast of california and florida and that 
his decision would come fairly soon

bush you know i saw somebody a freighter or tanker has a 
hole punched in it and i see a bunch of guys jumping up and down 
saying this proves you cant have any offshore drilling im 
saying to myself im not sure i understand the connection between 
tankers do they want to cut off all tankers or do we just want 
to do our level best to make tankering safer i have said that 
were not going to have drilling in highly environmentally 
sensitive places but ill be darned if i think we ought to shut 
down all offshore drilling everywhere 
and i dont see that that that a spill from a tanker really 
has much to do with whether you can drill an offshore well safely 
because its going on all the time and this country depends on it 
we depend a lot on offshore oil in domestically for our own 
for our own energy requirements but i tell you what it does do 
it reinforces my view that weve got to be very careful about 
leasing in sensitive areas even though theres no connection 
between a tanker spill and a drilling of a well 
q but when do you plan to make your decision on those lease 
sales 
bush fairly soon ive read the recommendations and the report 
it should be fairly soon 
q mr president did mr mandela and mr de klerk accept your 
invitations and if so when are they coming 
bush i felt i have to go back and look at my notes but i 
felt they accepted in principle both of them i think mr mandela 
said he wanted to talk i thought he said to his executive council 
or something but anyway he had to he wanted to talk to some 
others that came first you know right out of the first few 
hours i must say he seemed very pleased at that and i think mr 
de klerk the same way but there isnt there wasnt any time set 
on either of those invitations 
q mr president is this the time to reexamine the flexible 
response doctrine of nato and particularly the wisdom of 
continuing work on the lance missile 
bush well that decision will not be taken until 1992 that was 
an agreement between all the nato partners and i see nothing to 
change that at this point 
q but could i just follow up how can you under current 
circumstances justify deployment of the lance which would hit with 
nuclear warheads east germany perhaps poland and czechoslovakia 
bush if you have these dramatic changes get effected then you 
take a look at all these considerations thats what id say 
q you spoke a lot about troop cuts but nobody is explaining 
how these soldiers would physically how tens of thousands of 
soldiers would physically be removed from the armed services what 
are your suggestions 
bush i was talking to marlin when i should have been listening 
excuse me what was your question the first part of it 
q a lot of people are talking about troop cuts but you have 
not proposed a way to get several thousand lots many thousands 
of soldiers out of the armed services how do you propose getting 
people out of uniform force a lot of them into retirement 
bush well i tell you in our defense budget we did propose 
reductions theyll come up over the years not necessarily all at 
once 81000 troops two active army divisions and then some 
two battleships 14 b52s all of which have personnel with them 
m1 tanks maverick missiles sea launch system apache helicopter 
several different systems that will eventually result in lower 
personnel maybe im missing the question 
q youre only talking about reducing forces by attrition 
bush oh i would hope a lot of it could be done by attrition 
because of the highly trained dedicated men and women in the air 
in the armed forces i would hope a lot could you have high you 
know relatively high attrition rates in spite of pretty good 
retention but theres still attrition and i would like to think 
that a kid that went in to make a career out of this would not be 
unceremoniously dumped from the armed services 
no thats a good point but id and id hope i would hope 
that attrition can take care of the cuts that inevitably will be 
coming 
im told by marlin that this has got to be the last one 
q mr president what role did antiapartheid demonstrations in 
this country play in the release of nelson mandela and other 
political prisoners 
bush i dont know because you had antiapartheid 
demonstrations in many countries so i think i think if people 
get the feeling in south africa that apartheid itself is abhorrent 
to the united states through whatever way they get that feeling 
whether its a statement by the president whether its some 
legislative action or whether its some demonstration thats 
helpful but i cant help you on how you would quantify that

toy sales should grow moderately this year 
industry officials forecast monday as the business builds on 
1989s momentum and traditional american toymakers learn to cope 
with the video game craze 
industry officials provided the outlook on the opening day of 
annual american international toy fair which started its 10day 
run amid a bevy of colorful characters aimed at catching the 
attention of an estimated 20000 buyers from stores around the 
country and abroad

activists protesting war toys got some good news the industry 
reported sales of makebelieve guns weapons and accessories fell 
last year by 125 percent

kristi kari and jami chikaraishi helped the company introduce a 
new quints line of small dolls five to a set 
police were called in to control a crowd of young fans outside 
the hasbro inc building where the new kids on the block appeared 
to pitch dolls based on the singing group 
such promotions are commonplace at toy fair where each year 
thousands of toys make their debut many many will never make it 
to store shelves 
amid the publicity stunts the industry reported business 
improved moderately in 1989 similar results are expected this 
year depending on whether video games lose some of their following 
jack stoneman chairman of the toy manufacturers of america 
inc sponsors of the trade show said retail toy sales totaled 
about 134 billion in 1989 up from 1275 billion in 1988 the 
associations figures dont include the 3 billion or so pulled in 
by video games last year 
this years retail toy sales will rise by 4 percent to 6 
percent stoneman told a news conference 
competing with video games has been one of the biggest 
challenges for toymakers 
some of them have taken an ifyoucantbeatthemjointhem 
approach by offering software and accessories for use with the 
nintendo entertainment system and other machines companies also 
are emphasizing lowerpriced toys to attract dollars left over 
after video game purchases 
association officials and company executives were reluctant to 
speculate on whether the video game boom would end soon 
alan g hassenfeld chairman and chief executive officer of 
hasbro the countrys largest toy company said the industry has 
adapted 
all of us are learning to coexist with video games he said 
in an interview the cold war is over with video 
meanwhile the toy industry is looking to europe as a possibly 
lucrative market but prospects for business in eastern europe are 
unclear 
stoneman speaking at the news conference said eastern 
europe now presents all of us with a unique set of 
opportunities the potential for growth there is simply 
staggering 
hassenfeld of hasbro however said cultivating the east 
european market would take time and the first step will be the 
establishment of factories in countries there to support economic 
development and raise incomes 
while europe overall has fabulous growth potential 
hassenfeld said the eastern european market i think is a 
different story i think there is honestly too much being written 
on the eastern european market and its potential

a congressional international affairs expert 
on monday described president bushs andean drug initiative as a 
major turning point in us drug policy but a specialist in 
the region said the policy is doomed to failure unless attention is 
paid to the needs of cocagrowing peasants 
raphael francis perl a specialist in international affairs with 
the congressional research service of the library of congress said 
the bush initiative calling for 22 billion in aid to countries 
in the region over five years represents an increased awareness 
of the economic and trade component of drug policy 
kevin healy interamerican foundation representative for 
bolivia and ecuador on the other hand said we have had 
economic aid and cropsubstitution programs going on in bolivia 
since 1976 if they are implemented with the same kind of 
understanding of the peasant economy and the national agricultural 
problems i think they are doomed to fail 
i think we have got to go in and get serious about not 
economic development but peasant economic development putting the 
emphasis there we have had economic development before but it 
seldom gets through to the peasantry im sort of a disbeliever 
until i can see that its not just business as usual in foreign 
aid 
perl and healy spoke at a briefing called by the panos institute 
in connection with this weeks drug summit in cartagena colombia 
the organization founded in 1986 primarily by environmental 
journalists describes itself as an independent international 
institute working for sustainable development its sources of 
funds include the governments of denmark finland the netherlands 
norway sweden and britain as well as international organizations 
and the ford and rockefeller foundations 
a study distributed at the briefing said no approach to the drug 
crisis is likely to succeed unless it deals with the problems of 
farmers who grow the coca leaves from which cocaine is made 
the study by patricia ardila a colombian magazine journalist 
who is director of the institutes narcotics and development 
information program said cocaine money plays a vital role in 
helping to cushion the economic crisis facing bolivia and peru due 
to debt and structural adjustment and in contributing to 
colombias healthier economic performance 
at the same time the study said traditional or new elites 
are amassing immense fortunes through cocaine trafficking and 
helping to reinforce the inequalities that have prevailed in 
these countries for centuries 
the illegal nature of these economic activities which makes 
violence the chief means used by traffickers to regulate the 
cocaine business combined with the international response to the 
drug trade which has overlooked the issues of poverty and 
underdevelopment facing coca producers is occurring at enormous 
cost to the andean countries ms ardila said 
whatever solutions are proposed chances are that none are 
likely to succeed unless coca producers can participate in all 
stages of the process to ensure that their economic and social 
needs are met she wrote 
perl whose duties include advising members of congress on 
international drug control said there is no question that the 
us invasion of panama has placed significant obstacles to drug 
policy in the short term 
he said that on a recent trip to peru he expected people to ask 
him about drugs but most of the questions he got were about the 
us invasion that resulted in the arrest of panamanian gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
in the long run however perl said he is more hopeful about 
prospects for us drug policy in the region 
i believe that the bush initiative represents a major turning 
point in us international narcotics control policy he said

former premier jacques chirac has been reelected 
to head frances main conservative party the neogaullist rally 
for the republic but political analysts expect challenges to his 
leadership will persist 
a motion by chirac supporters obtained twothirds of the vote at 
a party convention sunday against an insurrectionist motion 
advanced by two men who served as cabinet ministers under chirac 
philippe seguin and charles pasqua 
chirac 57 who is also mayor of paris then was reelected by a 
unanimous vote for a threeyear term he had threatened to resign 
if his motion lost 
seguin leads a reform movement within the partys left wing and 
pasqua heads the right wing pasqua has urged the party to compete 
with the extremeright national front for votes seguin wants the 
party to lure centrist supporters 
chirac said after his victory that the party which he created 
in 1976 and has dominated ever since would emerge from weeks of 
conflict strengthened and enlarged and ready to fight the next 
legislative elections in 1993 
but newspaper commentators said monday that by capturing almost 
a third of the vote with their motion seguin and pasqua showed 
strong opposition to chirac existed in the party 
they said the initiative now may pass to a more serious 
challenger to chiracs authority michel noir mayor of lyon who 
is expected to launch an initiative to try to form a single 
opposition party with the other main rightwing group the union of 
french democracy 
le courier de louest a provincial daily said chirac had 
scored a pyrrhic victory 
the paper said it is unlikely that pasqua and seguin will 
give up and chirac risks another battle with michel noir his 
problems are only just beginning 
chirac served as premier from 197476 and from 198688 and 
failed in two runs at the presidency he has been notably quiet 
since his may 1988 defeat at the hands of incumbent socialist 
president francois mitterrand 
in issuing their challenge jan 10 seguin and pasqua said the 
party has not recovered confidence in itself and as a result has 
never seemed so far away from regaining the confidence of the 
french people they did not mention chirac by name but no one was 
fooled 
its a struggle for power it involves destablizing jacques 
chirac and myself said party secretarygeneral alain juppe who 
also was reelected sunday

an opposition leader said monday that 
it will pull out of romanias new powersharing government if the 
previous interim government continues to sabotage free 
discussion 
this would throw the country into political crisis said 
radu campeanu president of the national liberal party 
his warning came one day before the ruling council of national 
unity which will run the country until elections may 20 meets for 
the second time 
the council last week replaced the national salvation front 
which took power during the bloody revolution in december that 
toppled communist dictator nicolae ceausescu 
the front was forced to share power with the opposition after 
announcing it would in essence become a political party and 
participate in the elections reversing an earlier pledge to stay 
out of the first free balloting since world war ii 
but opposition leaders say the front is trying to maintain power 
by controlling the new government 
in a related development monday razvan teodorescu a reputed 
front supporter was appointed to head romanian national tv and 
radio the national news agency rompres reported 
he replaces aurel dragos munteanu who resigned last week 
following almost daily demonstrations by protesters who said he was 
too close to the front and the media was being used as a political 
weapon against the opposition 
campeanu said in an interview that he was certain his party 
would form an alliance with the national peasants party the 
largest of romanias revived political parties to challenge the 
front in the elections 
a unified opposition would crystalize the fact that the front 
is in reality the communists and the opposition is the 
anticommunists he said 
he said he also asked the social democratic party the third 
party in romania with historic roots to join the alliance and 
that he had been approached by several smaller interested parties 
as well 
campeanu said he expected the parties to reach agreement by the 
end of the month 
valentin gabrielescu spokesman for the peasants party also 
said an alliance was very desirable and almost a certainty 
social democrat secretary mira moscovici said her party which 
is ideologically further left than most of the others is undecided 
on whether it will join cooperation may be imperative as we are 
faced by a totalitarian threat from the front she added 
several opposition leaders have accused the front of 
manipulating the national unity councils inaugural meeting friday 
to assure itself of a majority of the 250 seats to vote down the 
opposition demand that elections be postponed 
the opposition wants the election delayed until september to 
allow it more time to prepare and to educate romanians about 
multiparty democracy 
campeanu said the hall in which fridays meeting was held also 
was packed with boisterous front supporters invited to create 
intimidation and sabotage free discussion 
he said that if this recurs tuesday we will quit the unity

a federal judge monday delayed the start of 
john poindexters irancontra trial by two weeks and said former 
president reagans videotaped testimony would be taken friday 
morning at the federal courthouse in los angeles 
us district court judge harold greene said disagreement over 
the use of about 150 classified documents the need to edit 
reagans taped testimony and other matters would require delaying 
poindexters trial from feb 20 to march 5 
richard beckler a lawyer for the former national security 
adviser urged that reagan not be questioned until irancontra 
prosecutors completed presenting their case 
im not going to buy that greene said we are going to 
proceed 
greene accepted reagans proposal to have the deposition on 
friday in los angeles but the judge rejected the suggestion by 
theodore olson one of reagans lawyers that the questioning take 
place in reagans offices 
greene said the us courthouse has the necessary amount of 
space plus security for classified documents 
at a hearing greene said it was doubtful he would allow the 
news media attend the deposition 
seven news organizations have filed an application seeking to 
have the questioning open to the media and the public 
the organizations cable news network capital citiesabc inc 
cbs inc national broadcasting co the new york times co times 
mirror co of los angeles and the washington post argued that the 
first amendment right of access has been held to apply to pretrial 
proceedings in addition to all aspects of a criminal trial 
one reason for having the questioning on videotape is so that if 
reagan inadvertently discloses classified information that portion 
can be edited before being shown at the trial 
the news organizations said greene could close portions of the 
deposition if he believed the questioning would elicit sensitive 
information at certain points at a minimum the media argued they 
should have an opportunity to inspect and copy the videotape and 
any written transcript as soon as possible after the proceeding 
meanwhile greene must rule on whether the approximately 150 
classified documents in dispute are necessary for poindexter to get 
a fair trial if he rules that they are necessary and if us 
intelligence agencies refuse to allow their declassification the 
poindexter case could be in jeopardy 
as past irancontra cases have shown it is not unusual to have 
unresolved lastminute disputes over the use of classified 
material there were repeated disputes over the use of such 
material before and during the trial of former national security 
council staff member oliver north 
problems over the use of classified material led to dismissal of 
criminal charges in the irancontra case against former cia station 
chief joseph fernandez attorney general dick thornburgh filed an 
affidavit barring disclosure of classified material dealing with 
cia facilities in central america and certain cia programs in costa 
rica 
irancontra prosecutors are appealing that case to the us 
court of appeals in richmond va 
the prosecution argues that a lower court judge erred in ruling 
that information pertaining to the programs and facilities was 
material to fernandezs defense the prosecutors said the lower 
court erred by not allowing substitutions for the classified 
material proposed by the government

the bush administration is easing away from a 
proposal that would have required automakers to produce up to a 
million alternate fuel cars as part of tougher air pollution 
controls officials acknowledged monday 
when president bush proposed a broadranging program last summer 
to clean up the nations air the centerpiece of plans to combat 
urban smog was a call for legislation requiring automakers to 
provide up to 1 million new cars annually by 1997 that could run on 
fuels other than gasoline 
the cars would be sold in nine cities where smog is worst and 
were calculated eventually to reach 30 percent of the motor vehicle 
fleets in those areas 
but william reilly head of the environmental protection agency 
confirmed monday that the administration no longer considers 
requiring the production of such cars which would use fuels such 
as methanol or natural gas as essential to curbing urban smog 
instead the administration is proposing in negotiations with 
senate leaders that a form of reformulated gasoline which 
would also reduce smogcausing pollution might be an alternative 
to automobiles using nongasoline fuels 
vehicles using reformulated lowpolluting gasoline do not 
require any additional equipment or modifications atlantic 
richfield co already is selling reformulated gasoline in 
california 
reilly rejected sugestions that the change was a weakening of 
the administration proposal to reduce automobile pollution 
there is no change in the goals or the performance objectives 
that we want to achieve but we have tried to indicate more 
flexibility about methods of getting there he told reporters 
legislation before the senate to tighten federal air pollution 
controls does not include a requirement for alternative fuel 
vehicles and instead would impose new automobile tailpipe 
emission controls that the auto industry has vigorously opposed 
but the white house has opposed the additional tailpipe emission 
requirements arguing that an alternative fuels vehicle program 
focused on the areas with the dirtiest air is more economical and 
achieves nearly as much pollution reduction 
some senate democrats have voiced frustration in recent days 
over the changes in the administrations proposal maintaining that 
while the white house opposes tougher exhaust controls it is also 
weakening the approach it is trying to sell as a substitute 
reilly acknowledged that the administrations original proposal 
requiring automakers to produce and sell a specific number of 
alternative fuel vehicles has caused us considerable opposition 
and kept some senators from joining in support 
we have been willing for some months to redraft some language 
on the alternative fuels proposal to try to reassure people that 
we do not prefer one fuel over another as long as the overall 
pollution reduction is the same said reilly 
reilly suggested for example legislation that would require 
all new cars in a polluted urban area to use the reformulated 
gasoline may accomplish the same pollution reductions as requiring 
30 percent of cars in the area to run on something other than 
gasoline

turkey opened sluice gates of the huge 
ataturk dam on monday allowing euphrates river water to flow south 
to syria and iraq 
turkey diverted the rivers main flow jan 13 to increase the 
water level in the ataturk reservoir and finish some construction 
work on diversion channels 
iraq and syria protested that their agricultural land might be 
damaged and their electricity production reduced 
cengiz altinkaya the public works minister said at the dam 
site 60 miles from the syrian border near sanliurfa that the 
diversion channel opened monday was closed in july 1988 and work 
also was done on a second channel closed in may his remarks were 
carried by the semiofficial anatolia news agency 
ataturk dams reservoir has three main diversion channels the 
third was blocked last month and will not be opened for some time 
the agency report said 
during the cutoff period syria and iraq got water from 
downstream tributaries of the euphrates but the flow was reduced 
to about onefifth the usual 500 cubic meters per second altinkaya 
said average flow was being resumed monday 
the euphrates originates in the mountains of eastern turkey and 
flows 1460 miles through syria and iraq to confluence with the 
tigris river and persian gulf 
anatolia quoted officials at the dam as saying about 25 billion 
cubic meters of water had accumulated in the ataturk reservoir 
whose full capacity is nearly 20 times that

prices monday breaking shop windows blocking highways and 
fighting police news agencies reported

into the center of akhisar 320 miles southwest of ankara and 
broke the windows of the tobacco shops and the state cigarette 
monopoly building 
the farmers threw stones at police trying to disperse the crowd 
and police arrested an undetermined number hurriyet reported 
support prices are what stateowned cigarette factories will pay 
for the next tobacco crop because cigarette production is a 
virtual government monopoly they also determine the freemarket 
price 
this years support price was set 54 percent higher than for the 
last crop but farmers complain that it falls short of the 65 
percent annual inflation rate

a leadership meeting of prime minister 
yitzhak shamirs likud bloc broke down in chaos and shouts of anger 
monday after shamir called for a vote of confidence in his plan for 
palestinian elections 
shamir stormed out of the session of the likud central committee 
after getting into a shouting match with his hardline party rival 
trade minister ariel sharon who said he would resign to protest 
shamirs policies 
shamir later claimed in a radio interview that he had received a 
large show of support 
the chaotic results left the already stalled middle east peace 
process in even worse shape and raised doubts about the future of 
shamirs fragile coalition cabinet 
leaders of likuds coalition partner the centerleft labor 
party met monday night and decided not to make any moves that 
would likely break up the government as long as there is a chance 
for peace but a senior labor official said the party would demand 
a new cabinet vote on the peace initiative and could leave the 
government unless it got backing 
some labor members demanded that the party quit the coalition 
immediately because israels peace initiative has been compromised 
i dont think we can continue to live in this marriage 
yossi beilin a top aide to labor leader shimon peres told the 
associated press 
in washington president bush said sharons resignation could 
suit us policy if it led to progress in the stalled peace process 
mr shamir was a proponent of these talks and if this clears 
the way for the talks to go forward that would be in keeping 
with us policy bush said at a white house news conference 
mondays meeting of likuds central committee contained two 
surprises 
the first was sharon announcing his resignation the second was 
the chaotic ending which came after polls predicted a victory for 
the prime minister over his hardline rivals 
the meeting broke down when shamir called for a vote of 
confidence at the end of a speech in which he essentially bent to 
the political demands of sharon and his supporters 
do you accept my proposal let us vote shamir shouted 
but sharon who later claimed shamir had broken an agreement to 
delay the vote until the end of the debate began shouting into a 
microphone for a vote on his own stands 
hundreds of delegates raised their hands amid the chaos and 
both sides claimed they won 
i received a decisive massive majority shamir said moments 
after leaving the meeting of likuds 3085member central committee 
in a circle of security guards 
it was very clear that our proposals were accepted sharon 
argued later in a radio interview 
sharon convened the meeting as a challenge to shamirs 
leadership and his peace plan which envisages a limited 
palestinian autonomy in the occupied west bank and gaza strip the 
likud hawks say the plan gives the palestinians too many 
concessions 
opening the session sharon surprised even his close supporters 
with his offer to resign from the cabinet 
my decision to resign from the government is in order to 
continue the difficult struggle for our national goals 
endangered as a result of policies of the present government he 
said 
as he spoke most delegates rose to their feet and several 
hundred began chanting arik arik sharons nickname 
shamir tried to seize the initiative with an emotional speech 
that embraced most of his rivals stands refusing to allow arab 
residents of annexed east jerusalem to vote in the proposed 
elections and demanding an end to the 26month palestinian 
uprising before peace could be negotiated 
we cannot imagine real political negotiations and autonomy as 
long as attacks and violence continue shamir said 
speaking later on army radio shamir indicated he would accept 
the trade ministers resignation saying it seems natural that 
sharon resigns from a government whose policies he opposes in all 
its aspects 
however the prime minister and his chief supporters said the 
chaotic meeting would not lead to a split in the party 
this is not the end of likud but the end of those who wanted 
to break likud down said environment minister ronnie milo 
but moshe zorenstein a delegate described the meeting as 
being at our own funeral

lowincome district of ein rummaneh aouns command however 
reported the death of four officers and nine soldiers in the last 
two days of combat 
that raised the overall toll to 471 killed and 1702 wounded in 
two weeks of fighting 
aoun moved against geageas rightwing militia to eliminate the 
main challenge to his authority as ruler of the 310squaremile 
enclave home to 1 million christians 
but geageas 6000strong militia which has 30000 reservists 
is proving a tough opponent to aouns 19000 troops in the 
bloodiest intrachristian fighting in the 15yearold civil war 
police said aouns army was concentrating on a new front in the 
mountain province of kesrouan a maronite region 15 miles northeast 
of beirut 
his tanks stabbed into a militiaheld triangle formed by the 
resort towns of daraya kleiat and ajaltoun below the ski slopes in 
the kesrouan mountains police reported 
a spokesman who cannot be named under standing regulations 
said the hitandrun mountain attacks appeared to be softening up 
lebanese forces defenses before a largescale assault to break a 
militia siege of the armys main helicopter base at adma and take 
the whole of kesrouan 
the international committee for the red cross the lebanese red 
cross and christian religious leaders issued fresh appeals monday 
for a mercy ceasefire to allow civil defense teams to recover at 
least two dozen decomposing bodies from the sniperinfested streets 
there was no formal break in the fighting but civilians took 
advantage of occasional lulls to dash across beiruts dividing 
green line into the moslem sector which has been outside the 
combat zone 
the snipers shot a woman running ahead of me said therese 
yakoub after she sprinted 500 yards across the museum crossing the 
only gateway open along the 3mile demarcation line 
poor thing she has five children and she was planning to buy 
bread and powdered milk for them ms yakoub said 
police said at least 75000 christians in the enclave have fled 
to west beirut and syriancontrolled north and east lebanon since 
the fighting broke out 
president elias hrawi appealed again to the superpowers france 
and the vatican to support possible intervention by his 
syrianbacked troops to halt the fighting 
hrawi made a similar appeal last week beirut newspapers said 
pope john paul ii and france traditional protector of lebanons 
christians warned against syrian military intervention 
in washington the state department said monday night it was 
clear that aoun had pursued a violent course and bears 
responsibility for the current round of senseless fighting among 
christians 
the department also expressed concern that aouns actions had 
heightened the risk of greater syrian involvement in lebanon and 
said only hrawi could decide whether the lebanese government should 
intervene 
we strongly support president hrawi it said in a statement 
aoun does not recognize hrawis christianmoslem government 
which is backed by syria he also has vowed to drive the syrians 
who support the moslem militias of west beirut from lebanon

a state judge refused monday to drop 64 
million in fines against the united mine workers raising new doubt 
about the future of a tentative settlement by 1700 miners in three 
states 
the strike against pittston coal group spread far beyond that 
one company last summer when thousands of miners staged wildcat 
sympathy strikes 
the umw and pittston reached a tentative agreement jan 1 but 
union leaders said they wouldnt put the contract to a vote of the 
rank and file until all legal action connected with the strike is 
settled 
both the union and the company had asked circuit court judge 
donald mcglothlin to drop the fines but on monday he refused the 
judge gave the union an additional 10 days to come up with new 
arguments in favor of dropping the fines imposed for a variety of 
illegal strike activities 
uwm general counsel robert stropp said union leaders would 
reassess their decision to withhold a vote on the tentative 
contract asked if there may be a vote even if mcglothlin upholds 
the fines stropp said i think that is going to have to be part 
of the assessment 
the union has said it would appeal a decision to impose the 
fines 
the union offered to have its 1700 striking miners in virginia 
west virginia and kentucky perform 10000 hours of community 
service over 30 days if the fines are waived mcglothlin rejected 
the offer monday calling it an affront to this court 
the judge said dropping the fines would send the wrong message 
to the community and to future strikers 
mcglothlin said it would convince people that mass 
violations of the law are a valid means of conducting a strike 
he said he knew dropping the fines would make all parties in the 
dispute happy miners would be able to get back to work state and 
local governments would be free of the law enforcement burden 
associated with the often violent strike and pittston would be able 
to return to full production 
pittston attorney carl kindig told the judge monday a decision 
to drop the fines would help bring an end to this dispute in a 
fashion that will lead to labor peace in this area and ultimately 
be in the public interest 
mcglothlin criticized pittston for asking him to drop the fines 
after coming to him repeatedly during the strike asking for harsh 
penalties against the union 
now the same plaintiff says everything is fine and we want you 
to drop everything and wipe the slate clean he said its an 
incredible irony in this courts opinion 
the courts are not pieces of a gameboard to be manipulated 
mcglothlin said later 
mcglothlin said there were 263 violent violations of his court 
order restricting strike activities and 137 nonviolent violations 
the fines are the largest obstacle to a final settlement in the 
strike union officials said 
friday the miners who have been on strike since april 5 moved a 
step closer to a vote on returning to work as the national labor 
relations board settled complaints filed by both the company and 
the union 
us district judge glen williams will decide tuesday or 
wednesday whether to waive nearly 1 million in strikerelated 
fines he assessed against the union 
both judges issued the fines for violations of court orders 
limiting picket line activity and prohibiting the disruption of 
pittstons operations about half of the fines were for violence 
aimed at company personnel and property 
mcglothlin also fined the union 5 million for taking over 
pittstons main coal processing plant in september for four days 
and several million for the use of massive sitdown demonstrations 
and enormous bumpertobumper convoys of cars and trucks to block 
coal truck traffic

scientists gathered to review a 
10year study on the causes and effects of acid rain were warned 
monday that their work wont provide a quick fix for policymakers 
the full story is seldom if ever known about the complex 
issues of environmental science said william rosenberg an 
assistant administrator for the federal environmental protection 
agency 
scientific investigation must continue including an 
evaluation of the control program put in place rosenberg said 
in the meantime we must take prudent actions to protect our 
health and our environment 
about 700 scientists from across the united states and 35 
foreign countries have gathered to review 28 draft reports on acid 
rain compiled by the national acidic rain assessment program the 
program was established 10 years ago by congress and has spent 500 
million investigating acid rain which is caused by air pollution 
and is said to pose the greatest threat to lakes in the northeast 
and upper midwest 
acid rain is a blanket term for a combination of sulfur dioxide 
and nitrogen oxide which mixes in the atmosphere and can fall as 
rain snow fog or dust particles it can make lakes and streams 
acidic and can kill trees 
along with smog acid rain is a target of clean air legislation 
being considered in congress that would would reduce pollution from 
factories power plants and automobiles 
about 1000 researchers have been at work during the past decade 
compiling the reports being considered at the conference the 
documents dont take policy stands 
you have changed the way the world thinks about acid rain and 
youve helped policymakers decide which steps need to be taken 
said michael deland chairman of the council on environmental 
quality 
but he added it is highly unlikely well reach scientific 
certainty on issues like acid rain 
that thought was echoed by james mahoney director of the 
assessment program 
we must critically analyze all our hypotheses but there is no 
way the scientific community can provide a single answer that this 
is the level for reducing industrial emmissions 
most of the reports which are the focus of the meeting have been 
released over the past two months this weeks meeting gives 
scientists from aboard a chance to review the material 
discussions monday centered on acidity in the nations streams 
and lakes based on sampling completed in the mid1980s 
the survey found that 42 percent of the 1181 lakes sampled 
were considered acidic with the most acidic lakes in the northeast 
the upper midwest and florida 
the study also found that 27 percent of the 5506 kilometers of 
streams sampled are acidic most of those streams in the 
appalachian mountains and the midatlantic coastal plain

nelson mandela said monday he 
seeks a south africa that is fair to both whites and blacks and he 
insisted that violence against apartheid is justified 
the 71yearold black leader enjoying his first full day of 
freedom after 27 years in prison defended the policies of his 
african national congress but said talks with the government could 
be held soon 
in the tribal homeland of ciskei 10 blacks celebrating 
mandelas release sunday night were shot and killed by police and 
20 were injured according to the daily dispatch newspaper in 
nearby east london homeland authorities refused to comment and 
civil rights groups demanded a judicial inquiry 
in mandelas hometown of soweto schools were deserted as 
thousands of students marched and danced in the streets 
anticipating his return home believing mandela was due back for an 
afternoon rally tens of thousands of sowetans crammed into a 
soccer stadium and dozens were injured in the crush 
hundreds of youths heading home from the stadium surrounded a 
police van and freed 13 prisoners inside according to gen herman 
stadler a police spokesman he said the officers in the vehicle 
decided not to use their firearms and no injuries were reported 
the activists making arrangements for mandela decided he should 
not reenter soweto until tuesday when a massive welcoming rally 
was planned they refused to disclose where he would spend the 
night although television networks deployed helicopters to pursue 
him 
i am absolutely excited to be out mandela told reporters in 
cape town before taking an evening flight to johannesburg he was 
released unconditionally on sunday 
mandela said negotiations between the anc and the government 
could begin very soon if president fw de klerk continues his 
peace initiative and makes further reforms 
the state of emergency has to be lifted in its entirety and 
political prisoners have to be released mandela told more than 
200 journalists assembled on the lawn outside the official 
residence of anglican archbishop desmond tutu in cape town 
at a news conference in washington on monday president bush 
expressed optimism monday that mandelas release was a sign the 
pretoria government was at last on the way to ending apartheid 
but bush showed no inclination to move quickly to lift us 
economic sanctions 
he noted that he had invited both mandela and de klerk to the 
white house separately with no times yet fixed and wanted to 
discuss sanction provisions with them 
andries treurnicht leader of the proapartheid conservative 
party accused the de klerk government of falling victim to 
mandela hysteria and moving toward white surrender eugene 
terreblanche leader of the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement 
said de klerk is now powerless to control mandela and he warned 
that his movement will protect itself and its property when the 
government can no longer do so 
mandela said whites should not fear the prospect of an ancled 
government 
whites are fellow south africans we want them to feel safe 
he said at his news conference the anc will find a solution 
that will suit both blacks and whites 
the anc seeks a oneperson onevote system which would be 
dominated by south africas 28 million blacks de klerk seeks to 
negotiate a new constitution that would establish some political 
rights for blacks but provide the 5 million whites with some sort 
of veto over major decisions 
police have reported about 40 deaths in unrest around the 
country since daybreak sunday including a clash between police and 
looters in cape town that left one black dead and more than 100 
people injured 
tutu in an unusual move issued a statement deploring the 
looting and refraining from criticism of the police other 
activists appealed to blacks to welcome mandela in a dignified 
nonviolent manner 
at midday monday a white security guard in johannesburg killed 
a man who was among a group of blacks that chased and cornered him 
carrying bricks and clubs police said the group had been chanting 
slogans welcoming mandelas release the police said 
in cape town a bomb blast damaged a ticket office at a stadium 
where an english cricket team is due to play this week in defiance 
of an international sports boycott 
mandela said the white governments intention when it jailed him 
and other anc leaders was that we should be forgotten 
instead his release from prison was covered by journalists from 
around the world as an epic event that could lead to sweeping 
political change in south africa 
mandela said he had been conferring with government officials 
for the past three years on the prospect of negotiations with the 
anc as well as on the issue of freeing political prisoners 
he denied there was conflict between his commitment to peaceful 
solutions and his endorsement of the ancs guerrilla campaign 
i have committed myself to the promotion of peace in the 
country but i have done so as part and parcel of the decisions and 
campaign that have been taken by the anc the armed struggle is 
a defensive act against apartheid 
the ancs bombing and sabotage campaign launched by mandela and 
his colleagues in 1961 has been nearly dormant in the past year 
although the movement has refused to confirm it is scaling back its 
military actions 
mandela reaffirmed his support for continued economic sanctions 
until the government dismantles the institutionalized racism of 
apartheid he also endorsed the ancs commitment to nationalization 
of south africas mines 
he told reporters his years in prison were hard 
i have lost a great deal over these 27 years and my wife has 
been under all sorts of pressure he said its not a nice 
feeling for a man to see his family struggling without dignity 
without a man around 
mandela described de klerk who on feb 2 lifted a 30year ban 
on the anc as flexible and a man of integrity 
if mr de klerk is able to carry the national party with him 
in the new line he has taken then i think very soon we will be 
able to begin negotiations he said 
he said he wanted to travel soon to lusaka zambia to consult 
with the ancs exiled leadership he said he had no right to decide 
unilaterally what role he would play 
the decision to free mandela after a long international 
campaign on his behalf was announced de klerk on saturday eight 
days earlier de klerk lifted bans on the anc and other opposition 
groups suspended executions and announced other reforms aimed at 
clearing the way for blackwhite negotiations 
in the mid1980s mandela rejected offers to go free in exchange 
for a renunciation of violence

britain called on monday for a swift relaxation of 
sanctions against south africa to save president fw de klerk from 
being toppled by a white backlash 
but most other countries said the release sunday of black leader 
nelson mandela was not enough to warrant easing sanctions the 
12nation european community appeared likely to isolate britain on 
the issue and president bush said it was too early to talk about 
lifting sanctions 
the soviet union which armed mandelas african national 
congress guerrilla movement and china joined in international 
expressions of delight at mandelas freedom 
the iranian foreign ministry said mandelas release was a 
token of good omen because it came on the 11th anniversary of 
irans islamic revolution 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
cyrpus said the foreign ministry also reffirmed its support for 
the struggle against apartheid and warned south africas blacks to 
watch out for the tricks of racist agents and weathered 
supporters of the world arrogance 
world arrogance is irans term for the united states 
most african nations including powerful nigeria said the 
continents last white government had taken a significant step but 
should still be isolated however two west african conservatives 
the ivory coast and gabon urged immediate closer ties with south 
africa 
in london foreign office minister william waldegrave said it 
was vital to send a signal to the white community that president 
de klerks steps will find a response from the international 
community 
if we dont provide any response at all you will surely 
blame us when the white backlash sweeps de klerk away waldegrave 
retorted in acrimonious exchanges wth opposition labor party 
legislators in the house of commons 
prime minister margaret thatcher wrote to fellow european 
community leaders sunday seeking an end to a 1986 ban on new 
investment in south africa and to a ban on promoting tourism there 
european community foreign ministers will consider the proposal at 
a feb 20 meeting 
mandela who walked free sunday after more than 27 years in 
jail said that sanctions and the armed struggle should continue 
in a radio interview waldegrave brushed aside the international 
chorus for continued sanctions he said the only countries whose 
positions mattered were the united states japan west germany and 
britain all major south african trading partners 
it doesnt actually matter very much what the distant chorus 
says said waldegrave what really matters is that those who 
have influence show to de klerk that his line is going to get a 
response if it doesnt get a response he will be swept away 
ireland current president of the european community said it 
believed the trade bloc should maintain its embargoes the 
relatively mild sanctions include bans on imports of coal iron and 
gold coins 
president de klerk displays great moral courage but it 
is only a start said irish deputy prime minister brian lenihan 
said in dublin 
other big trading partners confined themselves to welcoming 
mandelas release 
in bonn west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
called it a decisive step and said his government would insist 
on a national dialogue in south africa 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan said it was a 
clear turning point that would allow south africa to move 
toward democracy 
in beijing a foreign ministry spokesman said china welcomed the 
release of a man respected by all the justiceupholding people 
the world over including the chinese people the xinhua news 
agency reported 
in moscow soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov 
told reporters we hail the release of nelson mandela a step 
that should have been taken long ago 
at its exile headquarters in lusaka zambia the anc renewed its 
commitment to armed struggle our glorious peoples army must be 
given all the necessary and possible assistance to enable it to 
enhance its combat capacity anc secretarygeneral alfred nzo 
declared 
nzo made no reference to a call sunday by zambian president 
kenneth kaunda for the anc to suspend bombings and other guerrilla 
actions in south africa but to maintain its military capability in 
case of violence by rightwing extremists 
zambian officials said mandela telephoned kaunda sunday night 
and in emotional exchanges thanked him for his steadfast support 
for the anc 
in damascus syrian president hafez assad welcomed mandelas 
release and compared the fight against apartheid to arab efforts to 
regain land claimed by israel

the soviet union challenged the united states on 
monday to extend superpower cooperation in arms control 
surveillance to the high seas and to space 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze addressing the opening 
of a 23nation open skies conference also accused the united 
states of bolstering its naval strength even while agreeing to cut 
ground forces and landbased missiles 
let us face the truth shevardnadze said today the 
easiest way to launch a surprise attack a military invasion or an 
aggression is from the seas 
us officials dismissed the idea telling reporters in a 
separate briefing that washington was not interested in a naval 
arms control agreement and that surveillance flights already are 
allowed over oceans and in space 
however president bush told a white house news conference that 
he expected a major success on arms control at junes 
superpower summit in the united states 
shevardnadzes tough speech and one by secretary of state james 
a baker iii leveling criticism at soviet positions broke from a 
recent trend of softspoken reconciliation between the superpowers 
the exchange also strayed from he main topic at hand an 
agreement between the 16 members of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and the seven members of the warsaw pact on allowing 
the alliances to survey member nations by air 
bush originally made the proposal in may it includes aerial 
inspection on 24 hours notice to allay fears of surprise attack 
the plan has been promoted as a confidencebuilding measure and 
both alliances have agreed to it in principle 
shevardnadze endorsed the proposal which is likely to get final 
approval at a second conference in budapest hungary this year 
he also announced that an agreement was reached during bakers 
talks last week in moscow to provide for inspections of radar sites 
a soviet team will be permitted to go to thule greenland and 
to us installations in britain while an american group inspects 
the siberian radar station at krasnoyarsk and other sites 
the two sides have exchanged accusations that the 1972 
antiballistic missile treatys limitations on a defense against 
missiles are being violated 
shevardnadze acknowledged last year that some activities at 
krasnoyarsk were illegal and promised to dismantle the station 
on monday he criticized the united states at length for 
excluding naval forces from disarmament talks and for the star 
wars program of seeking ways to use nuclear weapons in space to 
block a ballistic missile attack 
again and again at various negotiations the issue of naval 
arms and confidencebuilding measures affecting the activity of 
states on the seas and oceans is being left out of consideration 
the soviet foreign minister said 
no fair argument is cited to justify this he said 
sarcastically shevardnadze said of the us space program 
they do not just grow chickens 
he urged the bush administration and all nations to join in 
developing a system to verify activities in space 
on the open seas shevardnadze said there should be exchanges 
of information about fleet positions and movements of large naval 
formations 
strong rays of light should focus on the darkest corners of 
military activity he said 
baker meanwhile said positions taken by moscow on troops and 
aircraft still stand in the way of completing a treaty this year to 
limit nonnuclear forces 
he criticized soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for 
rejecting a proposal by bush that would permit the united states to 
keep 30000 troops in britain italy and spain while both sides 
were held to 195000 in central europe 
gorbachev countered with ceilings of 225000 soviet troops to 
195000 us soldiers on foreign soil throughout europe that 
would in effect prevent a us numerical edge because the soviets 
could offset in central europe any americans stationed eslewhere on 
the continent 
bush monday said he stood by his plan 
baker said gorbachevs proposal for equal ceilings had not taken 
into account that the soviets could quickly expand their forces in 
a crisis while american troops would be an ocean away 
baker also criticized the soviets resistance to imposing 
ceilings on aircraft that moscow claims have a defensive role this 
was hardly a step toward arms reduction baker said 
raising the prospect of an impasse baker said disagreements 
over aircraft limits must not prevent us from signing a cfe 
conventional forces in europe agreement this year 
a senior us official suggested however that the issue might 
be finessed by leaving airplanes out of the treaty 
bakers tough approach seemed in contrast with his description 
in moscow last friday of gorbachevs proposal on troop levels as 
very very interesting and close to bushs approach he said 
he would consult the nato allies before giving a us reply 
a response and an early agreement now appears to be unlikely 
before baker flies home tuesday night 
baker and shevardnadze met outside the conference to discuss 
german reunification they set another meeting for tuesday 
baker suggested this scenario according to state department 
officials 
after east germany holds elections march 18 officials of the 
new government would meet with west german leaders to begin 
planning unification 
they would make decisions on the new germanys legal and 
political arrangements and the size of its army 
afterward the united states the soviet union britain and 
france would discuss security arrangements to allay the 
concerns of germanys neighbors 
as sovereign states however the two germanys would have 
control of the nations destiny 
the soviets have stressed those concerns and shevardnadze 
proposed two weeks ago an international plebisicite 
but the state department officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the soviets were quite interested in the us 
proposal and that it had the endorsement of britain and france

prime minister nikolai ryzhkov said 
monday the soviet union is on the right track at the start of a 
radical farreaching process of change despite world talk about a 
crisis in his country 
he spoke at a news conference in bangkok at the end of a twoday 
visit to thailand days after the soviet communist party announced 
it was willing to give up its constitutional right to the leading 
role in government 
ryzhkov then flew to melbourne australia for a threeday visit 
and was greeted by prime minister bob hawke 
he said in bangkok that moscow had laid the basis of 
revitalization and that economic changes had brought some positive 
results although he admitted in some respects we have found that 
things are not moving in the direction that we planned 
he said rival political parties would be allowed to form some 
time in the future although the government believed the party 
should remain the driving force in the country 
but the communists would take part in politics as an equal and 
their leading role would be gained through political struggle not 
by right he said 
of course it is a new thing for us and we are just starting on 
our way but first experience has shown us that we are on the 
right track he said 
he said new political parties would need a legal basis as the 
process of change under way also had some negative implications 
if the parties are for drawing two nationalities against 
each other then these organizations should not be established and 
we shall fight against such organizations he said 
ryzhkovs 50member delegation included deputy foreign minister 
igor rogachev he was the first soviet prime minister to visit 
thailand 
ryzhkov said earlier that peace in cambodia would benefit the 
entire region a sovietbacked government there has been fighting 
western and chinesebacked guerrillas in an 11yearold conflict 
he said the khmer rouge guerrilla faction should take part in a 
meeting of warring cambodian factions scheduled in jakarta from 
feb 2628 the group has indicated it will not attend 
ryzhkov held talks monday with prime minister chatichai 
choonhavan and had an audience with king bhumipol adulyadej 
in a luncheon speech chatichai whose government backs the 
guerrillas praised moscows constructive efforts in helping to 
find a political solution to the cambodia problem 
ryzhkov said the soviets were eager to improve trade ties and 
felt they could offer thailands developing economy expertise and 
modern technology to strengthen its basic industries 
while in australia he is to visit three cities and sign several 
agreements ranging from port access for soviet fishing trawlers to 
commodities deals ryzhkov then is to travel on to singapore

sassounguesso to keep promoting peace in angola and saluted the 
growing health of free markets and free ideas in the congo 
at a state dinner monday night honoring the president of the 
peoples republic of the congo bush said sassou had helped make 
southern africa a more peaceful and stable place 
namibia will soon be independent the new beginnings in south 
africa may help end an old evil apartheid said bush and in 
angola as cuban troops are leaving our search for national 
reconciliation has intensified 
he urged sassou to use his respected voice to pursue peace 
and selfdetermination for the people in angola 
bush said the congo once closely aligned with moscow has 
taken some welcome steps encouraging private enterprise placing 
some limits on the power of singleparty rule and opening the 
legislature to nonparty groups 
bush raised a glass to toast sassous health success and the 
growing health of free markets and free ideas in your homeland 
sassou applauded bushs role in leading the world to a more 
peaceful era saying history will note that the usussr 
dialogue of the 90s helped sketch out the 21st century 
speaking in french the congolese president said may all 
benefit from these trends big people as well as small may 
democracy and freedom be combined with peace and development 
he called life in africa today tragic and said international 
support especially from the seven major western democracies is 
needed more than ever before to ensure our survival and our 
recovery 
earlier in welcoming sassou to the white house bush assured 
his visitor that the dramatic events in europe will not diminish 
us interest in african affairs 
africas our friend and friends dont forget one another 
bush said at a fulldress military welcome 
bush said that despite undiminished us support for the 
unita rebels we continue to hope for a negotiated settlement to 
that tragic war in angola 
bush recalled he had visited africa three times as vice 
president and said he hoped to do so again as president 
some have suggested that events in the rest of the world 
including central europe mean that the united states will no 
longer pay attention to africa i can assure you and everyone in 
africa that this is not the case said bush 
i hereby renew the commitment of the american people and 
government to work closely in partnership with africa bush 
said 
sassou paid tribute to the 200year history of freedom in the 
united states that has inspired so many ideals and dreams for 
mankind he called bush one of the great figures who have 
inherited this rich legacy 
noting that this is africanamerican history month and monday 
was the birthday of abraham lincoln sassou also invoked the 
memories of lincoln and dr martin luther king jr 
their lives their struggle represent for us africans a 
neverending source of admiration pride and hope he said 
both leaders hailed the release from a south african prison of 
nelson mandela 
bush called it another important sign that south africa may 
soon begin negotiating a democratic nonracial society and at last 
be on the way to ending apartheid once and for all 
sassou said mandela was a great symbol of dignity for african 
men whose release ushers in great prospects for the 
negotiations on the future of south african society from this day 
on the congo can look forward with optimism to the future of its 
own relations with south africa 
this was the first official visit of a congolese president 
although sassou came here in 1986 as chairman of the organization 
of african unity the united states is its largest trading partner 
importing 400 million worth of congolese petroleum annually

the rev daniel berrigan and 15 others who 
blocked the elevator doors in the federal building in this city to 
protest us aid to el salvador were convicted by a federal judge 
monday of obstruction 
us magistrate ronald fonseca sentenced berrigan and each of 14 
other defendants to 20 hours of community service another 
defendant was ordered to spend seven days in a halfway house 
because she was on probation for trespassing in an antinuclear 
protest 
this court does not doubt youre sincere fonseca told the 
defendants but you cannot force your actions on others merely 
to prove your case 
berrigan and 22 others were arrested dec 1 in the hale boggs 
federal building after they blocked the eight elevators in the 
lobby for more than an hour 
as many as 100 demonstrators went to the federal building that 
day to protest us aid to el salvador where six jesuit priests 
were slain in november berrigan is a jesuit priest 
of the 23 arrested seven pleaded guilty earlier and also were 
sentenced to perform community service 
bill quigley a lawyer for the american civil liberties union 
said he didnt plan to appeal fonsecas decision 
the trial today showed there is justice and there is law 
quigley said i think it was a technically correct decision i 
think the defendants were correct as well 
berrigan a veteran of antiwar and other protests who says hes 
lost count of the number of times hes been arrested was less 
conciliatory 
i feel the whole thing was a coverup for the illegal murders 
of the jesuit priests berrigan said 
quigley argued the protesters should be acquitted because 
federal law requires that rules governing prohibited behavior in 
federal buildings must be posted in a conspicuous place they 
werent when the demonstration occurred he said 
several of the defendants testified they werent told blocking 
the elevators was a federal crime 
prosecutor patrice harris argued that they should have known 
the one protester sentenced to seven days in a halfway house was 
janet leboeuf she has lost nearly 20 pounds since she began a 
wateronly fast jan 22 at st louis cathedral to protest continued 
salvadoran aid after the six priests were killed 
she said she would continue the fast in jail if she is sentenced 
in connection with the demonstration 
the question for me is not when will the fast end but when 
will the military aid to el salvador end she said 
berrigan lives in new york city where he works with aids 
patients he was arrested last week in new york for blocking the 
doors of the office of us sen alfonse damato rny

mexican officials said a weekend aerial 
survey showed low numbers of gray whales arriving in bays along the 
pacific coast of baja california though usbased whalewatchers 
reported were seeing normal numbers 
only about 20 percent of the normal population has arrived 
and were still concerned said ulises cesena montano 
coordinator of the vizcaino biosphere reserve a favored gray whale 
calving area 
but he said bad weather limited the survey 
the san diego sportfishing council whose members run commercial 
whalewatching expeditions to the baja california lagoons said its 
members were reporting normal numbers of whales 
flyovers of the san ignacio and ojo de liebre lagoons on 
saturday and sunday revealed 90 grays cesena said by telephone 
monday 
jorge hernandez a biologist at vizcaina said he spotted 30 
more of the marine mammals off the coast south of the reserve 
between todos santos and san jose del cabo 
that probably means that along the length of the coast there 
are many more hernandez said 
but he said the number of gray whales normally in the lagoons at 
this time of year ranges from 900 to 1150 
the reality right now is that the population has been held up 
and we still dont know why cesena said 
patricia warhol director of the american cetacean society in 
los angeles which also runs whalewatchers expeditions said her 
organization received reports that the whales arrived in baja 
california in the same numbers as usual 
she said her association calculates that the same number of 
whales as usual passed the southern california coast on their 
migration but they showed up late and followed a new migration 
route 
the migration was two weeks late here and theyre now going 
outside the channel islands instead of through the santa barbara 
channel possibly that makes the trip a little longer and they may 
not have shown up yet ms warhol said adding that weather and 
food supplies can influence migration timing 
cesena said baja california experts speculate that a previously 
unknown cold current called the corriente de la nina might be 
holding up the whales 
the species was once hunted almost to extinction but estimates 
of the total population now run from 17000 to 21000

the coast guard vessel monitor who was 
on duty when the exxon valdez ran aground testified monday that he 
never looked for the tanker on his radar screen before the nations 
biggest oil spill 
bruce blandford testifying in the trial of former tanker 
captain joseph hazelwood on felony criminal mischief and other 
charges said he came on duty 40 minutes before the disaster he 
said he was told by gordon taylor the monitor who preceeded him 
that the ship had gone out of radar range 
blandford said he heard nothing from hazelwood and added i 
wasnt looking for him because he had been lost from radar and i 
had no reason to believe anything was happening other than what mr 
taylor had told me 
he said he went about straightening up papers had coffee and 
did his chores without looking at the radar before he got a radio 
message 
he said hazelwood called to report the exxon valdez was hard 
aground and leaking oil 
did you respond immediately asked assistant district 
attorney brent cole 
it seemed like forever said the witness it took about a 
minute for me to figure out what was going on 
blandford said he glanced at his radar screen and could see the 
marker indicating the troubled ship i asked him are you about a 
mile north of bligh reef and he said yes 
in other testimony two seamen who took turns at the helm on the 
exxon valdez painted a chaotic picture of the minutes before the 
tanker went aground 
harry claar told of being at the helm about 1120 pm when 
hazelwood ordered him to put the ship on automatic pilot he said 
he followed the order and yielded the helm to robert kagan just 
before midnight 
kagan said he knew the tanker was on automatic pilot when he 
took over and cant remember when the order came to go back to hand 
steering he said he and the third mate gregory cousins were near 
the autopilot control and we both reached for it at the same 
time 
then he said he heard three separate commands to go right 
left and then right again in the final seconds before grounding 
he said there was a command to turn hard left and cousins grabbed 
the wheel with him 
i started making the turn and he grabbed the wheel and helped 
make it kagan said i think he was kind of panicking then 
he was kind of excited 
at last kagan said he heard a little rattle bumping and 
the ship was aground 
asked about hazelwoods orders after the grounding kagan said 
he cant be sure whether the captain was trying to move the ship 
off the rocks or stabilize it on the rocks 
i really wasnt sure what he was doing the witness said 
cousins took the stand briefly before court recessed and was to 
tell his version of the grounding tuesday 
during questioning of blanford cole asked the civilian coast 
guard employee what went through his mind at the time of the 
grounding but blandford said he didnt remember 
i did a pretty hard swallow the adrenalin started 
pumping he said he called the commanding officer of the coast 
guard station and told him this was the big one the exxon 
valdez was on the rocks leaking oil 
within an hour he said phones were ringing off the walls and 
the coast guard had begun search and rescue operations 
the exxon valdez was gashed open when it hit part of the long 
jagged bligh reef and spewed more than 10 million gallons of oil 
into prince william sound the spill blackened hundreds of miles of 
rocky coastline killing hundreds of thousand of birds and 
wildlife exxon says the cleanup has cost 2 billion 
hazewlood 43 of huntington ny is the only person charged 
criminally in the case his lawyers are trying to show that the 
coast guards inattention may have caused the disaster not 
hazelwoods alleged recklessness 
hazewlood is charged with one felony count of seconddegree 
criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment 
negligent discharge of oil and operating a vessel while 
intoxicated the maximum penalty for conviction on all counts is 
seven years three months in prison and 61000 in fines 
both blandford and gordon taylor who concluded his testimony 
monday said that even if they had thought hazelwood was off 
course they lacked authority to order him to change position they 
said they would have had to defer to a commanding officer in such a 
situation 
who is in the best position to navigate a tanker asked cole 
certainly the master blandford said referring to the 
captain 
asked to explain he said with reference to a vessel traffic 
controller with radar contact i can only see where he is in 
relation to other vessels i cant see what he can see i know 
approximaely where he is but he is much closer to the locale and i 
cant see what he sees

stbasilelegrand quebec ap usborn phil edmonston 
easily won a special parliamentary election in the chambly district 
monday to become the first politician from the new democratic party 
to be elected in quebec 
edmonston defeated liberal party candidate clifford lincoln by 
about a 70 percent to 15 percent margin according to results late 
monday from nearly all of the 194 polling stations lincoln needed 
a victory to boost his campaign for the national liberal 
leadership four other candidates polled marginal returns 
known as a consumer advocate edmonston overcame allegations in 
the final days of the campaign that he had accepted kickbacks in 
the 1970s 
his triumph was considered all the more remarkable because 
edmonston born in washington dc 45 years ago and a us armed 
forces veteran who served 2 years in panama speaks french with a 
strong american accent the chambly constituency is overwhelmingly 
francophone and traditionally nationalist 
quebec is a province where people are very tolerent said 
edmonston who was greeted by a rousing version of the quebec 
nationalist anthem gens du pays residents of quebec accept people 
of ethnic and cultural backgrounds but french must be first 
edmonston added 
he failed in earlier attempts to get a seat in the federal 
parliament in a special election in 1977 and in 1988 general 
elections 
said lincoln i accept my defeat but life continues

angry black students carrying the banner 
keep the dream alive marched out of selma high school on 
monday ending a fiveday sitin but decided they wouldnt return 
to class when the school reopens 
in another development a federal judge turned down the citys 
request to halt a sitin at city hall in this landmark city of the 
civil rights era 
mayor joe smitherman announced that all schools would reopen 
tuesday but the racial protest that brought public education to a 
halt last week seemed far from resolved some white parents said 
they were transferring children to other school systems 
superintendent norward roussell whose dismissal at the end the 
school year sparked the protests ordered teachers to report at 
715 am tuesday and predicted that about 70 percent of the school 
systems 6000 students would be in class 
i anticipate some of our students will not show up tomorrow 
but we will have students tomorrow and we will have regular classes 
for those students roussell said monday 
more than 100 black students who took part in the sitin voted 
monday night to march to the high school when it reopened tuesday 
but said they wouldnt attend classes 
the students met in the basement of first baptist church while 
more than 300 adults sat upstairs singing hymns 
after the vote roussell told the parents and students it was 
their decision how to react to schools reopening but added i 
didnt come here to be superintendent over empty classrooms and 
closed schools 
us district judge charles butler of mobile after hearing 
arguments partly through a telephone hookup refused earlier in the 
day to grant a temporary restraining order against the black 
protesters in selma 
however he said he would reconsider the order if continued 
protests interfered with school and city hall activities 
on the steps of city hall smitherman said monday afternoon that 
officials felt public schools could safely reopen tuesday i will 
have adequate law enforcement at each school to ensure the safety 
of the children he said 
his statement was greeted by boos from a few dozen black 
protesters in the crowd 
roussell predicted about 70 percent of the students would show 
up tuesday 
about 150 students paraded monday morning from the high school 
to city hall where they briefly packed corridors then most 
departed about 25 adults and students continued a city hall sitin 
that began six days ago 
roussell was reinstated a week ago as rising racial tensions 
forced the school closings but the board has declined to extend 
his contract beyond its june expiration roussell and his 
supporters say the board opposes him because of his race not his 
alleged lack of managerial skills cited in an evaluation 
the five black members of the 11member selma board of education 
announced their resignations after the initial vote not to extend 
roussells contract protesters also want the school board to be 
elective rather than appointed by the city council which has five 
whites and four blacks 
roussell spoke with student leaders of the high school sitin 
monday shortly before their parade 
he felt it was in our best interest to leave plus the school 
board would fire him if we didnt leave said student protester 
latima salaam 
roussell confirmed that the white members of the school board 
threatened to fire him if he did not expel students continuing the 
sitin he said he would not expel them but he did not rule out 
lesser disciplinary action 
joe pickard a white member of the school board and a former 
superintendent said he was not aware of any threat to fire 
roussell if he did not expel the protesting students 
i know nothing about such a statement to him whatsoever 
pickard said 
the racial tensions and shutdown of the school system has 
prompted some white parents to transfer their children 
sandra knapp sewell was among them transferring her daughter 
melissa to prattville im leaving a place ive lived in 45 
years to make sure she has a safe place to go to school said 
mrs sewell 
black student protesters did not immediately say what their next 
step would be most returned to the high school picked up their 
sleeping bags and went home ms salaam said the students would 
meet monday night 
city attorney henry pitts urged butler to issue an order 
prohibiting the protesters from totally paralyzing city 
government he said the dispute does not involve the human rights 
that were at stake in 1965 when the selmatomontgomery march 
helped blacks gain voting rights 
jl chestnut a black attorney in selma said we dont think 
some blanket injunction barring our people from the seat of 
government should be granted he said fundamental rights to 
peaceful assembly would be violated 
by noon after about 150 students marched from selma high 
school all but about 25 adult and student protesters were gone 
from city hall which reopened its offices when the student 
marchers first jammed inside all the offices closed except for 
smithermans several police officers guarded his door

seated in a johannesburg television studio a few 
feet from an african national congress leader south africas 
foreign minister pik botha on monday night described followers of 
the black guerrilla movement as my friends 
the ancs ahmed kathrada released a year ago after 26 years in 
jail said nothing really had changed but he didnt doubt the 
sincerity or integrity of the white government leaders 
his face lined and somber jeff masomola of the smaller 
militant black nationalist pan african congress dismissed 
negotiations as futile only immediate universal suffrage for the 
51 black majority he said will result in the taking over of 
this country by the people who own it 
and veteran white liberal politician helen suzman chided botha 
for making the sort of speeches i made 30 years ago 
all were guests on the british broadcasting corps panorama 
current affairs program beamed live from johannesburg in what the 
network said was the first such appearance by south african leaders 
from across almost the entire political spectrum 
it came a day after anc head nelson mandela considered by many 
of south africas blacks to be their leader was released after 27 
years in prison 
only the farright white opposition conservative party refused 
to come to the studio because its followers object to sitting in a 
room with members of the anc 
conservative party spokesman koos van der merwe made his 
contribution in a separate recording he nelson mandela came 
out of that jail without having given in one inch of his demands 
said van der merwe they are not interested in peace or 
democracy they want complete capitulation of the white people 
no one raised their voices or interrupted throughout the near 
onehour program 
in the studio audience several whites expressed unease or 
resentment about the insistence by mandela that the armed struggle 
should continue some of the blacks wondered why after decades of 
apartheid blacks were now supposed to help allay white fears

what happens when the cheering stops when an 
athlete is told its time to hang it up when the big show is over 
for most its devastating as former tennis champ arthur ashe once 
wrote retirement can only mean we are thereafter lesser men 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
professional athletes die twice 
its so says lee lacy when you are told the only life 
you know and love is over its the same as telling you you are 
dead and gone 
for 16 years lee lacy ran and threw and slid with joyful abandon 
on three major league baseball teams today at 41 he retains his 
athletes physique but has gained or so he says a middleage 
maturity even so he refuses to accept a death sentence 
few athletes ever do especially perhaps prizefighters whose 
overdue decisions to hang em up often are only slightly less 
painful to faithful fans who avert their eyes in sorrow at the 
ultimate ignominy 
but denial extends to less brutal pursuits as well arthur ashe 
the former tennis champion offers an explanation and insists that 
a little like dying is more than metaphor 
we have defined our masculinity in terms of our athletic 
prowess he once wrote and retirement can only mean we are 
thereafter lesser men 
lesser men at an age that most adults consider the prime of 
life 
laying aside the artifacts of their prowess their spikes and 
gloves and rackets is not all they leave behind athletes have 
taken over from cowboys and movie stars and even astronauts as 
americas most glamorous heroes certainly the highest paid what 
they leave is more than a game and the leaving thus more painful 
than for mere mortals 
its the nature of the adulation football star jim brown 
recently told an interviewer its so overwhelming the thrill 
you get the cheers you hear the lifestyle you can afford your 
head gets bigger without your even realizing it 
the years seem to pass without their realizing it as well many 
athletes notably those who play team sports argue that their 
ability to go just one more inning should determine their 
longevity not the presence of some younger hotshot on the bench 
why should there be a cutoff date asks toby harrah whose 
17year baseball career included four allstar games 
harrah lithe and leather tough at 42 recalls the words of 
satchel paige whose playing days some guessed stretched into his 
60s how can you tell how old you are if you dont know 
you have to remember said harrah that our careers began 
not when we got out of college or even high school but back when we 
were 6 or 7 years old so when youre told youre through while you 
still feel fit and confident its like being hit by a train 
toby harrah and lee lacy are two among 200 other former major 
league baseball players who also had once been pronounced dead on 
arrival at spring training camp as in lacys case or when they 
came up with a bum leg or a sore arm or a slow bat 
naturally none of them accepted the verdict as final 
instead all of them heeded a sirens song inviting former major 
leaguers 35 and older to come to florida land of the fountain of 
youth and play baseball once again this time in the senior 
professional baseball association 
the league its first threemonth winter season just ended was 
the brainstorm of an entrepreneur willing to bet as were his aging 
recruits on baseball philosopher yogi berras pronouncement that 
the game aint over til its over 
like harrah lacy insists that thats something a ballplayer 
ought to be allowed to decide for himself acknowledging that 
such a notion probably was a pipe dream well why not playing 
in the majors was a dream come true in the first place he said 
one of the senior leagues luminaries exyankee graig nettles 
is also a dreamer said nettles when he joined the league if i 
can stay in baseball i may never have to grow up 
lacy and harrah both played for the west palm beach tropics who 
wound up winning their southern division title but losing in a 
championship game to the st petersburg pelicans perhaps you 
missed it 
the tropics theme song was a steve winwood tune back in the 
high life again 
its promising words ill be back in the high life again all 
the eyes that watched me once will smile and take me in had 
a forlorn and ironic ring however blaring over the loudspeaker 
before every home game echoing across rows of empty seats in a 
smalltown ballpark that real major leaguers used only for spring 
training 
lee lacy loved the major league high life all right what 
ballplayers call the big show

he traveled first class and slept on fine linen and left wakeup 
calls and dined at tables with tapered candles and oh how he 
savored the cheers cheers of sellout crowds in three world series 
and in the pittsburgh grandstands in 1984 when he led his league in 
fielding and finished second in batting 
my my my lacy said his face cradled in a smile of sweet 
memory 
then last year after 1523 major league games 4549 times at 
bat 1303 hits 91 home runs the baltimore orioles read the last 
rites over leondaus lacy outfielder 
somebody just told me sorry lee goodbye lacy said all 
he left out was may you rest in peace 
but lee lacy found no peace in the valley a valley as dark as 
his prospects for greatness had seemed back in the oakland calif 
housing project where he was raised 
at age 7 learning from older guys he took a match to a tennis 
ball and burned off the fuzz so it resembled a baseball what he 
had lit was a career that would blaze in glory and at a time other 
professionals consider their prime end just as unexpectedly in 
ashes 
i couldnt get over the shock of that lacy said i 
couldnt accept it i moped around i felt lost i was not a 
pleasant person my wife and i started a little telephone answering 
service something to do to feel worthwhile 
but every night i prayed i said lord if there is any 
chance any chance that i can play baseball again let it be 
lacy reflected on his fate one evening in late january just at 
nightfall his long legs stretched out in the aisle of his teams 
charter bus making its way across southern florida out the window 
he saw no bright lights just a weary landscape of flat brown 
canebrakes and dark flat swamps along arrowstraight roads 
was the answer to his prayer then really a minor ephipany a 
deliverance from the stygian twilight into one more moment in the 
sun or was it a cruel prolonging of the inevitable agony 
when they let me go i knew in my heart i could still play 
baseball said lacy now i have proved to my own satisfaction 
at least that i was right when the time finally comes to toss it 
in i will know what to expect and will accept it 
accepting it apparently is more difficult for the superstars 
than for journeymen athletes 
brooks robinson who dazzled a nation of fans with his play at 
third base discovered on retirement at age 40 that the only 
thing worse than being down and out is going up and down and out 
the big thing is that you dont know what youre going to do 
or where youre going to go he said the single hardest thing 
about leaving is that youre leaving a love a passion it was my 
whole life 
a few years later robinson discovered another agony of a 
vanished hero 
on a visit to the oakland as clubhouse wearing a suit and tie 
a clubhouse boy asked who are you 
brooks robinson 
do you play ball 
most athletes try to hang onto the fringes of their sport 
coaching scouting selling equipment robinson and harrah and al 
hrabosky another big name on the tropics got into broadcasting 
but many of the former players lesser lights put aside jobs as 
truck drivers or beer salesmen or telephone answerers to rush 
headlong to the senior league 
pete broberg is a rarity after pitching eight years in the 
majors he went to law school in 1978 at age 30 and began a new 
career he took a leave from his practice in west palm beach to 
join the home team so my children could see me play the game i 
love so much 
most players realize it would take them 20 years to learn to 
do anything as well as they know how to play baseball broberg 
said 
most other professionals lawyers doctors brokers at age 35 
or 40 are just beginnning to feel they are competent at the top of 
their game so to speak the same is true of athletes at least 
mentally yet thats the age athletes are told theyre through 
thats hard to cope with thats the sadness 
rick wolff the director of sports books for macmillan did a 
masters thesis on the problems athletes face at careers end he 
has developed a counseling program that leads the athlete through 
the phases of denial anger bargaining depression and finally 
acceptance 
if the program sounds familiar it is because it is based on the 
model for terminally ill people from the book on death and 
dying 
at least one line from the tropics anthem back in the high 
life again is as true it seems as a called strike 
when youre born to run its so hard to just slow down 
thats the real sadness

like penniless vincent van gogh whose painting 
irises recently sold for 54 million one can imagine john 
goddard sitting on a cloud and numbly shaking his head over the 
price of dying too soon john goddard he was a colonial 
cabinetmaker credited with producing a deskbookcase that sold last 
year for 121 million a record for a piece of furniture 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
fiscally speaking when john goddard died 
his shirt didnt quite meet his pants 
on balance that is he was broke having 15 children may not 
have helped too bad just 204 years later a desk almost certainly 
made by him sold for 11 million plus 10 percent commission 
john goddard 172385 was a cabinetmaker he was also an unsung 
vincent van gogh of mahogany you know die now get rich later 
much later 
in the 1760s goddard thought correctly he was making a 
handsome deskbookcase for a prominent providence merchant john 
nicholas brown he did not know he would also make tidal waves in 
the antique market when browns descendant and namesake sold the 
family heirloom through a new york auction house last june 
the 121 million price tag quadrupled the previous world record 
for a piece of furniture 297 million in 1988 for a louis xvi 
table once owned by louis queen marie antoinette before they 
both went to the guillotine 
colonial cabinetmakers even superstars like goddard didnt die 
rich their customers did instead the goddards served them in 
death as in life eking out a living in between masterpieces by 
making coffins or hammer handles or cheap furniture for export to 
the caribbean whence came their expensive mahogany logs in return 
goddards home one of the many colonial buildings in this 
antique seaport still stands down on second street near pine so 
does his shop still attached to the threestory gableroofed 
house its about as big as a onecar garage if the car is a 
compact 
john alden the mayflower immigrant was the first cabinetmaker 
in the colonies his product was crude as a broadax roughhewn for 
the ages as the colonies prospered hardscrabble utility began 
surrendering to refinement quality furniture became a confirmation 
of status gentility money 
wealth in the colonies concentrated in the seaports 
philadelphia second largest city in the british empire was the 
capital of cabinetmaking newport by the mid18th century was 
growing to 11000 inhabitants had more than 50 rum distilleries 
and a growing class of entrepreneurs who were becoming rich in the 
triangular trade of rumslavessugar cane 
newport also had a family tribe of quakers named townsend and 
goddard three generations of townsends and goddards intermarried 
nuptially and vocationally producing a line of some 20 
cabinetmakers and a golden age of furniture wooden parthenons for 
the drawing rooms of the rich and famous who could afford the best 
and found it providentially within walking distance 
john goddard was born in dartmouth mass son of a shipwright 
one of the crafts along with homebuilding that were to spawn the 
colonial cabinetmakers by age 20 he was master of the sloop 
bashsheda plying between philadelphia and newport in 1746 he 
married hannah daughter of local cabinetmaker job townsend 
goddards brother james also married a daughter of jobs the 
brothers began to learn the art trade and mystery of 
cabinetmaking 
the first good furniture in america was either british imports 
or copied from english books of design such as thomas chippendales 
1754 landmark the gentleman and cabinetmakers director 
gradually each of the american ports evolved its own style 
philadelphias was the most elegant and richly carved new york 
was an unadorned and put it there kind of town and so was its 
furniture boston was already declining as a seaport this produced 
a frugal style that resisted change as well as ostentation and in 
newport which had 67 cabinetmakers during the century the best 
remember were quakers 
the tools of the trade were almost cromagnonian by todays 
workshop standards 
all you needed were sharp planes saws and chisels says 
robert emlen the curator who shipped goddards desk off the 
auction block they finished wood with scrapers pumice and 
rottenstone or sharkskin but for that you had to find a shark 
screws were expensive and they were only used where 
absolutely needed says jeff moore who restores furniture for 
the newport preservation society they used hide glue its 
still holding blacksmiths made files and they had molding planes 
and jointer planes and rifflers and sandpaper made out of crushed 
glass glued to paper they werent fools they did it the easy way 
wherever they could 
humbler woods were used where they wouldnt be seen but the 
visible mahogany surfaces were flawlessly carved and dovetailed 
future cabinetmakers apprenticed for seven years beginning at 
about age 13 after the dog work they became journeymen traveling 
from job to job until they acquired enough rifflers and planes and 
sharks to open their own shops roughly it took a journeyman eight 
days to make a 4foot table six days for a plain desk 22 days for 
a highboy

each citys style became subtly distinctive an aid for future 
antiquarians since few pieces in the chippendale era were signed 
it was an anonymous business presumably because everybody knew who 
made what ballandclaw feet were squared off at the bottom in new 
york carved with pronounced knuckles in philadelphia without 
webbing between the talons in newport 
the townsends and goddards became known for their blockfront 
furniture convex panels surrounding a third concave panel and 
topped with a carved scallop shell a common adornment along with 
stars and radiating suns it was a style that came to newport from 
italy by way of boston 
customarily several crafts contributed to a block front 
deskbookcase the lathe turner the brass hardware maker 
sometimes the carver they would turn over their pieces to the 
cabinetmaker who put them all together and got credit for the 
final product so it was presumably with john goddards 121 
million blockfront desk although he probably did the carving 
himself 
actually no one is positive goddard made the desk it is 
unsigned its a reasonably good bet he made it but were not 
sure says emlen 
aside from the distinctive touches there are letters in 
evidence between goddard and the brown family which was of such 
importance and munificence that the college of rhode island became 
brown university in their honor a 1763 letter to goddard from 
nicholass brother moses accuses the cabinetmaker of being behind 
on an order and of working for another client when he should have 
been finishing browns furniture 
goddard the quaker wrote back hat respectfully in hand that 
moses should understand he had to keep my boys imployd so i 
hope thou will think better of thy friend he went on to describe 
a chest on chest of drawers and a sweld block front which are 
costly and ornimental 
such a costly and ornamental deskbookcase now known as a 
secretary might have sold for 400 pounds nicholas left at his 
death in 1791 a bookcase with books probably the future 
recordbreaker valued at 95 pounds in the widely fluctuating 
currency but it was high for its times 
there were 10 such desks made in all one burned in a fire 
eight are in museums the brown desk remained in the family from 
the day it was made about 1767 in fact when it was moved to the 
ultimate brown home in providence in 1814 it left there only 
twice both in this century to appear on exhibit 
when he died goddard left all my stock of mahogany to his 
sons to be worked up for the support of my wife and minor 
children a year later the newport mercury carried a sad epitaph 
a notice that said goddard represented insolvent all those 
indebted to said estate are desired to make immediate payment 
and so he faded into obscurity 
the desk meanwhile passed down through the eldest brown sons 
gradually acquiring the status of a family icon says emlen 
a pinnacle of the family fortune the browns had the means to 
change the interior decor every 20 or so years but the desk always 
remained 
the desk for years had received little more notoriety than 
goddard himself then in 1913 it was mentioned in vincent 
lockwoods colonial furniture in america goddard became 
similarly resurrected as were his town and his works 
newport had been invaded by the british during the revolution 
four hundred homes were torn down for firewood in the aftermath 
the town languished its motto being eat it up make it do do 
without in this environment old furniture stayed at home and 
out of antique shops but as the mahogany took on the bloodmaroon 
glowing patina of age the cabinetmakers of newport were recalled 
from their graves as craftsmen whose output in quality design 
and originality was unsurpassed by any other urban or rural 
setting throughout the world 
almost 10 feet in height the goddard desk rose above the 
finicky precious details of the auction house catalog molded 
scroll pediment fluted urn flame finials stopfluted 
quarter columns shellcovered prospect door scrollcarved 
bracket foot 
the desk was bought by a leading new york antiques dealer 
reportedly for young members of the wealthy bass family of fort 
worth texas who have begun collecting american antiques 
meanwhile emlen has asked a cabinetmaker in maine to make a 
replica of the desk using the same primitive tools for the brown 
center 
i dont know yet what it will cost but the estimate is 
35000 
roughly 900 colonial pounds say a fair amount of spermaceti 
candles but maybe john goddards hands like van goghs were 
reaching for something far beyond the marketplace

since 1813 it has been turning out equipment and 
weapons for americas fighting men from powder horns to battleship 
guns now with peace breaking out the fortresslike watervliet 
arsenal in upstate new york is once again looking for some other 
kind of work 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
its like ve day all over again for the 
last of the countrys cannon factories 
the easing of sovietamerican tensions in eastern europe and 
expected cutbacks in military spending signal a further eroding of 
demand for artillery made at the 177yearold watervliet arsenal 
near albany the armys biggun shop 
like any military person i welcome peace says col joseph 
mayton jr arsenal commander 
but peace can mean red ink when your job is making the 
heavyhitters that paved the way for american troops in five wars 
and many skirmishes in the last century 
resembling a fortress behind its spiked wroughtiron fence the 
arsenal sells about 150 million in cannons and mortars a year 
mostly to the army it turns out 200 to 250 cannons and mortars a 
month its biggest seller a 120mm gun for the armys abrams m1 
tank which may fall victim to president bushs paredback defense 
budget 
since the last troops left vietnam in 1975 the arsenal has had 
to go out looking for other work says arsenal spokesman john 
swantek 
the plant has made bridges for the marines and its forge can 
fabricate nearly anything out of metal that requires 
highprecision tooling and lowproduction volume mayton says 
one of its hottest new lines are towbars for military vehicles 
a far cry from the 16inch guns the arsenal fashioned for 
battleships in world war ii 
among the last of those 16inch guns the biggest the arsenal 
ever turned out was the one that exploded aboard the uss iowa 
last april killing 47 sailors a navy investigation blamed the 
explosion aboard the battleship on sabotage by a disgruntled sailor 
who died in the blast 
the arsenal no longer makes cannons that big but as long as 
humans know how to make war the demand for big guns will be there 
swantek says 
with all of the euphoria of whats going on in eastern europe 
then something happens like in panama and im sure there were 
watervliet arsenal cannons down there with them mayton says 
about 10 army staffers oversee the arsenal housed in 72 
buildings but the rest of the 2350 workers are civilians an 
arsenal employing about 2700 in rock island ill makes carriages 
for howitzers produced in watervliet 
employment at watervliet peaked at 10000 during world war ii 
a 10year 350 million renovation has brought the latest in 
cannon technology to the arsenal including a laserguided boring 
system and robotics machinery that has automated many tasks 
while that has eliminated the need for some jobs its the 
ebbs and flows of war and peace that dictate employment 
swantek says the arsenal will cut about 100 jobs a year through 
retirements and other voluntary departures so long as the peace 
lasts he says 
a few years before world war ii employment had dropped to about 
140 and there was talk about closing the arsenal and putting 
its 140 acres to other uses says william bradford curator of the 
arsenals museum 
in peacetime people have said say that 140 acres would 
make a nice hospital or a nice school then unfortunately along 
comes another war and people are glad they didnt close it 
swantek says 
the war department opened the arsenal in 1813 to make powder 
horns bullet pouches sword scabbards and other equipment the 
government chose watervliet because of its location near the hudson 
and mohawk rivers from watervliet army supplies could be easily 
shipped to western and northeastern new york where the british 
were likely to attack from forts in canada 
the arsenal was converted to cannon production in the 1880s when 
there were already rumblings about what was to come in europe 
swantek says 
fearing an attack from europe the army ordered large 
longrange cannons placed along the atlantic coast until the 
arsenal began making cannons the armys big guns were mostly made 
by private companies copying european weapons bradford says those 
companies often did shoddy work and to set up its seacoast 
defense the united states needed its own research and production 
area he says 
while the invasion never came the research effort put the 
united states at the front lines of artillery production just in 
time for the wars in europe 
among the arsenals chiefs was col j walker benet father of 
author stephen vincent benet who commanded the arsenal from 1919 
to 1921 the arsenals research center the benet laboratory is 
named for him 
after the wars strained relations between the united states and 
soviet union kept the arsenal forges turning out cannons to defend 
western europe soviet cannon factories churned out their own guns 
to point west 
a drawing hangs in the arsenals quartermilelong big gun 
shop showing a soviet cannon plant superimposed over the 
watervliet facility the soviet plant is more than twice the size 
and its just one of three in the soviet arsenal swantek says 
a past commander at watervliet hung the drawing to show arsenal 
workers that although it was peacetime they still were fighting 
the cold war he says 
with arms production slowing research on improved weapons 
continues at benet laboratory says research director larry 
johnson much of the labs work deals with better production 
methods that could be used in other industries he says 
but the main goal is to build a better cannon which will remain 
a big part of the conventional weapons arsenal for at least 25 
years he says 
theres two ways of settling arguments nuclear deterrents or 
conventional deterrents he says with conventional weapons 
people get hurt but its not terminal to our countries 
if oldfashioned artillery warfare breaks out the arsenal has a 
plan to step up production and mobilize private industry to begin 
producing cannons within a year 
you hope the peace business goes on swantek says but you 
have to wonder how many ebbs and flows will there have been a 
hundred years from now

a move by chrysler corp to cut more salaried 
workers should be well received on wall street today a day before 
the automaker reports marginal or no profit for the 1989 fourth 
quarter an analyst said 
chrysler on sunday confirmed that it had begun a second round of 
cuts among its whitecollar work force spokesman steve harris said 
there was no target number 
whitecollar reductions are becoming a way of life at 
chrysler harris said by telephone from suburban detroit a 
certain part will come through attrition 
auto analyst steve girsky of paine webber inc said sunday from 
new york the news is likely to get a good reception today because 
it sends a signal that they are serious about trimming down 
analysts have estimated that each of the big three general 
motors corp ford motor co and chrysler will report sharply 
lower 1989 earnings compared with 1988 
for the final quarter they forecast chrysler would report 
tiny if any earnings 
chrysler announced a costcutting program last october with an 
original goal of carving 1 billion from its 26billion annual 
budget by the end of this year since then the company has boosted 
that target to 15 billion 
included were the eliminations of 2300 salaried jobs or about 
8 percent of the whitecollar work force automotive news a weekly 
industry journal quoted sources in todays editions as saying the 
new cuts would involve 5 percent to 10 percent of the salaried work 
force 
if the reduction falls between those two estimates chrysler 
will slice 4600 jobs or about 15 percent from its preoctober 
salaried employment level 
chrysler is cutting its costs as the auto industry wrestles with 
a slumping market and too much production capacity in addition to 
the staff cuts the company shut down its jefferson avenue car 
assembly plant in detroit planned to close its st louis car 
assembly plant this september and cut out some expensive incentives 
its a question of can this company hold its market share 
girsky said if youre going to buy market share through 
incentive use lets hope youre a lowcost producer 
gm and ford have said they like chrysler constantly are 
reviewing their employment levels in 1987 gm began action 
plan to cut costs since then its original target has been 
raised to 13 billion by 1991 
ford has no formal costcutting plan like those at gm and 
chrysler 
analyst thomas ogrady president of integrated automotive 
resources inc in wayne pa said sunday chryslers savings must 
be put to good use 
what i would be concerned about is what they are doing with 
the savings he said if it is just to have a better bottom 
line thats not so good 
he suggested that the company funnel the money into product 
development harris didnt say where the savings would be sent 
in other chrysler news sunday dodge dealers said the company 
will do a test production run of less than 100 dodge viper sports 
cars the vehicles a simplified twoseater with few of the 
electronic gadgets in some of todays performance cars was first 
shown as a concept car 13 months ago

georgiapacific corp said today it was 
selling safetypaper operations in vermont and iowa to remove an 
antitrust question in its attempt to buy great northern nekoosa 
corp 
the atlantabased company said it would sell facilities in 
gilman vt and burlington iowa to seattlebased simpson paper 
co for an undisclosed price 
the gilman plant makes safety paper which is used in personal 
checks and securities certificates and the burlington plant 
converts and processes the paper 
in a federal lawsuit in bridgeport conn great northern claims 
georgiapacifics 38 billion hostile tender offer would run afoul 
of antitrust laws in the checkpaper business and other areas 
the sale of our safety paper business is an unwelcome step to 
facilitate our acquisition of great northern nekoosa corp 
georgiapacific chairman t marshall hahn jr said in a statement 
we couldnt risk delaying or losing a procompetitive 38 
billion acquisition because of an adverse court decision regarding 
assets with a value of less than 1 percent of the transaction at 
issue 
the announcement came as georgiapacific and great northern 
prepared to fight another round in us district court in portland 
today great northern was expected to ask us district judge gene 
carter to block georgiapacifics merger attempt as well as its 
efforts to oust the great northern board at a special shareholders 
meeting set for march 2 in portland 
great northern says georgiapacifics takeover attempt should be 
stopped because georgiapacific allegedly has sought to conceal 
plans to sell the great northern mills in millinocket and east 
millinocket as well as 21 million acres of maine woodlands if 
the merger is successful

perrier resumed bottling mineral water today and a 
company spokesman said human error probably had caused the benzene 
contamination that forced the recall of about 72 million bottles in 
canada and the united states 
all tests at the end of the production line have been 
negative spokesman jeanclaude lemaignen said after bottling 
returned to normal 
company officials believe only 13 bottles were contaminated with 
the poisonous chemical he said but the company has said all 
recalled bottles will be destroyed 
exports of the product to the united states and canada would 
resume more rapidly than planned in the next week or two 
lemaignen said earlier the company had said its product might be 
off the market for months 
source perrier sa halted production of its mineral water over 
the weekend and withdrew bottles from north american store shelves 
after the contamination was discovered 
french newspaper reports estimated that the contamination 
problem would cost the company 40 million in lost revenues 
trading in shares of the company on the french stock exchange 
was suspended several times today before resuming just after midday 
with prices down 41 dollars a share from fridays close 
perrier chairman frederik zimmer said human error was to blame 
for the entry of the benzene into the bottling process at the plant 
in vergeze in southern france 
that theory will be confirmed in the next 24 to 48 hours 
lemaignen said 
he said an employee had used a product containing benzene to 
clean some grease from one bottling line whose production was 
destined only for north america 
a spokesman for the french health ministry confirmed there was 
no contamination at the spring from which the sparkling water 
flows the government tests the source regularly and the last one 
was at the end of 1989 the ministry said 
benzene is a clear flammable poison used as a solvent for fats 
and in making lacquers varnishes and dyes at high enough doses 
it has been linked to cancer in animals 
the head of the us food and drug administration said the 
levels detected in perrier pose a negligible health risk 
if i had a bottle in the refrigerator i would drink it 
said acting fda commissioner james benson 
the bubbly water sold in green bottles has acquired great 
popularity in the united states as an upscale soft drink the 
company estimates annual us sales at 150 million 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the agency has confirmed levels 
of benzene in perrier samples at two to four times the 
environmental protection agencys standard for drinking water the 
standard is 5 parts per billion and the levels found ranged from 
12 to 20 parts per billion he said 
the elevated levels were found last month by north carolina 
health officials during routine testing and the fda later confirmed 
the findings 
however nesbit said the fdas health evaluation board 
concluded that there is no immediate health risk people can 
continue drinking perrier 
these are fairly low levels and theres a negligible risk 
involved here he said 
a lifetime of drinking water with these levels of benzene would 
increase the risk of cancer by one in a million he said 
despite the low health risk the company felt its actions were 
needed to restore consumer confidence were in the integrity 
business selling purity and quality said ronald v davis 
president of the greenwichbased perrier group of america inc 
which distributes the bottled water in the united states 
he said the company will offer refunds to customers and has 
established a tollfree telephone line for complaints or inquiries 
we believe our decision is right because we think in the long 
run our consumers will come back he said in the short run it 
will impact us very very negatively

iraqs oil ministry announced it has 
begun production at its southern suba oilfield with an initial 
output of 20000 barrels a day the official iraqi news agency said 
monday 
developing the suba oilfield is part of a major expansion 
program launched last year to develop iraqs oil and gas reserves 
following the august 1988 cease fire in the eightyear war with 
iran 
meanwhile the middle east economic survey weekly oil journal 
said in its latest edition monday that iraq is inviting wider 
foreign participation in oilfield development a major policy 
reversal 
ina monitored in nicosia reported that production at suba 60 
miles west of the port of basra can be boosted to 60000 barrels 
of oil a day and that the field can also produce 20 million cubic 
feet of gas daily 
iraqs oil ministry took steps in november to develop the saddam 
oilfield in saladin province north of baghdad to produce about 45 
million cubic feet of gas a day oil output is 45000 barrels a day 
the ministry also announced last year that it had completed a 
project to expand the alzubair field south of basra to increase 
its production by 150000 barrels of oil a day to 230000 barrels 
daily 
ina said the alzubair expansion was carried out by the state 
oil projects co with iraqi and foreign contractors while the 
drilling and preparation of wells was carried out by the southern 
oil co 
iraqs current oil production capacity is 45 million barrels a 
day but it is observing an organization of petroleum exporting 
countries quota of 34 million barrels a day 
the iraqis however are driving to boost production capacity to 
5 million barrels a day oil exports are iraqs economic mainstay 
and are vital to its postwar reconstruction program 
iraqi oil minister isam alchalabi told the newsletter that 
widening foreign participation in oil development marks a new 
policy under which the foreign companies will be paid back in 
crude oil from the same field after the start of production 
mees said this amounted to a significant decision to broaden 
the participation of foreign companies in the development of 
oilfields in iraq 
it added that the new policy is evidently designed to speed up 
the expansion of iraqs production capacity with infusions of new 
investment and technology given the financial constraints that 
iraq is experiencing in the aftermath of the gulf war 
iraq and other arab oil producers have over the last two decades 
sought to ease foreign companies out 
but the slump in oil prices has limited their investment 
potential and they have recently been seeking new relations with 
foreign companies

nelson mandelas release from 
prison might help ease sanctions economists and financial experts 
said today but they voiced concern about his endorsement of 
violence and nationalization 
gold shares on the the johannesburg stock exchange dropped 4 
percent today and the financial rand a special currency used by 
foreign investors dropped 10 percent in value analysts quoted by 
newspapers attributed the slump to nervousness over mandelas 
remarks 
the initial reaction of the business community to mandelas 
release on sunday was enthusiastic with executives and leaders of 
employer associations saying it would speed political reform and 
persuade some western countries to resume investment 
gavin relly chairman of the anglo american corp mining 
conglomerate called the release a major step toward normalizing 
south africas political life 
but the mood changed after mandela in a hardline speech in 
cape town on sunday reaffirmed his support for the african 
national congress guerrilla campaign against the government and 
for its goal of nationalizing mines and banks 
the nationalization of mines is a fundamental policy of the 
anc mandela said i believe the anc is quite correct in this 
attitude 
these pronouncements were causing jitters and uncertainty 
particularly among foreign investors said an economist at a 
major bank who requested anonymity 
mandelas stance will definitely have a negative effect on 
foreign perceptions of investment in south africa on local 
business confidence and on private fixed investment the 
economist said 
the johannesburg stock exchange was decidely bearish after 
mandelas remarks said a senior dealer at a brokerage firm share 
prices fell slightly today after a strong rise last week 
business leaders remained hopeful that president fw de klerks 
reforms and concessions would persaude western countries to abandon 
or ease the sanctions imposed in recent years as a protest against 
apartheid 
british prime minister margaret thatcher a longtime oppoenent 
of sanctions dropped academic and cultural embargoes when de klerk 
legalized the anc earlier this month and she now wants to end a 
ban on new investment 
britain intends to press the sanctions issue at a feb 20 
meeting of european economic community foreign ministers in dublin 
ireland 
the main eec sanctions which need community agreement to end 
are bans on imports of steel iron and krugerrand gold coins 
president bush has said his government will review existing 
sanctions against south africa but a final decision will require 
congressional approval 
one major foreign company in south africa shell oil was quick 
to identify with black jubilation over mandelas release it took 
out a twopage ad in the sowetan a major black newspaper saying 
welcome back nelson mandela the stars will shine brighter 
tonight tomorrow a brilliant future beckons

to get a rough idea of eastern europes 
rotting infrastructure try riding the creaky bulgarian railroads 
or walking a snowy sofia avenue in the dead of winter 
as most eastern europeans know but many potential western 
investors have yet to find out getting from here to there often is 
a matter of dumb luck 
in the last 18 months at least 30 people have died and more 
than 150 have been injured in five accidents on bulgarias 
staterun rail network the reasons range from poorly maintained 
axles to reckless crews 
its not much safer on the streets this and every other winter 
countless dozens have slipped and broken bones because of the ice 
the bulgarians dont know or care about salting sanding or 
plowing their idea of snow removal is a brigade of stalwart 
lackadaisical women armed with picks and brooms 
underlying these explanations is a chronic lack of investment in 
equipment and an indifferent attitude among workers subjected to 40 
years of mismanagement 
all over eastern europe antiquated cars primitive hospitals 
outdated factories horsedrawn carts poorly lit homes narrow 
roads rickety airplanes and lumbering trains testify to a neglect 
of the basics that westerners take for granted 
the lack of efficient ways to travel transport goods or even 
make a telephone call are frustrating efforts by the eastern 
europeans to transform their economies 
where citizens can help themselves they do in 1989 for 
example hungarians used their own precious hard currency to import 
60000 western cars 
but most infrastructure problems are too big for the individual 
even for the state 
no one knows how much money it would take to bring eastern 
europe up to date in technology communications transportation and 
education almost any data suggest the sum is enormous 
the west german consulting firm axel boje quoted in a recent 
issue of austrias business magazine gewinn estimated that more 
than 85 percent of industrial enterprises in east germany are 25 
years out of date 
the firm estimated 2695 billion is needed to modernize east 
germanys factories and another 359 billion for maintenance 
axel boje said add another 778 billion for telecommunications 
and transportation another small fortune to build 400000 homes 
and the bill for at least 20000 managers to be trained in the 
west and east germany might rival its western cousin 
not even booming west germany has that kind of money for 
countries like bulgaria with no wealthy friends it is even harder 
to modernize its rusting machines or add to the 229 million 
telephones serving 89 million citizens 
new democracy could prove as useless as old stalinism in 
creating economic might 
the main reason for the neglect of infrastructure is 
systemic said peter havlik a czechborn expert at viennas 
institute for international economic comparisons traditional 
marxist theory had it that this was the socalled nonproductive 
area and so very little was invested 
but havlik said expansion needs enormous reserves these do 
not exist in eastern countries thus we must fear that given the 
priorities these countries must make with reforms infrastructure 
again gets left behind they must invest in industry they must 
deal with huge environmental damage and there wont be enough left 
over 
some steps have been made last year for instance the ailing 
telephone network in budapest was enlarged in one weekend 
before that hungarys pioneering entrepreneurs had found 
attempts just to establish offices with western firms floundering 
for lack of telephone numbers 
knowledge of the modern working world is also a problem most 
east europeans receive at least 11 years of schooling and many 
learn foreign languages with the elite of the future attending 
special schools that teach them nearperfect english french 
german spanish or italian 
but while the lack of western distractions and a tradition of 
valuing education may make them fine students it doesnt equip 
them with independent thinking 
decades of isolation from the outside world compound the 
problem giving most east europeans a picture of the west akin to 
paradise on earth with no imagination of the work needed to 
afford the luxury 
total security in the future a promise held out by 
stalinism kills all incentives for dedicated work said ivan 
angelov a communist reform economist in bulgaria after some 
restructuring began in 1987 
three years later morale remains poor a basic problem is low 
efficiency which is pervasive angelovs soviet colleague 
stanislav shatalin stated recently 
even in czechoslovakia where citizens are closer to the west 
both geographically and mentally unsuitable education impedes 
development 
before revolution promoted him to the post of adviser to vaclav 
klaus the new finance minister economist dusan triska pondered 
how to calculate the countrys real inflation rate 
for years it hasnt been properly studied he said we 
must say we know very little about ourselves 
the lack of such basic data hinders any western company that 
decides to do business with eastern europe intricate paperwork 
adds to the frustration for such simple tasks as bank transactions 
or purchases of state supplies 
scarce resources and bureaucratic bumbling present obstacles to 
business and political initiatives alike 
everyone keeps comparing our democratization to that of spain 
after franco said rudolf joo of the opposition hungarian 
democratic forum last summer but its not the same in spain if 
you have money and support you just go and rent office space and 
order telephones

had produced more than 50 million pairs of shoes for 
fashionstarved east germans and soviets 
volkswagen maker of some of europes bestselling cars has for 
nearly 20 years been fitting golf and polo sedans with headlights 
horns and engines made under contract in east germany 
from the bertelsmann publishers supplying book clubs in dresden 
to the asko department store managers in bulgaria hungary and the 
soviet union west german merchants who nursed weak business 
prospects through the frosty decades of eastwest discord are best 
positioned now to exploit opportunities in eastern europe 
while many other european and other countries are trying to 
get their foot in the door in eastern europe were already inside 
sitting on the sofa and having tea jochen degkwitz deutsche 
bank assistant vice president for east european affairs said in 
describing his nations commanding lead 
west germanys boldness primarily has benefited cousin east 
germany and they seem to be moving toward economic reunification 
with stunning speed 
the west german mark for example could soon become the single 
national currency a monetary union that would give bonn enormous 
influence in rebuilding and reshaping the sickly east german 
economy 
west germany already has the strongest economy in europe a 
strategic location as the pivotal point between east and west and 
a long history as eastern europes largest western trading partner 
when finally calculated west german trade with the east bloc 
for 1989 is expected to exceed the 317 billion level recorded the 
previous year it accounted for more than half of all business 
volume between western europe and the east bloc but only about 5 
percent of west germanys worldwide total 
its difficult to estimate the potential for new business and 
industry in a region long locked in the vacuum of socialist 
economics but eastern europeans are starving for products ranging 
from cars to can openers economists say this demand could 
eventually translate into enormous profits for investors with the 
money and patience to endure a transition that could last a decade 
heinrich vogel an economist who heads colognes institute for 
eastern and international studies contends the consumer needs of 
more than 400 million people in eastern europe and the soviet union 
present international business with its best opportunity 
the potential in terms of an educated work force with 
unsatisfied consumer demands and a broad technology gap is 
tremendous everyone is looking for new markets and where else in 
the world do you have a better chance to make money vogel said 
western europe which has more than 10 times the volume of trade 
with eastern europe than either japan or the united states could 
retain its edge because of proximity and shared history and culture 
most of the hundreds of cooperative ventures bringing western 
goods to eastern buyers are between european partners 
philips of the netherlands for example makes videocassette 
recorders with tesla of czechoslovakia while swedens volvo sells 
vans to east germany austrias wienerwald restaurant chain has 
branched into hungary and a handful of western automakers recently 
have announced new projects including a volkswagen plant in 
karlmarxstadt and a renault venture in czechoslovakia 
replacing costly imports with homeproduced goods is the primary 
aim of east europeans said gerd adomeit east european trade 
specialist with west germanys industry and trade council 
we will contribute to their reconstruction mainly by 
cooperation in joint ventures and by providing technology 
management skills and marketing skills to sell products in the 
west adomeit said however import substitution is more 
important to east europeans now 
many west german businesses sensing what was needed long ago 
have been engrossed in efforts to help modernize eastern europes 
crumbling infrastructure some are expected to do quite well in 
projects ranging from communications to power generation 
stock prices have shot up for firms like siemens electronics a 
likely candidate to revamp the east blocs woeful telephone 
network upgrading of industrial plants will draw on the technical 
knowhow of thyssen hoesch and preussag and daimlerbenzs 
transport expertise is in demand for the regions daunting rail 
electrification needs 
most pressing and therefore most promising is the field of 
environmental cleanup as poland east germany and czechoslovakia 
vie for the dishonor of the continents most polluted state 
west germany has pledged more than 1 billion to 17 east german 
cleanup projects asea brown boveri of switzerland will be 
producing steam turbines and other power plant equipment with 
polands zamech firm in one of the first projects aimed at 
environmental improvement 
much of the west european interest in entering cooperative 
projects with the east is stifled by indecision and inconsistency 
in the laws regulating foreign investment 
some countries have yet to adopt clearly defined rules for joint 
ventures and repatriation of profits by foreign companies for 
example even investments in tourism considered an easy and quick 
way to lure foreigners and their money are hampered by poor 
transportation and unmotivated workers 
people who think they can come in and make a quick buck are 
going to be very disappointed said eddy buehlmann senior vice 
president for american express travel related services for europe 
africa and the middle east 
service with a smile or service with sentiment as we say at 
american express doesnt exist in eastern europe buehlmann said

when prime minister toshiki kaifu toured europe 
last month he demonstrated japans economic might by announcing 
almost 2 billion in aid to poland and hungary dwarfing what the 
united states has committed 
in contrast private japanese industries known for their 
aggressive expansion elsewhere are reluctant to plunge into a part 
of the world they see as inexperienced illequipped and still 
emerging from 40 years of communism 
a few prominent deals have been done suzuki motor co for 
example recently agreed to establish an automobile plant in 
hungary the first japanese company to enter a joint venture with 
eastern europe since the tumultuous political changes there 
but eastern europe remains virtually untouched by japanese 
business in 1988 japan trade with the region totaled about 147 
billion excluding the soviet union thats less than 1 percent of 
japanese trade worldwide 
though many japanese firms have offices in eastern european 
nations only about a dozen joint ventures have been established 
no japanese company has yet invested in poland east germany or 
czechoslovakia 
japanese businessmen have a range of reasons for holding back 
high inflation rates a heavy debt burden and inconvertible 
currencies make it difficult to profit in eastern europe in their 
view 
restrictions on exports of high technology to the east bloc a 
vestige of the cold war that remains entrenched also have reduced 
the spectrum of trade opportunities for the japanese leading 
exporters of hightech items 
nonetheless the changing political and economic landscape of 
eastern europe has evoked japans interest the government has 
allocated 750 million for export insurance to encourage japanese 
firms to trade there 
to daihatsu motor co economic reform and japanese government 
aid cannot alleviate the tremendous risks it sees 
one of japans smallest automobile manufacturers daihatsu has 
tried for more than five years to set up an assembly plant in 
poland though it developed an ambitious plan to build a 
12000vehicleayear plant with polish automaker fso daihatsu 
failed to acquire enough financing and the plan collapsed 
last fall fso approached daihatsu again this time said 
spokesman wataru shindo the company has considerably scaled down 
plans it will export about 6000 unassembled charade models to 
poland 
we dont know whether well be able to meet our costs at a 
scale of 5000 to 6000 cars even if we fail there will be little 
damage done shindo said 
japans largest glass manufacturer expressed the same caution 
asahi glass co has been negotiating with poland to establish a 
plate glass factory in the southern city of sandomierz 
the risks remain high said asahi official shigehiko tomita and 
no commitment has been made 
tomita said trade insurance and other japanese government 
support was necessary but stability in eastern europe was more 
important 
the political and economic situation in poland is still fluid 
and the risks great the country has high inflation and even 
though we think that democratization will proceed we need to have 
some protection he said 
shigeki ura a senior officer with merchant trader c itoh and 
co in eastern europe doubted japanese firms will attempt any 
largescale investments 
nevertheless he added as businessmen specializing in the 
eastern european market we should not be so optimistic but not so 
pessimistic economic reform and democracy will give us chances 
ura said japanese firms differ fundamentally from european firms 
in their attitude toward developing the eastern european market 
the japanese want clearcut laws in place specifying what is 
permissible for foreigners but some european investors are willing 
to overlook legal vaguenesses ura said 
despite japans reluctance its neighbor south korea seems eager 
to exploit opportunity in eastern europe yoo changsoon chairman 
of the federation of korean industries south koreas largest 
business organization said recently that prospects are bright 
for direct investment there 
some big entrepreneurs have already studied plans for direct 
investment in communist countries he said 
south korea established diplomatic relations with hungary 
poland and yugoslavia only last year and has a 91 million dollar 
trade surplus with those countries

for 40 years eastern europe has produced goods only the soviet 
union would buy they got back oil raw materials and finished 
products artificial rates were fixed in transferable rubles 
this closed circuit within strictly patrolled borders reduced 
former industrial powers to third world levels with 40 percent of 
the european economic communitys productivity rate at twice the 
energy consumption 
reformminded countries must now wean themselves from the soviet 
union and its socialist trading bloc comecon 
the soviet union and comecon partners agreed in january to work 
toward trade in hard convertible currency but there was sharp 
disagreement on how 
i dont think these countries know what theyre in for said 
jan vanous a specialist on eastern europe at planecon inc a 
washington consulting firm theyll see inflation unemployment 
debt the works 
because east bloc currencies are useless in the west no one 
knows precisely what theyre worth many economists say these 
currencies will have to find their true value in a free market of 
foreign exchange but most agree they are worth a fraction of their 
officially set rates 
this means for example that it could take huge sums of polish 
zlotys czech korunas or hungarian forints to buy the same things 
that smaller amounts of those currencies bought previously 
they will have to break out of the old cycle of you pretend 
to work and we pretend to pay you vanous said it will be 
very difficult 
some eastern european leaders who espouse free enterprise and 
open markets still recoil from the term capitalism 
romanias revolutionary government for example cannot remove 
the social safety net as it picks up the pieces of a potentially 
rich agricultural economy plundered by executed dictator nicolae 
ceausescu 
when the revolution began petre roman said romania would open 
its economy to the world later as prime minister he remarked it 
would be irresponsible to speak of this in detail now 
czechoslovakia is slowly opening without abandoning socialist 
safeguards guided by economists who pushed for reform under the 
communists not only are top managers reluctant to relinquish power 
but many workers fear the adventure of free competition 
we will have a tremendous job breaking up the mafia that runs 
the big state companies said one government adviser who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity i am not sure we can do it 
east germany is trying to intertwine with west germany while 
keeping its socialist character but as people move west from cab 
drivers to physicists plans are in turmoil pressure from bonn is 
accelerating economic integration 
hungarians have experimented with a private sector since the 
early 1980s and have long been open to outside influence today 
budapest looks like a prosperous western capital vaci street 
nearly as swank as paris rue de la paix glitters with wealth its 
mcdonalds is europes busiest 
general motors corp recently committed 150 million to a joint 
venture one of 400 deals struck in the last six months between 
hungarian and foreign companies hungarian officials toured us 
stock exchanges last month in preparation for plans to expand their 
own launched a year ago 
in a desperate imagebuilding move hungary decided to cohost 
the 1995 worlds fair with austria which will cost its strapped 
economy an estimated 25 billion 
laszlo lengyel an influential economic consultant in budapest 
said little has changed for hungarys or eastern europes three 
main classes despite giant political strides 
in hungary wages average 150 a month waiting lists for tiny 
subsidized apartments approach 20 years private homes are 
prohibitively expensive 
while the elites retain power lengyel said a broad class of 
workers sees no prospect for new income beyond controlled wages 
worse many fear layoffs in a new freeforall atmosphere 
a third class of people with second jobs or small businesses on 
the side might take new risks he said but few have contacts 
access to capital or reliable suppliers 
lengyel said a breakthrough may come from european and japanese 
investors who join local entrepreneurs in businesses that control 
their own supply and distribution 
but he said the american approach offering minimal official 
aid and encouraging joint ventures will have limited impact even 
some american diplomats in the region say privately that a country 
which spent trillions to combat communism militarily should risk a 
few billion to defeat it peacefully 
the gdansk shipyard birthplace of the solidarity movement that 
incited the east blocs sweeping changes embodies the challenge 
operations director hans szyc explained he could sell all the 
ships he could make but not without capital foreign investors 
remain cautious and local banks charge 58 percent interest per 
month 
true i am proud of the role this shipyard played in changing 
the whole world szyc said but the problem is not the past 
not today but the future

eastern european nations face a range of alternatives in the 
search for prototypes to reform their stagnating economies all 
involve dismantling staterun subsidy systems that keep prices 
artificially low unleashing market forces of supply and demand 
and moving toward integration with the rest of the world the 
unprecedented undertaking is fraught with risks moreover none of 
the models advanced so far has been put to an extended test 
below are some of the approaches under discussion 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
stateowned companies would be converted to workerowned 
businesses through the issuance of stock to employees under this 
arrangement the government would give preferential lowinterest 
loans to these businesses repayable over long periods while 
workers would control production expansion research marketing 
hiring and firing employee ownership would preserve the socialist 
ideal of workers controlling their own destinies but in the west 
where variations of this model also have been tried they often 
have resulted in inefficiency and a reluctance by employees to make 
tough decisions needed for their businesses to compete and survive 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
stateowned companies would be sold to existing management 
foreign companies or a combination of both in essentially one bold 
stroke the government would end its role as a giant business 
monopoly theoretically encouraging competition and productivity 
sales of stateowned assets would be financed by lowinterest 
government loans if the buyers are overseas investors the 
government would benefit by an infusion of foreign currency and 
expertise the risks lie in entrenching old managers mostly 
unqualified communist party functionaries the process could create 
enormous resentment by workers who feel little has changed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
stateowned companies would be restructured into interlocking 
networks of suppliers and lenders that own stakes in each other 
creating an incentive for them to cooperate an automaker for 
example would form a partnership with a steel factory which would 
be partly owned by a bank which in turn would be partly owned by 
the automaker workers would assume a role in helping direct these 
networks and would be protected by labor unions variations of this 
model helped revive the shattered economies of postwar japan and 
west germany but in eastern europes case they raise the 
possibility of entrenching unqualified managers similar to the 
risk presented by the management ownership model 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
stateowned companies would be turned over to the population at 
large either in the form of stock given to all or via an auction 
in which groups of citizens would compete to buy them this 
strategy in many respects is the fairest by giving people an equal 
economic opportunity but it also presents the threat of 
instability and confusion if companies are simply restructured 
into stock portfolios for each citizen no new capital is created 
for the economy to grow 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the government would encourage the creation of smallscale 
private businesses by managers and employees of existing 
stateowned firms this strategy would preserve the states 
dominant economic role indefinitely but would create new sources of 
employment and production the risk lies in the advantages that 
some state enterprises have in access to supplies creating the 
possibility of profiteering and a polarization of classes into rich 
and poor variations of this strategy have been tried on a limited 
basis in china but often have led to official corruption and a 
popular backlash against entrepreneurs who become relatively 
wealthy

top american and soviet trade officials today 
launched wideranging negotiations aimed at normalizing trade 
between the two superpowers for the first time in nearly a 
halfcentury 
asked if the talks could be accomplished in time for president 
bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to sign a new trade 
treaty at their summit in june us trade representative carla 
hills said we are a very efficient team 
she and deputy trade representative julius katz led the american 
negotiating team while the soviet delegation was headed by yuriy 
n chumakov deputy minister of foreign economic relations 
the agenda for just the first day of consultations listed 15 
areas of discussions the complexity of the negotiations was 
demonstrated by the fact that the us delegation included 19 
officials from six separate government agencies 
officials said the first round of discussions were scheduled to 
last through tuesday with more talks expected at the end of 
february possibly in moscow 
us officials are hoping to wrap up the negotiations in april 
giving plenty of time for drafting the final document that will be 
signed by bush and gorbachev at the washington summit in june 
bush has said he hopes that normalizing trade relations between 
the two nations will boost the soviet economy and lend support to 
the political reforms being undertaken by gorbachev 
thenpresident truman imposed trade restrictions on the soviet 
union in 1947 after relations between the world war ii allies 
deteriorated 
under a ussoviet trade agreement us consumers would see 
lower prices for such popular items as soviet vodka which by one 
estimate could drop in price by 125 a bottle and for luxury 
items such as russian furs 
as part of a trade agreement the united states would grant the 
soviet union most favored nation status qualifying it for the 
lowest tariffs granted to other countries 
currently the soviets are blocked from that status because of 
the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment which penalized the soviets for 
their ban against emigration by soviet jews and other dissidents 
the soviets have liberalized that policy since gorbachev came to 
power and bush has said he will propose to congress a waiver of 
the jacksonvanik tariffs once the soviet parliament passes 
legislation that would put the liberalized policies into law 
the lower tariffs cannot take effect however until there is a 
trade treaty between the two countries 
one primary area of dispute in the trade talks is expected to be 
how the jacksonvanik tariffs will be lifted the bush 
administration would like a threeyear trade agreement with annual 
presidential review and waiver of the high tariffs 
the soviets however would like to see the tariffs removed 
permanently to build confidence among business leaders that trade 
relations will remain stable in coming years 
but such a position is not likely to find political favor in 
congress micah naftalin national director of the union of 
councils for soviet jews said his organization supports the more 
limited oneyear waivers 
we should be giving them what they have earned but we 
shouldnt go overboard he said the country is still 
extraordinarily unstable and we should take it step by step 
the administration seeks to guarantee the protection of 
americanpatented products from piracy an arbitration method to 
settle business disputes and provisions allowing either country to 
impose temporary trade restrictions if a domestic industry suffers 
injury because of an unexpected surge of imports 
under a trade agreement between the two nations the 
administration predicts that twoway trade which last year totaled 
under 5 billion could double or even triple within the next two 
or three years 
but many experts said the administration was being 
overoptimistic in its projections of increased trade given the 
troubles plaguing the soviet economy 
the reforms that have captured world attention so far have all 
been on the political and social level said richard kaufman an 
expert on soviet affairs with the joint economic committee of 
congress i am not all that optimistic about significant 
increases in trade flows until the soviet economy is reformed 
robert cullen editor of sovietamerican trade a newsletter on 
the subject said that even with a trade agreement the 
fundamental barriers between the soviet union and america such as 
not having a convertible ruble are not going to be alleviated 
american farm groups are watching the trade negotiations with 
keen interest threefourths of us export sales to the soviet 
union involve american farm products and the soviets reportedly 
have stated that they will not approve a new grain sales agreement 
with the united states until they are granted lower tariffs

hasbro inc on monday reported profit 
gains of 14 percent for the fourth quarter and 27 percent for the 
full year 
the company also said it discontinued its maxie line of fashion 
dolls hasbros primary competition against mattel incs barbie 
because the doll did not meet sales expectations 
the toy manufacturer earned 24 million or 40 cents a share in 
the fourth quarter up from 21 million or 36 cents a share a year 
earlier sales rose 56 percent to 417 million from 395 million 
income for the year ended dec 25 totaled 922 million or 
156 a share compared with 724 million or 124 a share in 
1988 revenue for 1989 was up about 4 percent at 14 billion from 
1988s 135 billion 
a hasbro executive said the the toymakers annual results were 
not as good if a 1988 video game writeoff were considered 
but its not as dramatic as it seems when tempered by 1988s 
charge for the nemo video system that never came to market said 
john t oneill executive vice president and chief financial 
officer 
deducting that from 1988 research and development costs would 
have improved earnings to about 80 million in the range of 140 
a share he said 
hasbro however maintained its margins by holding costs down 
advertising increases for instance rose less than 1 percent 
we managed very tightly in terms of operating costs and we 
succeeded in getting a lot more leverage on our fixed costs 
oneill said 
alan g hassenfeld chairman and chief executive said there was 
balanced growth domestically and overseas despite the strong 
dollar 
domestic growth came from the milton bradley and playskool 
lines hassenfeld said he said the addition of cabbage patch kids 
from coleco brought more balance to hasbros product lines 
spokesman wayne charness confirmed that hasbro had discontinued 
maxie he said the decision was made about a month ago and that 
hasbro was keying on its recently announced new kids on the block 
line as its latest fashion doll entry 
maxie was doing ok but it really wasnt living up to the 
expectations we had for it charness said 
he refused to provide figures the wall street journal said an 
analyst estimated maxie sales last year were 20 million to 25 
million about the same as a year earlier while barbie sales were 
approximately 375 million

medical problems ranging from upset stomachs to headaches some 
residents testified they fear they will contract cancer because 
they live so close to the dump

dropped significantly

the first trial began monday in the guinness 
affair stock manipulation case the unprecedented whitecollar 
scandal that rocked british business after the multibilliondollar 
takeover of distillers co by brewing giant guinness plc 
eight men including guinness former chairman ernest saunders 
have been accused of involvement in a scheme to purchase guinness 
shares during the 1986 takeover fight for distillers a scotch 
whisky and gin maker in an attempt to boost guinness stock price 
the defendants allegedly aimed to make guinness 43 billion 
cash and stock bid more attractive than a rival offer from 
supermarket operator argyll group plc 
guinness succeeded in april 1986 in what was britains largest 
takeover ever but in december of that year the department of 
trade and industry announced it was investigating the deal and the 
alleged financial wrongdoing started coming to light 
the defendants in the first trial which is expected to last up 
to six months are saunders 54 gerald ronson the 50yearold 
chairman of the diversified conglomerate heron international plc 
former stockbroker anthony parnes 44 and millionaire financier 
and arts patron sir jack lyons 74 
they face a total of 35 charges on such counts as stock 
manipulation theft false accounting and destruction of documents 
the four men briefly exchanged words as they took their places 
on swivel chairs behind moveable desks in southwark crown court 
a jury of seven men and five women is to hear the case the 
trial judge sir denis henry adjourned the case until tuesday to 
give the jurors time to put their affairs in order 
the judge ruled last september that because of its complexity 
the case should be split into two consecutive trials 
in the second trial not scheduled to begin before october 
saunders will be joined by roger seelig 44 former morgan grenfell 
and co ltd corporate finance director lord patrick spens 47 
former director of corporate finance at the merchant bank henry 
ansbacher and co ltd and david mayhew 48 who continues as 
senior corporate finance partner of the investment firm cazenove 
and co 
the seven men have pleaded innocent to the charges and each is 
free on 850000 bail 
the eighth man charged is thomas ward an american attorney who 
also has denied wrongdoing british police are seeking wards 
extradition from the united states 
saunders who maintains that he is a scapegoat appears as a 
broken public figure openly bitter about trial delays the 
extensive legal fees which have forced him to obtain legal aid and 
the scandals devastating effect on his family he spent a night in 
jail when he was arrested in may 1987 
in an unusual step the judge decided the defendants in the 
first trial would not be required to appear in court every day he 
told them to apply to him for permission to be absent on days when 
there was no likelihood of evidence concerning them being called

nelson mandelas declaration 
of support monday for nationalization of gold mines and other key 
assets sent shockwaves through south africas business world 
mandelas statement on his first full day of freedom sent gold 
shares down 4 percent on the johannesburg stock exchange the 
financial rand a special currency used to encourage foreign 
investment plummeted 10 percent 
the reaction apparently did not extend overseas gold prices 
rose in europe and the united states 
mandela told a news conference he fully supports the economic 
plan of his african national congress for a staterun economy 
including nationalization of mines and other major pillars of the 
economy 
the nationalization of mines is a fundamental policy of the 
anc mandela said i believe the anc is quite correct in this 
attitude 
businesses also were unnerved by mandelas statements that he 
supports armed struggle to end whiteminority rule and destroy the 
apartheid system mandela also stressed his desire for peace and 
said whites had nothing to fear from blacks under a true democratic 
system 
the remarks punctured optimism in the business community that 
had been generated by president fw de klerks announcement feb 2 
of reforms to pave the way for talks with blacks on peacefully 
ending white minority rule the stock market and other economic 
indicators rose after de klerks speech 
mandelas pronouncements were causing jitters and 
uncertainty said an economist at a major bank who requested 
anonymity 
the black leaders stance will definitely have a negative 
effect on foreign perceptions of investment in south africa on 
local business confidence and on private fixed investment the 
economist said 
whites control the economy and white business and political 
leaders say any future powersharing deal with blacks must rest on 
a free enterprise system the white business community fears 
nationalization will cripple the economy 
business leaders still hope de klerks reforms and concessions 
will convince western countries to abandon or ease the sanctions 
imposed on south africa in recent years as a protest against 
apartheid 
british prime minister margaret thatcher a longtime opponent of 
sanctions dropped academic and cultural embargoes when de klerk 
legalized the anc earlier this month and she now wants to end a 
ban on new investment 
us president george bush has said his government will review 
existing sanctions against south africa but a final decision would 
require congressional approval

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher monday on the chicago board of trade bolstered by 
perceptions of shrinking supplies and prospects for new grain sales 
to the soviet union 
in a monthly report released after the close of trading friday 
the usda projected the nations corn stockpile at 148 billion 
bushels by aug 31 the end of the 198990 marketing year that 
compares with the january estimate of 161 billion bushels and last 
years ending stocks of 193 billion 
the usda pegged us wheat stocks at 443 million bushels by may 
31 the end of the wheat marketing year compared with a january 
estimate of 468 million bushels and last years ending stocks of 
698 million 
both estimates were below trade expectations the aug 31 
soybean projection of 335 million bushels unchanged from january 
was near expectations 
traders also were attuned to the opening monday in washington of

united airlines labor unions who are seeking 
employee ownership of parent ual corp have approached at least 
one candidate to replace ual chairman stephen m wolf according to 
a report published monday 
the chicago suntimes reported that richard ravitch former 
chairman of bowery savings bank of new york and onetime head of new 
yorks transit authority said he had held very preliminary 
discussions with union representatives 
ravitch also said he had the impression the union group was 
talking with others about taking wolfs job according to the 
newspaper 
attempts by the associated press to contact ravitch were not 
immediately successful a receptionist at his new york office said 
ravitch was out of town but would not reveal his whereabouts 
there has been no indication that wolf would resign from 
chicagobased ual which he has headed since december 1987 as part 
of any employee buyout deal between the unions and the companys 
board of directors 
but the union group representing uniteds pilots machinists 
and flight attendants is believed to be hoping to dump wolf and 
chief financial officer jack pope and recruit a new management team 
before approaching banks for loans to finance a buyout 
union and ual board representatives have been negotiating the 
terms of a formal buyout bid and are expected to report on their 
progress at a feb 22 board meeting 
neither a ual spokesman nor spokesmen for the three unions would 
comment on the suntimes report 
a source within the union group who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the management issue has not been decided but he 
said i think its probably fair to say that everyone wouldnt 
mind looking elsewhere 
wolfs role in an employeeowned ual was not covered in a buyout 
proposal outlined by the unions last month nor was the price of 
the 75 percent stake that the workers want to buy 
some airline analysts believe dumping wolf would be a mistake 
despite his history of fractious relations with the unions 
they say wolfs experience in turning around the financial 
fortunes of the former republic airlines and flying tiger 
airfreight carrier before coming to ual make him a good leader for 
united which has fallen behind american airlines in ridership in 
recent years after long leading the industry 
analyst louis marckesano of janney montgomery scott inc in 
philadelphia said the subject of dumping wolf came up at a recent 
meeting of airline analysts most of whom thought it would be big 
dumb thing the unions may be trying to do 
uals stock lost 4 to close at 13250 monday in new york stock 
exchange trading

time warner inc announced monday it lost 317 
million in the fourth quarter and 987 million for all of 1989 
because of costs related to its 14 billion acquisition of warner 
communications inc 
despite the loss which was expected securities analysts said 
they were satisfied with the results because time warners cash 
flow which is crucial for paying off its 106 billion in debt 
was strong 
time warner formerly time inc completed its acquisition of 
warner communications on jan 10 after having acquired more than 
half of warners shares in a tender offer last july 
the results announced monday were reported as though time had 
acquired warner on jan 1 1988 and therefore included results 
from all of warners divisions 
time warners fourthquarter loss amounted to 552 per share 
and compared with a loss of 320 million or 561 a share in the 
same period of 1988 
however time warners operating income which does not reflect 
interest taxes costs associated with the warner acquisition and 
other expenses totaled 412 million up from 351 million a year 
earlier 
the companys fourthquarter combined revenue rose to 309 
billion from 25 billion a year earlier 
time warner said its quarterly results reflected a 175 million 
loss before taxes on the sale of its scott foresman and co book 
publisher 
they also included a 63 million gain before taxes on the sale 
of time warners stock in columbia pictures entertainment inc 
the company said all its divisions performed well during the 
quarter 
timewarners magazine division which includes time sports 
illustrated and people magazines had operating income of 108 
million in the fourth quarter up 13 percent from 1988 advertising 
revenue was up 87 percent while circulation revenue increased 47 
percent 
time warner said its magazine revenue more than offset startup 
costs for its entertainment weekly which it launched monday 
the companys filmed entertainment division which includes 
warner brothers studios had operating income of 80 million 
compared with a loss of 20 million in fourth quarter 1988 
time warner said it continued to profit from the success of the 
motion picture batman which was in videocassette release 
domestically and theatrical distribution overseas during the 
quarter 
the companys recorded music and publishing division which 
includes warner records had operating income of 141 million up 
11 percent from a year earlier 
operating income at the companys cable television division was 
up 58 percent to 180 million time warner said the results partly 
reflected the addition of a florida cable system acquired from 
centel corp 
time warners programming division which includes home box 
office and cinemax had operating income of 37 million compared 
with a loss of 1 million a year earlier 
the companys book division had a loss of 134 million 
reflecting the scott foresman sale compared with operating income 
of 35 million in fourthquarter 1988 
john reidy an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc said 
time warner had a solid quarter judging by the performance of 
the companys various divisions cash flow for 1989 was in line 
with expectations he said 
analysts are more concerned with time warners ability to pay 
its debts and shrugged off the companys losses theyre 
meaningless said pavlos alexandrakis at argus research corp 
alexandrakis also said time warners cash flow would be enough 
to service its debt load 
for the year time warner said it lost 987 million or 1729 
per share compared with a loss of 114 billion or 1984 a 
share in 1988 
fullyear revenue totaled 1078 billion up from 91 billion 
the results for all of 1989 also include the costs of the warner 
acquisition operating income for the year totaled 192 billion 
up from 133 billion in 1988

mikhail s gorbachev told east german leaders 
a reunited germany cannot belong to the nato alliance the state 
news agency adn said monday 
the soviet leaders stand disagrees with the united states and 
western european nations who oppose a neutral germany with no ties 
to the western military alliance 
east germany rejected a west german proposal wednesday for quick 
adoption of a common currency but approved the principle of a 
monetary union 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany trying to hasten 
reunification has said a single currency should be adopted soon to 
help resolve east germanys severe economic problems 
east german leaders asked west germany on monday for financial 
aid of up to 9 billion but the west germans said no finance 
minister theo waigel said there was no sense in financing a 
system that has still not decided to make fundamental changes and 
has not shown it is capable of doing so 
about 70000 east germans turned out monday evening for the 
weekly prodemocracy rally in leipzig dozens carried west german 
flags and one banner read if the west german mark comes well 
stay if the west german mark doesnt show up well go to join 
it 
adn the official east german news agency said two young people 
were slightly injured in scuffles with about 75 to 100 rightwing 
radicals who showed up in leipzig 
about 80000 people held a rally in karlmarxstadt and chants 
of germany one fatherland rang through the city 
last year 340000 east germans moved to prosperous capitalist 
west germany they now stream west at the rate of 1800 a day 
making the economic chaos in east germany even worse 
the exodus helped bring down the old hardline communist 
government beginning in october and now encourages a growing 
reunification movement what remains of the communist party in east 
germany has tried to slow the process 
on tuesday kohl and hans modrow east germanys communist 
premier are to meet in bonn foreign ministers of the european 
community said in brussels that kohl would make modrow an official 
offer of monetary union 
they said waigel mentioned the plan at a meeting of ec ministers 
monday no details were released 
kohl said he got the green light for unification from 
gorbachev during a weekend visit to moscow but the official east 
german agency adn reported monday the soviet leader insisted a 
united germany stay out of nato 
the chancellor has said repeatedly that west germany is firmly 
in the north atlantic treaty organization and has rejected 
neutrality for a single germany 
adn said gorbachev told modrow by telephone he had clearly 
told kohl a united germany staying within the structure of nato 
cannot be accepted 
gorbachev said the question of military structures and 
questions of political status can only be solved in a gradual 
transition the agency reported 
its dispatch gave no details on gorbachevs position about the 
western military alliance but said he acknowledged german unity 
could come more quickly than previously thought adn indicated 
gorbachev initiated the conversation with modrow 
in washington president bush said we support chancellor 
kohls position that a unified germany should remain a member of 
nato let me also express my appreciation of chairman gorbachevs 
statesmanlike view that decisions regarding german unity should be 
left to the people of germany 
kohl has denied west germany wants to annex the east but 
comments from east berlin indicate growing resentment to pressure 
from bonn 
at the weekly talks monday between the government and other 
organizations a set of guidelines was approved for modrows 
meeting with kohl 
most important was rejection of speedy action toward the single 
currency kohl says is necessary to bolster the east german economy 
the panel added however that monetary union eventually could be 
an important measure for the creation of a german economic 
system 
sixteen political parties and other groups are represented in 
the weekly round table discussions which are part of the 
interim administration guiding east germany to free elections march 
18 
on monday panel members warned against artificial overheating 
of the german process the guidelines said reunification cannot 
endanger european integration

a federal bankruptcy judge on monday gave 
eastern airlines another eight days to file its proposed plan of 
reorganization after several parties in the proceeding said 
progress has been made toward agreement on a plan 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland granted easterns 
request for the extension to feb 20 of the deadline for filing 
its bankruptcy reorganization plan during that time other parties 
such as creditors cannot submit competing proposals 
miamibased eastern has been restructuring under bankruptcy 
court supervision since a grueling strike began last march 4 the 
airline asked the court last week for a 30day extension but 
reduced its request before mondays hearing indicating that 
eastern and its major creditors may have moved toward compromise on 
a plan 
david i shapiro the courtappointed examiner overseeing 
easterns chapter 11 proceeding supported the request and told 
lifland that substantial progress is being made in negotiations 
between the airline and its creditors 
shapiro said last week he would fight liquidation of eastern as 
rumors circulated that texas air corp easterns owner would opt 
for a chapter 7 liquidation 
the committee representing unsecured creditors also supported 
easterns petition 
representatives of preferred shareholders who recently 
advocated liquidation or outright sale supported the airlines 
request for more time however 
in papers filed earlier in bankruptcy court a committee 
representing tthe preferred holders said it had lost faith in 
easterns management because it was cannibalizing the airline 
by selling vital assets 
the preferred shareholders criticized easterns latest 
reorganization proposal recently diclosed publicly which proposes 
to pay them no more than 10 cents on the dollar in the form of new 
stock 
we are examining all of our various options were hopeful we 
can come up with a solution robert miller an attorney for the 
preferred shareholders committee said after the hearing 
the new plan also calls for paying unsecured creditors only 10 
percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges from 
bankruptcy protection and 70 percent more over the following 10 
years without interest 
in return for accepting partial repayment texas air would give 
the unsecured creditors 40 percent of easterns equity 
lawyers representing the air line pilots association and the 
machinists union opposed easterns request 
the pilots and flight attendants abandoned their sympathy 
strikes just before thanksgiving but eastern had since rebuilt as 
a smaller carrier and hired mostly nonunion workers to replace the 
strikers the machinists union remains on strike against the 
carrier 
mondays extension was the fourth granted by lifland to eastern 
since the bankruptcy proceeding began last march 9

soviet ambassador yuriy v dubinin said monday 
that the recent historic meeting of the communist party central 
committee has given a powerful political impetus to the soviet 
unions plans for economic restructuring 
dubinin speaking to a business audience about joint ventures in 
the ussr said the committees agreement last week to accept a 
multiparty system and adopt a new platform of reforms would help 
accelerate the countrys economic recovery and expand trade with 
the west 
the soviet unions economic agenda includes taking emergency 
steps to rebuild the economy and laying a foundation for economic 
development dubinin said it also includes creating a legal system 
with laws on property employment and taxes decentralizing the 
economies of republics within the country making the currency 
convertible and reducing foreign debt he said 
however dubinin said the natural mutual attraction between 
the us and soviet business communities could be destroyed by 
the cold war or severe restrictions 
shall we postpone our business interaction until better 
times dubinin asked 
i believe the answer lies in the fact thatwe are already 
experiencing an explosion of interest on the part of american 
businesses toward establishing ties with soviet business 
dubinin underscored the need for a ussoviet trade agreement 
that would relax trade barriers between the two countries and help 
remove obstacles to granting the soviet union mostfavorednation 
trade status a move that could ease the economic troubles under 
which the soviets are living 
top us and soviet trade officials on monday began negotiations 
in washington aimed at reaching a new trade treaty by the time of 
the june summit between soviet president mikhail gorbachev and 
president george bush 
dubinin said more than 1000 joint ventures have been registered 
between soviet and western companies in the last year and more 
than a dozen more joint venture agreements will be signed with 
major american companies in the next few months 
however only about a fifth of those registered have become 
reality due to the structural and economic problems in the soviet 
union 
we are trying to solve those problems dubinin said 
the ambassador said the socalled economic conversion or 
the converting of soviet military plants into facilities for 
manufacturing consumer goods is helping lessen the political 
tension between the soviet union and the west while helping in the 
recovery 
conversion serves to accelerate economic development 
andopens new horizons dubinin said 
dubinin said he returned on sunday from moscow where he 
attended meetings of the communist party central committee and 
meetings with secretary of state james a baker iii that wound up 
saturday

fewer savings and loans are falling short of 
tough new financial standards than originally feared thrift 
regulators said monday 
of 861 sampls originally thought to be short of capital 147 have 
demonstrated they meet new standards that took effect dec 7 the

thrift office director m danny wall said the 18 percent 
improvement over earlier expectations doesnt come as a big 
surprise because industry data showed that thrifts were shrinking

finished at 5595 cents a gallon up 087 cent the april contract 
rose 065 cent to 5527 cents and may added 055 cent to 5461 
cents 
analysts said there was little news to move the petroleum 
markets 
there was more movement than news said peter beutel energy 
analyst with elders futures inc it seemed to have been short 
covering that boosted prices 
prices had been under pressure recently from industry and 
government reports that showed an increase in crude and product 
supplies in the nations storage tanks 
analysts also attributed the recent weakness in crude prices to 
an announcement by a few big refiners last week that they would be 
doing annual maintenance turnarounds in march and april the 
maintenance requires refiners to slow operations which suggests 
they would be using less crude oil

the bigger they are the harder they fall 
berkshire hathaway inc wall streets priciest stock tumbled 
730 a share monday in a selloff that brokers blamed on negative 
publicity in a barrons magazine story 
the stocks preeminence remained untouched however even with 
the drop berkshire hathaway was still trading at 7220 a share 
keeping it in a class by itself on the new york stock exchange 
barrons said the company a hodgepodge of insurance and 
investment concerns controlled by legendary multibillionaire warren 
buffett has become extremely overvalued since buffett switched 
trading in the stock from the overthecounter market to the nyse 
in 1988 
j verne mckenzie berkshire hathaways chief financial officer 
and spokesman for omahabased company said no comment when 
asked about the barrons report and the stock slide 
a total of 1450 shares traded hands in the selloff 
the shares have been on the decline since peaking at 8900 late 
last year 
barrons suggested that buffetts investment miscalculations 
were largely responsible the magazine said some of buffets recent 
investments have not been made based on his celebrated adherence to 
buying into companies with sound balance sheets and strong 
management 
berkshire hathaways genesis was a struggling textile mill that 
buffett acquired 25 years ago then trading at 12 a share over 
the years buffett expanded and strengthened the company into a 
conglomerate with stakes in enterprises ranging from insurance 
giant geico corp to the washington post co

nissan motor corp said monday it would begin 
airing regional television ads for its infiniti luxury cars 
featuring the vehicles in their entirety instead of simply showing 
scenes of rocks birds and pussy willows 
the ads the second stage of the companys unusual advertising 
campaign for the cars will air in less than 45 television markets 
where infiniti has dealerships company officials said 
nissan drew some automotive ad industry barbs when its infiniti 
ad campaign began last year with ads that featured such scenes as 
countrysides or fields but did not show the car 
the new ads will be broadcast on network affiliates in infiniti 
markets during local news and prime time shows for the next 3 
months 
nissan is broadcasting the new ads regionally because each of 
the spots will carry the area dealers name said nissan spokesman 
bob thomas the original ads carried on television newspaper and 
in magazines were intended to create name recognition for the new 
auto line 
if you had to do advertising to get a name established we did 
that in spades said thomas mignanelli executive vice president 
of the companys us sales arm 
mignanelli also said monday the company was offering too many 
cars in the united states and indicated it may cut the size of its 
sports car lineup 
we probably ought to have one or two car lines less he 
said weve got all the bases covered you have to say how many 
sports cars do you need 
within the last year nissan has introduced its 240sx and 300zx 
and the new pulsar nx sports cars nissan is setting up a new 
organization in southern california designed to streamline its 
product development process in north america he said 
the organization called nissan north america will coordinate 
operations of the eight other companies nissan runs in the united 
states 
its a transfer of the planning and review process to the 
united states mignanelli said 
during the last year nissan broke ground for a huge research 
and development center northwest of detroit to bring research for 
future us products closer to the companys plant in smyrna 
tenn and to the market where the cars will be sold 
it provides us with a lot more say in our company said 
mignanelli we can do a project from the seed to the tree in the 
united states

platinum futures prices jumped monday after nelson mandela 
endorsed antiapartheid violence and nationalization of south 
africas mining industry sending a shudder of supply fear through 
the precious metals markets 
on other commodity markets oil futures fell coffee futures 
rose grains and soybeans were mostly higher and livestock and 
meat futures were mixed 
platinum futures settled 980 to 1010 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with the contract for delivery in april up

on new yorks commodity exchange gold finished 3 to 320 
higher with february at 41920 a troy ounce silver was 28 cents 
to 32 cents higher with march at 5305 a troy ounce 
south africa is the worlds largest producer of both platinum 
and gold it dominates in platinum accounting for an estimated 26 
million or nearly 80 percent of the estimated 33 million ounces 
produced last year according to british refiner johnson matthey 
plc 
mandela the african national congress leader who was freed 
sunday after 27 years in south african prison said in a speech 
that anc bombings and sabotage were defensive acts against 
apartheid and that the partys call for nationalization of mineral 
and diamond minds was quite correct 
those statements along with reports of 30 deaths in scattered 
south african violence since sunday morning smashed perceptions 
that mandelas release signified easing racial and political 
tensions 
anything that causes uncertainty anything that even hints at 
the possibility of less reliability as far as source of supply is 
concerned is bullish for the platinum market said bernard 
savaiko senior metals analyst at painewebber inc 
mine sabotage poses obvious production problems while the ancs 
call for mine nationalization leaves open the possibility that 
the flow of supply will diminish because of the inefficiencies of 
governmentowned mining operations as opposed to those controlled 
by free enterprise savaiko said 
oil futures rallied late in an otherwise lackluster session on 
the new york mercantile exchange 
ray mazzeo energy futures specialist with shearson lehman 
hutton inc said the rally was inspired by technical market 
factors and did not appear to have much staying power

great northern nekoosa corp asked a 
federal judge monday to block georgiapacific corps 38 billion 
hostile bid for the rival paper company charging that 
georgiapacific lied about plans to sell great northern assets 
meanwhile georgiapacific announced the sales of its own assets 
in three states to avoid antitrust problems that could develop if 
it succeeds with its 63 a share offer 
in federal court in portland great northern attorney bernard 
nussbaum asked us district judge gene carter for a preliminary 
injunction halting the takeover attempt as well as 
georgiapacifics efforts to oust great northerns board at a 
special shareholders meeting march 2 
great northern accused georgiapacific of violating federal 
securities laws by trying to cover up plans to sell great northern 
assets including two mills and 21 million acres of woodlands in 
maine if its completes its planned takeover 
gp is lying theyre not telling you their true plans 
nussbaum told carter 
nussbaum said handwritten notes and typed memos from 
consultants bankers and georgiapacific itself demonstrated that 
the atlantabased paper giant has planned since at least 1984 to 
sell the assets 
georgiapacific attorney stuart j baskin in turn accused great 
northern of pandering to the poor people in maine through an 
unfair motion that has no basis in law 
baskin said georgiapacific has produced depositions and 
affidavits from 14 people including georgiapacific executives 
consultants and bankers who dispute great northerns contentions 
about a planned asset sale 
the judge said he would rule on great northerns request as 
quickly as possible 
after mondays hearing lawyers for both sides met with carter 
and agreed to unseal a motion for a preliminary injunction filed 
last month by georgiapacific which alleged great northerns 
directors breached their fiduciary duty by resisting the offer 
great northern has rejected georgiapacifics bid as inadequate 
however georgiapacific contends great northerns investment 
banker goldman sachs amp co conducted a study last spring that put 
the value of great northerns stock at somewhere between 4639 per 
share and 6875 per share 
the motion asked the judge to force great northern to forgo its 
poison pill takeover defense and to strike down golden 
parachute payments to great northerns executives if they lose 
their jobs in the battle 
georgiapacific also asked the judge to force great northerns 
directors to refrain from using maines antitakeover law to block 
the merger 
great northern issued a statement saying the goldman sachs study 
was stale and originally prepared for a different purpose 
than evaluating a bid for the company 
also monday great northern filed papers saying it wanted to 
pursue a speedy appeal of an order last week from carter who ruled 
it would take a twothirds vote by great northerns shareholders to 
oust the great northern board 
great northerns bylaws called for a threefourths vote but the 
judge agreed with georgiapacific that twothirds was the most 
allowed under maine corporate law 
georgiapacific said monday it had agreed to sell safetypaper 
operations in vermont iowa and new york to remove an antitrust 
question in the takeover attempt 
the company said it was selling facilities in gilman vt and 
burlington iowa to seattlebased simpson paper co 
the deal also calls for the sale of two wet process machines and 
a precision sheeter in warwick ny 
the gilman plant employs about 200 people making safety paper 
which is used in personal checks securities certificates and other 
documents that need to be protected against forgery the burlington 
plant employs about 20 workers

suggested government regulations defining 
supercomputers are too broad and would handcuff us manufacturers 
industry officials said monday as the department of commerce began 
public hearings on its proposals 
although conceding there is a national interest in strict 
controls over the biggest and fastest computers experts said the 
suggested definition of a supercomputer is so broad it could 
include some personal computers within a few months 
we have to make sure that were controlling supercomputers and 
not everything else in the world said terry rock a vice 
president of convex computer corp a richardsonbased manufacturer 
of socalled minisupercomputers 
the commerce department has proposed defining a supercomputer as 
a machine with a total peak performance of 100 million 
floatingpoint operations per second a measure of the speed with 
which machines add subtract multiply or divide very large numbers 
the rules would require an export permit for machines with a 
performance of 100 mflops or greater machines with a capacity of 
150 mflops and 300 mflops could only be sold to 22 us allies and 
even then under strict guidelines including certification of 
security and access limitations 
the industry is concerned that the proposed regulation written 
in consultation with the department of defense will hamper its 
ability to compete with computer makers internationally 
its obviously of great importance that we balance the 
requirements of security with a minimum negative impact on 
competition said stanley sienkiewicz the commerce department 
associate deputy undersecretary who conducted mondays hearing in 
dallas 
setting a 100 mflops threshold for supercomputers today will 
soon make it very difficult for both us computer and 
semiconductor manufacturers to effectively compete in the world 
market said murray goldman head of the microprocessor group at 
motorola inc the no 1 us computer chip manufacturer 
dj thompson a dallasbased industry consultant said a better 
definition would be a machine with a 500 mflop to 600 mflop rating 
this sort of system would have particular usefulness in the 
known strategic applications for instance codebreaking fluid 
flow calculations antisubmarine warfare signal processing and 
the like thompson said 
if one is truly speaking of supercomputers as understood by 
the industry the security controls are not at all onerous he 
said a supercomputer is an expensive and delicate piece of 
capital equipment and physical access to it and its use would 
certainly be controlled and in a very strict way 
industry officials also complained monday about the pace of the 
regulationmaking noting that rapid technology advances could make 
the rules unrealistic almost before they take effect 
given the current performance trend for microprocessors you 
will soon need a 1000 mflops definition for a supercomputer not 
the 100 to 300 range you are currently evaluating said 
motorolas goldman by the late 90s we will see such systems 
common on engineers desks 
commerce officials indicated they were sympathetic to the 
industrys concerns and hoped the public hearings will provide 
evidence to help overcome defense department concerns about the 
lowrange computers 
other hearings are scheduled for wednesday in santa clara 
calif the heart of the silicon valley boston another hightech 
center on friday and feb 19 in minneapolis home of cray 
research inc the us leader in supercomputers 
the information gathered at the hearings will be reviewed by the 
commerce and defense departments and it will be several months 
before a final regulation is prepared

reacting to last years apple chemical fear 
and the chilean fruit cyanide scare the nations fruit and 
vegetable suppliers and buyers opened their convention monday with 
a predictable theme produce safety 
if it is an area of concern by the consumer we have to 
reassure them said jim halloran spokesman for the chilean 
winter fruit association 
his organizations members are among more than 7500 attending 
the united fresh fruit and vegetable associations annual 
convention where the food safety question seeped into almost every 
presentation 
association spokesman john mcclung said produce safety is the 
biggest issue at the groups 86th convention but food safety has 
been a concern for years 
i am always amazed about the resiliency of the food safety 
issue in the public mind said mcclung emphasizing that though 
specific food safety concerns wane the overall question remains 
the next issue to come along always attracts attention 
roger blobaum director of americans for safe food a project of 
the center for science in the public interest said he believes the 
fruit and vegetable industry is moving away from use of chemicals 
and pesticides 
theres a considerable amount of consumer interest and 
pressure to reduce pesticide residue blobaum said monday in a 
telephone interview were encouraged by a lot of things that we 
see 
he said his washingtonbased organization has worked with the 
united fresh fruit and vegetable association and similar groups to 
promote food safety 
the fruit and vegetable association has helped form the 
nonprofit center for produce quality to spread its message that 
produce is safe mcclung said 
the entire produce industry in the united states represents 
about 60 billion a year although that includes retail and several 
levels of wholesale sales mcclung said about 30 percent of 
produce is imported 
in a speech to the produce association agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said he said he was concerned that food safety laws 
may be affected by emotion rather than science 
last winter a widely publicized consumer report linked the 
chemical alar to a longterm health threat alar is the trade name 
for a spray that keeps apples red and fresh longer 
on the heels of that controversy traces of cyanide were found 
in two grapes from chile the food and drug administration ordered 
chilean fruit held at ports where it was entering the united 
states and fda officials urged stores to remove the fruit from 
their shelves 
no other tainted fruit was found however millions of dollars 
worth of produce went bad while it was held for the federal 
inspections 
produce industry officials say theyll bounce back despite last 
years setbacks 
chilean fruit which also includes nectarines peaches and 
plums undergoes the same type of inspections domestically grown 
fruit does halloran said 
its kept under rather rigid quality control from the time 
its picked to the time it makes it to the supermarkets he said 
they chilean growers are very concerned and theyre not going 
to do anything to jeopardize the quality 
grapes constitute about 70 percent of the fruit chile exports 
and virtually all of the fresh grapes sold in the united states 
during the winter months are from chile 
 
another glitch in 1989 came during the us military invasion in 
panama in december closing of the panama canal forced some ships 
to wait several days before getting through 
but halloran said while there was a slight delay in getting 
produce to market fruit on the refrigerated ships wasnt damaged 
the convention ends wednesday

a large us investor reportedly has agreed to 
buy 92 percent of blue arrow plc for 967 million to become the 
biggest shareholder in the british company whose chief asset is 
the temporary employment agency manpower inc 
blue arrow chairman mitchell fromstein said he was delighted by 
the investors decision to purchase the shares from natwest 
investment bank the british bank that has owned them since 1987 
the investor was not identified but the milwaukee journal 
described it in its monday editions as a major insurance company 
pension fund or private investment group manpower is based in 
suburban milwaukee 
its a marvelous late chapter in the story fromstein said 
adding the purchase would increase us ownership of blue arrow to 
more than 75 percent it removes an overhang from the market 
thats been there for two years 
fromstein has proposed reincorporating blue arrow in the united 
states he said the identity of the us buyer would be announced 
when the transaction was completed on wednesday 
natwest will take an 887 million loss on the stock sale the 
journal reported 
the disclosure in 1988 that natwest had owned the shares for a 
year jolted britains financial community because british 
regulations require public disclosure when anyone owns 5 percent or 
more of a public company 
as a result the banks top executives were dismissed and 
criminal charges eventually were filed against 10 executives of the 
bank and a brokerage firm the cases have yet to go to trial 
natwest acquired the shares through its investment banking 
subsidiary county natwest which underwrote an offering of new 
stock to finance blue arrows 13 billion acquisition of manpower 
county natwest wasnt able to sell all the shares however and 
was forced to keep 667 million shares itself or a 92 stake 
the disclosure of the natwest stake not only rocked the bank but 
also helped erode confidence in former blue arrow chairman tony 
berry who was ousted last year by fromstein the former president 
of manpower

eastern europe governments attempting to move 
away from communism should seek to stabilize their budgets 
inflation and exchange rates before dealing with problems of trade 
industry and labor a banking group advised monday 
nevertheless the other problems also have to be tackled soon 
said a report of the institute of international finance an 
association of major banks throughout the world 
the problem of successfully liberalizing a distorted economy 
can be likened to the problem of teaching a baby elephant to stand 
up it said 
the order in which it straightens its legs is important only 
to the extent that it influences the elephants ability to 
straighten them at all 
titled financial sector reform its role in growth and 
development the study is based on the experience of chile 
greece malaysia new zealand and tunisia 
it said detailed priorities should vary from place to place 
in some third world countries such as malaysia the study found 
the main task was to build institutions where few or none existed 
to develop skilled people and to build the basis for a modern 
economy 
most heavily indebted latin american countries had followed 
misguided policies for many years the study said adding that at 
various times countries such as new zealand tunisia greece and 
chile have made similar mistakes 
the priorities listed by the study included 
getting control and stabilizing taxation government borrowing 
and spending credit and prices 
decentralizing decisions to get them out of the hands of 
bureaucrasts and politicians and giving more authority to people 
with information and incentives 
developing a situation for healthy markets so that prices 
reflect cost and scarcity giving people the incentive to put their 
money into useful investments 
adopting an exchange rate that reflects actual value on the 
market getting rid of taxes on exports high duties on imports and 
preference for stateowned business 
reorganizing stateowned business 
the report warned that delay in financial changes may lead to 
high inflation and instability in other parts of the economy 
these issues are particularly important to the design of 
programs in central and eastern europe said horst schulmann 
managing director of the institute 
pushing financial changes including control of the government 
budget and convertibility of local currencies into hard money also 
is the priority for jeffrey sachs the harvard university professor 
who is advising poland and yugoslavia sachs said last week that 
poland is already beginning to see results in lower food prices 
the yugoslavs have also introduced full convertibility of the 
dinar as of jan 1 backed by billions of dollars of foreign 
exchange reserves he told a business conference last week 
the currency is perfectly stable fixed against the 
deutschemark the west german currency i think its a safer bet 
than the dollar in the next few months because they are committed 
and will be able to achieve stability

the communist party embraced the principle of 
private property monday in a radical rejection of some of the 
fundamentals of marxism and soviet socialism 
the communist party of the soviet union believes the existence 
of individual property including ownership of the means of 
production does not contradict the modern stage in the countrys 
economic development the partys new platform says 
the platform was approved wednesday by the partys policymaking 
central committee but not published in final form until monday 
it represents soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs boldest 
break with communist orthodoxy and contradicts public statements he 
made just months ago 
the platform says the party took into account the new hunger of 
soviet citizens for democracy and reform as expressed by mass 
rallies and local political organizing all over the country 
the document also says the communist party supports 
protection of a citizens personality and honor the 
immunity of his home and property the secrecy of correspondence 
citizen participation in running the affairs of society and 
the state freedom of speech the press meetings and 
demonstrations and the formation of public organizations 
mans free selfdetermination in the spiritual sphere the 
freedom of conscience and religion 
a stronger presidency that would further erode the power of 
the party in favor of the government party officials said last 
week they would would give up their constitutional monopoly on 
power 
soviet laws long have promised wide political freedoms but the 
communist party has dominated every aspect of life and has been 
intolerant of any challenge 
it was in economics the foundation of marxist theory that the 
party made its strongest break with both its ideological heritage 
and decades of soviet practice 
marxist theory holds that factories and other means of producing 
goods must be owned by the state rather than individuals because 
private ownership inevitably results in one person exploiting the 
labor of another 
the platform bowed to marxism by also proclaiming that any form 
of property must prevent mans alienation from production or 
exploitation but it did not define either term 
communists intend to reform the topheavy soviet system in 
serious economic straits into a plannedmarket economy based on 
a diversity of property forms competition between independent 
manufacturers a developed financial system and on the powerful 
stimuli of personal and collective interest said the platform 
published by the tass news agency 
it said stateowned property should be turned over to worker 
control through leasing contracts jointstock holdings and other 
methods

the juiciest gossip monday in the big apple was 
the separation of ivana and donald trump the billionaire developer 
who had the foresight to perfect the art of the prenuptial deal 
if the split sticks after 13 years of marriage the prenuptial 
agreement decrees that ivana gets 25 million plus the couples 
greenwich conn mansion and custody of the three children 
according to columnist liz smith who broke the story in sundays 
daily news 
the gossip mill was kept spinning by battling tabloids and tv 
stations that cant get enough of the tuxedoed trump and the 
bejeweled begowned blond ivana fixtures on the social circuit 
statements from the trumps did nothing to slow the mill her 
attorney michael kennedy issued a release monday saying we do 
not consider the socalled prenuptial agreement to be serious it 
will have no relevance to a court because it is unconscionable and

the communist party embraced the principle of 
private property monday in a radical rejection of some of the 
fundamentals of marxism and soviet socialism 
the communist party of the soviet union believes the existence 
of individual property including ownership of the means of 
production does not contradict the modern stage in the countrys 
economic development the partys new platform says 
the platform was approved wednesday by the partys policymaking 
central committee but not published in final form until monday 
it represents soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs boldest 
break with communist orthodoxy and contradicts public statements he 
made just months ago 
the platform did not make clear in what sense the party still 
considers itself to be communist but pays homage to the creative 
spirit of marxism and the philosphys humanistic outlook of 
opposing religion and emphasizing mans daily existence 
it also points with pride to the concepts of pensions free 
education and medical care and other social benefits that it says 
the soviet system pioneered 
in deciding on sweeping changes however the platform says the 
party took into account the new hunger of soviet citizens for 
democracy and reform as expressed by mass rallies and local 
political organizing all over the country 
the document also says the communist party supports 
protection of a citizens personality and honor the 
immunity of his home and property the secrecy of correspondence 
citizen participation in running the affairs of society and 
the state freedom of speech the press meetings and 
demonstrations and the formation of public organizations 
mans free selfdetermination in the spiritual sphere the 
freedom of conscience and religion 
a stronger presidency that would further erode the power of 
the party in favor of the government party officials said last 
week they would would give up their constitutional monopoly on 
power 
soviet laws long have promised wide political freedoms but the 
communist party has dominated every aspect of life and has been 
intolerant of any challenge 
in a departure from one of the marxist slogans once used to 
justify rule by terror and liquidation of the middle class the 
party dismissed the concept of a dictatorship of the proletariat 
saying the ruleoflaw state of the whole people has no room for 
dictatorship by any class 
it was in economics the foundation of marxist theory that the 
party made its strongest break with both its ideological heritage 
and decades of soviet practice 
marxist theory holds that factories and other means of producing 
goods must be owned by the state rather than individuals because 
private ownership inevitably results in one person exploiting the 
labor of another 
the platform bowed to marxism by also proclaiming that any form 
of property must prevent mans alienation from production or 
exploitation 
communists intend to reform the topheavy soviet system in 
serious economic straits into a plannedmarket economy based on 
a diversity of property forms competition between independent 
manufacturers a developed financial system and on the powerful 
stimuli of personal and collective interest the platform said 
central planning has left the soviet union chronically unable to 
provide its people with adequate food housing or consumer goods 
and the platform said the system had been characterized by 
monopoly lack of initiative wastefulness mismanagement and 
disregard for consumers interests 
the platform also said stateowned property should be turned 
over to worker control through leasing contracts jointstock 
holdings and other methods 
private property could face stiff resistance in many parts of 
the country where state schools have preached its evils for 
generations sociologist tatyana zaslavskaya told tass last week 
that while 80 percent of the population of latvia a small baltic 
republic approve of private property the attitude was exactly the 
opposite in many other areas 
the young soviet state under lenins leadership confiscated most 
private property after the 1917 revolution and stalins drive to 
strip peasants of their land through collectivization in the 1930s 
took millions of lives through famine deportation and summary 
execution 
the platform also called for restructuring heavily subsidized 
state prices as an indispensable prerequisite to the markets 
regulation of the economy 
subsidies have kept many prices artificially low a pound of 
sugar costs 70 cents a loaf of bread 33 cents and a bus ride and 
most daily newspapers a few pennies apiece 
the system has kept many inefficient industries afloat and has 
meant there is rarely any direct relationship between the cost of 
manufacture and retail prices 
the platform introduces the concept of competition once taboo 
among communist ideologists as a necessary tool for regulating 
prices and ensuring availability of goods and services it calls 
for legislation to break up state monopolies trade credit 
services and insurance businesses to permit competitive consumer 
services 
as recently as last november gorbachev stated firm opposition 
to permitting soviet citizens to hold private property 
tass said at the time he told a student assembly he remained 
committed to the communist manifesto which calls for state 
ownership of all means of production to ensure that workers get 
full value for their effort without factory owners taking a share 
as profit the manifesto is the blueprint for communism written in 
1848 by karl marx and friedrich engels 
at that time he also rejected calls for allowing political 
parties other than the ruling communist party although he left 
open the possibility the constitution might eventually be changed 
to permit a multiparty system 
tass quoted him as saying there was no other political force 
capable of both renewing the bodies of soviet power that were 
gaining strength and consolidating society

south korea will run a trade deficit 
of 33 billion this year the worst in nine years the korea 
foreign trade association predicted tuesday 
the figure compared with a government projected deficit of 2 
billion both figures were on a customs clearance basis 
the national traders group expected 663 billion in exports 
this year up 64 percent from 623 billion in 1989 while 
predicting 696 billion in imports up 135 percent from 613 
billion in 1989 
the government projected 66 billion in exports and 68 billion 
in imports for 1990 
association officials said exports are expected to recover 
somewhat in the second quarter of this year but the growth is 
likely to be far outpaced by surging imports 
after years of substantial trade deficits korea scored its 
first annual trade surplus in 1986 amounting to 31 billion 
the countrys trade surplus rose to a record 88 billion in 
1988 but plunged to 1 billion in 1989 because of the loss of 
export competitiveness affected by the korean currencys 
appreciation steep wage hikes and labor unrest in the past three 
years 
the association said its projection was based on assumption that 
the korean currency will be devalued by 56 percent during this 
year to 720 won to the dollar accompanied by moderate wage hikes 
and few labor disputes 
the group called on the government to take substantial steps to 
reinvigorate exports the government so far has refused to take any 
drastic measures on exchange rates and bank loan interest rates for 
fear of high inflation and instead has called for structural reform 
of korean industries

the west german government will make an 
official offer tuesday to east germany to form a monetary union of 
the two countries diplomats of the european community said monday 
west german finance minister theo waigel revealed the move at a 
meeting of finance ministers of the european community the 
12nation trading bloc according to officials 
no details of the plan were released 
east german premier hans modrow was scheduled to travel to bonn 
to meet with west german officials on tuesday and wednesday 
community officials had anxiously awaited waigels remarks 
because of concern about the effect of a monetary union of the two 
germanys on the rest of western europe which is planning its own 
monetary reform as part of its plans to remove trade barriers by 
1992 
a german monetary union no doubt would involve circulation of 
west germanys strong mark currency in the east 
communist east germany has seen its centrally planned economy 
deteriorate rapidly since the border between the two countries 
opened late last year thousands of east germans have poured into 
their western neighbor 
i fully understand bonns position to accelerate its 
economic and monetary union with east germany said dutch 
finance minister wim kok but brussels must be the place where we 
help determine germanys position on that 
i have full confidence in the fact that germangerman economic 
and monetary integration will be firmly anchored in wider european 
consultations he told reporters i find that crucial 
west germanys economy based on a freemarket system is the 
most powerful in the european community many of the west european 
currencies are closely tied to the west german mark and the ec 
countries have been working on plans to form a common currency for 
their members 
irish finance minister albert reynolds said waigel indicated 
the german government will make an offer to east germany tomorrow 
on closer integration for monetary union ireland currently holds 
the communitys rotating sixmonth presidency 
he said waigel promised to keep the community fully informed 
of developments 
a diplomatic source demanding anonymity said jacques delors 
president of the communitys executive body raised questions about 
how the german monetary union would affect the trading blocs 
monetary system 
an internal report by the european commission the executive 
body said that immediate monetary union would create a strong 
confidence factor but it also cautioned that a quick marriage 
would irrevocably link west germany to east germany 
any turbulences and setbacks in east germany would be 
transmitted to the west german economy and thereby also to the 
community said the study 
these turbulences and frictions seem however almost 
unavoidable it said it should not be forgotten that almost 
the whole east german population has had no direct experience 
with democracy and a market economy 
waigel told german reporters that he delivered a message to the 
finance ministers from west german chancellor helmut kohl who said 
his country remains committed to the communitys campaign to form 
an economic and monetary union 
kohl also said the bonn government would discuss its unity plans 
with all community institutions 
waigel said no date was mentioned for a german monetary union 
because it depended on discussions this week with modrow and the 
outcome of the march 18 elections in east germany 
he also noted the east german economy is onetenth the size of 
west germanys the dimension of the integration issue should not 
be exaggerated he said 
i tried to convince my colleagues that the challenge can be 
met by west germany if one takes a midterm view that is from 
five to 10 years he told reporters
