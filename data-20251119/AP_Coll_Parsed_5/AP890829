the father of three purported drug barons 
begged the government on tuesday to end its fierce antinarcotics 
drive and negotiate peace as colombia moved to extradite a reputed 
drug finance chief to america 
the developments came as the city of medellin was hit by seven 
bombs 
police also said tuesday night they frustrated a planned rocket 
attack on a stateowned distillery there four imported 
highpowered rockets were found aimed at an alcohol storage tank 
outside the licores de antioquia plant in medellin a police 
spokesmen said 
eduardo martinez romero identified as a major financial man for 
the medellin cocaine cartel was told by colombian authorities 
tuesday they plan to hand him over to the united states for trial 
colombian television said 
according to the tuesday night report by the private syndicated 
news program noticiero 24 horas martinez was formally notified 
during the day of plans to extradite him 
the medellin cartel is the worlds largest cocaine trafficking 
organization martinez is wanted by a federal court in atlanta on 
charges related to a 12 billion drug moneylaundering operation 
martinez was told he had until tuesday to appeal the extradition 
the report said 
it was the first word that the united states had completed 
extradition paperwork and made a formal request for martinez a 
35yearold econmist he was the first of at least four extraditable 
suspects to be caught up in a sweep aimed at drug traffickers 
the us embassy has said it will not comment on any extradition 
proceedings 
the martinez case is seen as a test of colombias resolve to 
press its attack on drug dealers they have cowed the courts in this 
south american country through assassinations threats and bribes 
meanwhile fabio ochoa restrepo the father of three reputed 
cocaine kingpins appealed in an open letter to president virgilio 
barco to bury the hatchet and agree to talk to the drug barons 
let there be dialogue let there be peace lets have 
forgiveness lets carry out a kind of erasing and clean slate 
ochoa restrepo wrote 
the letter was published on tuesday in a bogota newspaper 
in washington justice minister monica de greiff reiterated the 
barco governments refusal to negotiate with drug traffickers who 
are blamed for the assassination aug 18 of sen luis carlos galan 
a leading presidential candidate the slaying led to the crackdown 
on drug trafficking 
colombias police intelligence chief said tuesday that among the 
more than 11000 people arrested in the crackdown one has been 
implicated in galans death earlier news reports pointed to 
abraham majuat reputedly a top financial man for drug dealers but 
the reports could not be confirmed 
bombs exploded at six state liquor stores tuesday in medellin 
the shops are a source of patronage for political leaders 
a seventh bomb went off outside a tourist agency office in bogota 
no one was hurt police said they estimated damage at 100000 
a man who identified himself as a spokesman for drug traffickers 
claimed responsibility for the bombings tuesday and nine bombs that 
exploded in medellin on sunday the claim came in phone calls to 
medellin radio stations 
in his emotional appeal which was dated saturday and appeared in 
the bogota daily el tiempo ochoa restrepo called on barco to stop 
the bloodshed in our poor and dear colombia 
nobody in the world ever won a war all that is left are 
orphans widows and pained mothers said ochoa restrepo 65 he 
said traffickers should be called on to stop dead their 
activities no more drug trafficking no more war no more 
killings no more bombs no more fire 
he identified himself in the letter as father of three 
extraditables the poor little ones may god shelter them 
neither us nor colombian authorities have accused ochoa 
restrepo of trafficking but his three sons jorge ochoa vasquez 
juan ochoa vazsquez and fabio ochoa vasquez are alleged to be among 
the kingpins of the medellin cartel and are wanted by the united 
states 
drug agents believe the cartel is responsible for 80 percent of 
the cocaine distributed in the united states 
ochoa restrepo said traffickers facing extradition say they 
prefer a tomb in colombia to a jail cell for life in the united 
states which is to be dead in life as are so many that we have 
there in this i think theyre right 
he said any negotiated concessions by the traffickers would also 
require concessions by leftist guerrillas 
the traffickers allegedly have equipped and financed rightwing 
paramilitary death squads that have killed hundreds of suspected 
leftists and provided security and assassination services for the 
traffickers 
the miami herald and also the washington post quoting a 
confidential report by colombian security forces reported that at 
least five israeli and 11 british mercenaries helped train teams of 
assassins for colombian cocaine traffickers and their rightwing 
allies 
the us state department said it asked britain to investigate 
allegations some of its citizens were involved 
in washington mrs de greiff pledged tuesday to continue to 
fight her countrys drug lords despite death threats and she 
appealed for more us aid to protect judges 
she disputed reports that she had considered resigning in the 
face of death threats against her her husband and their 3yearold 
son 
she said she was requesting 19 million to purchase armored cars 
bulletproof vests metal detectors for courts and other security 
devices 
president bush has approved 65 million to help the colombian 
government fight the drug cartels and 5 million to help protect 
judges

two years ago sergei grigoryants was in a soviet 
labor camp ostracized and imprisoned by his government for what it 
called slander 
today he is among a new breed of globetrotting soviet activists 
flocking to the west to pitch their causes attend seminars meet 
government leaders and finally shake hands with people whose 
stubborn support kept many of them going 
unlike soviet tourists and emigrants these activists also are 
forging new contacts with people who will support them when they 
return home along the way they are amassing an arsenal of donated 
computers printers and fax machines to open new electronic windows 
on the onceclosed soviet society 
the number of activists visiting the west has soared since 1986 
the year after president mikhail gorbachev launched his reforms 
they range from veteran moscow dissidents who spent years in jail 
for their beliefs to proindependence baltic activists spurred by 
gorbachevs programs 
nearly every top leader of the three independent popular 
front groups in the baltic republics has visited europe the 
united states or canada in the last year leading moscow activists 
such as lev timofeyev and sergei kovalyov have crossed both 
continents and nobel peace prize winner andrei sakharov has 
returned to the west twice since his first visit last year 
but soviet authorities still tightly control travel visas for 
personal and business trips leaving wide speculation about the 
kremlins motives for allowing activists to ply their trade freely 
abroad 
id shy away from conspiracy theories but it obviously builds 
up gorbachevs reputation he obviously believes enough in his 
reforms to allow this said ginte damusis of the lithuanian 
information center in new york 
gorbachev wants to appear as a peaceful lawabiding 
figure said ludmilla thorne soviet affairs director at the new 
yorkbased human rights organization freedom house they dont 
want bad publicity 
jeri laber executive director of helsinki watch in new york 
suggested the kremlin simply is less concerned about activists 
influence somebody there has realized its not so bad when these 
people speak out 
a soviet embassy spokesman in washington said only that kremlim 
policy on visas for travel to the west doesnt discriminate between 
activists and all other soviet travelers whose total number could 
reach 2 million this year 
vytautas landsbergis president of the lithuanian independence 
movement sajudis said he didnt know why authorities let him visit 
the united states and europe but that he had more important things 
on his mind 
there is an opportunity to maintain contacts to establish new 
contacts the 56yearold musicologist said through an interpreter 
last month in new york i hope that sajudis will be known not just 
by name only but as a very real movement and representative of its 
people its nation 
landsbergis who became an activist only in the last two years 
said his trip reaffirmed sajudis rejection of soviet authority 
imposed on the baltics under a 1939 pact signed by josef stalin and 
adolf hitler 
were raising questions about the authority of our 
representatives abroad can we expect emigres or other governments 
to represent us 
he met with state department officials congressmen a former 
white house policymaker and lane kirkland president of the aflcio 
which has appointed a representative to deal with lithuanias 
fledgling independent labor union 
just a few weeks before the 48yearold grigoryants met with 
vice president dan quayle and other officials and activists and 
signed an agreement with freedom house to fax daily installments of 
his journal to america 
grigoryants the georgian publisher of the journal glasnost was 
freed in 1987 after four years in a labor camp for publishing an 
underground journal he formally came to america to accept the 
golden pen of freedom award from the international association of 
independent journalists 
a state department spokeswoman would not comment on any of the 
meetings saying only that us policy is to meet with all soviet 
activists 
one of their intentions for contacts with the west is to be so 
well known that if a crackdown came theyd be well known enough to 
protect themselves said martin zvaners of the american latvian 
association in washington the fact that these people are coming 
to the west showing their faces gives westerners a stake 
personally in their fate 
the activists also are seeing us working and they get an idea 
about how they could work they see participation in a real 
parliamentary democracy said robert van voren director of the 
bukovsky foundation in amsterdam 
but ideas and contacts arent the only things activists take home 
grigoryants handed thorne a list of supplies from staples to 
computers for his moscow office which was stripped by kgb agents 
and internal security forces last year thorne said she wasnt sure 
if all his requests were filled but that his wife tamara earlier 
in the year had carried a personal computer back to moscow after 
visiting the west 
landsbergis picked up a desktop publishing system with which 
sajudis hopes to put out a daily newspaper from vilnius the 
lithuanian capital 
baltic armenian and georgian activists regularly use fax 
machines they got from the west to send dispatches to western 
activists the recipients said 
one fax can perform miracles said eduard gudava executive 
director of the new yorkbased center for democracy in the ussr 
they can stop all this travel but they cannot cut all the 
telephone lines 
the center receives daily dispatches from the human rights 
journal expresskhronika and translates them for western media such 
independent reporting will make moscow think twice before sending 
troops against protesters gudava said 
its impossible now to keep information inside the soviet union 
about such things he said 
still nothing can replace facetoface contact said van voren 
they would be doing their jobs even without these trips but its 
easier to discuss things in person you know they still have bugs 
in their offices

guerrillas on the 6000foot 
volcano looming over san salvadors northwestern limits have turned 
the workingclass neighborhood of san ramon into another 
bulletpocked battlefront 
contingents of leftist rebels have come down the slopes four 
times in nine months to attack an army post in the center of the 
ramshackle district of 30000 people 
the attacks are part of a yearold guerrilla campaign to bring 
their war against the government into the capital the salvadoran 
military says the guerrillas are making urban attacks because 
theyve failed elsewhere 
but three of the four raids were staged in daylight illustrating 
the guerrillas confidence in their ability to at least partly 
neutralize the governments single greatest tactical advantage air 
power 
each time the combat is more fierce said marta teresa 
figueroa a vendor in the stalllined market alley hard hit by the 
fighting it will happen again and next time it will be worse 
she stood 10 feet from the spot where santos barrera a 
60yearold mason was killed by a bullet in the head the afternoon 
of aug 1 that raid also left a soldier dead another wounded and 
two civilians a marketstall owner and her daughter wounded 
three of barreras grandchildren stood on the stoop of his humble 
cinderblock home and told how they huddled under beds while the 
fighting raged for two hours 
asked if the attacks made her afraid to come to the market 
16yearold cheeseseller julieta lopez said yes but necessity 
obliges us to risk our lives 
though residents of san ramon have nothing against the soldiers 
manning the post several said there is a feeling that the 
detachment should be withdrawn or at least moved from the 
districts center 
miguel angel riveras arm is still bandaged and in a sling from a 
wound he received in november during the first attack on san ramon 
he had stopped to light a cigarette for a soldier when the first 
fusillade exploded out of the darkness 
the bone in the 21yearold bus faretakers upper arm was 
shattered the artery severed and much of the nerve destroyed 
they should remove the post to a more isolated place he 
said standing a block from the onestory house that serves as the 
15man detachments headquarters and barracks 
the house is distinguished from its neighbors by greenandblack 
camouflage daub and sandbag positions at its corners 
there are too many people around here the market the school 
the church people who have nothing to do with the conflict and 
things happen to them rivera said 
sgt mario ventura lopez a stocky 51yearold former 
paratrooper commands the post a 32year army veteran ventura lost 
a lung from a wound suffered in combat with the rebels in 1982 
standing next to a patched hole in the wall where an antitank 
rocket struck in the previous attack ventura said his detachment 
was there to protect the community from these terrorist 
delinquents 
he estimated that about 100 rebels took part in the attack aug 
1 his troops were reinforced soon after it began by scores of 1st 
brigade soldiers on constant patrol around the san salvador 
volcanos base 
a uh1h helicopter with two m60 machineguns one of 70 
ussupplied choppers in the salvadoran air force circled about 
3000 feet above san ramon shortly after the battle began too high 
for its gunfire to be effective 
the helicopters arent coming in as close as they used to because 
the guerrillas have acquired several hundred sovietdesigned 
dragunov sniper rifles which have a range of 800 yards compared 
with about 300 yards for an ordinary assault rifle the helicopters 
have been taking more hits and abandoning more missions 
with government air power reduced the rebels have been able to 
launch more daytime attacks than at any time in the last four years 
of the conflict that began nearly a decade ago 
ventura contended his post is getting evergreater acceptance and 
support from the local people 
theyre tiring of seeing the way the terrorists actions affect 
the civilian population he said 
but a dozen residents interviewed indicated little or no 
animosity toward the attackers it was clear however they were 
sick of the war 
one asks oneself whey the two sides are fighting and one 
doesnt find an answer said a produce vendor who preferred not to 
give her name 
even rivera says he has nothing against the rebel who wounded him 
so severely 
it was just bad luck he said

good evening the headlines tonight sue lawley 
tells bbctv viewers britain has sent a warning to herr hitler 
we will stand by poland whatever the consequences 
theres an eerie quality to news 39 a weeklong series of 
mock newscasts that marries 50yearold old footage to hightech tv 
to recreate the last days before world war ii 
with her reassuringly english tones as well as the period 
jewelry she bought especially for the program this doyenne of 
british television seems born to the role of wartime newscaster 
but at 43 ms lawley wasnt even born when the war ended and 
computer graphics have an unsettling impact as they mingle with 
grainy blackandwhite photos of helmeted germans and gasmasked 
babies 
the reporters on the 15minute news roundups are real like tim 
sebastian reporting on evacuees coming home from the continent or 
charles wheeler the bbcs white house correspondent now 
reporting from berlin and appearing in color against a backdrop 
of the brandenburg gate in black and white 
britain is being deluged with memories of sept 13 1939 when 
adolf hitler invaded poland and britain declared war on germany 
the tv schedules are saturated with documentaries and drama 
newspapers are publishing special supplements 
more than 100 new books about the war are being published from 
fresh histories to coffeetable volumes of photographs the emphasis 
is on the small almost forgotten details of life on the home front 
news 39 even claims to have unearthed a 50yearold scoop 
newly discovered footage of crowds falling over rubber balls that 
were strewn by an antiwar protester outside the prime ministers 
downing street residence 
this week will be a time of sadness for many for some it will 
bring a nostalgic smile a memory of a small but personal part in 
history says paul fox managing director of bbctv 
for those born after the event it will be a time to learn what 
happened and why 
but for some its too much all those trench coats all those 
tin hats all those smiling cockneys with a mug of tea amid the 
sepia ruins of london i cant face it im off wrote stephen 
pile an iconoclastic sunday times columnist 
for most britons the war years have taken on a burnished 
nostalgic glow where there is never any doubt where the division 
between good and evil lies and where there will always eventually 
be a happy ending as christopher booker put it in the daily 
telegraph 
but although the collective memory is of a nation united making 
huge sacrifices in the noblest of causes the anniversary is also 
reopening old controversies 
historians once again are debating whether the prewar british 
government in seeking to appease hitlers territorial demands in 
europe was abjectly craven or playing for time to rearm 
there is even a debate about whether britain should have joined 
the war 
that argument was rekindled by cambridge university historian 
maurice cowling who argued in the sunday telegraph that from a 
purely conservative viewpoint a victorious germany would have been 
preferable to a postwar europe dominated by the soviet union and the 
united states 
by staying out of the war he wrote britain would have allowed 
hitler to destroy its natural enemy bolshevism and left the 
british empire intact 
it is wrong to assume that a dominant germany would have been 
more intolerable to britain than the soviet union was to become or 
that british statesmen had a duty to risk british lives to prevent 
hitler behaving intolerably to germans and others he wrote 
cowling conceded that these are harsh judgments which will be 
offensive to men of good will and the flood of outraged responses 
to the telegraph proved him right 
professor t e allbone who worked on the development of the 
atomic bomb wrote that had it stayed out britain would eventually 
have come under the domination of a nucleararmed germany 
other historians said the empire already was disintegrating 
before the war and lord glendevon a former tory minister wrote 
that the war saved civilization and i am deeply thankful that i 
was old enough to join in

an ap correspondent was able to visit 
afghanistans secondlargest city for 36 hours with the aid of 
guerrilla commanders and afghan army officers this is her report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
two years of bombardment have made a 
ruin of this former royal city named for alexander the great who 
may have founded it but flowers brighten the rubble 
roses and mimosa jasmine and bougainvillea cover the serrated 
remains of buildings in kandahar which was the seat of afghan kings 
two centuries ago 
block after block of mudwalled dwellings that were bombed 
rocketed and shelled by moslem guerrillas and afghan soldiers have 
been transformed into ghost neighborhoods of jagged walls and 
collapsed archways twisted beams and shattered wooden roofs 
other buildings are heavily damaged by bullets and shrapnel some 
are boarded up and locked 
what remains often compared to beirut is a monument to the 
suffering caused by 11 years of war since the communist coup of 
1978 in which soviet military forces took part for nine years the 
red army withdrew in february 
even army officers and government officials are halfhearted in 
trying to blame the destruction solely on the guerrillas most of 
whose arms are supplied by the united states 
every day the soviets were here was a disaster an army 
officer said privately all they touched turned to dust now that 
we are on our own every day gets a little better 
guerrillas have tried since october 1987 to capture kandahar 
whose name derives from the arabic for alexander 
the conquerors army passed through in 329 bc for centuries 
after that india and persia fought over kandahar which was 
strategically located on the central asian trade routes 
since early may the government has claimed that guerrillas 
known as the mujahedeen or holy warriors and pakistani soldiers 
were planning a new assault on the city kandahar is 70 miles from 
pakistan where the main guerrilla groups are based 
most guerrilla commanders deny the charge and say instead that 
they agreed seven months ago to stop attacks on the city and turn 
their rockets and mortars on army posts and on the airport 15 miles 
north of the city 
for every communist killed as many as 100 innocent people may 
die if the city is shelled said commander mulah naqib of the 
fundamentalist jamiatiislami or islamic society of afghansitan 
considered the bestorganized and most efficient fighting group 
these are the people who helped us against the russians he 
said these are the people who gave us food and protection at a 
time when we were getting no outside aid why should we kill or hurt 
them 
naqib commands about 4000 of the estimated 20000 guerrillas 
around kandahar which was afghanistans secondlargest city before 
the war 
only one of the seven oftenfeuding resistance groups based in 
pakistan the fundamenalist hebziislami party of islam led by 
gulbuddin hekmatyar has refused to stop shelling the city the 
field commanders said 
some said they may be forced to save some weapons and ammunition 
to fight hekmatyars men 
government officials said the population fell from 300000 to 
about 25000 when the bombardment was at its heaviest 
residents who fled to pakistan or iran have begun returning even 
though up to 30 rockets still hit the city every day 
lt gen nurul haq ulumi military governor of kandahar province 
said seventy percent of the buildings in the city have been 
completely destroyed the remaining 30 percent have been hit by at 
least one bullet 
workers have begun building playgrounds for children and 
repairing badly minarets on neighborhood mosques in the battered 
shops of the bazaar teenage boys in turbans inspect japanesemade 
electronics goods and women in fulllength veils bargain with 
vendors for grapes and melons 
people travel on bicycles and donkeys on horses sometimes 
decorated with silver bells and brightly colored woolen balls along 
paved streets chewed up by tanks 
most gasoline stations are closed for lack of supplies so nearly 
all the motor traffic is military 
two years ago on any day of the week at any hour of the day 
you couldnt leave your house the army officer said driving past 
rows of shattered government houses this is still war but its 
just not as bad 
soldiers and guerrillas are within yards of each other in two 
rings around the city but appear to be observing a comparative 
truce at least for a time 
we all want the same thing ulumi said he is a member of the 
durrani tribe which produced the kings of afghanistan until the 
monarch was overthrown in 1973 
the government the mujahedeen the refugees in pakistan iran 
and the west all want the same thing we want to live together in 
peace he said in an interview at his office in governors house 
where portraits of the former kings hang we were friends before 
the war we can be friends in the future 
guerrilla commanders feel however that talking with president 
najib is tantamout to accepting the soviet legacy from a war that 
has cost more than 1 million lives 
we have problems with najib and his government naqib said 
they are still the enemy maybe well see each other and sit down 
and talk god willing one day we will but now isnt the right 
time

the environmental protection agency will press on 
with an effort to kill denvers proposed 500 million two forks dam 
because of the damage it would cause to the environment an epa 
official said tuesday 
the 615foothigh dam to be built near the confluence of the 
south platte river and its north fork would flood 30 miles of scenic 
river valley and canyon and the town of deckers to provide drinking 
water for up to 360000 new denverarea residents 
opponents including several environmental groups have called 
the project the biggest ecological disaster in colorado history 
the two forks dam and reservoir project would result in the 
loss of a major aquatic resource which provides irreplaceable stream 
fishery habitat and recreational resources near the denver 
metropolitan area said lee dehihns the epa deputy regional 
administrator from atlanta who reviewed the project for five months 
dehihns said he was recommending continuation of the veto process 
started by epa administrator william reilly on march 24 the next 
step in the process is two months of public hearings the final 
decision will be made at epa headquarters in washington but dehihns 
said vetoes are rarely overturned 
i caution that there are still powerful forces aligned against 
us two forks opponent sen jim exon dneb said in a statement 
released by his washington office 
you simply cant leave us high and dry mayor federico pena 
said at a news conference tuesday we have not been given a fair 
objective appraisal of this project 
dehihns said in response to penas remarks im not happy 
theyre upset but im obliged to carry out my responsibilities 
under the law 
gov roy romer a onetime two forks supporter was noncommittal 
about dehihns decision he said he hoped the cooperation forged 
between denver and its suburbs in their drive to build the project 
would not deteriorate 
epa officials said dehihns had two options besides continuing the 
veto process letting the project proceed or attaching additional 
environmental requirements that would have to be met before the 
project could proceed 
but after more than 160 hours of meetings with two forks backers 
and foes dehihns apparently remained unconvinced the project could 
be built without inflicting serious environmental damage 
the dam 25 miles southwest of denver was proposed by the denver 
water board and 42 area water providers they said the dam is needed 
to meet denvers future water needs 
dehihns said metropolitan denver appears to have adequate water 
supplies for now and could put more water conservation measures in 
place 
this is not just a statement to the people of denver said 
sen bob kerrey dneb we should hear this message too 
environmental groups said the dam would flood a premier trout 
stream and dry up wildlife habitat in nebraska nebraska gov kay 
orr opposes the project 
denver water board spokesman ed ruetz denied the downstream 
habitat would dry up if the dam were built 
another board member monte pascoe said the agency would 
challenge dehihns decision and demand more epa involvement in 
future denver water decisions 
audubon society president peter aa berle said dehihns deserves 
the heartfelt praise and gratitude of all concerned americans 
because of his decision 
this recommendation brings us one step closer to a total 
victory for common sense and for the environment said melinda 
kassen of the environmental defense fund there are less costly 
and less destructive ways to supply the denver metropolitan area 
with water

us policy toward panama enters an uncertain 
phase friday when the calendar runs out on the ousted presidents 
term leaving the united states with nobody to recognize as legal 
head of the country 
the situation raises a number of touchy situations such as 
notifying panamanian officials when a us naval vessel plans to 
search a panamanianflag ship suspected of carrying drugs 
panamas president eric arturo delvalle was ousted in february 
1988 by forces loyal to gen manuel antonio noriega the reagan 
administration refused to recognize that ouster and the united 
states has continued to look upon delvalle as panamas legal 
authority even though he wields no power 
but friday is the date when delvalle was supposed to step down 
officially as president according to panamas constitution with 
that date the bush administrations withdraws the mantle of 
legitimacy it accorded to delvalle 
in the absence of even a paper successor the united states will 
not have anyone it recognizes as president of panama 
the end of delvalles term also means that his envoy in 
washington ambassador juan b sosa will surrender control of the 
panamanian embassy here the building will remain under the state 
departments care until a democratically elected government taks 
office in panama 
sosa has found an apartment here and plans to look for a job 
officials acknowledge they dont know what will happen in cases 
such as those involving the inspection of panamanian ships 
for the past 18 months us naval vessels encountering 
panamanianflag ships suspected of carrying illicit narcotics have 
secured permission from delvalle before inspecting these vessels 
it is normal for the united states to recognize whatever 
authority is in effective control in a foreign country but an 
exception was made in the case of panama because of washingtons 
refusal to have official dealings with the noriegadominated 
government in panama 
the campaign against noriega began in earnest after two florida 
grand juries indicted him on drugsmuggling charges in february 1988 
in practical terms the end of delvalles term in office will 
mean little having spent much of the time since his ouster living 
in hiding in panama with only a small base of popular support 
delvalle has been largely irrelevant as a political factor since he 
was deposed 
his downfall occurred when he attempted to fire noriega as 
commander of panamas military forces within hours the 
noriegacontrolled national assembly voted to fire him as president 
and to replace him with manuel solis palma a noriega loyalist 
after friday it is not clear what will happen in panama 
authorities there recognize the constitutional significance of that 
date but there is no officially recognized successor to solis palma 
because the may 7 national election results were voided by the 
government after the antinoriega candidate guillermo endara 
appeared to have won by a wide margin 
the bush administration recognizes endara as presidentelect 
but officials said unless there is a swearingin accompanied by the 
appointment of a cabinet the united states has no one to recognize 
the administration had hoped the organization of american states 
would be able to promote a democratic transfer of power in panama 
but that effort broke down last week and noriega seems to have 
emerged with his power intact 
us officials said afterward the administration may tighten 
economic sanctions which were imposed against panama last year after

the food and drug administration is moving to 
withdraw from the market the second of two generic versions of a 
popular drug used to treat high blood pressure 
however the company that makes the drug contends that its safe 
and effective 
in the third such action in less than a week the fda proposed 
monday to remove bolar pharmaceutical co incs generic version of 
dyazide because of questions about its therapeutic value 
the copiague nybased company said in a statement that its 
product remains on the market 
it is safe effective and may be used with assurance of 
clinical effectiveness bolar said adding that it will appeal the 
fda action within the 30day limit 
dyazide and its generic competitors are among the most widely 
prescribed drugs in the country and the generic version is bolars 
largestselling product 
the fda said it has not been able to fully establish whether 
bolars product has the same effect as the brandname product made 
by smithkline beecham plc 
bolar officials told the washington post in todays editions that 
the fda announcement is the result of confusion over a clerical 
error in the identification of samples used in safety testing and 
misinterpretation of the results of tests for safety and 
effectiveness conducted by the company last year 
the fda said that while the proceeding to withdraw approval of 
the companys license to market its product is under way it will 
indicate that the drug is not considered to be of proved therapeutic 
equivalence to the brandname drug 
if bolars generic dyazide is withdrawn there would be no 
generic version on the market generics are copies of brandname 
drugs that sell for much lower prices 
the other maker of a generic dyazide vitarine pharmaceuticals 
inc of springfield gardens ny halted distribution of its copy 
earlier this summer when the company said it substituted samples of 
the brandname drug in tests required for fda approval 
bolar is among 11 drug makers being investigated by the fda in 
the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption involving employees 
in the agencys generic drug division and some makers of generic 
drugs 
the agency also is sampling 30 of the most prescribed generic 
drugs and their brandname counterparts in the wake of disclosure 
that several generic drug companies have provided false data to the 
fda 
however the fda said it found no evidence of fraud in the 
approval process for bolars generic dyazide 
questions about the products equivalence to the brandname 
product stem from irregularities in the batch records for lots of 
the product that were tested the agency said 
the fda announced last week it was proposing to withdraw 
approvals for three products made by par pharmaceuticals of spring 
valley ny and 25 made by vitarine 
the fdas action was praised by rep john dingell dmich 
chairman of the house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee which has been looking into the agencys generic drug 
division 
the fda is coming to grips with the problems in the generic 
drug industry he said i expect that after all is said and done 
both the fda and the generic industry will be stronger and better

the 9 percent turnover rate among federal 
employees in 1987 is roughly comparable to private industry and may 
be about right for an employer as large as the government says the 
merit systems protection board 
the board said monday that it found a 5 percent turnover rate for 
many technical and engineering occupations such as computer 
specialists that was contrary to conventional wisdom that 
turnover problems are more severe in those categories than other job 
descriptions the board said 
the board said its figures were virtually identical to those in a 
1984 study by the congressional budget office and not far off the 
private sector turnover rates of 14 percent and 16 percent cited in 
two recent studies 
after major differences are filtered out federal employee 
turnover may not be as different from private sector turnover as 
believed by some it said 
one difference for example is that a private worker who moves 
from one company to another would count as a turnover while a 
federal worker transfering from one department to another would not 
calling the overall government turnover rate relatively 
stable the board said the current overall rate of turnover may 
be near optimal for an organization the size of the federal 
government 
of those leaving 58 percent resigned 25 percent retired 5 
percent were fired and 12 percent were unspecified other 
removals the report said 
the board based its report on an analysis of 14 million employee 
records from the 1987 fiscal year 
here are some highlights of the report 
there was a 25 percent turnover rate among employees during 
their first year of service 
only 4 percent of all employees with from 16 to 20 years of 
service left their jobs during the year reviewed 
among those with more than 30 years service 20 percent retired 
in 1987 
the average age of federal retirees 60 is close to the average 
age of private sector retirees which is about 61 to 62 
although they constitute only 26 percent of the work force 
employees in the lowest five pay grades accounted for 55 percent of 
all resignations 
turnover was highest among healthrelated and lowerlevel 
clerical and support occupations 19 percent of all practical 
nurses and 16 percent of all clerktypists

the energy department may be unable to set a 
reliable date for completing a highlevel nuclear waste dump in 
nevada until it wins state permission to begin site studies a 
senior department official says 
in an interview monday samuel rousso indicated that squabbles 
with nevada pose a bigger obstacle than a court ruling last week 
against the departments proposed 1 billion contract award to a 
bechtel corp unit to manage the waste repository 
rousso acting director of the departments office of civilian 
radioactive waste management said no decision has been made on 
whether to appeal the court ruling 
completion of the dump proposed for yucca mountain about 100 
miles northwest of las vegas originally was scheduled for 1998 and 
currently is set for 2003 the nevada state government and its 
congressional delegation oppose the project in part on grounds that 
nevada was chosen for political reasons rather than scientific 
reasons 
energy secretary james d watkins said earlier this summer he was 
reconsidering the project timetable in light of recent setbacks and 
rousso said he expects a decision in the next few months on whether 
the schedule will be pushed back again 
a meaningful schedule will probably depend on agreement with 
the state to go forward rousso said at some point theres no 
fixed point but at some point we must have access to the site 
to perform the preliminary work 
nevada so far has refused to grant the environmental permits 
needed by the energy department to begin drilling on the site to 
determine its geologic suitability the department is obligated by a 
1982 federal law to study the yucca mountain site 
gov bob miller cited last weeks court ruling against the 
contract award to bechtel as an example of the programs lack of 
credibility 
us claims court judge reginald gibson ruled on thursday that 
the department may award the contract to no one but trw 
environmental safety systems inc trw was an unsuccessful bidder 
which sued on grounds that the departments means of selecting 
bechtel systems management inc as manager was improper and unfair 
over the short run i cant see that thats a dramatic impact 
on the program said rousso unless it forces the department to 
abandon its plans to put a single company bechtel or any other 
in charge of managing much of the project 
nuclear utilities are eager to see the repository built because 
some are being forced to spend millions of dollars to expand 
temporary waste storage facilities utilities customers pay 400 
million a year into a fund for the permanent dump 
rousso also reiterated his denial of one of trws main charges 
that his involvement in the contract award process was a conflict of 
interest trw asserted that the award was tainted by the fact that 
rousso worked for science applications international corp a 
bechtel subcontractor before joining the energy department 
rousso said he worked for science applications for seven months 
before joining the department in 1986 the yucca mountain contract 
proposal did not exist then he said adding that he has no 
continuing ties with science applications 
i hold no pension rights no favoritism no job promises no 
thoughts to that regard and i dont see where any conflict of 
interest has been shown he said

lords the governor confirmed monday 
there has been a general warning a general concern of 
highprofile public officials on the subject of drugs martinez 
told reporters weve been rather active in dealing with the drug 
issue 
the additional protection started this weekend after fdle agents 
were told by federal sources that colombian drug lords threatened a 
political assassination in the us if any of the targeted drug 
dealers were extradited from colombia martinez said 
earlier this year martinez traveled to colombia and other latin 
american countries to survey drugfighting efforts he also serves 
as the national governors association lead governor on substance 
abuse and drug trafficking

voyagers pictures of neptunes moon 
triton which revealed a unique world of icy volcanoes might have 
been washed out if not for lastminute adjustments to the 
spacecrafts cameras nasa says 
it wouldnt have wiped out the mission but would have made a 
lot of photographs embarrassingly overexposed said rich terrile 
an astronomer at the national aeronautics and space administrations 
jet propulsion laboratory it would have been an incredible 
disappointment 
they would have been white images voyager project scientist 
edward stone said monday 
meanwhile scientists said the spacecraft found that triton is 
the coldest body ever measured in the solar system and that neptune 
has something in common with los angeles smog 
only days before voyager made its closest approach to neptune 
last thursday and zipped past triton on friday scientists 
recognized that the frosty surface of neptunes largest moon 
reflected much more light than originally expected said mary beth 
murrill a jpl spokeswoman 
engineers compensated by sending voyager new computer commands 
reducing the exposure time on its television cameras from 668 
seconds to 384 seconds for the best closeups of triton murrill 
said 
those photographs revealed that giant craters called calderas 
once oozed an icy form of lava that flooded thousands of square 
miles of lunar terrain they also found what scientists believe are 
active ice volcanoes that explosively propel frozen nitrogen 
particles 20 miles skyward 
during its neptune encounter voyagers cameras discovered six 
moons in addition to triton and nereid which were discovered from 
earth they also found three thin rings of debris and five broad 
rings encircling the solar systems fourthlargest planet 
nasa engineers are investigating the feasibility of reprogramming 
voyager to take a snapshot of the entire solar system sometime in 
the coming months said lanny miller manager of the flight 
engineering office 
by 9 pm pdt tonight voyager will be 276 billion miles from 
earth and 455 million miles behind neptune speeding toward the 
edge of the solar system at 37568 mph 
voyager 2s ultraviolet detector determined tritons surface 
temperature is 400 degrees below zero fahrenheit making the moon 
the coldest body we have seen in the solar system said roger 
yelle of the university of arizona 
scientists believe pluto and its moon charon are the 
secondcoldest bodies in the solar system 
voyager also found smog on neptune 
sunlight hitting natural gas or methane high in the planets 
atmosphere converts it into a 90milethick icy layer of 
photochemical smog at the bottom of neptunes stratosphere said jim 
pollock an imaging team member from nasas ames research center in 
mountain view calif 
photochemical smog exists any place weve been that has an 
atmosphere imaging team leader bradford smith said of other 
planets and moons 
in los angeles the problem is its happening way down low 
where we have to breathe it in amounts exceeding anything weve seen 
except on titan he said referring to saturns smoggy moon 
in another finding the best closeup shot of the neptunian moon 
1989 n1 showed it has a huge crater half the width of its 
lumpylooking 240milewide surface 
that indicates that a big meteorite once smacked into 1989 n1 
one of the six moons discovered by voyager since june smith said 
voyager found earlier that 1989 n1 really is neptunes 
secondlargest moon after triton scientists previously thought 
nereid was no 2 
instruments aboard voyager discovered neptune is encircled by 
electrically charged particles that form a giant doughnut shape 
called a torus 
the torus is created by gases coming off of triton said ralph 
mcnutt of the massachusetts institute of technology jupiter is 
orbited by a similar torus of sulfur particles spewed by sulfur 
volcanoes on the jovian moon io 
the space probe also found neptune and triton have auroras 
vaguely like earths northern and southern lights they glow in 
ultraviolet light wavelengths invisible to the human eye however 
unlike earths visible auroras 
voyagers close encounter with neptune last week capped its epic 
tour of the four outer planets including jupiter saturn and 
uranus the probe was launched in 1977 along with its twin voyager 
1 which explored only jupiter and saturn

foreign producers are seeing some of the bloom 
fade from the lucrative us oats market as american farmers rebound 
from last years drought according to an agriculture department 
report 
the united states has been the worlds largest importer of oats 
since 198384 including a spectacular increase the last two or 
three years as consumers discovered the grains health benefits 
research has linked the fiber content of oats with lower serum 
cholesterol levels and health concerns have buoyed the demand for 
oat food products the report said 
in the 198889 marketing year that ended may 31 us oats 
imports rose to about 68 million bushels or nearly 1 million metric 
tons a 50 percent increase from 198788 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 689 bushels 
of oats a bushel of oats weights 32 pounds little more than half 
that of wheat 
oats imports in 198990 are forecast to settle back to around 50 
million bushels or about 725000 tons but the united states is 
expected to remain as the dominant buyer in the world market the 
report said 
the usda estimates that food use of oats in 198889 jumped more 
than 40 percent from the previous year but that the amount of oats 
used as livestock feed has been declining because of its relative 
high price relative to corn 
oats production this year is expected to rise 74 percent from the 
droughtstricken 1988 harvest to 381 million bushels or about 553 
million tons according to usda forecasts 
this likely will mean season average farm prices 25 percent to 
40 percent below last year the report said imports are 
expected to drop 25 percent but at this level us imports 
would still account for about half the volume of world trade 
forecast to 198990 
the report published in the september issue of agricultural 
outlook said no significant increases in oats imports by other 
countries are expected 
while interest in the health qualities of oats may be growing 
in other countries this has not yet translated into significantly 
higher import demand for foodquality oats the report said 
economist pete riley said in his report that global export 
supplies of oats in 198990 are expected to be adequate to meet 
us demand and that even if market prices drop significantly the 
major suppliers are likely to continue producing for the us 
market 
canada and sweden have been the biggest suppliers since the us 
oats boom began but argentina and finland also are providers some 
oats were bought from poland last year after finland turned out a 
poor harvest 
riley said that even if us production turns out as forecast 
the proportion of top quality oats is not assured and that a 
shortage of highquality oats suitable for milling count still push 
imports higher than currently expected 
the usda says oats prices nationally may average in the range of 
155 to 195 per bushel in 198990 compared with 261 estimated 
for 198889

officials of us cities say they need real 
commitments from the federal government to deal with problems 
affecting children including child care drugs and teenage 
pregnancy 
we need help and we need it now said james p moran jr 
mayor of alexandria va and a member of the national league of 
cities 
we also need real commitments over the long run not the kind 
of federal aid that is here one year and gone the next 
the league released a 390city survey monday that found officials 
in nine of 10 cities regard child care as the most pressing need 
among childrens issues 
this report is a sobering slap of reality that should awaken 
our national conscience said moran chairman of the leagues 
human development policy committee 
in cities between 50000 and 100000 population alcohol and 
drugs were rated as the second most pressing issue named by 48 
percent of those questioned 
education especially dropout prevention and health were second 
among cities between 100000 and 300000 population with 41 percent 
of those responding mentioning each 
in larger cities however the prevention of teenage pregnancy 
became the second most serious problem cited by 43 percent 
nearly half of the cities under 300000 and 70 percent of the 
larger cities said lack of money was the chief barrier to dealing 
with such problems 
some cities the report said already are taking steps to deal 
with the problems 
jacksonville fla in cooperation with barnett bank and the 
state department of health and rehabilitiative services developed a 
program to train mothers on welfare to operate family daycare homes 
in spokane wash a teen pregnancy prevention task force has 
sponsored an annual conference for teens on sexuality and is working 
on a community action plan 
boise idaho funds 10 apartments and places homeless families 
with children in them for up to two months rentfree 
in oakland calif an advisory council of children and adults 
advises the city council on young peoples issues 
from coast to coast cities are working on these issues in 
innovative ways the report said they predict their involvement 
will increase over time except there is no money to support 
expansion 
one city out of four is significantly involved in child care and 
the report said that is expected to increase to one in three during 
the 1990s 
the study covered 278 cities with populations above 50000 and 
112 smaller cities 
moran said the survey of larger cities covering 60 percent of 
all those in the nation was much broader than that for the smaller

common theyre both on the cover of the latest issue of tv guide 
and neither is pleased 
appearing under the headline oprah the richest woman on tv 
the magazines cover illustration has the talkshow hosts face 
superimposed on the actress hourglass figure 
the cover which appears to show miss winfrey in a gauzy dress 
atop a pile of money is not identified as a composite tv guide 
acknowledged monday that unsuspecting readers might think its a 
real photograph 
the lean body came from a publicity shot of annmargret for a 
rockette special she did about 10 years ago according to her 
publicist george kirvay i think she was shocked kirvay said 
if you look at the two pictures theyre identical its even her 
ring on oprahs hand 
the formerly overweight miss winfrey who lost 67 pounds on a 
diet in 1988 had no part in the covers making said christine 
tardio a spokeswoman for miss winfreys harpo production company 
oprah would not pose on a pile of money like that nor would she 
pose in that revealing a dress she said 
annmargret should be thrilled because shes got another tv

editor and oprah should be thrilled because she looks terrific 
but sendler said tv guide had instructed the artist who did the

gene smith spokesman for los angelesbased us borax co which 
owns part of the mine said the robbers carted off the loot using a 
wheelbarrow and truck and then left spikes in the road to flatten 
tires of any pursuers 
it was well planned thats for sure he said in a telephone 
interview they knew what they were doing 
a man wearing a red ski mask and armed with a 12gauge shotgun 
confronted two mine employees tied them with duct tape and then 
loaded up 125 tons of silver buttons wheelbarrow by wheelbarrow 
onto a pickup truck outside pershing county undersheriff bill davis 
said 
the robber was about 6foot4 and his accomplice was either a

the united states cut its trade deficit with 
western europe japan and industrialized countries of the far east 
in the first half of 1989 but increased its deficit with third 
world countries 
thats the kind of development many economists have been urging 
saying the united states buys too much from advanced industrial 
countries and sells them too little 
poorer nations want to expand their sales in the united states 
and cut imports 
if the second half of the year is like the first the deficit 
with western europe will be only 45 billion compared with 158 
billion last year according to a commerce department report 
released monday no breakdown was given for individual european 
countries 
with the four industrialized areas of the far east known as the 
four tigers hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan the 
decrease in the deficit would be 65 billion to 227 billion 
those countries have allowed the value of their currencies to rise 
making their goods less attractive in the united states and 
encouraging exports 
the projected drop in the deficit with japan however is only 
18 billion leaving its deficit at 509 billion 
some economists think the trend wont continue 
this is the end of the good news in trade said michael 
evans head of a washington forecasting company 
david wyss of drimcgraw hill said the growth of exports had 
slowed with the rise of the price of the dollar over the past 18 
months the increased cost of the dollar in terms of yen and marks 
for example should make american goods less attractive to japanese 
and west germans 
the changes in the projected balance are due to exports 
increasing at a rate of 15 percent to western europe 14 percent to 
japan and 7 percent to the four tigers 
us deficits were increasing at a rate of 7 billion with opec 
countries 1 billion with china and 200 million with mexico 
us sales of farm goods were growing more rapidly 13 percent 
than minerals and manufactured products 12 percent there was a 24 
percent surge in imports of petroleum which is coming in at the 
fastest rate since 1985 and at higher prices 
other kinds of imports increased more slowly though mexican 
sales showed a strong increase of 14 percent to a rate of 29 
billion from japan the increased rate was only 4 percent and 6 
percent from hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan 
in the second quarter march through june us farm exports were 
almost unchanged from the first quarter drops in sales of wheat to 
the soviet union soybeans to western europe and tobacco to japan 
were offset by increased sales of feed grains to south korea and 
taiwan 
other kinds of exports increased by 4 percent led by chemicals 
and aircraft to western europe 
imports of passenger cars dropped sharply in the quarter 37 
percent from west germany and 9 percent from japan however us 
manufacturers increased production in mexico which sent 31 percent 
more vehicles across the border

the state department is opposing palestine 
liberation organization membership in a world tourism group 
it was not clear however that us opposition would derail the 
move being discussed at a meeting of the world tourism organization 
in paris because the united states doesnt have veto power 
the bush administration could discourage the move by withholding 
financial support the united states which covers 4 percent to 5 
percent of the organizations budget is contributing 330000 this 
year 
the plo applied for membership july 7 for palestine 
in our view the selfdeclared state of palestine which we do 
not recognize does not meet the generally accepted criteria under 
international law for statehood and thus does not qualify for 
membership in international organizations state department

motorized seat belts 
the national highway traffic safety administration on monday gave 
avanti automotive corp a twoyear reprieve from the passive 
restraint requirement saying it agreed complying would cause 
substantial economic hardship 
the decision was criticized by airbag proponent clarence ditlow 
director of the nonprofit center for auto safety 
we feel that air bags are such an important lifesaving 
technology that there shouldnt be any exemptions from the 
standard he said its just one of those decisions that is so 
dumb it speaks for itself 
in seeking the exemption avanti said convertibles comprise 
twothirds of its sales and noted that the small company is very 
important to youngstown ohio a oncethriving steel center 
suffering through a long period of high unemployment 
the company which intends to produce about 200 convertibles a 
year had asked for a threeyear exemption the base price of the 
convertible is 47982

senate calls to close us military 
bases in two years have increased pressure on president corazon 
aquino and set the stage for difficult talks with washington on the 
future of the strategically important installations 
mrs aquino has refused to say whether she favors keeping the six 
us bases which employ more than 70000 filipinos but opposition 
sen juan ponce enrile one of the cosponsors of a resolution 
seeking the base closures said the proposal is aimed at forcing her 
to take a stand 
us and filipino officials are to begin talks later this year on 
a new treaty to replace the military bases agreement which expires 
in september 1991 mrs aquino is expected to discuss the issue when 
she visits washington in november 
that senate resolution looks like the genie out of the 
bottle wrote former presidential spokesman teodoro benigno in the 
philippine daily star and it will take a lot of political genius 
on the part of the aquino administration to put the genie back in 
the bottle 
twelve senators sponsored the resolution last thursday under the 
constitution any agreement must be approved by twothirds of the 
23member senate so the resolution shows the aquino administration 
lacks the votes for ratification 
us officials claim the installations including clark air base 
and the subic bay naval base are essential for maintaining the 
military balance in the far east and protecting sea lanes to 
prowestern nations such as japan singapore and thailand 
about 40000 us troops military dependents and civilian 
employees are stationed at the bases among the oldest and largest 
us garrisons abroad 
assuming mrs aquino supports an extension she has a number of 
options for pressuring the senate into ratification most political 
surveys indicate a majority of filipinos support the bases which 
pay more than 96 million in local salaries annually 
but the senates view reflects that of the nationalistic urban 
classes which see the bases as a vestige of colonialism political 
analysts say mrs aquino could call for a referendum on the bases 
and then pressure the senate into accepting the national will 
mrs aquino could also use a discrepancy between us and 
filipino interpretation of the expiration date 
the constitution says the agreement expires in 1991 but us 
officials say the agreement actually says that after sept 16 1991 
either side can terminate with oneyears notice without 
notification the agreement runs indefinitely they say 
us ambassador nicholas platt prefers to sidestep the ambiguity 
saying he would like a new agreement negotiated and ratified before 
the 1991 cutoff 
faced with senate rejection the aquino administration could 
delay the ratification vote until after a new congress is elected in 
may 1992 four months before the end of the notification period 
in any event most analysts see long and difficult negotiations 
before any new agreement can be forged this is due in part to a 
wide gap between us and filipino views of the bases 
to washington the bases are americas contribution to the 
defense of the philippines a commitment that transcends dollars and 
cents because the bases are here the united states would defend 
the philippines with american blood 
as an island people hundreds of miles removed from the asian 
mainland filipinos do not perceive an external threat to them the 
threat is internal communist and moslem insurgents in those 
conflicts the bases are irrelevant 
therefore filipino officials view the bases as a business deal 
a means of luring us economic aid 
she is not probases per se wrote benigno of mrs aquino 
like many filipinos she is probases only because she is 
convinced she can use the bases for extracting the maximum 
assistance or rental from the americans 
platt however says the united states is not prepared to pay 
more last october washington agreed to pay 461 million a year to 
keep the bases until 1991 
i told them that if they are waiting for foreign aid to more 
than double they have a long wait coming said rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo who visited the philippines this month either 
a base is necessary for mutual defense or it is not

the threat of court and legislative action to 
restrict or outlaw abortion is leading some women to consider 
reviving an old underground movement that performed clandestine 
abortions 
the group called jane after a pseudonym some of the women used 
at the time performed as many as 13000 abortions in the four 
years before the us supreme court legalized the procedure in 1973 
said former organizer jody howard 
the high courts decision july 3 allowing states to place 
restrictions on abortions and the threat of further court 
restrictions may make it necessary to revive the group said ms 
howard and ruth surgal another key jane member 
its time for new people to move in a new generation said 
ms howard 48 now a freelance writer i will do everything in my 
power to teach them everything i know but i would hope it wouldnt 
be necessary 
jane believed to have been the only group of its kind in the 
united states involved about 120 chicagoarea women who were 
trained in some cases by sympathetic doctors to perform abortions 
they worked clandestinely from 1969 to 1972 under constant threat of 
arrest 
already courts are making it harder the laws may make it 
illegal but women are going to keep it available im convinced 
ms howard said 
at a recent prochoice march in washington she said a number of 
women from various states said they would establish similar 
underground groups and take the movement nationwide if abortion were 
outlawed again 
its easier if you have a role model somehow because it gives 
people courage said ms surgal 51 
andrew scholberg assistant director of the chicagobased 
prolife action league said his group would battle any attempt to 
revive an underground abortion network 
well see to it that theyre prosecuted to the fullest extent 
of the law he said well have spies well have to have people 
claiming to be seeking out abortions to find out who the illegal 
abortionists are so they can be punished 
in addition he challenged the ability of jane members to perform 
abortions safely 
i seriously doubt their safety record he said no abortion 
is safe because it always kills the baby 
women who were active in the group said 3 percent of treated 
women developed complications usually infections but that no women 
died 
statistics from the alan guttmacher institute the new yorkbased 
research branch of planned parenthood placed the complication rate 
for abortions performed by doctors at about 1 percent 
seven jane members were arrested in 1972 despite frequent changes 
in locations where the abortions were performed the charges were 
dropped after the roe vs wade ruling that legalized abortion 
ms howard said she would risk going to jail to give women the 
freedom to choose abortion 
whats more important my staying out of jail or a woman having 
to have an abortion she said

backlash from colombian drug lords under pressure 
there has been a general warning a general concern of 
highprofile public officials on the subject of drugs martinez 
said monday the florida department of law enforcement just feels 
a little bit more comfortable at least in these next few days 
being a little more cautious 
the bolstered protection began late friday after state agents 
were tipped by federal sources that colombian drug lords had 
threatened a political assassination in the united states if any of 
the targeted drug dealers were extradited from colombia martinez 
said 
the governor said his recent trip to south america to survey 
drugfighting efforts made him a prime target he also serves as the 
national governors associations leader on substance abuse and drug 
trafficking 
last friday martinez asked attorney general richard thornburgh 
to extradite 25 florida drug fugitives should they be arrested by 
colombian authorities 
i recognize the importance of the united states doing all it 
can to ensure that the drug merchants who threaten our society are 
brought to justice martinez wrote 
martinez said he understood the threat against american officials 
was tied to the scheduled extradition wednesday of a colombian drug 
dealer 
brian ballard director of operations for martinez said the 
governors public schedule which is normally published days in 
advance for distribution to the press will now be on a daytoday 
basis

gotten a real immediate response sgt lynda edmonds a sheriffs 
spokeswoman said monday people get threatened all the time but 
thats a fact of life

secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
says he plans to contact the usbacked nicaraguan rebels to obtain 
their cooperation with a peace plan calling for their disarmament 
five central american nations have asked the united nations to 
monitor the voluntary disbanding of up to 11000 contras camped in 
honduras and the repatriation of as many as 12000 of their 
dependents 
they are asking us to monitor operations to disarm the 
opposition and that is something that is very complicated and is 
not very much in our practice perez de cuellar said after 
briefing the security council on monday 
that is why i need assurances that if we send people there 
there is cooperation from the resistance forces he said 
the presidents of nicaragua el salvador honduras guatemala and 
costa rica signed an accord aug 7 calling for the disbanding of the 
contras 90 days after a joint resettlement mission of un and 
organization of american states representatives is formed 
well be in contact with the resistance to find ways and means 
to be in touch with them in order to have assurances from them that 
they will accept disarming to give their arms to the united 
nations the un chief said 
these contacts will take place as soon as possible he added 
the secretarygeneral of the oas joao clemente baena soares of 
brazil and perez de cuellar announced friday they will launch the 
mission sept 6 
by having the international support and verification 
commission begin its work on that date the oas and un chiefs 
set dec 5 as the target date for the voluntary repatriation 
numerous contra field commanders and guerrillas have vowed they 
will not give up their fight 
a un diplomat active in central american affairs however said 
preliminary talks with the contras indicate they are quite willing 
to go home or be resettled and said little resistance is expected 
the united states had lobbied the central american nations to 
allow the contras to stay in their camps through the feb 25 
national elections in nicaragua to maintain pressure on the leftist 
sandinista government to allow a fair campaign 
even honduras however which has received lavish military and 
foreign aid from washington agreed earlier this month there was no 
justification to continue their mission 
the united states gives the contras 45 million a month in 
nonlethal aid that may also be used for resettlement 
congress cut off funds for weapons last year prompting the 
contras to arrange a truce with nicaraguas government last year 
since then they have launched only sporadic raids

investigators looking into the nations worst 
oil spill and parties to litigation arising from it have started 
inspecting the exxon valdez the supertanker that caused the 
disaster 
drucella andersen a washington dcbased spokeswoman for the 
national transportation safety board said two of the agencys 
investigators arrived monday at a san diego shipyard to begin their 
anticipated fiveday inspection 
the valdez is in a national steel and shipbuilding co dry dock 
for a ninemonth repair job estimated to cost 25 million 
the ships hull was shredded causing about 11 million gallons of 
crude to spill into alaskan waters when it struck a reef march 24 
in prince william sound 
andersen said the inspection is the first look at the tankers 
hull outside of the water since the grounding the inspectors 
findings will be included in the ntsb report on the spill which is 
expected to be finished early next year she said 
others in san diego to examine the valdez are an alaskan state 
investigator and representatives of exxon shipping co and the 
alyeska pipeline service co a consortium of seven oil companies 
that includes exxon said andersen 
the state of alaska is suing exxon in connection with the spill 
which devastated hundreds of miles of pristine shoreline and killed 
scores of waterfowl and marine wildlife alyeska also is a defendant 
in the case 
les rogers an exxon spokesman in houston said the inspections 
are being conducted because the vessel itself is considered 
evidence and they want a firsthand look at it 
he declined to elaborate because of the pending litigation 
shipyard workers will begin repairing the ships damaged hull 
after the inspections are complete 
we cant start work until then because of certain court 
orders that restrict any work that would cut or modify the ship 
said fred hallett nasscos vice president of finance and public 
relations 
engineering procurement and fabrication of steel outside the 
ship are continuing so we are still proceeding with the job we 
just cant proceed with the rip out of the damaged sections of the 
hull 
the valdez was towed from alaska arriving off the san diego 
coast july 10 it was kept from entering san diego bay for three 
weeks however because of oily slicks sighted near the ship when it 
reached southern california 
huge steel plates that were peeled downward from the hull during 
the 2500mile journey also had to be cut off by divers at sea so 
they wouldnt drag bottom in the bay 
the tanker docked at a nassco pier july 30 after the 
environmental and navigational problems were fixed to the 
satisfaction of state and federal officials 
the valdez floated into a dock for the repair work aug 15 
pumping operations to remove water trapped inside the enclosed 
repair dock were completed friday the water was transferred to 
another exxon ship which will take it to a processing facility at 
an exxon refinery in northern california 
during the weekend shipyard workers washed down the dock to 
remove sand silt and marine growth the debris was put into barrels 
and trucked to a san diego hazardous waste dump for disposal 
the dock is now dry and clean so the appropriate individuals 
can inspect the ship hallett said

no more sniffing and prodding to tell if a 
melon is ripe government scientists have introduced a failsafe 
method the melon meter 
us department of agriculture researchers have developed an 
infrared device that measures the sugar content of watermelons 
cantaloupes and honeydews 
gerald dull a usda chemist in athens said 16 years of research 
yielded the melon meter which shines infrared light into the top of 
the fruit and then measures the amount of light that comes out the 
side 
the computerized device determines the amount of soluable solids 
based on how much light the fruit absorbs soluble solids are 
predominantly sugars 
the no 1 parameter of quality is sweetness dull said in an 
interview if you havent got sweetness you havent got a good 
melon 
growers and consumers currently have to rely on appearance in 
judging ripeness and quality dull said but similarlooking melons 
can vary from 5 percent to 10 percent in sweetness 
theres no one who can look at the outside and tell you whether 
that melon is good he said 
several companies have expressed an interesting in producing 
melon meters dull said and they probably will be installed 
initially in packing sheds where the fruit is graded packed and 
shipped 
he believes they will appeal to suppliers who want to provide 
consumers with the highest quality melons 
i think were just opening the door on analyzing fresh 
produce he said with computers and highspeed equipment we 
might be able to get down to measuring the vitamins

the former interior minister of cuba faces a 
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison in a drug and corruption 
scandal the official cuban news agency prensa latina reported 
divison gen jose abrantes fernandez also faces demotion from 
general to private the news agency said in a dispatch monitored 
monday in mexico city the dispatch did not say when a verdict was 
expected 
abrantes was tried on charges of abusing power neglecting his 
duties and enriching himself by stealing from the government prensa 
latina said 
prosecutors requested the stiff sentence sunday at the end of 
four days of testimony before a military tribunal 
the trial is the latest chapter in a drug trafficking scandal 
that has shaken the caribbean island disrupted the nations 
reputation for communist discipline and sent four officers to the 
firing squad one of them was a highly decorated war hero 
the tribunal also was asked for sentences ranging from eight to 
15 years in prison for six other ministry officials including the 
former vice interior minister and the former head of customs the 
news agency said 
the defendants are accused of using their government posts for 
private gain the prosecution asked the tribunal to confiscate the 
profits 
castro fired abrantes as interior minister in june when 12 
military officers from the ministry and two from the army were 
charged with drug smuggling and other crimes four were executed and 
the others are serving up to 30 years in prison 
the prosecution said abrantes fumbled the drugtrafficking 
investigation so badly that his mistakes appeared deliberate but it 
said the evidence did not support a charge of treason prensa latina 
said 
abrantes knew as early as february that officials of his ministry 
were involved in drug trafficking but did nothing about it the 
prosecution charged 
castro had personally ordered abrantes to conduct the 
investigation after persistent reports that tons of colombian 
cocaine and jamaican marijuana were moving through cuba to the 
united states 
the prosecution asked the tribunal to sentence the former vice 
interior minister division gen pascual martinez gil to 15 years 
and demote him to private for abuse of power and stealing from the 
government 
it requested a 13year sentence for bribery and abuse of power 
for lt col oscar carreno gomez former head of customs and said 
he should be demoted to the rank of foot soldier 
abrantes carreno gomez and four others are accused of taking 
money from some of the officers arrested in june prensa latina said 
abrantes allegedly accumulated millions of dollars in an illegal 
fund set up at the ministry 
the chief prosecutor felipe aleman cruz said he was so consumed 
with dollar fever that he traded cuban pesos on the black market 
for his own profit 
castro who has for years denied us charges of cuban complicity 
in the drug trade said the officers involved in narcotics were 
traitors to his cause

baseball commissioner a bartlett giamatti said 
the agreement banning pete rose from baseball leaves giamatti free 
to express his opinion that the former cincinnati reds manager bet 
on baseball 
but rose said he felt doublecrossed by giamattis remarks made 
during the news conference last thursday at new york in which the 
commissioner announced roses lifetime banishment 
just 12 hours earlier we signed that agreement in good faith 
and there he was saying he thinks i bet on baseball rose told the 
cincinnati post in an interview published monday 
the only reason i signed that agreement was that it had no 
finding that i bet on baseball we got what we wanted and we didnt 
have to go another eight months and spend another threequarters of 
a million dollars rose said 
on monday giamatti said that rose appeared to misunderstand the 
agreement 
i was very clear about the fact that i was not going to be 
constrained from saying what i thought was the case giamatti told 
the associated press by telephone from cape cod mass im not 
going to change anything i said 
giamatti asked at the news conference whether he thought rose 
had bet on baseball replied based on the evidence and in the 
absence of a hearing i have concluded that yes he bet on 
baseball 
deputy commissioner francis vincent jr and roses lawyer 
reuven katz drafted the agreement which includes a stipulation 
that rose neither admits nor denies betting on baseball 
katz acknowledged that vincent had told him what giamattis 
reponse would be to a question about whether rose bet on baseball 
thats true he did katz said maybe i misunderstood 
maybe i wasnt altogether clear on what mr giamatti would say i 
think that i was surprised that giamattis statement was that 
strong that he put it that way and that it came so fast 
giamatti said he based his opinion on the 225page report by 
baseball investigator john dowd the agreement noted that baseball 
rules allow rose to apply for reinstatement after a year but dont 
guarantee that he can return 
rose said hes considering a television appearance to tell his 
side of the story 
weve got some good minds working on it rose said the key 
thing is well tell the story and let the people decide but i 
dont know how im going to do it 
the internal revenue service and a federal grand jury in 
cincinnati are reportedly investigating whether rose illegally 
concealed winnings from gambling or sales of memorabilia 
the fbi has dropped an earlier reported investigation of rose

one of leona helmsleys bodyguards was found in 
the hotel where the jurors in her tax evasion trial were sequestered 
and rode the elevator with one juror according to a report today 
but there was an innocent explanation and both the government 
and court are satisfied assistant us attorney james devita told 
the new york post 
the 12member jury in leona helmsleys tax evasion and extortion 
trial was heading into a fourth day of deliberations today 
mrs helmsley 69 is charged with evading 12 million in 
federal taxes by charging personal expenses including renovations 
at her connecticut mansion to her businesses 
devita and defense attorney gerald feffer would not say why the 
unnamed bodyguard was in the hotel friday night 
in court papers us district court judge john walker told 
feffer to convey to his client to tell her people to stay out of 
the hotel 
needless to say this is not a helmsley hotel walker said 
leona helmsley and her husband harry are among the biggest owners of 
hotels and other real estate in new york 
the judge said a federal marshal was escorting a juror back to 
her hotel room after dinner friday when one of mrs helmsleys 
security guards got on the same elevator 
the marshal purposely pushed the elevator button for the wrong 
floor so the guard would not know which floor the juror was staying 
on according to the judge in the transcript 
the juror misunderstanding the situation pushed the correct 
button however the juror and the guard got off the elevator on 
different floors 
if the helmsley security people think they are doing their 
client a favor by investigating where the jurors are the rooms the 
jurors are staying in or what floor the jurors are staying in or a 
particular hotel they are not walker said 
two helmsley guards appeared before the judge but the transcript 
of the hearing including the identity of the guard in question was 
sealed

thirty officers and seven civilians were injured 
when rowdy youths ended an otherwise peaceful afrocaribbean 
carnival by pelting police with cans and bottles authorities said 
today 
scotland yard said 37 were injured and 250 arrested during the 
twoday carnival in the notting hill district that ended monday 
night after drawing about 500000 people 
st john ambulance however said it treated 269 people 21 of 
them policemen during the festival fifty people were 
hospitalized although there was nothing of a serious nature a 
spokesman said 
one officer was stabbed but was not seriously hurt said the 
yard headquarters of the london police 
the yard said charges against those arrested included possession 
of weapons and drugs and disorderly behavior 
it blamed groups of youths determined to provoke disorder for 
violence in the carnivals closing hours when police were struck by 
tossed cans and bottles 
police with riot shields tackled the rampaging youths the yard 
said about 5000 officers were on the streets some on horseback 
and a police helicopter was overhead as the violence flared 
the clashes took place at the close of what was earlier called 
the most peaceful of the afrocaribbean festivals that have been 
held for 24 years during the late august threeday bank holiday 
weekend 
deputy assistant police commissioner charles rideout said the day 
had been most successful until the clashes 
police estimated 200000 people on sunday and 300000 on monday 
jammed the streets to see the spectacularly dressed paraders street 
performers and bands in what has become a cultural focal point for 
londons black community 
riots muggings and other violence marred previous festivals and 
a man was fatally stabbed in 1987 
conservative lawmaker terry dicks said the carnival should be 
banned because of the cost of policing it which he estimated at 
156 million this year 
there were probably more police on the streets monitoring the 
carnival than there were throughout the rest of london it is 
outrageous that we should have to pay for this dicks said

leaders of the evangelical lutheran church 
in americas pensions board say they may not be able to comply with 
churchs insistence on rapid divestment from companies operating in 
south africa 
whether the law will permit us to follow this churchwide 
directive i cant answer said investment specialist john kapanke 
of minneapolis president of the board 
the denominations legislative assembly on monday voted that by 
september 1991 the board of pensions be completely rid of stocks in 
companies with direct or indirect business dealings in south 
africa 
an estimated 80 to 85 percent of the 1041 delegates voted for 
the deadline in a showofcards vote at stake was the churchs 16 
billion pension fund of which 849 million is invested in 
companies doing business in south africa 
kapanke and mildred berg of new york city chair of the board 
pointed out the board was incorporated separately from the church 
and thus was not legally bound by its instructions although sharing 
its purposes and principles 
the board has a right not to accept it if we feel it is 
violating our fiduciary responsibility ms berg said at a news 
conference but we take that mandate seriously in regard to 
investments 
the vote by delegates of the newly merged 53 millionmember 
denomination is intended to put pressure on south africa to end its 
apartheid system of race separation 
it puts teeth into our concern the rev joseph ellwanger of 
milwaukee said of the deadline he said if the church cant hear 
the voices of blacks crying for justice above the call of profit 
yield then it doesnt mean anything to be called the body of 
christ 
before the vote kapanke said a deadline threatened financial 
responsibility 
it puts us in an almost impossible situation to act in a 
prudent way kapanke said to introduce controls over 
investing of funds he said jeopardizes them and increases risk 
ms berg said the time limit imposed for the divestment process 
was too short we would have great difficulty accomplishing that 
goal we do recognize the frustration of the church about it 
fortyfour of the 65 regional synods had demanded total 
divestment from south africa as had predecessor denominations of 
the merged body but none had fixed a deadline for it 
the assembly entering the next to last day of an eightday 
meeting also approved a major longrange program called mission 
90 to strengthen bible teaching evangelism and work for the cause 
of peace and justice 
the meeting is the first since the 1988 merger of the lutheran 
church in america the american lutheran church and the association 
of evangelical lutheran churches

at a funeral for slain black panther 
cofounder huey newton friends called his death a clarion call 
to free black communities of drugrelated violence and mourners 
chanted free huey a reminder of an earlier period of militancy 
his problem with chemical dependency represents all our 
weaknesses in america said newtons friend and fellow panther 
david hilliard during the service monday 
among the 1200 people attending the service at the allen temple 
baptist church were h rap brown leader of the student nonviolent 
coordinating committee and panther cofounder bobby seale hundreds 
of others milled around in the streets outside 
many in the congregation gave raisedfist salutes when seale 52 
donned a black beret and said all power to the people during his 
turn at the pulpit 
the mourners left the church chanting free huey the refrain 
that sounded during newtons frequent imprisonments beginning in the 
1960s 
newton 47 was killed early aug 22 in the poor west oakland 
neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years 
ago police said newton died in a dispute over crack cocaine 
while hilliard said newtons violent death should be used as a 
clarion call to solve national problems with drugs and alcohol 
many of the mourners remembered newton as a hero of the bold and 
belligerent black pride movement 
members of newtons family friends and fellow radicals recalled 
the days when the black panthers espoused the cause of black 
liberation and the power of the gun against white authority 
johnny spain a former black panther who recently won a new trial 
in the 1971 killings of two prison guards spoke at the funeral 
about problems still facing blacks 
after the dust clears and next week little kids say huey 
who remember that in someones community a human being was 
gunned down and that should serve as a notice that theres a lot of 
work to do said spain 40 who joined the panthers while serving 
time at san quentin prison 
newton and seale founded the black panther party in oakland in 
1966 as the partys minister of defense and chief ideologue newton 
became one of the most articulate leaders of the black militancy 
movement 
the panthers embraced maoist political theory and espoused the 
use of arms for defense against police whom they called racist a 
black panther poster distributed nationally during the orgnizations 
heyday pictured newton sitting on an african wicker throne a spear 
in one hand a shotgun in the other 
many of newtons admirers discounted police accounts and blamed 
his death on authorities with whom newton battled for decades 
newton had a long criminal history including a manslaughter 
conviction in the 1967 shooting death of a police officer he was 
freed after 22 months when an appellate court sent the case back to 
trial court 
while in prison in march on a narcotics paraphernalia possession 
charge newton received a suspended twoyear sentence in connection 
with the theft of 15000 in state funds from community schools 
operated by the panthers 
tyrone robinson 25 who is accused of shooting newton appeared 
in court briefly monday and was ordered by alameda county municipal 
court judge horace wheatley to return sept 5 to enter a plea 
robinson allegedly shot newton with a companions gun after 
pistolwhipping the former panther leader with his own gun which 
jammed the san francisco examiner reported today 
being struck with the gun would explain the trauma to the right 
side of newtons face the report said quoting from a detailed 
log of the investigation kept by oakland homicide sgt dan mercado 
then robinson wrestled the witness gun away from him because 
robinsons gun jammed mercado said and robinson fired three 
times striking newton

firstclass letters will probably cost 28 to 32 
cents to mail in three years and could include an 11digit zip code 
by the turn of the century says the postmaster general 
increased automation and other economies at the us postal 
service will most likely keep price increases for mailing a letter 
below inflation after 1991 postmaster general anthony frank said 
monday 
speaking at the opening of a threeday convention of major 
northeastern largevolume mailers frank said the actual increase 
for a firstclass stamp by 1991 might be 5 cents to a total of 30 
cents 
ill point out that 5 cents is a 20 percent increase in three 
years which is more or less the amount that the costs have gone up 
over the last three years frank said 
the cost of mailing a firstclass letter rose from 22 cents to 25 
cents in the spring of 1988 an increase in 1991 would continue the 
recent policy of increases every three years 
frank said that after running a surplus last fiscal year the 
postal service will be hard pressed to break even in the current 
year and faces the greatest deficit in its existence up to 17 
billion in fiscal 1990 
automation will cost the postal service 4 billion between now 
and 1995 but will save having to hire 100000 workers he said 
new machines exist that can scan nine miles of mail an hour and 
can spot a bar code anywhere on the face of an envelope even one 
sandwiched into a cluttered address block or placed amid graphics 
and colorful designs 
scanners now in use at post offices can pick up a bar code only 
on the lower right hand side of an envelope isolated from the 
address block and other print 
frank said the postal service wants to have ninedigit bar coding 
on all mail by 1995 and will begin testing an 11digit code 
with the current ninedigit code the socalled zip plus 4 a 
piece of mail is automatically sorted to one or another side of a 
specific street in a given locale 
the 11digit code would sort a letter down to the building 
address in effect stacking the mail in delivery sequence for a 
carrier at the destination 
businesses that code their own mail would get substantial postage 
discounts frank said

the government in the aftermath of four child 
slayings blamed on the harmful effects of horror videos said today 
that it wants the video industry to regulate how its sells and rents 
violent tapes 
the spread of videos in japan has been remarkable in recent 
years and some feature brutality in the treatment of humans and 
animals and are seen clearly as inhumane kiyoshi mizuno 
directorgeneral of the management and coordination agency said in 
a statement 
mizuno who also heads the agencys youth affairs administration 
which works to prevent juvenile delinquency said he is concerned 
about how such videos affect young people 
mizuno urged the video industry strengthen its own regulations on 
the sale and rental of videos depicting cruelty he also urged local 
governments and youth organizations to study ways of regulating the 
sale of potentially harmful videos 
the request came after authorities said tsutomu miyazaki a 
26yearold print shop worker confessed to police investigators 
that he kidnapped and killed four girls aged 4 to 7 over the past 
year in a tokyo suburb 
news coverage of the case has focused repeatedly on his room 
filled with a collection of some 5000 videotapes including horror 
films and animation films showing violence and undressed girls 
investigators said one of the killings to which miyazaki has 
confessed followed the plot of one of his videotapes chiniku no 
hana flower of blood and flesh in which a man follows a girl in 
his car kidnaps her and then dismembers her in his apartment 
kyodo news service said the government would ask the video 
industry to designate videos with violent scenes as adults only 
as is done with pornographic videos in japan

the state will fight the deportation of a 
9yearold bangladeshi girl who was molested by the man who brought 
her to america 
more than 200 people marched to the state capitol on monday to 
express their opposition to deporting the youngster known as kushi 
and afterwards they were rewarded state officials said they would 
try to obtain an education visa for the girl allowing her to stay 
indefinitely 
the girl was taken by state workers from a foster home last week 
because it wasnt culturally relevant the girls foster parents 
were among the marchers who demanded help for the youngster 
the state child protective services said it would review the case 
and fight deportation spokeswoman irene hopman said an education 
visa would be sought from the federal immigration and naturalization 
service she faces deportation when her visa expires sept 5 
the girl is one of several members of a bangladeshi family that 
stefan christopher 52 brought to this country a un consultant 
he had married one of the girls older sisters separated from her 
and married another sister age 12 over the years he brought family 
members to work on his oakville farm 
christopher is in jail awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty 
to taking indecent liberties with the girl and two other children 
sheriffs department officials said he subjected them to physical 
and psychological torture 
at the rally the foster parents chemical engineer bob martin 
and his wife english teacher betsy seidel wept when they were 
surrounded by supporters they had feared the state would allow 
kushi to be sent back to bangladesh where she would be outcast 
because of the sexual abuse 
kushi has a magic that touches everyone martin told the 
rally she certainly has touched us she was taken away from not 
only us but from the whole community 
betsy and i did everything we could within the system but it 
wasnt enough removing kushi was wrong just wrong martin said 
cps workers took khurshida kushi begum from the martinseidel 
home at hoquiam last friday declaring it wasnt culturally 
relevant 
kushi has been placed at least temporarily with her 19yearold 
sister here whose marriage gave the youngster entry to the united 
states 
supporters say if she is returned to her remote village she faces 
life as a social outcast because of her sexual abuse 
martin and seidel who have been her foster parents for a year 
had hoped to adopt the girl but they have been told they cannot 
keep her because they are not moslem and because the natural parents 
will not give her up for adoption 
the girls birth parents want her educated and raised in the 
united states but their sect does not believe in adoption and they 
have not relinquished their rights ms hopman said 
im sure she is bonded to them after the year she has been with 
them but this has to do with family reunification and with cultural 
relevancy ms hopman said 
if the placement with her sister morshida doesnt work out three 
moslem families have volunteered their homes ms hopman said 
kushi and her sister did not attend the rally monday fearing it 
would mean deportation of both said lee terry who sheltered the 
family during the initial investigation ms terry said morshida has 
major problems of her own to deal with and that the foster parents 
would be a better placement 
kushis brother sultan 21 who lives in seattle said in an 
interview that kushis parents dont mind if their daughter stays 
with martin and seidel 
they say its ok they dont know about this adoption this 
country is very hard my parents cant understand he said 
they said its ok if she happy he said

separate groups of blacks and hispanics began forming in various 
parts of the city and converged on landis avenue the main drag of 
the mostly white downtown section of vineland a city of about

windows were knocked out of a few police cars and a lot of 
civilian cars were smashed up pretty good 
gary vasell a manager of a seveneleven convenience store on 
landis avenue said he barely escaped injury 
i was looking through the window and all of a sudden bricks 
came flying through vasell said i started to run out the door 
and then more bricks came flying through so i just backed up and 
called the cops i thought maybe somebody was going to start firing 
shots i thought i was going to die 
smaller groups took to sidestreets and caused more damage

he threatened to kill the officer cassisi said the 
officer was in fear of his life 
the results of an autopsy are still out 
samuel l clark president of the cumberland county chapter of

justifiable shooting 
when the newspaper hit the street all hell broke loose said 
clark were trying to defuse a very volatile situation

clashes between the two largest groups 
of usbacked afghan guerrillas have left 300 people dead one of 
the groups and some independent sources said today a rival 
guerrilla group disputed the claim 
the battles reflect deteriorating relations among the 
pakistanbased guerrillas who have yet to capture an afghan city 
since the soviets withdrew their governmentallied forces more than 
six months ago 
hezbiislami a fundamentalist moslem group said 300 guerrillas 
were killed in fighting in northern afghanistan with the rival 
jamiatiislami group 
we dont have an updated figure but we know that 100 
hezbiislami mujahedeen islamic holy warriors have died and 200 
from jamiat said a hezb spokesman identified only as nasir 
however jamiat a more liberal moslem party called the claim 
baseless 
it said only that its men were holding five hezb prisoners 
including an important commander 
they were handed over by the local people because they are 
criminals said jamiat spokesman masoud khalili 
something is going on thats for sure said naim majrooh an 
independent afghan observer in peshawar pakistan both sides are 
involved its difficult to believe either one 
fazle akhbar another prominent afghan exile said his 
information indicated between 170 and 200 mujahedeen have died in 
the fighting 
radio kabul the official broadcaster of afghanistans marxist 
leaders has reported at least 556 mujahedeen killed in such clashes 
in seven provinces since aug 18 
however the radio monitored in islamabad is heavily slanted 
against the mujahedeen 
deeprooted antagonisms between the two leading guerrilla groups 
broke out july 9 in northern takhar province when hezb guerrillas 
under commander syed jamal ambushed and reportedly executed 32 
jamiat men including several jamiat commanders 
jamiat claims that local afghans captured jamal earlier this 
month and turned him over to jamiats northern commander ahmad shah 
masoud 
hezb claims jamal was captured by progovernment militamen who 
then handed him over to masoud because masoud had made some kind of 
deal with the kabul government 
since the takhar clash the president of the mujahedeens 
selfdeclared government sibghatullah mojaddidi has publicly 
called hezbs leader gulbaddin hekmatyar a killer mojaddidi 
is from the small moderate afghan national liberation front 
the growing dispute has rocked the rebels government which is 
composed of hezb jamiat and five other pakistanbased 
antigovernment groups 
the mujahedeen based mainly in pakistan and iran are fighting 
to topple the kabul government and replace it with a moslem regime 
hardline parties such as hezb and jamiat favor fighting for a 
military victory moderate mujahedeen groups have left the door open 
for a negotiated settlement 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan seized power 
in a 1978 military coup touching off the insurgency

former rep pat swindall hit the airwaves a few 
hours after he was sentenced to a year in prison and tried to 
convince skeptical listeners he deserves a new trial to reverse his 
perjury conviction 
swindall accompanied by his pregnant wife kim appeared monday 
on two television news shows and two radio programs including a 
2hour appearance on a radio callin show more appearances were 
planned this afternoon 
this is not about my political career the 38yearold 
conservative republican said following his sentencing in federal 
court this is not about whether i should be in congress 
you dont stand by and let the constitution of the united 
states be trashed he said thats why im doing it 
this man violated federal law said us attorney robert 
barr he will do time in jail for his misdeeds 
as a result of his conviction the state bar of georgia asked the 
georgia supreme court late monday to begin proceedings that could 
lead to disbarment of swindall an attorney 
us district judge richard c freeman sentenced swindall to 12 
months in prison on each of nine counts of perjury with the terms 
to run concurrently freeman also fined swindall 30000 plus 450 
in court costs 
swindall was convicted june 20 of lying to a federal grand jury 
last year about negotiations for an 850000 loan from a federal 
agent posing as a money launderer 
the loan to help finance swindalls 15 million home in 
suburban stone mountain did not go through 
swindall who will remain free while pursuing an appeal said the 
judges decision to grant him an appeal bond was an indication he 
would win a new trial 
all i ask is a fair opportunity to present my case in a fair 
court he said 
barr who had sought a sentence of more than three years in 
prison said the government may appeal to obtain a tougher penalty 
freeman said the governments sentencing recommendation was 
unjustified because prosecutors had not proved swindall was 
personally involved in laundering money 
in his public appearances swindall was alternately righteous and 
glib about his situation 
he told one caller that he was fooled by federal agents posing as 
drugmoney launderers because im not used to dealing with 
criminals i may have to get used to it soon 
some callers supported swindalls claims that he was the victim 
of an unfair trial and an overzealous prosecutor but many others 
castigated him for refusing to admit his guilt as decided by the 
jury 
at his sentencing swindall gave a 30minute statement recounting 
his reasons for appealing his case but said he stood before freeman 
in all humility 
the judge disagreed 
you dont know the meaning of humility mr swindall he 
said i thought you were beginning to learn it but im afraid 
youre not 
evidence presented at swindalls trial included tapes of his 
conversations with an internal revenue service agent posing as a 
money man and with political supporter charles lechasney who 
pleaded guilty to money laundering conspiracy 
the conversations continued even after swindall told the grand 
jury he had walked away from the proposed deal the congressman 
ultimately accepted and endorsed a 150000 check before backing out 
swindall was largely unknown politically before he won the 4th 
congressional district seat in 1984 upsetting veteran democrat 
elliott levitas he was reelected in 1986 but lost the seat in 1988 
to democrat ben jones after being indicted for perjury 
lechasney who testified against swindall awaits sentencing

logging was allowed close to two nests of the 
rare northern spotted owl a us forest service biologist testified 
at the last of a series of hearings on the birds status 
officials at siuslaw national forest in western oregon recently 
allowed logging within 100 yards of two of the 11 breeding pairs 
known to exist in the forest norm barrett testified at the hearing 
monday 
the us fish and wildlife service held the hearings to determine 
whether to protect the spotted owl as a threatened species 
it worries me that on a forest with only 11 breeding pairs of 
owls they can endanger two of their pairs barrett said 
the fish amp wildlife service proposed threatened species status 
for the owl last june saying logging in old growth forests in the 
northwest was destroying the birds habitat 
the fish amp wildlife service has estimated only 1500 nesting 
pairs of northern spotted owls remain in its range from southern 
british columbia to northern california 
the timber industry maintains that if the owl is listed as 
threatened thousands of jobs will be lost to preserve oldgrowth 
forests where the biggest and most valuable timber is found as 
habitat for the bird 
environmentalists say only 10 percent of the northwests ancient 
forests remain and the declining numbers of owls signal the 
disappearance of an entire ecosystem 
an estimated 500 people turned out for mondays hearing many of 
them wearing yellow tshirts or yellow buttons to show solidarity 
with the timber industry 
the hearing drew nearly 150 speakers more than earlier fish amp 
wildlife service hearings in portland ore olympia wash and 
redding calif 
the majority of the testimony monday came from timber industry 
workers and supporters who called on the fish amp wildlife service to 
remember that thousands of jobs are at stake 
your agency has never before had to consider the listing of a 
species which if listed would have as catastrophic an affect on 
peoples lives as this one said ross mickey staff forester for 
the north west timber association in eugene 
after a sept 21 deadline for public comment the fish amp wildlife 
service agency has a year to decide whether to declare the bird a 
threatened species

the national science foundation says 
astronomers believe they have stumbled across evidence that galaxies 
may still be forming in the universe 
the evidence is a massive cloud of hydrogen 10 times larger than 
the milky way galaxy all by itself and close by astronomical 
standards 65 million lightyears away the foundation said monday 
the discovery would appear to challenge the current belief that 
all galaxies were formed within the first few hundred million years 
after the big bang explosion dispersed hydrogen and matter in 
the universe 
the hydrogen cloud was found by riccardo giovanelli adjunct 
professor of astronomy at cornell university and head of the radio 
astronomy group at the foundations national astronomy and 
ionosphere center in arecibo puerto rico and coworker martha 
haynes associate professor of astronomy at cornell 
before stumbling into this thing neither i nor martha were 
great believers in the existence of such objects giovanelli said 
but this cloud indicates that the discs of galaxies can form 
slowly throughout the history of the universe and not just be 
something that happened during some magic period in the distant 
past 
giovanelli and haynes found the cloud while calibrating detectors 
attached to the 1000foot dish radio telescope at arecibo for 
calibration they pointed the dish at a region of the sky thought to 
be devoid of objects and found the characteristic radio signal of 
hydrogen 
astronomers believe galaxies massive groupings of millions to 
billions of stars must form from the condensation of hydrogen the 
simplest element a proton accompanied by an electron 
previous searches for cloud protogalaxies had failed to find 
anything though there is strong evidence for the existence of 
clouds of hydrogen 
light from quasars incredibly bright objects 10 billion or so 
light years away from earth was missing frequencies characteristic 
of what would be absorbed by hydrogen in its path 
the cloud emits a strong radio signal but there are no stars 
associated with it and it does not show up in optical surveys 
though 10 times larger than the milky way it has only 10 percent 
of the mass of that galaxy and it isnt clear whether the cloud will 
evolve into a galaxy the astronomers said 
the cloud south of the virgo cluster consists of two large 
clumps of gas that may be merging they said 
a full report will appear in the astrophysical journal

rep barney frank dmass is asking the house 
ethics committee to investigate his former relationship with a male 
prostitute 
questions have been raised about my employment of a personal 
assistant during a period between 1985 to 1987 frank wrote in a 
letter to the chairman of the ethics committee i have publicly 
responded to these questions and i have expressed regret for the 
mistaken judgment involved 
in order to ensure that the public record is clear i hereby 
request that the committee on standards of official conduct conduct 
an investigation into these matters frank said in mondays letter 
to committee chairman julian dixon dcalif 
house rules require that a member act at all times in a manner 
which shall reflect creditably on the house the ethics committee 
already is looking into cases involving three other members accused 
of sexual improprieties 
frank pledged to cooperate fully with investigators and asked 
that the probe be conducted quickly 
the liberal democrat acknowledged friday that he had paid for sex 
with a male prostitute then hired the man steve gobie to do 
household chores and run errands 
saying he was victimized frank said he fired gobie two years 
ago when he became suspicious that gobie was selling sex from 
franks capitol hill apartment 
gobie alleges frank knew about the prostitution ring at his 
apartment frank denies that 
meanwhile george washington university law professor john 
banzhaf said he asked us attorney jay stephens of the district of 
columbia to investigate other charges related to prostitution 
including running a bawdy house and soliciting for prostitution 
many people dont think frank confessed to a crime he has 
banzhaf said 
frank said that banzhaf is saying is that every gay person in 
washington dc who is not totally abstinent is a criminal the 
congressman said he didnt think he or anyone else in such a 
situation should be prosecuted 
in another development assistant commonwealths attorney s 
randolph sengel said today he will file a motion friday to drop 
charges against democratic political consultant john e ashford 
accused of trying to arrange sex with a 13yearold girl through 
gobie 
after reviewing the case with police it was our determination 
that evidence which we had is not sufficient to sustain the 
allegation that mr ashford solicited a crime sengel said for 
that reason we are dismissing the charge 
ashford is scheduled to appear in alexandria district court 
friday for a closed hearing 
frank and fellow massachusetts democrat gerry studds are the two 
house members who have publicly acknowledged they are homosexual 
franks announcement came in 1987 and he was overwhelmingly 
reelected to a fifth term in 1988 with 70 percent of the vote 
two polls published over the weekend showed that voters in 
massachusetts 4th district still strongly support frank 
frank 49 made two public appearances in fall river mass over 
the weekend where a few muffled boos were overwhelmed by 
applause and cheers 
i guess it means people think ive done a good job in the 
past he said people are being nicer to me than im ready to be 
to myself right now 
alexander tennant executive director of the massachusetts gop 
called on frank to resign 
the democrats are arguing this is a personal matter we are 
arguing that there is a very serious public matter tennant said 
the other three house members being investigated by the ethics 
committee are rep jim bates dcalif some of whose former female 
staff members allege he sexually harassed them rep gus savage 
dill who allegedly fondled a peace corps volunteer while on an 
official trip to zaire in march and rep donald e buz lukens 
rohio convicted may 30 of contributing to the unruliness of a 
minor as a result of alleged sexual intercourse with a teenage girl

a sheriffs deputy has been charged 
with criminally negligent homicide for shooting a cookie salesman 
during a routine traffic stop in front of the salesmans home 
morgan county sheriffs deputy dan probasco 29 was charged 
monday in morgan county district court in the july 15 death of dan 
e smith 36 a salesman for nabisco 
police say probasco shot smith in the back of the head after 
pulling him over in front of smiths fort morgan home for an 
apparent drunkendriving check 
deputy probascos actionsgrossly deviated from the standard 
of care that a reasonable person in like circumstances and under a 
like standard of care would exercise district attorney jon bailey 
said at a news conference 
probasco has declined to discuss the shooting with investigators 
and has been on paid administrative leave 
if convicted the deputy could face one to four years in jail and 
a fine ranging to 100000 bailey said the jail sentence could be 
extended to eight years under exceptional circumstances 
the shooting has prompted criticism of the sheriffs office by 
some fort morgan residents who said the episode epitomized the 
sometimes overzealous law enforcement in the county 
it seems to me if there was a shot in the back of the head it 
would be more than negligent said attorney roger nixt who is 
representing smiths estate 
but bailey said elements were lacking for the filing of murder 
charges 
police reports say the shooting occurred after probasco pulled 
smiths car over and radioed headquarters to verify smiths license 
number and drivers license 
a transcript of radio transmissions the night of the slaying 
showed the sheriffs dispatcher had just acknowledged probascos 
call when probasco yelled i need backup the dispatch center 
then was unable to contact probasco on the radio 
a short time later a neighbor of smiths called police to say an 
officer had asked her to call for assistance because there had been 
a shooting

moldavians today pushed forward in 
parliamentary debate on a new draft law to make the local dialect 
the official language of the republic but nonmoldavian strikers 
and protesters charged the measure was discriminatory 
in the restive baltics an activist said monday that president 
mikhail s gorbachev cautioned communist party officials in 
lithuania against pushing too hard for autonomy 
the legislature of the southern soviet republic voted 300 to 43 
not to delay debate on the bill despite objections by deputies from 
two cities where 80000 nonmoldavian workers have been striking 
since last week to protest the law three deputies abstained and 30 
were absent 
the vote on the bill was expected by wednesday 
around kishinev capital of this republic on the romanian border 
viewers watched the session on television in both russian and 
moldavian a romanian dialect 
the russians ukrainians and other ethnic groups comprise more 
than a third of the republics population 
the communist party newspaper pravda said monday that ethnic 
activists in moldavia are trying to take power on the crest of a 
muddy wave of chauvinism and separatism 
moldavian activists said the opera theater where the lawmaking 
body was meeting was ringed by police as several hundred people 
gathered across the street waving redblueandyellow banners of the 
republics colors 
gorbachev called lithuanias party chief algirdas brazauskas on 
friday and sunday to express his concern about the independence 
movement in the republic activist romaldus olozus said 
on saturday the communist party central committee in moscow said 
separatists were leading the baltic republics of lithuania latvia 
and estonia toward trouble the statement came days after 1 million 
baltic people joined hands in a chain to protest the 1939 agreement 
between josef stalin and adolf hitler that forced the independent 
baltics in the soviet sphere of influence 
olozus a member of the governing council of the sajudis 
grassroots movement said in a telephone interview from vilnius that 
he and four colleagues met with brazauskas on monday 
brazauskas told the sajudis members gorbachev is concerned 
about whats happening in lithuania that what had happened so far 
was worth supporting but that now wed gone too far olozus said 
by telephone 
no special meeting of sajudis was planned to discuss the kremlin 
reaction but sajudis chairman vytautus landsbergis was scheduled to 
speak tonight on lithanian television olozus said 
estonian communist party chief vaino vyalyas said the republics 
party agreed with the central committees assessment that the baltic 
region was in danger of falling into an abyss if they heeded 
separatist calls for secession tass reported today 
the government of lithuania and the communist party of the third 
baltic republic latvia came into line monday behind the statement 
from moscow 
the tass news agency said the latvian party issued a statement 
calling the partys stance the basis for concrete action for 
normalizing the socialpolitical situation in the country 
in lithuania the presidium of the republics supreme soviet 
legislature rejected a commissions findings that the incorporation 
of lithuania into the soviet union by stalin in 1940 was an 
international crime 
izvestia the soviet government newspaper said the findings did 
not take into account lithuanias political situation in 193940 
and would lead the republic into a political deadend and serve 
poorly in the transfer to economic independence 
it returned the supreme soviet commissions work until a national 
panel finishes its review izvestia said 
olozus said gorbachev apparently was upset with the findings of 
the lithuanian commission because they could heighten the legal 
argument for full independence 
olozus said he had an impression from talking to brazauskas that 
gorbachev did not entirely support the strident tone of the central 
committee statement but that his reaction was one of 
disappointment 
the confrontation with the kremlin was inescapable but the 
resistance might slow down the sajudisled drive for greater 
autonomy if not outright independence from moscow olozus said 
the grassroots movement will continue on the same path but 
the steps can be slower or faster depending on the concrete 
situation he said 
the labor daily trud today attacked moldavian nationalists 
saying they stepped up bitterness mutual hostility and 
suspicion among ethnic groups 
representatives of the moldavian peoples front on monday met 
leaders of a council representing nonmoldavian workers who have 
been on strike since last week to protest the draft language law 
tass reported 
on sunday up to 300000 people rallied in kishinev in favor of 
the language law 
pravda on monday said that the crowd drawn to kishinevs lenin 
square on sunday by the peoples front had submitted to longterm 
brainwashing by nationalistminded ideologists 
nonmoldavians are concerned the language law will be the first 
step toward a policy of discriminating against nonmoldavians

a bitter ethnically charged battle between a 
cubanborn state senator and a jewish lawyer sparked heavy turnout 
today as voters went to the polls to pick a successor to the late 
rep claude pepper 
normally when the polls open we might have one person waiting 
to vote today at that time there were five said herman 
weissman a veteran election inspector at one miami beach polling 
place 
at 11 am based on initial results from polls the elections 
department was projecting that 428 percent of eligible voters would 
turn out far higher than normal for a special election 
voting was heaviest in the cubanamerican precints where 
republican ileana roslehtinen was strongest with central little 
havana residents turning out a projected 773 percent clip 
by contrast north miami beach condominium precincts where 
democrat gerald richman has the advantage were projected to have a 
463 percent turnout 
its been a very controversial election elections supervisor 
david leahy said there has been a tremendous amount of media 
exposure and we think both camps are getting a lot more people out 
to vote 
many cubanamericans were upset by the tone of the richmans 
campaign his early slogan was this is an american seat 
richmans defenders said he had been unfairly labeled as 
prejudiced and said the campaign phrase was merely richmans answer 
to republican claims that the seat should belong to a cubanamerican 
the fair campaign practices committee an independent panel 
criticized both candidates as appealing to voter prejudice blasting 
ms roslehtinen for a spanishlanguage brochure that it said made a 
veiled ethnic attack on richman a jew 
no we werent born in brooklyn ny like him no we dont 
speak english the same way he does we too are americans 
said the brochure ms roslehtinen has refused to debate richman 
calling him a bigot 
she campaigned monday with sen connie mack among senior citizens 
in miami beach an area heavily favored to back her democratic 
opponent 
richman spent part of the day before the election in miami beach 
and also visited with black ministers in miami 
polls last week indicated the race was too close to call and that 
most voters in the diverse district would choose ethnic heritage 
not partisanship at the ballot box 
the area pepper represented for 27 years until his death may 30 
at age 88 has 100149 registered democrats 71295 registered 
republicans and 14098 independents 
blacks make up 19 percent of the districts registered voters 
more than 40 percent of the districts registered voters are 
hispanic and the rest are nonlatin whites sometimes known locally 
asanglos 
richman 48 the brooklynborn former florida bar association 
president hoped for a strong turnout from the traditional 
jewishretireeblack democratic coalition a group that has seen its 
traditional power in the area eroded by the latin influx into south 
florida 
a large turnout was expected from cubanamericans seeking to make 
ms roslehtinen 37 the first cubanamerican elected to congress 
south florida also has a growing population of nicaraguans 
leahy said that 7961 democrats and 5965 republicans had 
requested absentee ballots as of the weekend 4800 had been 
returned by monday but no breakdown was available 
this is a unique situation where the parties really encouraged 
people to vote absentee ballot and im not sure what that will do to 
the returns leahy said

irans parliament today approved all 22 
nominations to president hashemi rafsanjanis new cabinet the 
countrys official news agency reported 
the islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia described 
the vote of confidence by the 270member majlis as unprecedented 
since some members of all previous cabinet slates had been rejected 
in the past 
the vote came after rafsanjani got a lastminute boost for his 
proposed cabinet today from radical parliament speaker mehdi karrubi 
i see mr rafsanjanis cabinet as a successful one and one that 
supports the deprived and whose members have worked hard for the 
revolution karrubi was quoted as saying by irna 
he told parliament on the third day of a debate on rafsanjanis 
cabinet it is a cabinet that has experience proficiency 
competence and faith with full revolutionary credentials 
earlier tehran newspapers had warned that as many as three of 
the nominees could be rejected 
rafsanjani has come under fire from radicals for dumping their 
leaders from his cabinet they included outgoing interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi who has been closely linked with shiite moslem 
militants holding most of the western hostages in lebanon 
karrubis support was seen as critical for rafsanjani 55 who 
was elected by a landslide vote july 28 after two days of debate in 
which some of his nominees have incurred severe criticism from 
radical deputies 
karrubi a hardline radical who has advocated the violent spread 
of irans islamic revolution is allied to rafsanjanis rivals 
but he apparently has fallen in line with ayatollah ali khamenei 
irans spiritual leader who last week urged parliamentary deputies 
to set aside their differences and approve rafsanjanis cabinet to 
ensure a smooth transition from the outgoing government of prime 
minister hussein musavi 
khamenei was elected to succeed irans revolutionary leader 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini who died june 3 karrubi succeeded 
rafsanjani leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists as speaker 
last month 
rafsanjanis newlook cabinet includes more technocrats many of 
them westerneducated than revolutionary ideolgues he has said his 
main priority is to revitalize irans sagging economy battered by 
eight years of war with iraq and a decade of mismanagement

separate bodo state must be met by 1990 or the group would resume 
violence 
the bodos have been demanding a separate homeland on the northern 
bank of river brahmaputrain in assam a remote and hilly state 
bordering bangladesh and bhutan 
the bodos mostly farmers of mongol origin were animists before 
they converted earlier this century to hinduism and christianity

the bodos claim they suffer discrimination from the assamese and 
accuse them of mass migration to bododominated land 
we will go to any extent to get our demand for a separate 
fullfledged bodoland on the northern bank of brahmaputra river 
implemented by 1990 brahma told reporters in new delhi after the 
talks monday 
the violence has seriously affected the economy of the tea and 
timbergrowing state 
it is good news that both the sides have agreed to work for 
peace and not to encourage violence assam government spokesman 
jk dass said today 
dass said that during the talks the bodos agreed to stop attacks 
on government and in return the assam government would not to 
invoke special police powers to detain suspects without trial for up 
to one year 
from our side we will stop all actions against the bodos with 
the hope that they will abide by the agreement dass said but 
if they resume their violent campaign we will use force against 
them 
the bodo problem has been simmering for more than 20 years but 
it turned violent earlier this year 
bodo leaders claim that 1500 of their comrades have died in 
police actions by the assam government and that 15000 houses have 
been damaged by assamese leaving 100000 people homeless 
dass however said only 395 people including 41 policemen and 
16 state officials had been killed this year

have clashed since a gambling raid last month state police said

heavily damaged in the fire sunday night after a confrontation 
between a pro and antigambling factions a brief standoff between 
the warriors society a selfappointed reservation security force 
and state police followed the disturbance 
casino owner victoria adams said she had just left the building 
when a mob stormed it and set the fire with molotov cocktails she 
said the mob tried to burn other casinos but armed guards stopped 
them 
state police in a statement said the conflict at the casino 
involved more than 500 people and lasted about six hours 
while state troopers set up roadblocks to route traffic around 
the reservation warriors society members expecting state police to 
intervene set up their own armed checkpoints just inside the 
reservation 
after several tense hours both sides relinquished their 
respective strongholds along the perimeter of the reservation which 
straddles the uscanadian border in northern new york 
the reservation was the site of a 10day standoff between 
troopers and indians after a gambling raid july 20 by state and 
federal authorities mohawks voted this month to permit gambling on 
the reservation but some indians claim the vote was invalid 
state police and tribal leaders reached an agreement this month 
to resume patrols on the reservation but the warriors society has 
said they would allow troopers on their land only with advance 
notice and escorts 
although casino gambling is illegal in new york state the 
reservations seven casinos offer slot machines and card games that 
attract gamblers from both sides of the border the mohawks contend 
they are not bound by state or federal gambling laws since they 
consider their reservation a sovereign nation

a group of artists says it wants to 
enlighten not offend with a show on the us flag that includes a 
painting of the statue of liberty giving a nazi salute against the 
backdrop of an american banner 
the 10 artists students and former students at jersey city 
state college are exhibiting their works in a monthlong show 
opening sept 12 called flagging our freedom the exhibit in a 
campus gallery is funded by a campus literary magazine and has the 
support of the chairman of the art department 
the exhibit is motivated by proposed laws against flag 
desecration and by the threat of the government withdrawing money 
for art considered offensive 
by no means are we trying to do shock art organizer orlando 
r cuevas said were trying to do good art 
oroc an artist who goes by the one name had a piece among those 
previewed monday 
in his oil painting 21st century america a grimacing statue 
of liberty makes a nazi salute a swastika is painted on the tablet 
on her arm and pennies reading in dog we trust cover her 
breasts behind her is a wrinkled backwards american flag and the 
corner of a dollar bill 
christ is crucified on the one of the bill 
to me the statue of liberty is really a joke said oroc a 
24yearold union city resident the works message is that the 
nation celebrates freedom but tolerates racism homelessness 
exclusion of immigrants and worship of wealth he said 
cuevas contribution is a multimedia sculpture inside half a 
catcarrying box what appears to be a row of toy soldiers marches 
on top of a flag a dolls head lies in back its arm poking through 
the row of soldiers 
the big parade is an antiwar statement and the flag 
represents mainstream america said cuevas 25 of jersey city 
the artists have a range of opinions over proper treatment of the 
flag but agree their right to use it to express themselves should 
not be limited he said 
they are reacting in part to a recent us supreme court decision 
protecting flag burning as free speech the students also said they 
were reacting to cuts of federal grants by the us house to museums 
that sponsored the controversial work of photographers robert 
mapplethorpe and andres serrano 
a spokesman for the state veterans of foreign wars which favors 
a constitutional amendment against flag burning said he would 
reserve judgment on the show 
it all depends on the works of art theyre displayng said 
willis bird in trenton 
i absolutely do support the show said art department 
chairwoman dorothy dierks harris of the students she said i 
think they are rather exceptional

the head of hungarys intelligence 
service said in an interview published tuesday that the communist 
party no longer controls his organization 
police brig gen jozsef horvath told the magyar nemzet newspaper 
that situation reports no longer are being given to leading members 
of the party and only state leaders are entitled to this right 
the formal transfer of control from the communist party to the 
government has had little practial effect however because all 
government leaders are also ranking communists 
after endorsing the concept of multiparty democracy in february 
the reformminded communist leadership began transfering to the 
government formal supervisory rights to organizations it had 
traditionally controlled including the armed forces and the police 
the moves are in preparation for free parliamentary elections

there was mass confusion in salem 
last year after 13 bombs were stashed around the southern indiana 
town local law enforcement officials testified today 
we felt like we were dealing with something we didnt know too 
much about fire chief larry cooper testified at the trial of 
jerry a conrad 42 one of two men accused of planting the bombs 
the prosecutor in the us district court trial assistant us 
attorney robert stanley powell said in his opening statement monday 
that the town was paralyzed by the attempted bombings on july 5 
1988 
but defense attorney michael mcdaniel said conrad was an honest 
lawabiding citizen and a family man hes never been in trouble 
with the law mcdaniel said 
in todays testimony police chief max boling said authorities 
cordoned off downtown streets for about 12 hours while teams 
searched for more bombs 
nobody could understand what was going on there was mass 
confusion for a while as to why they couldnt drive through town 
boling said 
conrad and john m hubbard iii 31 of salem are accused of 
planting dynamite bombs under bridges and behind buildings in the 
town nearly 30 miles northwest of new albany on july 5 1988 three 
of the bombs ignited and fizzled but none exploded and no one was 
hurt 
the bombs were allegedly targeted at state rep frank newkirk jr 
authorities declined to comment on a motive but a criminal 
complaint called hubbard a lifelong rival of newkirk who is 
also the son of salems mayor 
conrad and hubbard who worked at the same factory were arrested 
last may and indicted on one count of unlawful possession of 
dynamite one count of conspiracy 14 counts of making bombs and 13 
of attempting to destroy roads and buildings affecting interstate 
commerce 
if convicted conrad could be sentenced to up to 285 years in 
prison hubbard is to be tried after conrad 
powell said evidence would show that conrad a technical 
engineer helped hubbard make the bombs and that the tools used to 
make them belonged to conrad 
powell cautioned that much of the governments case was based on 
circumstantial evidence 
dont expect somebody to come up and say they saw them making 
the devices powell said 
mcdaniel said that conrad would not dispute allegations he told 
hubbard various things about making bombs but would deny any 
involvement in a plot to blow up salem 
the evidence will show he knew how to make bombs mcdaniel 
said he is a survivalist he wants to be selfsufficient in the 
event of a nuclear war he wants to be able to sustain himself his 
family 
mcdaniel said such people are not part of a lunatic fringe 
simply because they are concerned about their future and their 
familys safety 
conrad who wore a dark suit and tie sat quietly at a table in 
the courtroom taking notes on a yellow legal pad

mediation efforts 
the syrians have 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab 
league mandate to halt lebanons civil war which erupted in april 
1975 
syria which considers lebanon within its sphere of influence and 
vital to its security backs demands by lebanons moslem and 
leftists for an equal share of power with the traditionally dominant 
christians 
aoun a maronite catholic has accepted to negotiate political 
reforms but he has declared a war of liberation to drive 
syrias troops out of the predominantly moslem sectors they have 
controlled since 1976 
aoun and other christian leaders charge that the syrians 
abrogated their arab league peacekeeping mandate by openly siding 
with the moslems in the 14yearold civil war in which more than 
150000 people have been killed

about 15 tons of security files kept 
on citizens were destroyed in a blast furnace tuesday in a symbolic 
act marking the 40th anniversary of the end of the greek civil war 
as the files were dropped into the main furnace of a steel mill 
13 miles northwest of athens flames shot upward and scattered 
cinders throughout the plant 
the cinders were the remains of dossiers on the activities and 
political leanings of millions of greeks considered a threat to the 
state since 1944 
government spokesman athanassios kanellopoulos said former 
premier andreas papandreou and his panhellenic socialist movement 
had added to the files by keeping records on citizens from 198287 
papandreou who was defeated in the june 18 general election had 
pledged that all the security files would be destroyed the 
government said he had failed to fulfill his promise during his 
tenure 
last week the government announced that 165 million files would 
be burned to mark the end of divisions between left and right that 
followed the communist partys defeat in the threeyear uprising 
the civil war ended unofficially on aug 29 1949 when all 
hostilities stopped between the communists and government forces 
backed by the united states and britain 
i think that all greeks wanted to see the end of these relics 
of the civil war said public order ministry general secretary 
mihalis koutelidakis 
the decision to destroy the files was made by premier tzannis 
tzannetakis who heads a government comprising the conservative new 
democracy party and the communistled coalition of the left and 
progress 
the coalition government said its main task before calling new 
elections by the end of october would be to investigate scandals 
allegedly perpetrated by the socialists and to pass legislation 
leading to conciliation among greeks 
the destruction of the files met some opposition from citizens 
and politicians 
about 50 people mostly supporters of the panhellenic socialist 
movement gathered at the gates of the steelworks and tried to block 
police trucks with the files 
a nation which has no memory has no history they chanted 
panhellenic socialist movement deputies the athens university 
council and justice minister fotis kouvelis a member of the leftist 
coalition opposed burning the files saying they were important 
documents that should be kept in archives for research 
whether or not the files are of historical value should be 
decided by historians and should not be sacrificed for the sake of 
any symbolism the university council said monday 
the government said that about 2000 files on people who played a 
major role in the history of greece would be preserved

delegates to a peace conference canceled a formal 
meeting planned for today and a french official said warring 
cambodian groups might wait until next year before they negotiate 
again 
representatives of the 19 nations spent the day working 
informally in small groups then planned a working dinner followed 
by further consultations on the issues that have blocked a 
settlement in the monthlong conference 
the formal session was postponed several times before finally 
being rescheduled for wednesday 
a foreign ministry spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping 
with department practice said the conference would conclude 
wednesday with a short statement that probably would recommend a 
reconvening the conference in paris several months from now 
perhaps in the spring 
the spokesman said there was no movement on the part of the 
cambodian parties on two essential points composition of a 
proposed transitional government and an international mechanism for 
monitoring withdrawal of vietnamese troops this month 
its too early for a compromise he said 
a senior us official predicted today that the conference would 
be suspended and a new round of fighting would follow 
we see indications that we may be in for this period of 
military testing the official told reporters speaking on 
condition he not be further identified 
the official suggested the conference could close leaving 
openended the prospect of reconvening some months down the road 
when perhaps the realities on the ground have given people a clearer 
sense of the real balance of forces at play here 
fourteen foreign ministers present at the first session in late 
july have returned to paris but chinas foreign minister qian 
quichen soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and us 
secretary of state james a baker iii did not return because no 
resolution was in sight 
nineteen nations originally attended the conference with high 
hopes of laying the foundations for a lasting peace in cambodia 
which has suffered two decades of civil war and slaughter but no 
progress has been made in three weeks of working meetings 
some delegates said positions seem to have hardened among the 
cambodian parties the vietnameseinstalled government of prime 
minister hun sen and the threeparty resistance led by prince 
norodom sihanouk cambodias ruler until 1970 
vietnam has said it will withdraw the last of its forces by sept 
27 with or without a settlement 
the greatest obstacle remains the role of the khmer rouge 
strongest of the resistance factions and responsible for the deaths 
of an estimated 1 million civilians due to purges or starvation from 
1975 until its ouster by vietnamese forces in 1978 
the khmer rouge regime came to power by defeating the usbacked 
cambodian government 
sihanouk cambodias heriditary ruler says he would rather share 
power with the khmer rouge than fight it in the jungles while hun 
sen says the group must be eliminated politically and militarily 
there is a limit to which the rest of the world can impose a 
solution on the cambodians a weary australian foreign minister 
garth evans said at the close of mondays session

steel wheels cbs the rolling stones 
 
theres the sun the moon the trees and the rolling stones 
keith richards says in describing the longevity that is the secret 
to this bands success 
the stones new album steel wheels is as reassuring and 
predictable as the sun and the moon 
the rolling stones whose raunchy guitarbased sound is the most 
instantly identifiable signature in rock music sound simply 
terrific richards and ron woods guitar playing is exemplary and 
the rhythm section of charlie watts and bill wyman sounds inspired 
even mick jagger for all his whining about the need to do solo 
work is undeniably more at home here than anywhere else 
thankfully the stones vary the output enough to keep steel 
wheels from lapsing into the boredom of the bands more recent 
records particularly dirty work the 12song album contains 
three ballads a blues song and the exotic sounding continental 
drift which feature moroccan drummers 
where the stones stumble is in the lyrics they rarely rise above 
the pedestrian and are occasionally insipid 
for every rare offhand funny lyric so get off the fence its 
creasing your butt theres about a dozen nagging cliches after 
34 albums the stones should know enough to avoid such lines as i 
can feel your tongue on mine silky smooth like wine im living 
with these memories thats all thats left of you and me 
jaggers yowl which renders much of the words indistinguishable 
anyway is the signal that words arent the most important thing for 
this band 
the individual cuts the opening sad sad sad is a rocker in 
the classic stones mold the single mixed emotions is most 
interesting for armchair psychologists who want to apply the line 
youre not the only one with mixed emotions to the recent 
feuding between mick and keith 
terrifying is a series of animal metaphors attached to a beat 
that recalls the 1970s hot stuff hold on to your hat is the 
sort of angry get out of my life witch song that the stones 
have been writing too much of lately though watts makes this tune 
with a strong shuffle beat 
blinded by love is a pleasing country ballad thats sort of a 
cross between lady jane and faraway eyes 
rock and a hard place with horns integrated into the 
traditional rock sound is one of those songs that sound better if 
you dont pay attention to the lyrics put on a kind face is 
jaggers brief advice for such problems as human rights war and the 
homeless 
both of richards lead vocals cant be seen and slipping 
away are somewhat slight jaggers ballad almost hear you 
sigh is again lyrically problematic but pleasant sounding 
continental drift with the raucous master musicians of 
jajouka is the kind of strange experimentation that shows how the 
stones are still better when they want to be than the legions of 
bands that try to imitate them 
the verdict steel wheels is no masterpiece but it gives 
more evidence why the rolling stones are hall of fame members

seven bombs apparently set by drug 
traffickers exploded early today police said the father of three 
reputed drug lords called for negotiations with the government to 
end drugrelated violence 
in washington colombias justice minister monica de greiff 
today pledged to stay in her job and continue fighting her countrys 
drug lords despite death threats and she appealed for more us aid 
to protect judges 
there were no injuries in the bombings of six state liquor stores 
in medellin and a travel agency in bogota police said but 100000 
of damage was caused the bomb in bogota blew up about 300 feet from 
a military base 
police blamed drug traffickers for the bombs which went off 
between 4 am and 5 am police also blamed traffickers sunday for 
nine bombings of banks in medellin there were no claims of 
responsibility 
fabio ochoa restrepo father of the reputed medellin cartel 
leaders jorge juan david and fabio ochoa vasquez asked president 
virgilio barco to end the bloodletting in our dear colombia by 
negotiating with drug traffickers to end the violence 
no more drug trafficking no more war no more assassinations 
no more bombs ochoa restrepo said in his message which was dated 
saturday and printed in local newspapers today 
ochoa restrepo said drug traffickers are willing to negotiate for 
peace but similar initiatives must be made by the government 
leftist guerrillas and paramilitary groups 
leftists groups often attack drug traffickers extensive property 
holdings inside colombia 
ochoa restrepo said a dialogue with the government was a 
condition for peace and he asked the government for forgiveness 
of the traffickers but did not elaborate 
ochoa restrepos three sons are among 12 people wanted by the 
united states on charges linked to the medellin cartel which 
enforcement agents believe is responsible for 80 percent of the 
cocaine distributed in the united states 
barco who began the unprecedented war on traffickers after the 
assassination of a leading presidential contender on aug 18 has 
refused all calls for negotiations with traffickers 
mrs de greiff in the washington news conference disputed 
widespread reports that she considered resigning in the face of 
death threats against her her husband and the couples 3yearold 
son 
the 32yearold justice minister also said she was requesting 19 
million in us aid to purchase armored cars bulletproof vests 
metal detectors for court houses and other security devices to 
protect the jurists 
a bogota city councilwoman today said the government can win the 
war on drugs but must first get rid of police and government 
officials tied to the drug traffickers 
the government has to take very definite action to purify 
it of those people who are in alliance with the criminals that the 
government and society is hoping to take to justice said clara 
lopez obregon whose name has appeared on a death list by the drug 
lords 
colombia cannot continue living in this bloodbath she told 
cbs this morning from bogota 
us ambassador thomas mcnamara met privately monday with 
colombias foreign minister to formally request extradition of a key 
narcotics trafficking suspect in washington colombias justice 
minister and attorney general dick thornburgh discussed extradition 
and millions of dollars of us aid 
in jerusalem police on monday questioned two former israeli 
military officers about reports they trained gunmen for colombian 
cocaine bosses 
the washington post quoting a confidential report by colombian 
security forces reported today that at least five israeli and 11 
british mercenaries helped train teams of assassins for colombian 
cocaine traffickers and their rightwing allies 
the army on monday announced abraham majuat identified as a top 
financial man for drug dealers was detained last week at a ranch 
not far from medellin authorities also seized about 45 tons of 
cocaine there about 1 percent of colombias yearly production 
according to us narcotics officials 
army officials said majuat is wanted in the united states if so 
he would be at least the fourth potentially extraditable suspect to 
be caught up in the nationwide sweep since aug 18 
foreign ministry officials said mcnamara and foreign minister 
julio londono paredes met for 20 minutes monday to discuss 
reestablishing a system of quotas for exports of coffee once 
colombias principal cash product but a meeting between the two was 
required to formally request the extradition of eduardo martinez 
romero an alleged finance chief for the medellin cocaine cartel 
martinez is wanted by a federal court in atlanta in connection 
with a 12 billion moneylaundering operation 
as part of the crackdown colombia renewed its extradition treaty 
with the united states which had been nullified by the supreme 
court in june 1987 
barco in a videotaped message sent to us networks monday 
called on rich countries to crack down on illicit drug use 
colombias survival as the oldest democracy in latin america is 
now at risk but so is the safety of your streets he said what 
might seem to be a matter of purely personal habit has had explosive 
public consequences it has thrown us all into a war we did not ask 
for

an environmental protection agency administrator 
has recommended upholding a veto of the controversial two forks dam 
project officials in colorado and nebraska said today 
denver has sought the dam on the south platte river to provide 
for the citys future water needs but conservationists and 
nebraskans have blasted the project as environmentally disastrous 
sen bob kerrey dneb and tom gleason an aide to denver mayor 
federico pena both said they learned this morning of the decision 
by epa regional administrator lee dehihns 
epa administrator william reilly announced his intention to veto 
the project last spring and appointed dehihns to make a final study 
and issue a recommendation 
the project still faces public hearings before a final epa 
decision is made 
kerrey said dehihns based his decision on potential damage to 
fish wildlife and recreation in colorado and fish and wildlife in 
nebraska kerrey also said the epa didnt agree with denvers water 
need projections 
they didnt believe the denver water board had assembled 
numbers that supported their need he said 
gleason declined to discuss details of the decision but said 
we did find some serious shortcomings in their rationale 
gleason said dehihns who has been reviewing the project for the 
past 4 months briefed pena and members of the denver water board 
on the agencys rationale 
rich lathrop an epa spokesman in denver declined comment on the 
reports and said the epas official announcement was to be made 
later today 
the 11 millionacrefoot dam project would flood 30 miles of 
cheesman canyon southwest of denver to create a reservoir for city 
water its cost has been estimated at between 500 million and 1 
billion 
kerrey speaking by telephone from washington said dehihns 
decision indicates that epa officials are willing to discuss 
alternative proposals to the dam and believe colorado could do more 
in the way of conservation 
it is possible that other alternatives could be detrimental to 
nebraska although the alternatives that were mentioned by dehihns 
would not be kerrey said 
he said he hoped the agency can select an alternative that isnt 
environmentally offensive while still allowing for denvers 
water needs

dog attacks on mail carriers are increasing the 
post office says blaming the increase on warmer weather than usual 
and on people keeping larger dogs 
hot weather makes dogs irritable and attacks on mailmen were up 
by 40 percent in the first six months of this year the post office 
said 
a survey of the problem in the current long hot summer by the 
times of london reported a mail carrier in somerset was bitten on 
the arm when a dog leaped through the window of his delivery van 
in bristol a mail carrier had a narrow escape when a guard dog 
inside a house crashed through the glass front door to try to get 
him 
there were 7057 dog attacks on mail carriers in britain last 
year nearly onefifth more than in 1987 dog attacks cost the post 
office 515000 a year 
to stop them the post office is testing a device that emits a 
highpitched sound inaudible to humans but intimidating to dogs 
in the past mail carriers facing a threatening dog were advised 
to get down on all fours and look the beast straight in the eye few 
were brave enough to try the post office said

live snakes sent to video rental shop owners to 
promote a horror film will be retrieved and the stunt will be 
canceled because of public outcry the organizers said tuesday 
cinema international corp which began sending out 700 chinese 
rat snakes to shops nationwide last week as part of a promotional 
package said it was worried about the reptiles 
we were worried that all this unwarranted attention could get 
the public overly interested in the snakes and result in them 
coming to harm said paul brett the companys marketing manager 
we thought the best thing to do was to take them back 
the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals had a 
different view on what might cause the snakes harm it said last 
week that directions accompanying the snakes had incorrectly said 
they didnt need to be fed during what cinema international planned 
as the snakes monthlong stay in the shops 
but an rspca spokeswoman said tuesday it welcomed the end of the 
promotion saying obviously cic has seen the error of their ways 
and were very pleased about that 
the spokeswoman said it would prosecute the company if any of the 
snakes suffered 
the snakes which were not poisonous were sent out to promote 
the release of the video of the film the serpent and the rainbow

the environmental protection agency concluded 
today that emissions from a massive coalfired power plant in 
arizona cause up to 70 percent of the air pollution over the grand 
canyon and must be curbed 
in announcing its preliminary findings the epa said it expects a 
final decision by next february on how pollution from the navajo 
generating station is to be curbed 
operators of the page ariz plant about 12 miles from the 
northern rim of the canyon have argued that no additional pollution 
curbs should be required because much of the canyon pollution comes 
from other sources in the los angeles area and mexico 
but the epa said the park service tests using a chemical tracer 
that was released through the power plants 750foot smokestacks 
demonstrated that on average about 40 percent of the pollution over 
the grand canyon originates with the plant and during some periods 
the percentage is as high as 70 percent 
officials said a solution may require the plant to install 
expensive scrubber technology to reduce sulfur dioxide 
emissions which currently range as high as 12 to 13 tons an hour 
during peak power periods 
the 2250megawatt power plant partially owned by the federal 
government has been under close scrutiny by the us park service 
to determine to what extent it contributes to the bright white 
layers of haze clearly visible over the canyon during much of the 
year especially in winter 
we have substantial evidence that the navajo generating station 
is a significant contributor to the visiblity problem said f 
henry habicht the epas deputy administrator action must be 
taken now to protect the grand canyon 
the plant is one of the largest coalburning electric generating 
facilities in the country burning 24000 tons of coal a day 
because of the plants size sulfur dioxide emissions are a problem 
even though it burns largely lowsulfur coal 
the federal government could be required to pay for some of the 
pollution control equipment because the interior departments bureau 
of reclamation holds a 24 percent interest in the facility the 
government uses electricity from the plant to pump water from the 
colorado river for irrigation in central arizona 
the epa action was prompted by a lawsuit filed by the 
environmental defense fund a private group

former first lady nancy reagan is being 
criticized for her plans to stay away from a junior high school in a 
gangplagued neighborhood and deliver an antidrug grant at a 
different school 
board of education member rita walters charged monday that mrs 
reagan is too afraid to enter the southcentral los angeles 
neighborhood that is intended to benefit from the grant 
ms walters made the accusations after learning that mrs reagan 
the wife of former president reagan would not go to john muir high 
school on sept 14 to present the school with a 36392 grant 
instead mrs reagan plans to make the presentation at gates 
street school in the lincoln heights area north of downtown 
the issue is the insult that is rendered when youre going to 
give money for a program in one community but youre afraid to go 
into the community ms walters said 
however los angeles unified school district superintendent 
leonard britton said the secret service not mrs reagan made the 
arrangements for the presentation 
city police and the secret service suggested the alternate 
location because similar events had been held there said deputy 
superintendent sid thompson 
neither the secret service or representatives for mrs reagan 
could be reached for comment early today 
ms walters said that she would not attend the presentation if it 
was held at gates 
this is an absolute slap in the face she said 
britton said the district would discuss the issue with the secret 
service before making a final decision about where the presentation 
will be

president bush wrapped up a strategy 
session today with top cabinet officials on a new antidrug policy 
and promised the united states will do all it can to help colombia 
fight its violent drug cartels 
we will cooperate with colombia to the best of our ability 
bush told reporters outside his oceanfront vacation home adding 
that the administration supports what the president of that 
country is trying to do 
asked about colombian president virgilio barcos televised appeal 
to drug users abroad to stop using narcotics bush said i fully 
agree with that so does our drug czar bill bennett we talked 
about that at lunch 
the president said we did have a very good discussion on the 
antinarcotics program well have more to say on that next week 
white house officials have said the antidrug plan to be 
revealed sept 5 in a televised presidential address to the nation 
will cost around 8 billion 2 billion above current antidrug 
spending levels 
it will attempt to cut off drugs at the source stiffen penalties 
for users and expand treatment for addicts they said 
bush was asked if he planned to increase economic aid to foreign 
countries as part of his antidrug package in view of the violence 
in colombia he declined to answer directly saying well have 
more to say on that at the appropriate time which will be fairly 
soon 
joining bush at his oceanfront vacation home were bennett the 
white house drug policy director attorney general dick thornburgh 
cia director william webster defense secretary dick cheney deputy 
secretary of state lawrence eagleburger and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft 
at a news briefing later scowcroft said the focus of the 
meeting was on the international aspects of the antidrug 
strategy with particular emphasis on the situation in colombia 
the administration had initially been considering 300 million in 
economic and military aid to the andean countries including 
colombia scowcroft said that figure has already been raised by the 
65 million package of assistance for colombia that the white house 
announced last friday 
there will be i think its fair to say a greater military 
role in the future with respect to the drug program than has been 
true in the past cheney said in a television interview before the 
meeting 
asked on abcs good morning america what kind of military 
role he envisioned in the expanded fight cheney said well let 
the president worry about that next week 
meanwhile colombias justice minister monica de greiff said she 
was requesting 19 million in us aid to purchase armored cars 
bulletproof vests metal detectors for court houses and other 
security devices to protect her countrys judges under seige by the 
medellin drug cartel 
the law is under siege in colombia and we must protect it every 
way we can she told a news conference in washington 
asked about the aid request bush did not discuss it 
specifically but said its being worked out now the details 
the aid package being sought is in addition to the 5 million 
that the bush administration has approved over a twoyear period to 
improve security for judges and the 65 million in military aid 
announced last week 
david runkel a spokesman for thornburgh said the justice 
department was in the process of drafting extradition requests for 
12 colombian drug traffickers under federal indictment 
barco in bogota put to rest rumors that ms de greiff had 
decided to resign in the face of death threats from drug cartel 
leaders worried about possible extradition to the united states 
the drug traffickers have threatened to kill 10 judges for every 
trafficker sent to the united states to face trial 
on his daily golf outing monday bush declined to comment on a 
newsweek report that he had approved a covert action in colombia 
against the drug lords 
if i discussed covert action it wouldnt be covert and i dont 
discuss that kind of thing at all anyway he said 
bush on monday got a firsthand report from secretary of labor 
elizabeth dole and senate minority leader bob dole on their visits 
in warsaw with the new leadership of poland 
bush said it could take a lot more money than his 119 
million aid package to help poland rebuild its economy 
but its also got to take political reform the president 
said its got to take economic reform so that when they talk 
about investment and privatization something really happens 
bush praised soviet president mikhail gorbachev for being 
extraordinarily understanding of the changes taking place in 
eastern europe he said he hopes peaceful change would continue 
not only outside the soviet union but in it 
bush who met with lech walesa in gdansk last month said that if 
the solidarity leader visits the united states later this year i 
certainly will meet with him

colombias justice minister monica de greiff 
today vowed to continue to fight her countrys drug lords despite 
death threats and she appealed for more us aid to protect judges 
the law is under siege in colombia and we must protect it every 
way we can she told a news conference at the colombian embassy 
she disputed reports that she had considered resigning in the face 
of death threats against her her husband and the couples 
3yearold son 
i never considered resigning she said the threats are out 
there but i am satisfied with my protection right now 
ms de greiff said she would remain in washington through sept 6 
to continue discussions with bush administration officials about her 
requests for additional aid to protect colombian judges from 
assassination 
the 32yearold justice minister said she was requesting 19 
million to purchase armored cars bulletproof vests metal detectors 
for court houses and other security devices to protect the jurists 
the aid package being sought is in addition to the 5 million 
that the bush administration has approved over a twoyear period to 
improve security for judges 
the president also has approved 65 million in us military aid 
to help the colombian government fight the drug cartels 
at his vacation home in kennebunkport maine where he met with 
top aides on the antidrug battle plan he will unveil sept 5 bush 
was noncommittal when asked about the requested 19 million in aid 
to protect judges 
he first declined comment then said its being worked out 
now the details and he said the united states will cooperate 
with colombia to the best of our ability 
ms de greiff said she was anxious to continue her efforts to 
preserve the colombian legal system she said her government faced a 
fight with a foe that has no respect for the law or even the 
minimal standards of decency 
but she expressed confidence that colombia will survive this 
crisis 
she said she was very pleased with the response of the bush 
administration saying she still was hoping for more assistance 
meanwhile david runkel a spokesman for attorney general dick 
thornburgh backed away from the justice departments earlier 
prediction that a colombian drug trafficker wanted in this country 
would be extradited this week 
runkel said eduardo martinez romero may not be extradited for two 
weeks under procedures set forth by the colombian government he 
also raised the possibility that the colombian supreme court which 
overturned the extradition procedures in 1987 may review the 
emergency decrees for extradition that recently were promulgated by 
colombian president virgilio barco 
those extradition procedures are complicated and i think there 
is a possibility there may be a decision to have the supreme court 
in colombia rule on those new procedures the spokesman said 
nevertheless he said we have every hope and expectation of 
getting custody of mr martinez 
runkel said the justice department was in the process of drafting 
extradition requests for 12 other colombian drug traffickers under 
federal indictment

educators are canceling or curtailing school 
activities such as shop classes cheerleading and gymnastics to 
avoid lawsuits and high insurance premiums a group backing revised 
liability laws said tuesday 
the american tort reform association released results of two 
surveys that association president martin f connor said 
illustrate just how much americas litigiousness and riskaversion 
has diminished the quality of life for all our students 
but the head of a trial lawyers group challenged the surveys as 
being insurance industrysupported scare tactics 
i think this is a red herring said james taglieri president 
of the trial lawyers association he said the tort reform group has 
the backing of the insurance industry that wants to avoid paying out 
claims while reaping incredible profits from exorbitant premiums 
taglieri said the ploy of the insurance industry is to pressure 
the public into thinking there is a crisis in tort law 
according to the surveys of attorneys and school principals the 
threat of lawsuits is prompting educators to cancel class trips 
shop classes and athletic activities particularly gymnatistics 
football and cheerleading other affected school programs include 
laboratory science programs such as chemistry and use of school 
playgrounds 
those who dont are paying the price in the form of higher 
insurance payments said connor and ivan gluckman staff counsel for 
the national association of secondary school principals 
robert hunter president of the national insurance consumer 
organization agreed 
atra has an axe to grind hunter said the reform groups 
purpose was to slant the questions in the surveys to get these 
results that were based more on gut feelings and attitudes 
rather than facts hunter said 
reduced activity is not necessarily bad depending on the risks 
and exposure hunter added if things are too risky and 
canceled then its actually a benefit not a degradation of the 
educational system 
the 190 principals who responded to the survey all members of 
the national association of secondary school principals said that 
while only 16 classrelated programs were canceled about half of 
more than 240 activities were modified because lawsuits were either 
threatened or filed said gluckman 
fiftyeight percent of the responding principals said there was a 
noticeable difference in the kinds of school programs being offered 
because of the threat of lawsuits and high insurance costs gluckman 
said 
the survey conducted last december showed 51 extracurricular 
programs were canceled and 301 modified 
restrictions on athletics have included limits on heights of 
pyramids by cheerleaders stopping the use of trampolines by 
gymnasts and halting diving competitions for swimmers the 
association said 
sixtytwo percent of the attorneys representing school boards 
that are members of the national school boards association reported 
no changes in school activities however most indicated that 
schools are paying higher insurance premiums to continue offering 
the programs 
one in five attorneys said they had been involved in lawsuits or 
outofcourt settlements that affected schoolrelated programs 
about 290 members of the nsbas council of school attorneys 
completed the survey 
the american tort reform association is a washingtonbased 
organization that advocates revising the system of liability 
lawsuits

a sheriff today said he doubted a wounded 
handcuffed canadian fugitive who was strapped to a stretcher could 
have caused the wreck of a medical helicopter that killed all four 
aboard 
the bodies of canadian fugitive robert l adams 25 and three 
crew members were found by searchers monday in northern idaho on 
larch mountain 25 miles northeast of spokane 
chip roos the sheriff of bonner county idaho said today that 
adams body was still strapped to a gurney at the legs and both 
elbows and one arm was cuffed to the stretcher that meant he had 
only partial mobility in the lower portion of the other arm where a 
nurse had rigged an intravenous tube roos said 
i really start to doubt any suspect activity that could have 
been instrumental in the crash roos said 
investigators from the federal aviation administration and the 
fbi were dispatched to the site authorities said today dennis 
hanson of eagle helicopter which provides pilots mechanics and the 
medical helicopter to sacred heart medical center said he and 
national transportation safety board officials were also heading to 
the scene 
roos said other factors such as mechanical failure or bad 
weather more likely contributed to the crash a storm had passed 
over northern idaho on sunday night when the chopper went down 
bob zinkgraf who was listening to a scanner at his home in 
colbert wash said the crew the pilot a registered nurse and a 
respiratory therapist reported that adams was scuffling before the 
aerospatiale astar from sacred heart hospital in spokane crashed 
around 10 pm sunday 
he said the crew reported they were having problems with the 
suspect 
a couple of minutes later they reported they were in a scuffle 
with the suspect then we heard the hospital trying to get in touch 
with them they reported they lost contact with the helicopter 
zinkgraf said 
however a medical center spokesman marilyn thordarson said the 
last report at 956 pm made no mention of any difficulty and that 
only static and background noises were heard afterward the faa was 
not monitoring the radio transmissions 
sheriffs detective john valdez said the pilot was frantic in his 
last radio transmission he said something like we have a 
problem we are going down valdez said 
roos said it appeared the craft broke apart in midair at high 
altitude since there was little damage to trees and wreckage was 
strewn over a wide area 
it really could have been anything all we know is that 
whatever happened must have caught the pilot by surprise he went 
straight down from a high altitude he said 
it just doesnt seem likely to us and hearing some comments 
from the feds yesterday that the likelihood of patient involvement 
was that high 
earlier sunday night adams apparently overpowered a us customs 
agent to enter the united states illegally near a customs station in 
eastport idaho the boundary county sheriffs department said 
he broke into a nearby home and in an exchange of gunfire was 
shot in the chest by a boundary county idaho man police said 
the homeowner 71yearold bob mcglocklin and adams were taken 
to the medical center in separate flights mcglocklin was in 
satisfactory condition with wounds to his right arm and back the 
medical center said 
adams of bridgefield nova scotia was wanted in canada for 
investigation of escape sexual assault and auto theft charges 
boundary county sheriffs sgt rick alonzo said he had 
volunteered to travel in the helicopter with adams but the flight 
crew said the additional passenger would be too much weight the 
newspaper said 
the faa is conducting the preliminary investigation 
if it turns out there was activity aboard the aircraft that 
contributed to or caused the accident and there is speculation 
about the prisoner having a tussle with flight crew it would be 
referred to the fbi as a criminal matter said mitch barker of the 
regional faa office in seattle 
the crew included pilot pat varea age unknown lyn gould 31 a 
registered nurse and bob siekerman 36 a respiratory therapist 
all three were from spokane ms thordarson said

with more than a score of trade 
cultural and scientific agreements in the works the political ice 
curtain is melting fast between the soviet union and alaska 
still gov steve cowper who leaves wednesday on a 10day 
6700mile trade and friendship mission to the soviet far east 
counsels patience 
i think they perceive a clear advantage in perestroika and 
glasnost the liberalizing of their political and economic 
system the governor said but many of these changes will be 
taken over a longer time frame because change is inherently 
unstable 
the political thaw has led to so many agreements between alaska 
and the soviet union that even cowper has trouble keeping up with 
them he recently asked that any initiatives across the bering 
strait be coordinated through his office 
the main purpose was that a lot of people were coming out of 
the woodwork purporting to be representatives of alaska or the 
soviet union said david ramseur cowpers press secretary 
things are happening so fast that we wanted to get a handle on 
it 
alaska cant sign treaties or agreements that bind nations 
cowper said what we can do is enter into preliminary 
negotiations sort out the details at our level then hand them to 
the representatives of the respective federal governments for a 
readymade treaty 
at a 1987 summit in iceland soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and 
president reagan issued a statement encouraging cooperation on 
issues relating to the arctic many alaskasoviet ties have been 
forged since then including 
a friendship flight from nome to provideniya in 1988 
reunited eskimos separated since the political ice curtain was 
drawn in 1948 a small commuter airline began charter service 
between the two cities a year later 
a soviet icebreaker helped rescue whales trapped in ice off 
barrow in 1988 and a soviet skimmer ship helped mop up after the 
nations worst oil spill hit prince william sound in march 
an expedition used skis and sled dogs to make a 1200mile from 
anadyr to nome earlier this year to promote alaskasoviet relations 
a pact opening the alaskasoviet border to visafree travel by 
eskimos with relatives in both countries is to be signed in 
september 
negotiations are under way that could lead to an agreement to 
protect fishing grounds from overfishing both nations also are 
working to establish joint sea rescue missions in the bering strait 
because of our geographical location and our history in alaska 
we were in a much better position than other states to press for 
agreements relating to the soviet far east cowper said as a 
result were recognized now as being in the forefront of efforts 
leading to friendship between the two nations

the us economy grew at a healthy 27 percent 
annual rate in the spring far higher than previously estimated the 
government said tuesday in a report viewed as further evidence that 
the countrys longest peacetime expansion is in no danger of 
faltering 
the commerce department said that the increase in the gross 
national product from april through june was a full percentage point 
higher than the anemic 17 percent gnp increase originally estimated 
a month ago 
most of the newfound strength came in consumer spending a 
critical sector because it accounts for twothirds of total economic 
activity government spending business investment and us export 
sales also provided momentum during the spring 
the gnp report showed that while inflation picked up in the 
second quarter the increase was not quite as bad as previously 
believed a price guage tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 
51 percent from april through june because of higher energy costs 
a month ago this increase had been put at 52 percent 
in further good news for the economy the commerce department 
said tuesday that sales of new homes bolstered by falling mortgage 
rates shot up 144 percent in july their biggest monthly gain in 
almost three years 
with the strength in home sales which had been one of the 
weakest sectors of the economy analysts said they expected 
respectable growth in the final half of the year in line with the 
forecast being made by the bush administration 
this is a far different view than the one prevalent just a month 
ago when the initial gnp report put growth at such a sluggish rate 
that many analysts expressed fears that the country was on the verge 
of its first recession since the 198182 downturn 
since that time however various reports have shown that 
business activity in the spring was not as sluggish as previously 
believed 
we have had almost a total rewriting of history said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co instead of the entrenched 
slowdown suggested by the original data we now have a story of a 
very solid economy that was picking up momentum in the second 
quarter 
in the first three months of the year the gnp grew at a 37 
percent rate but most of that increase included a onetime boost 
that resulted from returning anticipated farm output this year to 
its predrought levels without that increase nonfarm gnp rose at 
a weak 15 percent rate in the first three months of the year 
analysts have been busy revising upward their growth forecasts 
with some approaching the administrations own projection that the 
economy will turn in a respectable 29 percent increase in 1989 
compared to a fouryear high of 44 percent in 1984 
this economy is not headed into a recession said lyle 
gramley chief economist of the mortgage bankers association in 
fact we are doing better for the seventh year of an economic 
expansion than we had any reason to hope for 
to reach the administrations growth target the economy will 
have to expand at an annual rate of just 22 percent in the second 
half of the year 
sinai said gnp growth could rise to around 3 percent in the 
current julyseptember quarter but other analysts said they were 
looking for slightly slower growth because of a need to work down 
inventories of unsold goods in such sectors as autos 
white house budget director richard darman two weeks ago 
criticized the federal reserve suggesting that if a downturn does 
occur it will be the fault of the central bank for keeping interest 
rates too high 
but analysts said there was little likelihood now that the 
central bank will lower rates any time soon given the robust 
economic growth and the fact that inflationary pressures have abated 
somewhat but not disappeared 
in another report the government said that corporations profits 
after taxes fell a sharp 54 percent in the second quarter the 
biggest setback in three years and a reflection of rising business 
costs analysts said 
the gnp report showed that consumer spending advanced in the 
second quarter at an annual rate of 22 percent double the original 
estimate government purchases jumped by 123 percent while business 
investment spending climbed by 82 percent 
the trade deficit as measured by the gnp declined by 25 
billion slightly better than the original estimate 
the weakest sector in the gnp report was housing which suffered 
a 126 percent drop in construction in the spring the worst setback 
since 1982 but analysts noted the big jump in new homes sales in 
july and said this should spur construction increases in the months 
ahead 
the various changes left the gnp after adjusting for inflation 
at 4134 trillion in the second quarter

sen richard lugar says president oscar arias 
of costa rica optimistic that nicaraguas marxist government can be 
removed through free elections favors continued us humanitarian 
aid to the contra rebels until they can be resettled peacefully 
lugar also said he believes the profits of drug production and 
distribution in nations such as colombia peru and bolivia are so 
enormous that the supply of narcotics probably cannot be shut off 
until demand for cocaine and other drugs in the united state is 
dramatically reduced 
the indiana republican a ranking minority member of the senate 
foreign relations committee commented at a news conference as he 
reviewed his impressions of a 14day ninenation trip through latin 
america 
reporting on his visit to costa rica lugar said president 
arias told me he favors continuation of american humanitarian aid to 
the contras through the nicaraguan elections next february and 
perhaps after that 
lugar said that when family members are taken into consideration 
some 60000 to 70000 people are either contra members or closely 
associated with them 
arias believes that reintegrating so large a group into 
nicaraguan society or settling them elsewhere will be difficult and 
time consuming and that they will have to be supported until their 
future is secured lugar said 
arias believes the majority of them will be integrated but it 
will be difficult lugar said 
lugar noted that the agreement reached earlier this year by the 
presidents of five central american nations calling for the 
disbanding of the contras by december is purely voluntary on the 
part of the rebels 
arias the principal architect of the accord also stressed the 
need for the united states and nations in latin america and western 
europe to go into nicaragua to boost voter confidence that the 
february elections will be held and that a nonsandinista president 
can be elected president lugar said 
he said polls taken by costa ricans in nicaragua show that a 
unified opposition would defeat the sandinistas and he is 
optimistic that could happen lugar said 
the nicaraguans have to get over a psychic block that leads 
them to believe that either nothing will happen or that elections 
will not make a difference lugar added 
he said arias hopes to give the process a boost at an 
international conference in san jose in october marking the 100th 
anniversary of democracy in costa rica noting that president bush 
plans to attend 
the five central american presidents will meet in managua the 
nicaraguan capital in december arias hopes that also will help 
promote the elections process lugar said 
lugar said he found the narcotics situation in countries such as 
colombia and peru difficult complicated and truly depressing 
he said us officials estimate that 450 square miles of peruvian 
farm land is in coca production with peruvian officials estimating 
the total as twice that 
coca paste is the basic ingrediant of cocaine and lugar said it 
is hard to imagine what crops could be substituted that would bring 
in a quarter of the narcotics profits now being pumped into the 
inflationravaged peruvian economy 
in colombia lugar said it is essential the united states 
strengthen a government that is under siege by narcotics cartels in 
the aftermath of the assassination of a leading presidential 
candidate 
eradicating the flow of narcotics into the united states depends 
on drying up demand among americans using drugs lugar said 
we should be discouraging first users and casual users and 
rehabilitating addicts he said

williams declined to say what type of equipment would be 
provided noting in general terms it would be aircraft weapons

package last friday said the united states would huey helicopters 
for transporting troops equipment and ammunitions blackhawk 
helicopters for medical evacuations planes trucks and assault 
boats

not be delivered until the entire list was received and approved 
which he added could be this week

space shuttle atlantis was rolled to 
the launch pad tuesday for a mission that will send the 
plutoniumfueled galileo spacecraft on a sixyear flight to venus 
and jupiter 
the rollout allows plenty of time to ready atlantis for liftoff 
oct 12 said conrad nagel who directs shuttle preparation oct 12 
is the start of a 43day period in which jupiter will be in position 
to receive a probe from earth in 1995 
nagel said the galileo probe would be put in the payload bay on 
wednesday 
five astronauts will deploy galileo about six hours after launch 
starting it on a journey during which it is to fly by venus pass 
earth twice and make the first close approach to an asteroid 
the circuitous 24millionmile route was chosen so galileo can 
use the gravitational pull of venus and earth to accelerate it 
slingshotfashion toward jupiter 
galileo is to parachute a probe into jupiters atmosphere and 
then spend about two years orbiting the planet photographing it and 
studying it with scientific instruments 
to power it through its long journey galileo will carry two 
122pound nuclear generators 
antinuclear groups have protested that the nuclear material 
could pose a hazard if it were released during an accident although 
no protesters were at the rollout 
if people really understood what were doing here the 
significance of it the risks we are taking and the precautions we 
are putting into place there really should be no concern nagel 
said 
nasa has said that the generators were tested to survive the most 
explosive type of shuttle failure and that a plutonium release would 
be unlikely to hurt anyone in any case 
the galileo mission will mark a continuation of the nations 
renewal of planetary exploration following an 12year hiatus the 
drought ended in may when another atlantis crew released the 
magellan spacecraft which is to orbit venus in 1990 
voyager 2 launched in 1977 streaked by neptune last week to 
complete a grand tour of four outer planets during its odyssey 
voyager 2 also examined jupiter saturn and uranus

a woman who says her parents listed her as white on 
her birth certificate to help her later in life has asked a court to 
declare her black 
this is like emancipation for me said mary christine walker 
39 i dont want to be put in a box i dont fit in 
walker who has fair complexion green eyes and light brown hair 
said three of her grandparents were black but one was white 
the former public school teacher said she always has called 
herself black and wants the official designation because she has 
been accused of lying about her race to take advantage of 
affirmativeaction policies 
walkers lawyer penfield tate ii said he had trouble filing the 
petition last week to change her birth certificate 
nobody wanted it tate said in the 20 years ive been 
practicing law ive never seen anything like it and from some of 
the reactions i got i dont think anybody else had 
walker said her parents wanted their kids to make it and they 
picked the easiest way possible they knew what it was to be black 
they knew the problems 
mom really stressed the white world on the kids education 
manners and she was very paranoid about the secret getting out

walker whose family moved from great bend kan to colorado in 
the 1950s said she found her mixed heritage made her a target of

neither do the blacks so i dont think he had a love of either

moldavian lawmakers trying to make 
their language the official tongue of the southern republic 
overwhelmingly won their first test of strength tuesday stopping a 
bid to halt legislative debate 
the republics legislature voted 30043 to proceed with the bill 
despite objections by deputies from two cities where 80000 mostly 
russian workers have been on strike since last week in protest 
saying it would be the first step of a policy of discrimination 
three deputies abstained and 30 were absent 
the strikes have affected more than 100 factories and enterprises 
in at least three cities in the republic that borders romania 
a key opponent of the bill said the vote to proceed with 
legislative debate portends likely approval in the next few days 
i think the law will be adopted the bill will pass said 
vladimir a solonar a historian and a leader of yedinstvo a 
russianlanguage group he said his group will try to amend it 
solonar warned that life wont be quiet if the bill passes 
i know the situation is very dangerous and in the future this 
tension will not disappear he said 
the bill would make moldavian which is nearly identical to 
romanian the official language moldavia currently has no law 
defining an official language but russian is commonly used in 
government factories and commerce 
opponents of the bill want to see both moldavian and russian 
named official languages yedinstvo is seeking amendments allowing 
business managers to choose the language of their official 
documents essentially gutting a key portion of the law 
the bill also would make moldavian the language of communication 
between russians ukrainians jews bulgarians and other 
nationalities in the republic that goes further than the language 
laws in other soviet republics many nonmoldavians dont speak 
moldavian but they share some knowledge of russian as a result of 
soviet schooling 
the communist party newspaper pravda criticized that part of the 
bill tuesday the bills opponents say that will force even 
predominantly nonmoldavian residents to use moldavian 
the labor newspaper trud attacked moldavian nationalists saying 
they stepped up bitterness mutual hostility and suspicion among 
ethnic groups 
the law also would restore the latin alphabet replacing the 
cyrillic imposed by dictator josef stalin after he annexed moldavia 
from romania in 1940 stalin imposed the cyrillic alphabet to back 
up his claim that romanians and moldavians are two distinct 
nationalities 
ethnic moldavians make up 64 percent of the republics 42 
million people tensions between the moldavians and nonmoldavians 
have been running high since the peoples front a primarily 
moldavian group began organizing this year to push the language law 
and other demands for more autonomy from moscow 
the peoples front won the first battle when the legislature 
convened and defeated an effort by deputies representing the 
strikers to delay the session for months well after a communist 
party central committee meeting on ethnic issues expected in early 
september 
mihai ghimpu acting chairman of the peoples front said about 
50 deputies opposed the bill other peoples front sources said 
there may be as many as 100 votes against it 
the law requires a twothirds vote of all deputies who are 
registered for the session if tuesdays registration does not 
change the opponents will need 116 of 346 votes to defeat it 
we have to seize the moment said ala myndycanu a member of 
the peoples front governing council we have to solve our 
problems before moscow does 
leonida lari a moldavian poet and lawmaker said in an 
interview the people are patient but theyve been pushed to the 
edge theyve been held back too long 
speeches at the session which was televised live in kishinev 
overwhelmingly favored the language law 
during the session police surrounded the legislative building 
which flew the flag of the moldavian soviet republic a red banner 
with a green horizontal stripe and a hammer and sickle 
on a nearby square hundreds of peoples front supporters 
gathered beneath the blue yellow and red of the traditional 
moldavian flag 
after the debate ended the crowd swelled to several thousand 
people and swarmed around about 100 people who marched past a statue 
of lenin and shouted slogans against the strikers 
in the baltic republics meanwhile communist party officials 
accepted a stinging rebuke against nationalist activists that was 
issued saturday by the communist partys central committee in moscow 
but four lithuanian legislators sent a telegram to the kremlin 
saying the central committee statement showed a dictatorship 
still rules they also said the statement was anticonstitutional 
directed against the selfdetermination for the peoples of the 
republics according to arunas zabriunas a leader of the 
lithuanian grassroots movement sajudis 
vaino vyalyas the party chief in the republic of estonia said 
the party agreed with the central committees assessment that the 
baltics were in danger of falling into an abyss if they heeded 
separatist calls for secession tass reported 
tarmu tammerk editor of the estonian newspaper kodumaa said by 
telephone that vyalyas also criticized destabilizing groups of 
different kinds including those calling for secession and 
restoration of the bourgeois order that was a reference to the 
independent government that ruled estonia between the two world wars 
vyalyas said the republic wanted more local control but 
estonia is part and parcel of the soviet union as a sovereign 
republic however he also said he believed firmly in the 
selfdetermination of nations on the basis of democratic legal 
guarantees 
the government of lithuania and the communist party of a second 
baltic republic latvia came into line monday 
tass reported that the lithuanian party ruled out secession 
saying it is possible to be a free and sovereign nation within a 
union of equal republics 
lithuanian activists said monday that president mikhail s 
gorbachev told officials of the lithuanian communist party the 
republic had gone too far in its drive for independence 
on aug 23 more than 1 million baltic people joined hands in a 
human chain protesting the 1939 agreement between stalin and adolf 
hitler that assigned the baltics to a soviet sphere of influence

irans parliament approved all 22 members 
of president hashemi rafsanjanis new government tuesday opening 
the way for economic reform and gradual restoration of ties with the 
west 
the official islamic republic news agency said the 270member 
majlis took the unprecedented step of endorsing the entire 
cabinet in past ballots deputies rejected several nominees 
earlier reports suggested three cabinet candidates would be turned 
down 
irans state tv showed deputies chanting death to america 
death to israel death to britain after the results of the secret 
ballot were read out by speaker mehdi karrubi 
however the new cabinet contains more technocrats many of them 
westerneducated than revolutionary ideologues 
the appointments reflect rafsanjanis pledge to focus on raising 
living standards and boost private enterprise after a decade of 
strict state controls on the economy 
rafsanjani had come under fire from radicals for dumping their 
leaders from his cabinet they included outgoing interior minister 
ali akbar mohtashemi who has been closely linked with shiite moslem 
militants holding most of the western hostages in lebanon 
the endorsements came after karrubi a member of the radical 
faction opposed to rafsanjanis pragmatists gave the cabinet list 
his personal backing at the last minute 
i see mr rafsanjanis cabinet as a successful one and one that 
suports the deprived and whose members have worked for the 1979 
islamic revolution karrubi said 
karrubis support was seen as critical for rafsanjani who was 
elected president july 28 and handed broadened executive powers 
the cabinet approval indicated the radicals were prepared to 
follow spiritual leader ayatollah ali khameneis call for an end to 
political bickering 
khamenei became the irans supreme leader after the death june 3 
of revolutionary partriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
but karrubi who succeeded rafsanjani as speaker also said the 
new ministers would face tough scrutiny in the chamber where 
radical factions have dominated since parliamentary elections last 
year 
our hands will not be tied if a minister gets the vote he 
said 
rafsanjani speaking before the vote called for more government 
efficiency noting that in the past only 50 or 60 percent of 
programs passed in parliament had actually been implemented 
he said ministers programs must include an annual budget that 
would need parliamentary approval 
he defended his cabinets political credentials but stressed the 
emphasis was placed on finding good managers because we are in the 
reconstruction phase and right now we have to put more effort 
into ensuring the programs are implemented 
iran is seeking to rebuild industry after an eightyear war with 
iraq it also hopes to boost productivity afer years of economic 
mismanagement by revolutionary radicals 
rafsanajni also is expected to gradually revive links with the 
west to end irans isolation and attract foreign investment 
a key figure in restoring foreign relations will be foreign 
minister ali akbar velayati 44 a ustrained pediatrician who 
helped negotiate the ceasefire with iraq that took effect in august 
1988 
velayati was one of 14 ministers who received more than 200 votes 
in parliament others were oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 41 and 
and interior minister abdollah nouri 39 a former leader of the 
revolutionary guards

new prime minister toshiki kaifu travels to the 
united states on wednesday for a summit japanese officials hope will 
forge closer contacts and cool simmering trade tensions 
kaifu who took office aug 9 will not bring major trade or 
diplomatic initiatives to his discussions with president bush a 
senior foreign ministry official said 
he does plan however to use bush baseball and talks with 
academicians to seek closer ties with americans to ease tension over 
japans growing economic might said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
mr kaifu wanted at the earliest possible occasion to make a 
personal approach to president bush not only for bilateral 
relations but in a global context as well the official said 
it is extremely important to have a personal relationship so 
that both sides can pick up the phone when important problems crop 
up he said 
the 58yearold prime minister also will appeal to the american 
public in several major speeches and visit boston for a red sox game 
in san francisco washington and boston kaifu will address 
scholars and journalists as part of his effort to appeal directly to 
people who influence american public opinion and policy 
recent surveys have indicated growing resentment in the united 
states over japanese investment in american real estate and over the 
us trade deficit with japan which was 55 billion in 1988 
according to us figures 
bush is expected to seek a commitment from kaifu that japan will 
broaden foreign access to japanese business and distribution systems 
usjapanese talks on nontariff trade barriers are scheduled to 
begin sept 4 but kaifus liberal democratic party is under strong 
pressure at home not to make additional concessions on trade 
the senior official said kaifu viewed his us visit as an 
opportunity to explain exactly what japan has already done to help 
ease the trade deficit 
what we have done is considerable given the very fact that we 
have changed our economic structure from one visibly dependent on 
exports to one dependent on the domestic economy he said 
it will take a long time to solve the trade imbalance and in 
the meantime we have to live with it the official said to 
defuse the tension caused by the imbalance we need a more objective 
understanding of each other 
foreign ministry officials said monday that kaifu also would 
reassure bush and other american officials of japans overall 
political stability 
japanese foreign policy initiatives have been on hold for several 
months as the governing liberal democrats grappled with a series of 
money and sex scandals and an election setback that led to two prime 
ministers resigning kaifu is japans third prime minister in three 
months 
mr kaifu will be making clear to the president that there will 
be no change whatsoever in our basic position in our foreign policy 
and he will continue to carry on the commitments made with president 
bush and the american government said yukio okamoto of the 
ministrys first north american division 
kaifu also will use the tour which will take him to mexico on 
sept 46 and to canada on sept 7 to establish his diplomatic 
credentials and enhance his stature at home analysts say

sales of new homes bolstered by falling 
mortgage rates surged 144 percent in july the fastest pace in 
nearly three years the commerce department reported tuesday 
the department said that new singlefamily homes were sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 739000 units last month 
compared with a revised rate of 646000 units in june 
the advance was led by a giant 558 percent jump in sales in the 
northeast a region where sales have been especially sluggish 
because of high prices but every geographic area of the country 
reported good gains during the month 
analysts credited the advance to a sharp decline in mortgage 
rates after hitting a peak of 112 percent in march fixedrate 
mortgages had fallen to an average 981 percent nationwide by the 
end of july 
rates have risen slightly in recent weeks currently averaging 
1021 percent according to a national survey by the federal home 
loan mortgage corp 
economists were split on whether this increase would continue or 
whether mortgage rates would begin to drift down again in coming 
months 
david berson an economist with the federal national mortgage 
association said he looked for mortgage rates to continue creeping 
up driven by reasonably strong economic growth and continued 
worries about inflationary pressures 
but lyle gramley chief economist at the mortgage bankers 
association predicted a resumption of modest rate declines and he 
said this would act to spur further gains in sales 
the july increase was the third in the past four months and put 
sales at their highest level since december 1986 when homes were 
sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 784000 units the 144 
percent rise was the biggest advance since a 229 percent jump in 
september 1986 
the report on new home sales followed a report last friday that 
sales of existing homes also improved in july rising by 12 percent 
to an annual rate of 340 million units the second consecutive 
month that existing home sales have increased 
the price of a new home posted a modest decline in july the 
median newhome price fell 37 percent to 118800 the median is 
the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less 
some analysts said the price drop indicated that firsttime 
buyers who buy less expensive homes are reentering the market 
but gramley said he also believed that the decline reflected the 
fact that sellers were being forced to cut their asking prices 
especially in such highcost areas as the northeast 
the 558 percent jump in sales in the northeast was the biggest 
onemonth advance for that region since february 1982 it put sales 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 120000 units 153 percent 
above where they were a year ago 
sales climbed 238 percent in the midwest to an annual rate of 
125000 units the highest level of activity for this region since 
february 1987 
sales in the west were up 89 percent to an annual rate of 
232000 units while sales in the south rose by a more modest 24 
percent to an annual rate of 261000 units

an international conference failed to formulate a 
peace plan for cambodia but will probably meet again next spring to 
resume its work a spokesman said tuesday 
delegates predicted a fullscale resumption of the guerrilla war 
with the combatants also maintaining their political contacts 
there is not at this stage the possibility for movement by any 
of the cambodian factions said spokesman jean gueguinou 
the 19 countries at the monthlong conference were to issue a 
brief declaration wednesday at the closing ministerial session he 
said adding the conference was likely to resume in paris when 
conditions are right 
gueguinou said a likely time was next spring 
the issues of national reconciliation among the warring factions 
and setting up a control mechanism to monitor a standdown were the 
biggest stumbling blocks he said 
a threeparty resistance led by prince norodom sihanouk has been 
fighting the vietnameseinstalled government of prime minister hun 
sen for a decade vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 
toppling the khmer rouge from a nearly fouryear reign of terror 
the chinesebacked khmer rouge the strongest element in the 
resistance have been the central issue of contention 
hun sen has rejected sihanouks efforts to include the khmer 
rouge in an interim government composed of all cambodian factions to 
preside over the country before general elections sihanouk has 
refused to exclude them from a share of power 
the failure to reach a settlement at the conference means there 
will be no international supervision of a withdrawal of vietnamese 
troops from cambodia vietnam has pledged to pull out its 26000 
troops by sept 27 even without a peace agreement 
hun sen has rejected any monitoring force under the united 
nations which recognizes sihanouks coalition as legitimate 
government of cambodia 
french foreign minister roland dumas and his indonesian 
counterpart ali alatas conference cochairmen decided that 
compromise was impossible among the four cambodian factions despite 
intensive consultations tuesday gueguinou said 
it was too early to reach a compromise but not too early to 
work he said when the conference resumes it will start with 
considerable work behind it 
it had been widely speculated that the conference would fail in 
its goal to reach a comprehensive settlement to the conflict in 
cambodia which has endured two decades of bloodshed and turmoil 
we are deadlocked here because the military situation is not 
decisive said a spokesman for sihanouks delegation ek 
saraywath if there is no result on the battlefield there is no 
result at the negotiating table 
we may be moving into a period where things will go back to 
the ground to the battlefield a senior us official said 
demanding he not be further identified there may be a period now 
of some months of testing of the military balance on the ground 
reports of battlefield action have increased over the past three 
weeks western analysts attributed the renewed fighting to a 
jockeying for power before the resumption in paris of the final 
ministerial session 
hun sen thinks he can still win the war that is why he has 
made no concessions here ek said when he sees that he is weak 
he will negotiate 
in three or four months well see who has the advantage he 
said 
the us official said there was great uncertainty about the 
real strength of the khmer rouge and that a period of military 
testing may determine who has the upper hand in any future 
negotiations 
the official refused to comment on whether the united states 
could supply lethal aid to the resistance should fighting flare 
again president bush had been pressing for aid to the two 
noncommunist elements of the resistance 
we assume at the minimum there will be a very substantial 
supply of armaments by vietnam to hun sens forces he said

the official press broadened accusations tuesday 
against ousted communist party chief zhao ziyang saying the 
reformminded leader inspired attacks on government offices during 
the spring democracy movement 
the new attacks by two newspapers were a possible prelude to 
prosecuting zhao in what would be the first trial of a party leader 
in nearly a decade 
the newspapers said zhao was directly responsible for massive 
student marches attacks on government offices and establishment of 
illegal groups during the democracy movement through neglect of 
political and ideological education 
zhao ziyang proposed diluting the function of the party 
said economic information he denied the superior tradition of 
the party and canceled the work of political education 
a commentary in the party newspaper the peoples daily said 
zhao bolstered flagging protests in shanxi province when he told a 
visiting delegation on may 4 that the government should open 
dialogue with the students 
his comments the paper said resulted in daily marches of tens 
of thousands of people the establishment of more than 60 illegal 
organizations attacks on provincial offices and the disruption of a 
major international trade fair by thousands of students 
economic information said students influenced by zhao attacked 
the socialist system at a discussion session last year with 
education officials and questioned the need for political 
education the students called ideological workers glib talkers 
propagating dog philosophy the paper said 
zhao was stripped of his party posts in late june after losing a 
power struggle over handling of the sevenweek democracy movement 
he was accused then of splitting the party and supporting the 
protests 
since then government officials have said the investigation into 
zhao is continuing but have refused to say if the party charges will 
be turned into legal charges 
zhao has not been seen in public since late may when he spoke 
tearfully to students occupying tiananmen square some unofficial 
reports say he is under house arrest but government spokesman yuan 
mu recently said zhao was leading a normal life 
the media have carried sporadic criticism of zhao for weeks but 
the recent attacks have been notable for their length detail and 
specific references to damage zhao allegedly caused by his erroneous 
thinking and leadership including leading vast numbers of 
people astray 
the commentaries may be an effort to prepare the public for the 
first trial of a top party leader since the 1980 trial of the gang 
of four the leaders of the 196676 far leftist cultural revolution 
economic information said zhao neglected ideological work and 
encouraged bourgeoisliberal or western thought 
a workers daily commentary saturday said zhao elevated the role 
of entrepreneurs while belittling workers who should be considered 
the force behind socialist modernization 
workers daily said zhao missed the point of chinas economic 
reform policies of the past decade which was to show the 
superiority of socialism 
zhao ziyang often told some people that capitalism actually was 
better and our socialist system had problems it said 
a military assault on beijing quashed the student demonstration 
killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of people

a czechoslovak court tuesday convicted a 
leading dissident of inciting rebellion and sentenced him to 20 
months in prison emigre and human rights sources said 
the dissident stanislav devaty called the proceedings a 
political trial that violated his freedom of speech an emigre 
source said on condition of anonymity 
defense attorney jiri machourek immediately appealed the 
conviction calling the proceedings unfair according to the emigre 
source as well as charter 77 human rights activist dana nemcova 
they said they were citing reports from friends of devaty who 
attended the trial 
devaty 37 is a charter 77 member who last year served as the 
groups spokesman 
the trial was held at gottwaldov about 125 miles east of prague 
devaty was tried in connection with a petition signed by more 
than 400 people calling for more religious and cultural freedom and 
the release of all political prisoners the petition was sent late 
last year to the government which made no response 
one of the most active of czechoslovakias dissidents devaty has 
been detained several times this year and released after hunger 
strikes 
devaty initially was detained march 16 in a mass crackdown on 
dissent that also put playwright vaclav havel and other leading 
activists in jail he was last detained aug 7 
the emigre source said only five friends of devaty were allowed 
into the courtroom most of the 30 people attending were hired by 
the government to keep out devaty supporters she said 
also present were representatives of the us and canadian 
embassies she said 
machourek said the evidence presented should have been 
insufficent to reach a verdict because none of the witnesses said 
devaty wrote the petition according to the emigre source

two mathematicians who set a record in june by 
calculating pi to 480 million decimal places have extended the mark 
to over 1 billion places ibm announced tuesday 
the work was done by columbia university researchers gregory and 
david chudnovsky on two supercomputers at ibms thomas j watson 
research center in yorktown heights the company said 
the new mark of 1011196691 digits appears to be a world 
record said denis arvay spokesman for the international business 
machines corp 
theyre starting more calculations so it goes on from here 
arvay said tuesday i dont know when theyre going to stop 
peter renz associate director of the mathematical association of 
america said he had not heard of anybody exceeding the researchers 
mark 
pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter 
the infinite string of digits begins with 314159 and contains no 
obvious pattern 
the 480 million digits the chudnovsky brothers calculated in june 
would stretch for 600 miles if printed 
at the time david chudnovsky said calculating pi to such lengths 
is useful for testing the performance of computer hardware and 
software he called the task the ultimate stress test 
the calculations also let researchers investigate whether the 
string of digits is random or contains some undiscovered pattern he 
said

despite the scandal enveloping the generic drug 
industry consumer advocates and physicians on tuesday reaffirmed 
their confidence in lowerpriced clones of brandname medicines 
at the present time theres no evidence that any generic drugs 
out there in the pharmacies lack safety or effectiveness said dr 
sidney wolfe a physician and head of the public citizen health 
research group 
although disclosures of fraud and corruption in the food and drug 
administrations generic drug division have tainted the agencys 
reputation and cast doubts about the industry many say concerns 
about the safety of generic drugs are overblown 
what weve seen in the past few weeks is regrettable but i 
dont think it reflects all generics and it really hasnt changed my 
prescribing habits said dr ray w gifford a trustee of the 
american medical association who is also an interist at the 
cleveland clinic and a clinical pharmacologist 
in the past month the fda has initiated steps to withdraw from 
the market products manufactured by several generic drug companies 
including two that have admitted wrongoing in the growing scandal 
in the latest move the fda on monday said it wants to remove 
from the market bolar pharmaceuticals co incs generic version of 
dyazide a popular drug used to treat high blood pressure the fda 
said it found no evidence of fraud and the copiague nybased 
bolar said the problem stems from confusion over a clerical error in 
identifying samples used in safety tests 
last week the agency said it wants to remove from the market 
three products made by par pharmaceuticals of spring valley ny 
and 25 made by vitarine pharmaceuticals inc of springfield gardens 
ny par and a company executive have pleaded guilty to paying 
illegal gratuities to fda chemists and vitarine has admitted that 
it submitted false samples for safety tests 
also last week the fda expanded federal inspections of 11 
generic drug makers to include the plants of 20 additional generic 
firms the agency said it was a further effort by the fda to 
assure the public of both the safety and the efficacy of the 
genericdrug supply in the united states 
the concerns question the ability of generic products to work as 
effectively as the brandname drug whether they are absorbed into 
the body at the same rate as the original drug 
wolfe head of the nader consumer health group said these 
potency problems are rarely of any significance in most cases he 
pointed out doctors prescribe the same dose of medicine to a 
125pound adult as to a 250pound adult 
for most drugs there is a wide range over which the drug will 
be effective and safe he said this cuts through a lot of the 
extent to which people are overreacting to the problems that have 
been brought to light 
while wolfe defends the general safety and efficacy of generic 
drugs he is sharply critical of the fda for creating an 
atmosphere of lawlessness with lax enforcement of the regulations 
governing drug approvals 
he is more concerned about the safety of new brandname drugs 
than generic compounds because the record shows that every major 
prescription drug disaster in this country is related to a newly 
marketed brandname drug 
generic drugs copies of brandname medicines that are usually 
more expensive have long been controversial but have become well 
accepted by consumers and physicians a third of all prescriptions 
written in the united states are filled with generic drugs 
according to the generic pharmaceutical industry association 
while generics are seen by some as moneysaving alternatives 
others including some brandname companies claim generics are less 
effective than their tradename counterparts 
most physicians can tell you that there are certain situations 
in which they would insist on tradename drugs said gifford of 
the ama he said he referred to conditions such as congestive heart 
failure that are difficult to treat 
jay molishever a spokesman for the generic pharmaceutical 
industry association noted that generic drugs have been subject 
to constant continuing scrutiny throughout their existance and 
that the results have shown generics to have an extraordinary 
record of safety and efficacy

police reported 
they said the malteseflag sunshield was hit at 230 am seven 
miles off the christianheld maameltein area 11 miles north of 
beirut while trying to run the syrian artillery blockade under 
cover of darkness it carried 550000 gallons of gasoline 
johannes garabedian the lebanese captain was among the dead 
coast guard vessels rescued two wounded crew members two others 
were missing and feared dead the police reported they said the 
seven badly burned bodies washed ashore several hours after the 
tanker was hit 
police reported three people killed and 16 wounded in the ensuing 
fivehour artillery exchange between syrian army gunners and 
christian army units led by gen michel aoun three of the wounded 
were moslem firemen hit when an 82mm mortar round exploded in the 
parking lot of a west beirut fire station 
at least 802 people have been killed and 2268 wounded nearly 
all of them civilians since fighting began march 8 between aouns 
men and a moslem alliance led by the 40000 syrian soldiers in 
lebanon 
a police spokesman said the sunshield was hit by at least one 
shell from radarcontrolled syrian howitzers deployed along the 
seafront in moslem west beirut 
hanna saddiq 24 said at a hospital in christian east beirut the 
tanker was set ablaze by missiles fired from a syrian gunboat that 
intercepted it 
the syrian captain ordered us through a bullhorn to identify 
ourselves and our cargo our captain did not reply said saddiq 
who was being treated for severe burns 
all our crew were hiding behind sandbags placed on the bridge 
to protect us from syrian shelling the syrian gunboat sailed away 
and then fired several missiles that hit the bridge starting the 
fire 
if saddiqs report is correct it would be the first time a 
syrian warship fired on a cargo vessel since the fighting began 
nearly six months ago they usually order intercepted ships to turn 
back 
police insisted the sunshield was hit by artillery fire from west 
beirut directed by syrian radars in mountains overlooking the coast 
what probably happened is that the gunboat pulled away as they 
usually do leaving it to be hit by shellfire said the police 
spokesman who cannot be identified under standing rules 
he said the radarcontrolled howitzers opened fire soon after the 
tanker entered lebanese waters 
a tug managed to tow the stricken ship to within a halfmile of 
the coast and firemen extinguished the blaze 12 hours after it 
hegan the police said 
a security source said privately the christians might be trying 
to blame the attack on a syrian gunboat in hopes of getting french 
naval protection for blockade runners 
the tanker attack coincided with a visit by french envoy francois 
scheer for talks with christian and moslem leaders on how to end one 
of the worst episodes in a 14yearold sectarian civil war that has 
killed more than 150000 people 
syrian soldiers are in the country under an arab league 
peacekeeping mandate issued in 1976 the year after the war began 
aoun calls them an occupation force and has declared a war of 
liberation to drive them out 
france which governed lebanon by mandate until 1943 has a 
sixship flotilla in the eastern mediterranean it says the warships 
are on a humanitarian mission to evacuate the 7000 french citizens 
in lebanon if necessary 
after the sunshield was hit police said aouns 155mm howitzers 
opened fire on syrian artillery positions in west beirut to cover 
coast guard boats trying to rescue the tanker 
syrian gunners responded and shells began falling on christian 
and moslem neighborhoods 
seven other cargo ships trying to reach christian ports have been 
hit by syrian gunfire since march 16 at least two seamen have been 
killed 
scheer secretarygeneral of the french foreign ministry arrived 
in beirut from two days of talks with syrian leaders in damascus he 
met with aoun for three hours tuesday in the generals bunker under 
the presidential palace at baabda a christian suburb and told 
reporters 
he later crossed the sectarian dividing line for meetings with 
moslem leaders including acting prime minister salim hoss head of 
a moslem cabinet that competes for authority with the christian 
government led by aoun 
diplomatic sources said scheers plan includes a ceasefire 
embargo on arms deliveries to warring factions political reforms to 
distribute power equally between christians and moslems and 
withdrawal of foreign forces

president bush wrapping up work on a 
new us drug strategy said tuesday his administration will 
cooperate to the best of our ability on colombias request for 
an extra 19 million to fight drug kingpins 
in a meeting with top policy advisers bush put new focus on the 
andean strategy to fight drugs in south american countries that 
are the source of illicit narcotics said national security adviser 
brent scowcroft the adviser said however it was too early to 
comment on colombias request for another 19 million on top of the 
65 million bush already has approved 
bush also declined to comment directly on the request advanced 
in washington by colombian justice minister monica de greiff and 
said details of the aid are being worked out now in discussions 
with the colombians 
the president made the comments to reporters after a strategy 
review with top cabinet advisers including the attorney general and 
secretary of defense on a revamped antidrug plan that he will 
announce in a nationally broadcast white house address sept 5 
scowcroft said after the meeting that bush is adjusting his 
strategy to respond to the heightened drug crisis in colombia drug 
lords there have launched a series of attacks and threaten to kill 
more judges in retaliation for extradition of any drug trafficking 
suspects 
he indicated that new focus would be put on the andean 
strategy to provide aid to interdict cocaine in the source 
countries of peru colombia and bolivia 
vacationing at his seaside home on the maine coast bush summoned 
his cabinet advisers involved in the international component of the 
8 billion antidrug strategy to be unveiled in a week 
asked mrs de greiffs request for 19 million in additional aid 
bush would not comment directly but he said we will cooperate 
with colombia to the best of our of our ability i support what the 
president of that country has been trying to do and everyone of our 
cabinet officers here all of us agree that this is important 
step 
he said he had great respect for colombian president virgilio 
barcos call for foreign drug users to help curb demand for drugs 
this demand barco said is destroying his country 
asked about reports that bushs antidrug strategy would include 
300 million in economic and military aid for the andean countries 
scowcroft told reporters that figure had already been adjusted 
upward by 65 million with the presidents announcement of 
additional helicopters and equipment aid for colombia last week 
he indicated there could be further adjustments in the figure 
but gave no specifics 
in washington there were these related developments 
at the pentagon a spokesman said that distribution of the 65 
million worth of us military aid was awaiting a detailed list of 
needs from colombian officials 
when the list is returned to the united states delivery will 
begin pete williams told reporters 
williams said the united states sent colombia a list of equipment 
available for immediate transfer from defense department stocks 
after bush granted the aid the colombians in turn issued their 
list of requests 
williams declined to say what type of equipment would be 
provided noting in general terms it would be aircraft weapons 
ammunition personal gear communications equipment and medical 
supplies 
mrs de greiff holding a news conference at the colombian 
embassy vowed to stay on the job saying the law is under siege 
in colombia and we must protect it every way we can 
i never considered resigning she said in response to a 
question about such reports the threats are out there but i am 
satisfied with my protection right now 
in the session with reporters covering the vacationing president 
in maine scowcroft noted that the primary focus of bushs antidrug 
strategy will be on the domestic aspects including law enforcement 
assistance education and treatment programs 
bush called the meeting at his walkers point home where he has 
been vacationing since aug 16 arriving from washington in 
addition to scowcroft were attorney general dick thornburgh 
defense secretary dick cheney deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger national drug policy coordinator william bennett white 
house chief of staff john sununu and cia director william webster 
scowcroft said de greiffs request for more money was not 
discussed at the presidents meeting because officials had just 
learned of it in reports from washington 
were now in discussions with the colombians over the 65 
million package we put it together based on what we thought 
that the colombians would need in order to undertake the operatiosn 
that they have in mind he said theyre now discussing with us 
the kind of things they think they need 
scowcroft said its not clear to me what de greiffs extra 
19 million would be for but he added that he was not ruling out 
the possibility of more aid than the 65 million bush is providing 
from an emergency assistance fund 
in addition the administration has announced a 5 million 
package of security assistance to help protect the colombian judges 
who are a principle target of drug assassins 
on a related matter scowcroft said its possible that some 
drug traffickers wanted for extradition to the united states have 
taken refuge in panama where a sept 1 deadline for installation of 
a new government comes up this week 
there is no government to install however because the countrys 
de facto ruler gen manuel antonio noriega invalidated last mays 
elections after first allegdly rigging them to his advantage 
scowcroft said the administration would have something to say 
about the administraions position position relative to panama this 
week 
de greiff indicated the 19 million she was seeking would be for 
bullet proof cars and other protective measures for the judicial 
officials 
scowcroft lauded the colombian government for bravely standing 
up to the drug traffickers who are waging a war of violence and 
assassination on government officials 
we want to do everything we can to help the colombians he 
said 
he said bush also would raise the drug issue with canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney when mulroney arrives wednesday for a 
twoday private visit with the president here scowcroft said bush 
will likely ask the canadians to get involved in the antidrug 
effort in south america 
bush already had approved the major planks of his new antidrug 
strategy but a draft of his sept 5 television address being 
circulated in the administration contained blanks on some details 
including what he will say on colombia one official said the 
address will be bushs first televised speech to the nation from the 
white house 
bush returns to washington a day before after nearly three weeks 
on vacation here

the federal price support for soybeans grown 
this year will be reduced 5 percent to 453 per bushel from 477 
in 1988 the maximum reduction allowed by law agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter said tuesday 
yeutter said the decision was a preliminary one and the final 
1989 soybean support rate will be announced by oct 1 
the reduction in the support rate was required by a formula in 
the 1985 farm law but the law says the support cannot be cut more 
than 5 percent in any single year and in no event can be lowered 
below 450 per bushel 
agriculture department economists have forecast that soybean 
prices during the 198990 marketing year beginning sept 1 may 
average 475 to 6 per bushel compared with 735 in the current 
year 
there is no direct relationship between the market price and the 
price support in a given year 
soybean production is expected to be up sharply this this year to 
an estimated 19 billion bushels from 154 billion in 1988 when 
drought reduced yields

state on texas license plates 
the commission decided instead to add just the red white and 
blue state flag to the plate which already carries a texas map

message would attract tourists 
the slogan became the topic of radio callin shows newspaper 
surveys and coffee shop banter 
its wimpy said texas treasurer ann richards a candidate 
for the democratic nomination for governor 
many suggested the lone star state instead a newspaper 
survey came up with such suggestions as the bank failure state

declaring that bulgarias turkish minority was 
trapped in a tragic situation of human rights violations the 
bush administration announced monday it had recalled the american 
ambassador to the east european country and joined nato allies in 
condeming bulgaria 
a strong statement issued at the state department followed what a 
us official said was a recent worsening of the situation and an 
inability by turkey to absorb many more than the 311000 ethnic 
turks who have taken refuge in the country 
while estimates vary about 1 million people of turkish 
extraction live in bulgaria where according to the state 
department they are systematically denied the right to speak the 
turkish language and practice turkish culture 
the turkish government recently required visas of ethnic turks 
emigrating from bulgaria the bulgarian government accused turkey of 
hypocrisy 
turkish border officials said they had strict orders to turn away 
the refugees waiting to cross into turkey however the 
semiofficial turkish news agency anatolia said hundreds were 
allowed to enter without visas last week 
turkish opposition parties accused the government of backing away 
from its pledge to accept all ethnic turks who wanted to come while 
bulgaria blamed turkey for refusing to hold talks on an immigration 
agreement 
the turkish ethnics with strong us support accused bulgaria 
of forcible assimilation beginning in 1974 that made practicing 
islamic rites more difficult 
the situation just continues to get worse said richarrd 
boucher the state department spokesman said repression 
continues 
he said ambassador sol polansky had been recalled from sofia 
for consultations and that the bush administration was 
considering assistance for the refugees 
the ongoing abuse of the human rights of bulgarian ethnic turks 
by the government of bulgaria remains an issue of serious concern to 
the us government the statement said 
the us has made its views on this matter known to the 
government of bulgaria both publicly and privately and president 
bush has spoken several times to turkish leaders to express our 
strong support for their efforts to end this tragic situation the 
spokesman said 
simeon darpatov spokesman for the bulgarian embassy denied the 
allegations he said turkey had set preconditions for discussing the 
problem with his government including recognition of a distinct 
turkish ethnic group in bulgaria 
there should be a dialogue between the two neighoring countries 
and we are not pleased when other countries interfere in bilateral 
relations darpatov said 
the bulgarian diplomat said nobody has been persecuted for his 
religion in the country 
darpatov said his government in accord with the 1975 helsinki 
accords permits all of its citizens to travel abroad

shiite moslem chief nabih berri said 
tuesday that to solve the hostage crisis the united states should 
help end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
my advise to the americans and everyone is to help resolve the 
lebanese problem berri told reporters representing foreign media 
at his heavily fortified office in west beirut 
they have to go to the core of the problem in order to be able 
to help resolve the hostage problem berri said 
at least 802 people have been killed and 2268 wounded nearly 
all of them civilians since the latest outbreak in the civil war 
began march 8 between christian forces and a moslem alliance led by 
the 40000 syrian soldiers in lebanon 
berri leader of the moderate syrianbacked amal movement also 
said the hostage issue was linked to the 1982 israeli invasion of 
lebanon 
the israeli army withdrew from lebanon in 1985 after a threeyear 
occupation but set up a selfdesignated security zone in the south 
six to 10 miles deep as a buffer against crossborder guerrilla 
attacks into northern israel 
why was it before 1982 that we didnt hear of any kidnapping 
berri asked because before 1982 we didnt have the israeli 
invasion all that happened to lebanon came after that date 
sixteen foreigners are missing in lebanon most are believed held 
by proiranian shiite extremist groups they include eight 
americans four britons two west germans one italian and one 
irishman 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press kidnapped on march 16 1985 
amal is not involved in seizing hostages the hostageholding 
groups are believed to come under the umbrella of hezbollah or 
party of god 
berri and sheik abbas mousawi of hezbollah on thursday announced 
the end of 16 months of intermittent clashes between their rival 
factions for dominance of the 12 million shiites lebanons largest 
sect 
the feud killed nearly 575 people and wounded more than 1550 by 
police count 
mousawi said the mission for amal and hezbollah now is to 
jointly confront the new crusaders invasion 
he referred to a french naval buildup in the eastern 
mediterranean which the shiites claim was designed to support 
christian army commander gen michel aoun in his confrontation with 
syria and its moslem militia allies

a woman who settled a crack debt by allowing her 
13yearold daughter to be raped was sentenced to life in prison 
tuesday 
the child is grateful her pain is finally over prosecutor 
kelly ramsey said after the sentencing she can begin rebuilding 
herself 
susan barbier 29 was convicted of firstdegree criminal sexual 
conduct the charge for rape in michigan for giving her daughter to 
a man who raped her twice 
the crime normally carries 10 to 25 years in prison but circuit 
judge james j rashid said barbier gave flagrantly false 
testimony at her trial and showed no potential for reform 
the man who raped the girl anthony sawyer 28 was convicted of 
the same charge and was sentenced thursday by another judge to 40 to 
60 years in prison 
barbier had maintained her innocence at all times and had also 
claimed that she had been punished enough because her children had 
been taken from her 
that is not a punishment for someone with such little regard 
for her children rashid told her your daughter trusted you and 
you abused that trust beyond all bounds of decency 
ramsey said barbiers daughter called the 1988 rape the worst 
hour of my life according to testimony by sawyer barbier offered 
her daughter to satisfy a drug debt then smoked crack with sawyer 
afterward 
barbier is eligible for parole in 10 years 
her former husband michael dare has been granted temporary 
custody of the victim two other children ages 6 and 8 are staying 
with a relative 
this case demonstrates tragically the farreaching impact of 
drugs on innocent people the judge said i have not heard of 
such a situation where drugs were responsible for a mother 
subjecting her own daughter to sexual abuse

voyager 2 cruised away from neptune and 
toward the stars tuesday completing an 865 million trek past 60 
worlds a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent 
destruction of their own planet 
if you want to understand earth go look at other worlds 
said cornell university astronomer carl sagan a member of the team 
that analyzed about 81000 photographs taken by voyager 2 and its 
twin voyager 1 
our passion to explore our deep need to understand our 
origins and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding 
our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets 
as scientists held a final news conference at nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory to summarize voyager 2s discoveries the 
oneton spacecraft was 276 billion miles from earth and 42 million 
miles beyond neptune the solar systems fourthlargest and 
currently mostdistant planet 
voyager also was nearly 45 billion miles along a curving path 
that took it from earth in 1977 past jupiter in 1979 saturn in 
1981 and uranus in 1986 and now past neptune in search of the edge 
of the solar system voyager 1 explored jupiter in 1979 and saturn 
in 1980 
for 865 million 20 cents per year per american since the 
project started the twin voyagers visited four planets with at 
least 56 moons discovering at least 23 of the satellites and 
examining worlds of wonder like jupiters moon io with its 
sulfurspewing volcanoes 
as exciting as the discoveries at neptune have been this 
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that 
voyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its 
journey through the outer solar system said voyager project 
scientist edward stone for those of us fortunate enough to be 
involved this has been the journey of a lifetime 
at neptune voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to nereid 
and triton which were first detected from earth it discovered 
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet 
it found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings 
the spacecraft detected in neptunes bluish atmosphere an 
earthsized swirling storm called the great dark spot 720 mph 
winds photochemical smog invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus 
clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below 
voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy 
pinkish triton the first kind are calderas 1000footdeep 
craters measuring hundreds of miles across that produced 
oceansize floods of ice flowing like lava probably no more 
recently than a half billion years ago said us geological survey 
geologist laurence soderblom 
the second type can erupt explosively ejecting nitrogen ice and 
gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph higher and faster than 
initially estimated he said he said he suspects the nitrogen 
volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years 
soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a voyager 
photograph of one of the calderas computer enhanced to make it look 
as it would to someone standing on tritons surface and seeing the 
crater in three dimensions 
scientists also presented new findings tuesday showing neptunes 
weak tilted magnetic field doesnt go through the center of planet 
but is offset about fourtenths of the way toward the surface that 
plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the 
planet suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may 
exist in a shallow spherical shell not in a deep central core as 
inside the earth 
these observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of 
captain cook or even the posthumous accounts of magellan said 
planetary society vice president bruce murray former director of 
jet propulsion laboratory the discoveries challenge our 
imagination and seem just like science fiction but they may be very 
important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their 
grandchildren 
the knowledge gathered by the voyagers may help alert their human 
masters to the vulnerability of earth a tiny garden threatened by 
nuclear warfare the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone 
shield 
if you look who discovered these dangers you find a 
remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists 
sagan said 
he said sherwood rowland and mario molina first warned of 
depletion of earths ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to 
help nasa understand the atmosphere of venus molina now works at 
jet propulsion laboratory 
sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that 
smoke from nuclear war could plunge earth into a dark cold nuclear 
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange 
of warheads 
the idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the 
great martian dust storm of 197172 which was detected by mariner 
9 and chilled mars already cold surface sagan said 
from mariner and the space probe pioneer scientists studied the 
runaway greenhouse effect on venus where thick clouds trap 
solar heat warming the planet to 900 degrees 
sagan said voyager also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks 
to answer that most fundamental question where we come from how 
we fit into the grand cosmological scheme 
voyager 2 keeps looking back at neptune until oct 2 then like 
voyager 1 it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting 
information about particles and magnetic fields in space and 
searching for the edge of the solar system scientists figure the 
probes can continue transmitting data until 2020

cash receipts from larger crops this year are 
boosting net farm income more sharply than had been expected the 
agriculture department said tuesday 
the departments economic research service said that nationally 
net farm income could rise more than 10 percent this year to between 
48 billion and 53 billion 1 billion more than forecast in july 
last years net income was around 44 billion and the record was 
47 billion in 1987 
as used by the agency net farm income includes the value of 
agricultural production whether sold or stored on the farm and 
allowances for family dwellings and other adjustments minus total 
operating expenses 
in another method of accounting the report said this years net 
cash income could fall from last years record 60 billion net 
cash income does not include changes in inventory values and is 
simply gross cash income during the year minus cash operating 
expenses 
economists said cash receipts from the sale of crops and 
livestock are expected to rise 2 billion to 10 billion this year 
more than offsetting a decline in direct government payments to 
farmers total expenses are likely to go up 3 percent to 6 percent 
largely because of more land being brought into crop production 
wheat and corn receipts are expected to rise as much as 15 
percent this year following sizeable gains last year the report 
said vegetable receipts are also expected to rise soybeans 
however probably will see falling receipts as higher domestic 
production and record foreign output lead to a 25 percent decrease 
in prices 
total livestock and poultry receipts should see a modest rise 
but hogs could be the only livestock group facing a drop the report 
said although the decline in 1989 hog receipts is expected to be 
small less than 500 million it will be on top of a 1 billion 
reduction in 1988

workers were arrested across the country tuesday there were no 
details on any charges

public transportation except for essential services should come to 
a halt during the strike the strike was intended as a show of 
strength before parliamentry elections later this year 
the government also asked thousands of its employees to stay in 
their offices overnight so they could report for duty wednesday

investigators frustrated by a bold heist of 
more than a ton of silver shaped like hersheys kisses are hoping 
the thieves brag and are also watching smelters capable of melting 
down the 200000plus cache 
we dont have any leads but they have to melt it down 
undersheriff bill davis said tuesday and im confident well get 
a tip from somebody wholl hear about the heist all good crooks 
brag about the jobs they pulled 
officials are investigating past and present employees of the 
trinity silver mine where the robbery took place saturday night 
the mine is about 20 miles from lovelock a town more than 90 miles 
northeast of reno 
were fairly sure it was an inside job davis said they 
knew something about the mine 
gene smith spokesman for the us borax corp which owns part 
of the mine said a shotguntoting man in a red ski mask tied up two 
mine employees with duct tape and with an accomplice who was either 
a woman or a small man used a wheelbarrow to haul 125 tons of 
silver buttons to a pickup 
they then left spikes in the road to flatten tires of any 
pursuers 
the robbery was discovered when the next shift came in sunday 
morning police said the bound employees werent injured 
it took the robbers more than one hour to haul the silver from a 
locked vault to the pickup said smith he said the thieves 
apparently broke the lock 
the buttons are made when silver removed from the mines ore is 
melted and poured into molds 
smith said the mine normally waits until it has about 50000 
ounces more than 15 tons of dore or impure silver before it 
ships a load to a smelter for refining 
the mine was expected to produce about 4 million worth of silver 
this year 
pershing county authorities notified precious metals dealers but 
smith and smelter operators said the crooks would probably melt the 
silver themselves through an arrangement with a smelter or try to 
ship it out of the country 
they seem to have thought out everything else beforehand so 
im sure theyve thought this through too smith said 
bob horton associate dean of the mackay school of mines at the 
university of nevadareno said authorities could trace the silver 
by examining its makeup every precious metal sample has its own 
unique mix of impurities 
a normal refinery would wish to know the source of the silver 
so if theyre suspicious they would probably report it horton 
added however he noted that crooks could add impurities to change 
the silvers makeup 
horton said the crooks could easily ship the cache out of the 
country because there are no controls on shipping gold and silver 
the trading is pretty wide open he said thats why mining 
companies pay a lot of attention to security 
smelting companies contacted tuesday all refused to comment on 
the record about their operations 
you dont like to talk about details of the operation because 
well its sort of like telling someone when the brinks trucks are 
going out said a new york city official of one of the larger 
preciousmetal refining firms

a leader of the movement demanding the transfer of 
the disputed territory of nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan to 
armenia has been acquitted of corruption charges a documentary 
filmmaker said tuesday 
arkady manucharov chairman of the karabakh committee was jailed 
last autumn along with other committee leaders blamed for organizing 
mass demonstrations in the armenian capital yerevan 
filmmaker arkady ruderman who is making a movie about 
nagornokarabakh said tuesday that a lower court had thrown out 
corruption charges against manucharov and the appeals court upheld 
that decision friday 
ruderman said manucharov a yerevan glass factory manager never 
was accused of a crime connected to the protests 
on sunday manucharov was elected to a vacant seat in the 
armenian legislature with more than 90 percent of the vote ruderman 
said authorities earlier refused to recognize his candidacy because 
he was in jail 
ruderman said manucharov apparently has not yet been released 
from moscows butirsky prison 
meanwhile soviet interior minister vadim bakatin reported that 
someone made an unconstitutional attempt to take power in 
nagornokarabakh last week tass said tuesday 
it quoted bakatin as saying a person was killed but did not say 
when the incident occurred or give other details 
the territory is in predominantly moslem azerbaijan but it is 
claimed by armenia which like nagornokarabakh is overwhelmingly 
christian 
there have been frequent reports of violence in the area this 
summer some involving gunfire and explosives

an old courier returned home to poland on 
tuesday after nearly 45 years and he carried with him the message 
of hope 
this is the culminating moment of my whole life said jan 
nowak the courier from warsaw who is remembered for risking 
his life repeatedly in acting as a gobetween for the polish 
underground home army and the london governmentinexile during the 
nazi occupation of world war ii 
two months ago i thought this moment would never come said 
nowak 76 i am so old i thought it would never come 
as he stepped foot back in warsaw he flashed the solidarity 
vforvictory sign he was greeted with cheers kisses flowers 
and a song of welcome 
nowak escaped poland in october 1944 after the doomed 1944 warsaw 
uprising and mindful of the persecution of exhome army officers 
after the wars end remained abroad for the decades that followed 
aside from his world war ii exploits nowak who lives outside 
washington earned the anger of the postwar communist government 
because he headed the polish section of usgovernmentfinanced 
radio free europe for 24 years beaming in uncensored information in 
polish 
in that role he frequently was attacked in the official press 
and by longtime government spokesman jerzy urban 
poland stopped jamming radio free europe broadcasts on jan 1 
1988 and nowak is able to return thanks to an improved political 
climate marked by the restoration of solidaritys legal status in 
april and the election of solidarity parliament representatives and 
a solidarity prime minister since june 
waiting to greet him tuesday was a highlevel delegation from the 
solidarity movement led by the groups parliamentary leader 
bronislaw geremek veteran activist jacek kuron and sens zofia 
kuratowska and andrzej celinski 
asked what nowaks return meant for poland celinski replied 
everything 
a group of about 50 poles was on hand to welcome nowak including 
a few veterans of the home army which was persecuted by the 
communists after the war but has been gradually rehabilitated in 
recent years 
we poles look at the world through the prism of the war 
because it was then that the character of a man was shaped said 
jozef rodak of warsaw who remembered meeting nowak after the 1944 
warsaw uprising and still regards him as a hero 
when he was fighting leaving poland meant a 99 percent chance 
of death said rodak but he took the risk it is a great thing 
for us we value his courage and his sacrifices for the homeland 
as nowak emerged from the vip lounge at warsaws okecie 
international airport the crowd serenaded him with a round of sto 
lat or may he live 100 years 
long live solidarity replied the beaming nowak 
nowak now a member of the national leadership of the 
polishamerican congress gained additional fame in poland in the 
mid1980s when his book courier from warsaw was issued in 
polish by the oppositions clandestine nowa publishing house it 
became an underground bestseller 
several of the bystanders gave him flowers kissed him and asked 
him to autograph copies of the book 
invited as a guest of lech walesa and the solidarity 
parliamentary caucus nowak will participate in a series of 
solidarity and church observances of the 50th anniversary of the 
outbreak of world war ii this thursday and friday

corporations aftertax profits fell 54 
percent in the apriljune quarter the biggest decline in three 
years the commerce department said tuesday 
the decline followed a smaller 11 percent drop in the first 
three months of the year and left aftertax profits at an annual 
rate of 1643 billion in the second quarter 
analysts attributed the drop the biggest since a 165 percent 
decline in the first quarter of 1986 to rising business costs 
us busineses have enjoyed substantial profit gains over the 
past two years reflecting a major costcutting effort and a boom in 
export sales 
but many economists predicted that this period is drawing to a 
close and profit increases this year will be much more modest 
we could not keep the boom in corporate profits going 
forever said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co the 
second quarter represents a slowing of that extraordinary momentum 
primarily because of cost increases for energy and raw materials 
the decline in profits for the second quarter was lead by a drop 
in earnings for auto companies the report said profits for 
transportation companies and public utilities however rose during 
the second quarter 
among the details in the profits report 
beforetax profits dropped a sharp 64 percent in the second 
quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual level of 2976 billion 
after falling a slight 03 percent in the first quarter 
corporate profits after adjusting for depreciation and 
inventories fell 23 percent in the second quarter to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 3091 billion after posting an even bigger 
7 percent decline in the first quarter 
corporate cash flows a measurement intended to show the funds 
corporations have for investment rose 16 percent in the second 
quarter to an annual rate of 3947 billion after falling 56 
percent in the first quarter 
dividend payments to stockholders increased 2 percent to an 
annual rate of 1209 billion after a 29 percent increase in the

a soviet labor camp inmate who met recently 
with two visiting us congressmen is being moved to another 
facility where conditions are worse an advocacy group for soviet 
jews said tuesday 
the union of councils for soviet jews said it believes mikhail 
petrovich kazachkov is being punished for his outspokenness with the 
american visitors 
kazachkov was tried on aug 25 in perm camp 35 on charges of 
refusal to work and sentenced to be transferred to the chistopol 
prison the union said 
kazachkov a physicist who heads a human rights monitoring group 
at the camp went on strike with eight other inmates to demand safer 
work conditions the union said 
sergei kovalev a former political prisoner told the 
washingtonbased group in a telephone call from moscow that the food 
and conditions at chistopol are worse than at perm 35 and there 
is less opportunity for fresh air 
kazachkov 45 was arrested in 1975 one week after applying to 
emigrate he was convicted of treason and other offenses and 
sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp in 1981 he was given an 
additional 3 years after protesting prison conditions 
in 1987 the authorities offered to free kazachkov if he 
confessed to his alleged crimes on television but he refused the 
union said he suffered a heart attack the same year 
last december he was visited by new york times columnist am 
rosenthal and last month he was allowed a visit by rep christopher 
smith rnj and frank wolf rva 
in an interview wolf said soviet authorities had promised him 
there would not be any reprisals of the kind carried out against 
some prisoners after rosenthals visit wolf said he had spoken with 
23 of the 38 inmates at perm 35 which is situated in the foothills 
of the ural mountains 
theres no doubt kazachkov is a prisoner of conscience he 
ought to be released from prison wolf said this is an 
opportunity for the soviets to review his and other cases and to 
show that glasnost is coming to the prison system too

israeli soldiers tuesday demolished or sealed 
seven houses belonging to palestinian families whose sons are 
accused of bombings or attacking suspected collaborators with 
israeli authorities 
in the occupied gaza strip soldiers opened fire during a 
stonethrowing protest killing a 27yearold student the army said 
in the west bank an arab man suspected of collaborating with 
israeli authorities died of wounds 
the deaths raised to 554 the number of palestinians killed by 
soldiers or israeli civilians during the uprising and to 100 the 
toll of palestinians slain by fellow arabs as alleged collaborators 
with israel thirtyeight israelis also have died 
also tuesday palestinian uprising leaflets appeared for the 
first time signed by a group calling itself hezbollah a government 
source said officials think the group like the radical hezbollah in 
lebanon is tied to iran 
hezbollah and the revolutionary court of justice are going to 
lay in wait for the zionists and take revenge for every drop of 
blood spilled by their hands said the leaflets 
the government source said many leaflets were distributed in arab 
east jerusalem and nearby bethlehem but palestinians said only a 
few have appeared 
army officials think the group was formed by fundamentalist 
moslem palestinians deported from israel who made their way to 
tehran the source said 
the student killed in gaza ws identified as ismail abu jayyab he 
had been jailed four times in the 20monthold uprising against 
israeli rule of the occupied territories and was described by arab 
reporters as head of shabiba the youth movement of yasser arafats 
plo faction fatah at gazas islamic university 
an army spokeswoman confirmed soldiers killed jayyab 
hospital officials in ramallah confirmed the death of hussein 
hila brahama 40 from a skull fracture he sustained last week the 
army radio said he was injured when youths in the town of jericho 
firebombed his house 
the army said it was checking the report 
hospital officials said at least 16 palestinians were shot and 
wounded in clashes between soldiers and stonethrowing youths

alleged collaborator 
arab reporters said the houses belonged to families whose sons 
aged 15 to 26 are suspected of antiisraeli violence they said 
most of the sons are in jail and one was convicted of a firebombing 
and sentenced to two years imprisonment 
fortytwo people lived in the homes destroyed and sealed arab 
reports said 
the army has demolished more than 200 houses and sealed over 100 
during the uprising in a collective punshiment the united states and 
human rights groups condemn as a violation of due process since most 
suspects never are tried 
in the gaza strip meanwhile the military issued an order 
requiring special permits for palestinians to own facsimile machines 
following reports that they are used to distribute antiisraeli 
leaflets 
the israeli daily haaretz called on the government to reverse the 
order saying it will be viewed abroad as interference in civilian 
life and could harm israels image 
outlawing the popular civilian communications machine will 
obviously serve as a juicy news item throughout the world haaretz

the security council unanimously adopted a 
resolution tuesday criticizing south africa for failing to fully 
cooperate with un monitors overseeing the world bodys 
independence plan for namibia 
south africa insists it is complying with the oneyear un plan 
to end its 74year rule of namibia 
the resolution demands the complete disbandment of a notorious 
paramilitary police unit called koevoet and demands all parties 
comply strictly with the un plan especially south africa 
british ambassador sir crispin tickell said he had considerable 
doubts about the evenhandedness of a resolution singling out south 
africa but voted in favor to preserve unanimity 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said he voted for the 
resolution because it was a compromise among several strongly held 
positions about namibia 
the reprimand was watered down during days of bargaining between 
african and western council members 
the original draft attacked south africa for not complying 
with the un plan but britain and the united states succeeded in 
weakening that language 
the resolution calls for complete impartiality by the namibian 
broadcast media during the current election campaign and asks 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to see south africa 
conducts a free and fair election 
tuesdays vote follows two weeks of speeches by about 40 nations 
complaining south africa is trying to rig the november election 
against the southwest african peoples organization the 
guerrillabacked movement favored to form an independent government 
in washington a group of prominent american jurists former 
cabinet members and legislators who have just returned from namibia 
echoed the criticism 
the group called the commission of independence for namibia 
accused south africa of trying to do everything they can to 
manipulate the process in the words of rep howard wolpe dmi 
chairman of the house subcommittee on africa 
his group also called for koevoet to be purged 
the resolution adopted by the 15 security council members does 
not refer to the guerrilla organization also called swapo which 
fought a 23year bush war against south african rule 
i think this clarifies what weve suspected all along that 
this was an attempt to whitewash swapo and carry on what has been an 
unnecessarily protracted exercise for reasons that we find difficult 
to explain said south african un ambassador jeremy b shearar 
the security council debate appeared to win some response from 
the protagonists 
on aug 15 the day before debate opened south africas 
administratorgeneral in namibia louis pienaar announced all 1200 
koevoet officers in the southwest african police would be withdrawn 
from northern namibia and confined to base 
un officials say koevoet members have terrorized guerrilla 
supporters in northern namibia 
during the debate shearar asked why the council was not 
investigating allegations the guerrrilla movement still is detaining 
hundreds of political prisoners 
following his speech the guerrilla organization announced that 
for the first time it would let the red cross and other 
international inspectors visit its camps 
in april swapo released about 200 detainees held on suspicion of 
spying but those freed say they were tortured and that at least 
1000 more prisoners are held in camps in angola and zambia

amtrak is on a fast track to criminal court 
after refusing to stop flushing toilet waste from trains 
state attorney john tanner who filed littering charges against 
the passenger railroad had offered to drop the three misdemeanor 
counts if amtrak agreed to stop dumping from trains passing over two 
overwater trestles 
but amtrak whichhas been dumping along its right of way under a 
federal law that railroads have been using for more than a century 
contends federal law overrides state and local law clifford black 
an amtrak spokesman at its washington headquarters said florida 
risks losing service if it presses the case 
an arraignment was scheduled sept 18 the charges carry fines of 
up to 5000 each 
amtraks 600 passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping 
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the 
contents of 30gallon holding tanks when the trains are traveling at 
least 35 mph 
tanner tried to halt the practice only over the two trestles 
black said agreeing to tanners conditions would make amtrak a 
target for similar demands over every body of water in florida 
with the myriad waterways in florida it would be an impossible 
situation he said monday 
the railroad hopes to replace much of its fleet with new cars 
equipped with holding tanks for all toilets black said it would 
cost 147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet 
amtrak fears having to hire a worker to stand in each car to 
throw an override switch for toilets when the trains cross bodies of 
water black said 
tanner said amtrak is bluffing and could not afford to cut back 
service in florida or the western states oregon washington utah 
california and nevada where it has also come under fire for its 
sanitary habits 
black said that the criminal case is the only one of its kind 
against amtrak of which he is aware two civil cases are pending in 
oregon he said

foreign minister jorge ritter said 
tuesday a provisional government will take over on sept 1 
inauguration day under the constitution and the opposition said it 
would be dictatorship behind a new facade 
also tuesday the defense forces said five opposition party 
members were arrested near the costa rican border on charges of 
threatening national security 
no official announcement has been made of the governments form 
or makeup but most observers expect it to be a junta approved by 
gen manuel antonio noriega the military and police commander who 
wields the real power in panama 
acting president manuel solis palma said tuesday all possible 
formulas of government were being evaluated and we will do the 
best for the country he said 
ritter said it would be a provisional government with the 
widest possible political support 
the opposition which international observers say won a 31 
victory in the may 7 election said it would not be involved in the 
new regime the government noriega sponsors annulled the election on 
grounds of us interference 
the opposition was invited to join a junta but refused saying it 
would continue its campaign to oust noriega as head of the defense 
forces 
we refused the offer for a share of bureaucratic spoils said 
ricardo arias calderon opposition vice presidential candidate and 
leader of the christian democratic party 
he said the new government will be a continuation of the 
military dictatorship and the opposition expects repression and 
the crisis to continue and the dictatorship to go on behind a new 
facade 
us officials have said the united states will not recognize the 
new government 
there can be no accomodation with a government in which noriega 
is the real power said a us source who requested anonymity 
noriega has been indicted in the united states on charges of drug 
trafficking and laundering money washington applied economic 
sanctions in an attempt to force him from power 
the general calls the campaign against him a disguised attempt to 
renege on the 1977 treaties that turn the panama canal over to 
panama at the end of the century 
solis palma said tuesday the permanence of gen noriega at the 
head of the defense forces is part of the struggle for national 
liberation we cannot accept an improvement of relations with the 
united states based on the acceptance of the removal of an official 
of the panamanian government under pressure 
meanwhile a communique read over national radio said the five 
opposition members arrested planned to destroy bridges and provoke 
violence and had undergone guerrilla training on the costa rican 
side of the border 
it said the suspects were members of the christian democratic 
party but gave no other details there was no immediate comment from 
the party 
defense forces sources in the chiriqui province near the border 
who asked not to be named said the arrests had taken place over the 
past few days 
three weeks ago the costa rican government denied reports in the 
panamanian press that rebels were training in villa neilly near the 
border

a federal appeals court ruled tuesday that the 
army may subject more than 6500 of its civilian workers to random 
drug tests including law enforcement and aviation personnel 
the army in 1986 implemented drug testing for more than 9000 of 
its 450000 civilian employees 
in a 30 decision the us court of appeals said 3700 civilian 
police and guards should face mandatory drug tests because of the 
threat to public safety posed by drugimpaired guntoting 
civilian officers 
the 2800 civilians who fly and service the armys airplanes and 
helicopters also should undergo random drug testing due to the 
possibly calamitous consequences of a single drugrelated lapse 
the appeals court said 
a small group of civilian laboratory workers dont have to 
undergo mandatory random testing said the decision by appeals 
court judge david sentelle 
the appeals court said it was unable to determine whether random 
tests should be imposed on a group of employees that includes some 
secretaries and engineering technicians the appeals court returned 
that portion of the case to us district court for further 
consideration 
employee unions including the american federation of government 
employees launched a court challenge to the legality of the random 
portions of the armys civilian testing program 
the government argued that compulsory testing was justified by 
compelling governmental interests in maintaining the safety 
security and integrity of its workforce 
a lower court permanently enjoined the testing in 1988 
concluding that mandatory random testing constituted an 
unreasonable search the permanent injunction was delayed pending 
outcome of the appeal 
the supreme court in its first ruling on testing for drug and 
alcohol abuse in the american workplace last march said workers in 
sensitive government jobs or those entrusted with public safety may 
be forced to undergo the tests

the general secretary of vietnams 
communist party accused president bush and other western leaders of 
trying to take advantage of reforms in some countries to undermine 
socialism according to a report available tuesday 
nguyen van linh told the 7th plenum of the partys central 
committee that reforms in some socialist lands were causing newly 
arising difficulties 
we express our profound concern over the danger threatening 
socialism in some fraternal socialist countries 
he said that western politicians including bush left no stone 
unturned in an attempt to affect the situation in a number of 
socialist countries with the aim of driving these into the free 
world of capitalism 
the plenum was held in hanoi from aug 1524 a text of linhs 
speech at the closing session was broadcast monday on radio hanoi 
and was seen in bangkok on tuesday 
in a number of socialist countries currently facing many 
difficulties the imperialists and reactionary forces are colluding 
to undermine the gains of the socialist revolution linh said 
he said vietnam is also affected by this international situation 
over the past few days official vietnamese news reports have 
denounced counterrevolutionaries in poland where the first 
noncommunist prime minister for 46 years was appointed last week 
linhs speech seemed to indicate a predominately conservative 
streak in vietnamese politics despite some liberal reforms hanoi 
is closed aligned with moscow where president mikhail gorbachev is 
making major economic and social reforms 
however the 7th plenum rejected bourgeois liberalization 
pluralism political plurality and multiopposition parties aimed at 
denying marxismleninism socialism and the partys leadership 
linh said 
he said serious shortcomings in the vietnamese partys own 
ideological work had caused certain persons to mistakenly believe 
that the nature of imperialism had changed 
linh accused some party members of irresponsible disorganized 
and undisciplined acts and of inciting a number of people to 
disturb public order and security and engage in factional 
activities 
in his criticism of the united states linh said washington has 
continued its space defense program and tightened its military 
belts around socialist countries 
he charged that it had established arms caches in thailand and 
was scheming to set up military bases in singapore 
all these acts are part of their menace strategy relying on 
military strength to oppose the soviet union and socialist 
countries he said 
we do not nurture the illusion that the imperialists are 
willing to achieve peaceful coexistance with us he said

an environmental group said tuesday new laws 
are needed to prevent chemical companies from manufacturing highly 
toxic pesticides banned in this country and sending them abroad 
the practice has created a circle of poison where in some 
cases food tainted by the toxic chemicals is imported into the 
united states and sold to consumers said sandra marquardt who has 
followed the issue for the environmental group greenpeace 
greenpeace cited the practices of the velsicol chemical corp 
which from its plant in memphis tenn is the worlds only producer 
of the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor both pesticides have 
been banned for agricultural use in the united states since 1978 and 
for virtually all other uses in recent years because they were found 
to cause cancer 
the two pesticides which had been widely used for treatment of 
termites have been banned or severely restricted for use in 48 
countries because of their carcinogenic properties 
nevertheless said ms marquardt velsicol exported nearly 5 
million pounds of the two pesticides to 25 countries between 1987 
and the middle of this year more than 330000 pounds went to 
argentina and another 510000 pounds to australia countries that 
import meat and other products into the united states 
in a statement issued from the chemical companys headquarters in 
rosemont ill velsicol called the greenpeace report on its 
continued sale of the two pesticides abroad as grossly 
inaccurate and said it remained committed to producing the 
products and shipping them abroad 
forty years of product use and research conducted by scientists 
who are experts in their field support the continued use of 
chlordane and heptachlor said charles h frommer the companys 
vice president of government regulatory and public affairs 
he suggested in some cases there are no practical substitutes for 
the chemicals a contention disputed by greenpeace 
dr samuel epstein a professor of occupational and environmental 
medicine at the university of illinois medical center who 
participated in a greenpeace news conference in washington accused 
velsicol of failing to inform their foreign customers of the danger 
posed by the two pesticides 
he accused the company of manipulation of information about 
the two chemicals and that warning labels often are not explicit and 
people handling the pesticides not aware of precautions that should 
be taken 
if these products are too toxic to be used here in the united 
states they are too toxic to be used anywhere said ms 
marquardt 
she maintained that the food and drug administration and the 
agriculture department are too shorthanded to adequately monitor 
food imports for content of pesticides that have been banned in this 
country 
she said last year two shipments of beef from honduras were found 
to have been contaminated with the velsicol pesticides she said 
heptachlor contamination also has been found in imported carrots 
pineapples garbanzo beans and cheese although the source of the 
contamination was not clear

japan told international negotiators ending their 
latest talks tuesday they may be letting chances fade for adopting a 
global ban on chemical weapons 
chusei yamada tokyos chief envoy to the 40nation conference on 
disarmament suggested the conference agree on a target date for 
adopting a draft treaty 
as the chemical weapons talks ended the 10week session yamada 
said progress was made this year mainly on technical issues he said 
the important political issues such as provisions for 
monitoring compliance were unresolved 
yamada said a 149nation conference on chemicals arms held in 
paris in january gave political impetus to the geneva talks but he 
expressed a sense of uneasiness that the momentum might be 
slipping out of our fingers 
the talks were entering a threemonth recess 
the united states has told western allies it will not accept an 
artificial deadline at the conference which has been debating a 
global convention banning production stockpiling and use of 
chemical arms since 1968 
french envoy pierre morel who presides over the conferences 
chemical arms negotiating committee said the draft treaty was 
sharply improved this year 
he said new provisions were added on protecting the 
confidentiality of private chemical plants and progress was made in 
working out an international inspection mechanism and classification 
of toxic chemicals to be banned 
conference negotiators expect their next session to begin 
incorporating ussoviet proposals on the destruction of stockpiles 
and inspection procedures into the draft accord morel said 
talks on the treaty are to resume nov 28 the full conference is 
expected to reconvene early next year

world clamor set off by cardinal john 
glemps remarks grew louder tuesday one charge hurled at the head 
of polands roman catholic church was that he used nazilike 
arguments against jews 
glemps saturday comments were meant to calm international 
criticism about his churchs attitude toward jews instead his 
speech set off a new round of controversy about alleged 
antisemitism in the church 
glemp told pilgrims at jasna gora monastery at czestochowa 
poland that polish antisemitism would disappear if jews abandon 
antipolonism or antipolish sentiments 
he asked jews to understand that it offended poles religious 
sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty for jews to insist on 
removal of a carmelite convent set up on the edge of the former nazi 
german death camp at auschwitz in poland 
dear jews do not talk to us from the position of a nation 
elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are 
impossible to meet glemp said 
but some of his language invoking the image of jews spreading 
communism mentioning that some jews collaborated with nazis during 
world war ii that jews as businessmen neglected or detested poles 
and saying that jews have easy access to mass media apparently 
added fuel to charges of antisemitism 
the expressions used by the primate even contrary to his 
intentions pose a danger of deeply wounding the feelings of many of 
those who are descendants and brothers of the holocaust victims 
said catholic journalist krzysztof sliwinski in a rare published 
criticism of glemp 
the commentary appeared monday in the oppositions gazeta 
wyborcza newspaper 
elsewhere the response was even more biting 
referring to glemps comment about easy jewish access to mass 
media the international league against racism and antisemitism 
said in paris it regretted that glemp made use of arguments used 
against jews by the nazis yesterday and by the extreme right in 
france today 
yossi sarid a legislator from the leftwing citizens rights 
movement in israel said tuesday in jerusalem antisemitism has a 
long history in poland and i think it is ridiculous to talk about 
antipolonism 
romes chief rabbi elio toaff said in a newspaper interview the 
question of antisemitism is something the church has to face 
the analysis has to be deep enough to eradicate once and for all 
the antisemitism that still exists in many countries like poland 
it is particularly serious that it was glemp one noted for 
diplomacy and political gifts who confused cause and effects 
said tullia zevi head of the union of italian jewish communities 
quoted in the same article monday in romes i messaggero 
the representative council of jewish institutions of france 
issued a statement monday calling glemps comments malicious and 
out of place 
they bring us back to a period we believed was forgotten that 
of 50 years ago before the war when comments of this type were 
made and led to the tragedy that we know about 
relations between the polish church and jewish organizations were 
already strained by church refusal to relocate the community of 
carmelite nuns from auschwitz the convent site has been criticized 
as offensive because most of the camps victims were executed simply 
for being jews 
an estimated 25 million of the 4 million victims of 
auschwitzbirkenau were jewish 
cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow whose diocese includes 
the camp announced aug 10 that the church was suspending a 1987 
agreement to move the convent he said it could not fulfill the 
agreement in an atmosphere of aggressive demands 
the proposal to remove the convent which was founded in 1984 
just outside the auschwitz fence has found little sympathy in 
poland poles have commonly argued that thousands of the victims at 
auschwitz were polish political prisoners including many priests 
and nuns 
cardinal albert decourtray archbishop of lyon in france said 
tuesday it was unlikely that glemps words were meant the way they 
were received 
he said the primate and bishops of poland cannot be accused of 
an antisemitism which they denounce 
the issue of antisemitism remains much discussed in poland even 
though only several thousand jews remain compared to a prewar jewish 
population of 35 million 
poles often feel wrongly accused of blanket antisemitism or of 
playing an active role in the holocaust carried out by nazi german 
occupiers of poland 
few poles deny that antisemitism exists here but they often 
argue that it is exaggerated and note that many poles risked their 
own lives to protect jews during the war

britain said tuesday it will publish in full the 
findings of its inquiry into whether austrian president kurt 
waldheim is linked to the nazi executions of six british commandos 
in world war ii 
a defense ministry spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the report ordered by prime minister margaret thatcher in 
february 1988 will be published within a few weeks but no date was 
fixed 
he would not elaborate and made no comment on a british 
newspaper report tuesday that the findings are likely to be 
inconclusive 
the daily telegraph quoting defense sources said the report 
would shed fresh light on the war record of waldheim a former 
un secretarygeneral who was an intelligence officer in the german 
army but it added no major revelations are likely 
speculation has arisen that some evidence may be suppressed 
because of possible postwar links between waldheim and british and 
us intelligence services 
the six commandos were in a raiding party captured in the 
germanoccupied balkans in april 1944 they were handed over for 
interrogation to waldheims unit in army group e refused to talk 
and were executed it is a crime under the geneva convention to kill 
prisoners of war 
an international commission of historians that investigated 
waldheims army career reported in february 1988 that the initial 
w was on transcripts of interrogations of the six men 
the commission said it could not prove a connection between 
waldheim and the commandos but suggested he knew they were shot by 
the gestapo under a general order by adolf hitler to execute 
commandos 
the britons fate was part of the commissions inquiry into 
charges that waldheim took part in or facilitated atrocities 
including massacres of 60000 yugoslav partisans and civilians and 
rounding up jews for death camps 
the commission concluded waldheim lied about his war record knew 
about atrocities and did nothing to stop them but left open the 
question of guilt 
waldheim says he did nothing wrong after being drafted into the 
german army 
for the british inquiry the united states sent to london copies 
of german army war records relating to the commandos capture the 
original files were among documents captured by american forces as 
the war ended in 1945

training programs for hirelings of colombian drug lords was warned 
by israeli government officials six months ago to stop his 
activities israel radio said tuesday 
it said the officer lt col yair klein fled colombia but four 
israeli associates ended up as hostages in his paramilitary 
training camp until a deal for their release was worked out 
kleins lawyer yigal shapira denied the kidnapping report 
there is absolutely no truth to it he said in a telephone 
interview its a nice story though 
defense ministry spokesman eitan haber would not answer telephone 
calls asking for comment 
the radio which attributed its report to unidentified security 
sources said klein earned about 800000 for his work including 
providing arms and equipment to the men he was training 
the government has begun investigating kleins activities the 
radio report indicated the government has been aware for months of 
kleins operations 
police investigators questioned two more reserve officers in the 
case tuesday and said others with possible links to colombian 
training would be called interrogated were avraham tsadaka and 
mariot shoshani 
israeli newspapers said tuesday that israel was concerned that 
reports of such involvement by israeli mercenaries could hurt the 
countrys lucrative arms trade 
the miami herald and also the washington post quoting a 
confidential report by colombian security forces reported that at 
least five israeli and 11 british mercenaries helped train teams of 
assassins for colombian cocaine traffickers and their rightwing 
allies 
shapira repeated on tuesday that neither klein nor his firm hod 
hahanit spearhead sold weapons in colombia he would not comment 
on reports klein was warned to leave that south american nation by 
israeli officials 
the yediot ahronot daily in a report from bogota said colombia 
has purchased about 350 million worth of galil rifles kfir fighter 
jets and communications equipment from israel 
police questioned klein monday on suspicion of violating israeli 
security laws with his possible involvement in training killers for 
the medellin cartel 
israel radio said that in the defense ministry people knew 
they asked the head of security in the bogota embassy to meet yair 
klein and stop his activities they are illegal and to get out of 
there and fast 
it said klein went to bogota about six months ago to start a 
training course and was warned by an israeli official not to do so 
because the group being trained was in opposition to the 
colombian government 
klein persisted smuggling equipment and weapons to a camp about 
60 miles south of bogota after paying a 100000 bribe the report 
said but he fled after a second warning saying colombian 
authorities wanted to arrest him

merchants boarded up storefronts and swept 
up broken glass tuesday after a night of vandalism and looting 
sparked by the fatal police shooting of a black man 
leaders of this city of 54000 people about 40 miles southeast of 
philadelphia moved to prevent another night of violence 
samuel clark president of the local chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people met with mayor 
harry curley to try to defuse racial tensions that escalated into 
rioting monday night by nearly 200 people on the citys main street 
and the arrest of 23 people 
in new york city religious and community leaders met with 
reporters and called for continued efforts to root out racism in 
the wake of the fatal shooting of a black teenager by white youths 
last week 
in a separate statement new york gov mario cuomo called on new 
yorkers to pray that we will make this moment of shame a time for 
honesty and renewal 
police said the gang in the borough of brooklyn attacked four 
black youths because they believed the four were going to visit a 
young woman who had spurned one of the gang members yusef hawkins 
16 was killed 
the new jersey violence followed sundays shooting of samuel 
williams 26 
about 40 businesses and 20 cars were damaged by rocks and 
bottles most of them along a milelong stretch police said four 
people were injured 
damage was estimated at 75000 to 100000 for broken windows 
and officials were still trying to gauge losses from looting city

justifiable homicide 
that was the catalyst clark said that sparked the anger

good driving skills and a good aim 
seem like reasonable police officer essentials but nicelooking 
clothes also count in beverly hills where money talks and 
celebrities sometimes squawk 
this is a very imageconscious city lt robert curtis said 
tuesday after the beverly hills police department learned its force 
won a special achievement award in the national best dressed police 
department competition 
we are expected not only to function well but also to look 
professional curtis said although officers wear the standard 
navy blue uniform curtis said attention to detail gives them an 
appearance edge 
the examples are subtle rather than black plastic buttons 
beverly hills officers use brass motorcycle officers have a yellow 
pant leg stripe and color guard canine and special tactics units 
have tailored uniforms 
little things make a difference curtis said 
officers who protect and serve on such wellknown streets as 
rodeo drive are often asked to pose for pictures with tourists 
were in the public eye a lot more said officer sammy lee 
who spends 35 minutes each morning polishing his motorcycle

the troubled fort st vrain nuclear 
power plant the nations only heliumcooled reactor was shut down 
nearly a year earlier than planned because of cracks in steam tubes 
utility officials said tuesday 
the hairline cracks found aug 18 in tubes that supply steam to 
drive the the plants turbine generator pose no threat to the 
public but fixing them would have required a lengthy shutdown 
anyway officials said 
the 330megawatt reactor 35 miles north of denver has repeatedly 
experienced equipment problems and unplanned shutdowns since opening 
in 1976 in december public service co of colorado said it planned 
to end nuclear operations at the plant in june 1990 
although we had hoped the plant would perform through the first 
half of 1990 our board and executive management feel this is the 
most prudent action to take in light of the new difficulties at the 
plant said utility chairman delwin hock 
utility officials however would not rule out resuming nuclear 
operations at fort st vrain even though they had ruled it out in 
december 
public service spokeswoman peggy morton said the utility could 
permanently close the plant convert it to fossil fuel or resume 
nuclear operations with financial help the nuclear regulatory 
commission has licensed the plant to run through 2008 
however morton said plant workers have begun removing nuclear 
fuel from the reactor and are preparing to decommission it 
hock said layoffs are expected but not for at least a month 
he said the shutdown would not hurt the utility financially 
because it already has written off the estimated costs 
fort st vrain never has operated for any length of time at 100 
percent capacity in 1984 a series of equipment problems closed the 
plant for 22 months in 1986 the nrc identified it as one of the 10 
worstrun nuclear power plants in the united states the agency took 
it off the list last year 
the latest shutdown came after a routine test aug 18 indicated a 
problem with a control rod in the reactors fuel core while 
replacing the faulty rod crews discovered the cracks 
gascooled reactors have been widely used in europe but fort st 
vrain is the only one of its kind in the united states public 
service officials have blamed the choice of a waterlubricated 
bearing for its turbinelike helium circulators for many of the 
plants problems saying the bearing proved more sensitive than 
anticipated 
fort st vrain also is the only us commercial reactor with a 
graphite fuel core the soviet reactor at chernobyl which exploded 
and burned in 1986 had a graphite core which was cooled by water 
rather than helium

colombian justice minister monica de greiff 
vowed tuesday to stay on the job to fight her countrys drug lords 
and appealed for 19 million in new us aid to protect judges from 
the medellin cartel 
the law is under siege in colombia and we must protect it every 
way we can mrs de greiff told a news conference at the official 
residence of the colombian ambassador 
i never considered resigning she said in response to a 
question about such reports the threats are out there but i am 
satisfied with my protection right now 
the 32yearold lawyer said she would go back to colombia next 
week after concluding discussions with the bush administration about 
her request for additional aid 
i am determined that the integrity of our justice system 
survives this crisis and i hope to play my full part in assuring 
this mrs de greiff said 
the justice minister who met monday with attorney general dick 
thornburgh and other top justice departments aides continued talks 
tuesday with the bush administration about her request for another 
19 million to protect colombias judges from assassination 
the administration only last week approved a 65million military 
aid program and the pentagon said tuesday that disbursement of 
funds under that program is awaiting colombias list of needs 
at the news conference mrs de greiff told reporters we must 
uphold the rule of law and regrettably at this moment that requires 
intensive physical protection of our judges 
the bush administration has already promised 5 million over two 
years for training programs to bolster judicial security 
we have asked the united states for more support not only in 
words but in resources she told reporters i am very pleased 
with what we have done i think we can do more but i think we can 
work out things 
mrs de greiff her countrys eighth justice minister in three 
years said she told thornburgh that colombia needed the additional 
aid to buy armored cars metal detectors and other security devices 
to protect judges from the wave of assassinations mounted by the 
drug cartel 
both our countries are countries of laws even at a time when 
our enemies are operating against us with no respect for law or even 
the minimal standards of decency she said 
the state department meanwhile updated its warning against 
nonessential travel for us citizens in colombia and suggested 
for the first time that american citizens living there consider 
leaving 
although americans have not yet been the target of any 
violence visitors and americans resident in colombia should 
carefully reevaluate whether it is essential that they travel to or 
remain in colombia at this time said the new statement the 
department believes it would be prudent for those who deem their 
presence nonessential to seriously consider leaving 
the last travel advisory issued last weekend was limited to 
recommending that travel to colombia be postponed for several weeks 
in addition to raising the possibility of resident us citizens 
leaving the country the update also recommended that new travel to 
colombia be postponed indefinitely 
president bush who discussed his antidrug strategy with top 
cabinet officials at his maine seaside retreat said the 
administration will cooperate with colombia to the best of our 
ability 
the president declined to comment specifically on mrs de 
greiffs request for more money but added that its being worked 
out now the details 
the pentagon said it will begin delivering military equipment 
under the 65 million aid package as soon as it receives a list of 
materiel sought by the colombian government 
when the list is returned to the united states delivery will 
begin defense department spokesman pete williams told reporters 
officials of both governments are now analyzing those needs 
the spokesman said adding the dod is ready to provide immediate 
airlift 
williams declined to say what type of equipment would be 
provided noting in general terms it would be aircraft weapons 
ammunition personal gear communications equipment and medical 
supplies 
the justice department meanwhile raised the possibility that 
its request to extradite drug trafficker eduardo martinez ramirez 
could be delayed while colombias supreme court reviews emergency 
extradition procedures promulgated by president virgilio barco 
those extradition procedures are complicated and i think there 
is a possibility there may be a decision to have the supreme court 
in colombia rule on those new procedures said spokesman david 
runkel 
runkel backed away from thornburghs earlier prediction that 
martinez would be turned over to us authorities this week saying 
the procedure could take another week 
nevertheless he said we have every hope and expectation of 
getting custody of mr martinez 
mrs de greiff asked about runkels comments said she did not 
know about a possible supreme court review of the emergency 
extradition procedures in 1987 the court set aside colombias 
extradition law 
in a related development the justice department persuaded the 
senate judiciary committee to cancel a hearing set for wednesday on 
the colombian drug crisis out of concern that publicity could 
endanger law enforcement efforts 
runkel said the department advised the panel that because of 
the sensitive nature of the situation in colombia at this time that 
it would not be appropriate to have an open hearing 
david westrate the assistant administrator of the drug 
enforcement administration was set to testify 
the panels chairman sen joseph r biden jr ddel said in a 
statement that committee members would be briefed privately this 
week 
runkel said the justice department was also drafting extradition 
requests for 12 other colombian drug traffickers under federal 
indictment 
the department wanted colombia to have the paperwork so that 
when someone is captured we would be in a position to have 
everything signed sealed and delivered to the united states 
mrs de greiff was asked about whether her son understood the 
danger posed by her continuation as justice minister 
my son is three years old i think he doesnt understand all of 
the problems thats involved she replied but he knows 
something about it i explained to him some things so i hope he is 
safe and we are all safe

a huge disk of hydrogen gas discovered 65 
million light years away suggests that galaxies are still being 
formed in the universe a finding that could modify the current 
theory that star systems formed within a relatively short time after 
the big bang 
riccardo giovanelli head of the radio astronomy group at the 
national astronomy and ionosphere center in arecibo puerto rico 
and martha haynes associate professor of astronomy at cornell 
university found the gas cloud earlier this year using the 
1000foot radiotelescope dish at arecibo 
others astronomers said tuesday that the findings were 
exciting and important and could reshape the current view of 
the history of the universe 
the cloud of hydrogen gas is 10 times larger in diameter than the 
milky way galaxy which includes the sun and appears to be in the 
shape of a disk that is rotating slowly the national science 
foundation announced 
carl heiles a professor of astronomy at the university of 
california berkeley said the gas cloud is a very important 
discovery 
it shows that there are clouds of gas out there that have not 
yet turned into galaxies he said further study said heiles 
could lead to modifications of the basic big bang concept of the 
universe 
the big bang theory postulates that the universe began with a 
cataclysmic explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago and that 
galaxies of stars formed within a few hundred million years after 
that astronomers have earlier reported findings that suggested star 
formation within existing galaxies and studies that indicated that 
some galaxies may have formed billions of years later than others 
but there have been no earlier reported findings of true 
protogalaxies or star systems at the very beginning of 
formation the general belief has been that such formation halted 
billions of years ago 
giovanelli and haynes said they made the discovery through luck 
they were attempting to calibrate the radiotelescope by aiming it at 
a part of the sky they thought was empty 
before stumbling into this thing neither i nor martha were 
great believers in the existence of such objects giovanelli said 
in a statement but this cloud indicates that the disks of 
galaxies can form slowly throughout the history of the universe and 
not just be something that happened during some magic period of the 
distant past 
gas clouds have been discovered in the heavens but those were 
associated with existing galaxies 
this cloud seems to have formed independently in a pocket of 
space isolated from other galaxies said giovanelli 
no stars were found in the gas cloud 
most astronomers believe that galaxies form when hydrogen atoms 
collect in 
huge clouds that are collapsed by gravity and that form clumps 
that further gravitational collapse turn into stars 
giovanelli and haynes estimated the mass of the cloud at about a 
tenth of the milky way which contains billions of stars 
heiles said the relatively small mass of the cloud presents no 
problems to the theory that it is a protogalaxy 
there are lots of small galaxies out there lots that are about 
10 percent the size of our milky way he said 
james rose an associate professor of astromony at the university 
of north carolina who has studied young galaxies called the new 
finding very exciting 
this would be the first time that we could see a mass of gas 
changing itself into a galaxy he said it offers the 
opportunity to study the process in great detail 
rose said that fact that the cloud is close to earth by 
astronomical standards just 65 million light years away will help 
astronomers study it a light year is a measure of distance used by 
astronomers it is the distance that light travels through a vacuum 
in one year about 57 trillion miles 
heiles said the next step now is to conduct a careful search for 
other such clouds in the universe he said astronomers may find that 
there are many other such clouds or forming galaxies 
presently said heiles it is believed that vast areas of the 
heavens are devoid of any matter he said a survey might find that 
many of those voids are not empty at all but filled with hydrogen 
clouds or protogalaxies

a showdown between the new 
government and organized labor shaped up on tuesday as bus drivers 
in the capital refused to work and teachers prepared a nationwide 
strike 
the bus drivers and teachers along with doctors in municipal 
hospitals and public employees in the provinces are demanding 
salary increases that exceed guidelines set by the economy and labor 
ministries 
we insist on a pay floor of 75000 australs about 114 for 
the month of august said maria sanchez secretarygeneral of the 
200000member confederation of argentine educators 
the monthly base now is about 46 the 48hour strike was to 
begin wednesday 
menem belongs to the peronist party whose traditional base is 
organized labor but government and labor have been heading for a 
clash since he was sworn in as president on july 8 
faced with a huge budget deficit and hyperinflation the new 
government raised public utility rates by several hundred percent 
pledged to sell off moneylosing state companies and implemented 
voluntary wage and price controls 
the labor ministry threatened to revoke collective bargaining 
pacts that exceeded 175 percent for the julyseptember period most 
fell within that limit though the cost of living soared by 197 
percent in july alone 
labor leaders complained that workers cannot pay the higher 
utility rates face firings or reduced wages in any privatization 
plan and that the guidelines allowed prices to rise higher than 
wages 
my main obligation is to defend the interests of workers 
saul ubaldini leader of the 3 millionmember general labor 
confederation said im peronist but im not servile to 
anybody 
to restart an economy in recession menem is willing to make 
concessions to business that organized labor is not inclined to 
accept 
on tuesday economy minister nestor rapanelli proposed that as a 
temporary measure businesses be allowed to hire employees for up to 
three years with no commitments to job security or unemployment 
insurance 
on tuesday bus drivers demanding a raise of 36 percent over the 
recently negotiated monthly pay floor of about 95 refused to charge 
passengers many owners pulled their buses off the streets 
coffins piled up in cemeteries in la matanza the most densely 
populated district of metropolitan buenos aires as municipal 
workers including grave diggers refused to work 
public employees in mar del plata and san miguel de tucuman 
struck for higher pay butchers in rosario argentinas 
thirdbiggest city refused to pay electricity bills that are up to 
2500 percent higher than the previous month 
the menem government conscious of the food riots that shook the 
country last may has tried to ease the way for its program of 
economic restructuring 
private and public sector workers have received clothing 
allowances onetime bonuses and advances on monthly salaries soup 
kitchens feed hundreds of thousands of hungry argentines in the 
countryside 
some progress has been reported under the new government 
inflation is projected to increase by 35 percent in august and by 
10 percent or less in september 
real wages in july were about 30 percent higher than in june 
the austral currency has stabilized against the dollar and 
interest rates have plunged prices in supermarkets and department 
stores have come down slightly

a communications satellite that was 
the first payload put in orbit by a privately owned rocket was 
parked in a permanent orbit tuesday by a radiocontrolled motor 
aboard the satellite 
the 2700pound marcopolo i which will beam televison programs 
to british homes was launched into a preliminary elliptical orbit 
sunday from cape canaveral air force station atop a threestage 
delta rocket made by mcdonnell douglas space systems co 
ground controllers tracked the satellite for nearly two days to 
determine its orbital path then sent a radio signal at 952 am 
edt to fire the motor 
hughes aircraft co which built the satellite for a british 
broadcasting company said the motor fired perfectly to kick the 
spacecraft into a circular orbit 22300 miles above the atlantic 
ocean overlooking the british isles 
everything is checking out very well all the systems are 
operating the way they should be said hughes spokesman richard 
dore this has been a very smooth transition into space 
the satellites antenna and solar panels which provide power 
are expected to be deployed thursday dore said 
after being checked for several months marcopolo i will begin 
beaming television signals to britain next spring said anthony 
simondsgooding chief executive officer of british satellite 
broadcasting ltd which will operate the system 
marcopolo i is the first of two satellites designed to transmit 
television programs for a fraction of the cost of cable systems 
directly to british homes equipped with a 12inch dish antenna a 
box on top of the tv set and a remote control unit 
the second satellite is scheduled for launch in mid1990 
the launch was a milestone in the us commercial space program 
started after the 1986 challenger explosion 
president reagan ordered the national aeronautics and space 
administration to stop launching payloads for commercial customers 
from the space shuttle and said the job should be done by private 
industry using unmanned rockets

a huge coalburning power plant in arizona is 
contaminating the once pristine air over the grand canyon and may be 
forced to install expensive pollution controls the environmental 
protection agency said tuesday 
the epa said it will determine by next february how much 
emissions of sulfur dioxide will have to be curbed at the partially 
governmentowned navajo generating station 80 miles from the center 
of the grand canyon 
the plant one of the largest in the country burns 24000 tons 
of coal a day and releases an estimated 12 to 13 tons of sulfur 
dioxide from its 750foot smokestacks hourly 
much of the pollution has been finding its way as sulfate 
particles over the grand canyon causing a white haze over the 
canyon during much of the year especially in the winter months 
according to environmentalists and park operators 
the operators of the navajo plant near page ariz have said 
that costs for pollution curbs possibly expensive scrubbers to 
reduce sulfur releases could be as high 1 billion although other 
estimates have been in the 300 million to 400 million range 
the epa which is under a courtimposed agreement to resolve the 
grand canyon pollution problem and determine to what extend the 
power plant is at fault said there is substantial evidence that 
the 2250megawatt plant is a major contributor to the canyons 
pollution problems 
the epa cited a 2 million sixweek study by the national park 
service in 1987 and early 1988 that concluded that on average 40 
percent of the air pollution over the canyon came from the power 
plant on some days during the study period the plant was blamed for 
as much as 70 percent of the pollution 
the park service used a chemical tracer that was released with 
the plants other emissions and then tracked how the winds carried 
the pollutants over the canyon 
we have substantial evidence that the navajo generating station 
is a significant contributor to the visiblity problem said f 
henry habicht the epas deputy administrator action must be 
taken now to protect the grand canyon 
but officials of the salt river project operator of the plant 
have argued that they should not be required to install expensive 
pollution control equipment because they say the contamination 
over the canyon comes from other sources as well including 
pollution drifting from the los angeles area and mexico 
while the park service contends its study clearly shows the power 
plant to be the major cause of the canyons air pollution problems 
another agency in the interior department the bureau of 
reclamation has sided with the plants operators 
d michael rappoport an srp executive in washington said we 
intend to test the reason and rationale employed by epa the park 
service and the environmental defense fund during the comment 
process and if necessary in court 
at a time when the press and policymakers are rediscovering 
the environment were not at all surprised by the epa decision 
said rappoport who directs the srps government relations 
ed norton director of the grand canyon trust called the epas 
move another encouraging example that epa under bill reilly is 
going to make strong decisions to defend the environment 
nevertheless norton said its by no means the end of the 
issue because the major controversy the pollutioncontrol strategy 
is ahead of us 
the bureau of reclamation which owns 24 percent of the plant and 
relies on its electricty to pump water from the colorado river into 
irregation projects in central arizona has maintained that further 
studies are needed before new pollution curbs should be required at 
the plant 
despite the park service study interior secretary manuel lujan 
said tuesday he is not convinced the power plant is the leading 
culprit in the grand canyon air pollution problems he said he would 
like the national academy of sciences to review the park service 
findings 
we have two bureaus within the department that disagreed 
what we seek is a disinterested third party said a department 
spokesman when asked to elaborate on lujans statement 
environmentalists charge that the bureau of reclamation is trying 
to discredit the park service study because as much as onefourth of 
the cost of additional pollution controls at the plant as much as 
250 million according to some estimates could come eventually 
out of the bureaus budget 
while the epa concluded tuesday that the plant is a major 
contributor to the canyons pollution it held off until next 
february to determine how much it wants the plant to curb its 
emissions and by what means those reductions will be attained 
bob yuhnke an attorney for the environmental defense fund said 
that with the federal government likely to bear much of the cost of 
pollution controls the epa will be under pressure to hold down the 
cost of any emissions control plan 
the epa is under a court order to impose specific curbs on the 
navajo plant by next feb 1 as a result of a settlement of a lawsuit 
filed by the environmental defense fund 
federal clean air laws require the epa to take action against 
polluters that impair visibility in federal parks such as the grand 
canyon

developers and city officials from las vegas 
nev will appeal a court decision protecting the desert tortoise 
which has been listed as an endangered species by the federal 
government 
the group of businessmen and officials filed suit in us 
district court fearing that a real estate boom in las vegas will be 
hurt by an aug 4 emergency regulation issued by the us fish and 
wildlife service it is designed to leave desert tortoises 
undisturbed 
issued under the endangered species act the rule could severely 
restrict development on land inhabited by the mojave population of 
wild desert tortoises 
covered by the regulation are portions of california 
southwestern utah and northwestern arizona as well as southern 
nevada including las vegas the scene of substantial commercial and 
residential growth 
in a decision last thursday us district court judge stanley 
harris refused to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement 
of the rule 
the federal government issued the regulation after an outbreak of 
respiratory disease among wild desert tortoise populations but 
there is no scientific evidence that the disease affected tortoises 
in nevada said the city of las vegas which argued that the 
regulation should have been confined to areas affected by the 
disease 
in his decision harris agreed that it would have been 
significantly preferable to limit the geographic scope of the 
emergency rule but he said nothing in the endangered species act 
requires the wildlife service to limit the chaos caused to 
productive human enterprises based on geographic concerns 
the wildlife services rule calls a halt to an awful lot of 
development activity because the las vegas area is within the 
habitat of the desert tortoise said irwin goldbloom one of the 
lawyers representing the nevada interests filing suit 
in an interview tuesday goldbloom said some construction already 
has been stopped in the las vegas area because of the rule he said 
the nevada officials and developers will go to the us court of 
appeals in an attempt to overturn the emergency regulation 
one court filing in the case said the city of las vegas stands to 
lose 11 million a year in lost tax revenue building permit fees 
and other income due to the regulation 
del webb communities inc a developer says the emergency rule 
could lead to staggering interest costs and could jeopardize 
completion of construction projects 
environmental groups have been pushing since 1984 to place the 
desert tortoise on the list of endangered species 
the federal government stated in court papers that the emergency 
listing will place additional constraints on industries 
to help prevent extinction of the tortoises 
given the longstanding consideration of the desert tortoise 
for listing as an endangered species the group of developers and 
officials from nevada should have been aware of that 
eventuality said justice department lawyers

a government official said tuesday police 
are fighting indiscriminate burning and treecutting in parts of the 
amazon rain forest under emergency measures that already have 
brought 9 million in fines 
jose roberto lima a spokesman for the states brazilian 
environmental institute said institute agents and federal police 
began patrolling part of the amazon jungle in five helicopters in 
early august 
in that month ranchers and farmers traditionally begin to burn 
off forest growth for pasture and planting 
the area is wild and the settlers extremely dangerous if you 
dont police the jungle with a machine gun on your side youre as 
good as dead lima said in an interview 
he said agents had handed out fines of about 9 million in the 
first 15 days of the exercise 
among those fined were farmers ranchers steel mills that use 
wood to fuel blast furnaces and 15 sawmills 
lima said fines will be used to support an emergency 
environmental package called our nature announced earlier this 
year 
amid mounting world concern that the destruction of the forest 
could disastrously change global weather the brazilian government 
also this year suspended incentives for largescale agricultural and 
cattle ranching projects and created a special police force to 
control fires 
satellite photographs show that in the past 10 years the 2 
millionsquaremile rain forest the worlds largest has lost an 
area half the size of west virginia to slashing burning and mining 
ecologists charge the government has done little to discourage 
the uncontrolled destruction 
brazil initially refused offers of help from international 
organizations and foreign governments saying that would amount to 
meddling in its internal affairs but has softened that position in 
recent months 
the government earlier this year turned down offers from the 
united states france and the netherlands to discuss swapping part 
of brazils 115 million debt for preserving amazon land which 
covers twothirds of brazil and is home to 15 million people 
but lima said the institute hopes to receive help from foreign

the national football league on tuesday suspended 
13 players who tested positive for steroids in its first crackdown 
on the musclebuilding drug as well as two athletes accused of 
using illegal drugs 
the steroid suspensions included only one prominent player 
former pro bowl guard ron solt of the philadelphia eagles the two 
suspended under the substanceabuse policy were far more prominent 
cornerback leroy irvin a former allpro from the los angeles rams 
and tight end orson mobley of the denver broncos who played on both 
of denvers super bowl teams 
the players came from nine of the nfls 28 teams the most 
three were from the buffalo bills there were two each from the 
green bay packers the new york jets the los angeles rams and san 
francisco 49ers all 15 received fourgame suspensions 
eagles general manager harry gamble said he was disappointed 
with solt but hes still an important part of the football team 
bills general manager bill polian said he would welcome back his 
three suspended players 
they are not druggies polian said theyre not felons 
theyre not bad kids theyre good kids who made a mistake and are 
paying the penalty for it 
other than solt who is recuperating from operations on both 
knees the bestknown player in the steroids crackdown is maurice 
douglass a backup defensive back for the chicago bears who spends 
the offseason as an exotic dancer 
most seemed to fall into the category defined by us district 
judge thomas hogan on monday who in turning down the players union 
request to halt the suspensions acknowledged the crackdown could 
be fatal to a marginal player 
the league which tested 2200 players in training camps said an 
unspecified number of others tested positive but had been cut for 
lack of playing ability 
others suspended for steroids were running back sean doctor and 
his linebacker brother tom doctor both of buffalo linebacker matt 
jaworski of buffalo offensive linemen mike ariey and keith uecker 
of green bay defensive end mark mraz of the los angeles raiders 
tight end vernon kirk of the los angeles rams running back vince 
amoia and wide receiver bobby riley of the new york jets and 
running back keith henderson and nose tackle rollin putzier of san 
francisco 
the nfl players association challenged the testings accuracy 
saying players had called the union claiming they were innocent and 
suggesting the tests may have mistaken other medication as either 
steroids or masking agents for the drugs 
but nfl spokesman joe browne said we conducted olympiccaliber 
testing that takes everything into account olympic athletes are 
routinely tested for steroids 
a league statement however acknowledged that the nfl could not 
guarantee the testing detected or will detect every steroid user in 
the league 
the suspended players must remain away from their teams training 
facilities until sept 27 the nfl said if the drugs remain in 
their system after that date they will continue to be suspended 
the league said that if another random test found evidence of 
steroids in a suspended player again he would be banned for the 
rest of the season

nancy reagan said fear wasnt keeping her away 
from a school in a ganginfested neighborhood the former first lady 
said tuesday she was never invited to appear at the school 
board of education member rita walters had criticized mrs 
reagan saying her refusal to appear next month at john muir junior 
high school to present an antidrug grant was an insult to the 
community 
the issue is the insult that is rendered when youre going to 
give money for a program in one community but youre afraid to go 
into the community walters said monday night 
deputy police chief glenn levant called a news conference tuesday 
to clear up the controversy saying it turns out to be much ado 
about nothing 
the only thing i can surmise is the school board was not 
presented all of the facts theres nothing political about drug 
abuse levant said 
mrs reagan will present a 50000 nancy reagan foundation grant 
for school antidrug programs on sept 14 during drug abuse 
resistance education day ceremonies at gates street school in 
lincoln heights 
my only goal is to help keep our kids away from drugs i will 
continue to take my campaign to every corner of our community 
mrs reagan said in a statement issued tuesday 
a portion of the money was earmarked for the john muir school and 
the school board staff told walters the former first lady wouldnt 
go to the southcentral los angeles neighborhood due to security 
concerns 
but mrs reagan said she was never invited to appear at john muir 
there simply was no invitation request or expression of 
interest conveyed to the foundation or me that i make the 
presentation at john muir junior high school mrs reagan said 
dare program officials picked the location for the ceremony 
levant said once mrs reagan became aware of the controversy she 
changed her plans to include a second appearance at john muir 
walters on tuesday said she was unaware mrs reagans appearance 
at gates street school was for the dare event not just for john 
muirs program she said her information about the security concern 
came from the board staff 
but even after finding out that it was part of a larger program 
i still maintain that it was inappropriate to make a gift to muir 
at another school walters said 
whoever did what i dont know at this point but the important 
point at this moment is that mrs reagan will be coming to john 
muir she said

the evangelical lutheran church in america 
adopted but later rejected a measure on abortion tuesday that some 
interpreted as prochoice a neutral version was later approved 
in drawnout emotional sessions of the denominations assembly 
delegates voted down an initially approved statement after several 
said it upheld access to abortion 
some felt it supported abortion on demand others that it did 
not said the rev herbert knutsen of rice lake wis urging 
reconsideration of the statement the original was tossed out then 
revived in changed form 
it was not intended to be divisive said louise shoemaker of 
philadelphia who sponsored the original resolution 
she proposed the amended version eliminating an earlier phrase 
calling for free acess to services and substituting personal 
care information counseling and competent christian guidance 
a nurse betty jane reisner of whitehall pa pleaded against 
the substitute saying prochoice allows prolife the reverse is 
not true this is taking away our freedom 
robert vargas of woodville wis and others urged retention of 
the original statement because of the the churchs diversity and to 
give opportunity for ministry to one and all 
the question had been simmering several days among delegates of 
the newly merged 53millionmember denomination which had taken no 
stand on the issue 
we must begin to lead or be led said guy erwin of new haven 
conn calling the issue urgent excruciating and personal he 
urged prompt postassembly study and action by the churchs interim 
policymaking counsel 
we must risk deep disagreement for the sake of the church 
erwin said 
favoring the original measure anne cuba a binghamton ny 
nurse appealed for christians to trust women and give them the 
freedom to make their best choices in gods world 
but in a pained voice the rev paul hinlicky of delhi ny 
exclaimed i will not obey this call for free access to abortion 
on demand 
the three denominations that merged into the new body had taken 
differing positions on abortion from accepting it in limited 
circumstances and defining human life as beginning at conception to 
stressing the right to personal choice 
the eightday assembly which ends wednesday is the first since 
the 1988 merger of the lutheran church in america the american

the health ministry said tuesday it is 
starting a multimilliondollar campaign to stop the spread of 
hepatitis and malaria the centuriesold scourges that kill 
thousands each year in the amazon jungle 
the campaign is to include spraying huts and leantos in the 
amazon rain forest with 198million worth of ddt the cheap but 
powerful insecticide banned in many countries 
health minister seigo tsuzuki said the world bank will help pay 
for the ddtspraying campaign 
in an interview he said brazil begins a 44 million vaccination 
campaign thursday against hepatitis b in lambrea a backwoods 
town in amazonas state known for its high incidence of the illness 
some 93000 children under nine years old will be given belgian 
vaccines in what tsuzuki claimed is the worlds first mass 
immunization against the disease that inflames the liver 
some 10000 workers will be involved in the campaign which will 
be monitored by scientists from cuba france belgium and the world 
health organization tsuzuki said in an interview 
in brazil hepatitis afflicts 74 percent of the population and 
malaria 33 percent according to government statistics the 
ministry says four of every 1000 amazon residents die each year 
from hepatitis 
tsuzuki said the government plans to use the vaccine nationwide 
in hopes of bringing the disease under control within three years 
to contain malaria they plan a fiveyear campaign involving 
198million worth of ddt he said 
last year the ministry registered 560000 cases of malaria in 
brazil up from 500000 a year earlier the number is expected to 
rise again this year 
malaria is almost exclusively a problem of amazonia a 2 million 
squaremile wilderness sprawled across northern and western brazil 
the government plans to send 70000 army troops to the region to 
begin spraying now that the fourmonth rainy season has ended 
tsuzuki said 
he said ddt is cheap and effective against the anopheles 
mosquito which carries malaria 
the insecticide will not be used indiscriminately but only to 
spray inside the huts and leantos used by miners and settlers he 
said 
he said world bank loans will help pay for the ddt campaign 
during the 19641985 military regime the generals in power urged 
poor brazilians to settle in the undeveloped amazon and offered 
numerous tax incentives and state subsidies to ranchers and 
developers 
since the drive began in the 1970s the incidence of malaria has 
risen more than 500 percent the ministry says 
malaria causes fever and chills and a gradual weakening of the 
body it can be fatal if not treated in brazil between 1 and 2 
percent of those who get the disease die from it dr agostinho cruz 
marquez of the ministrys malaria institute told the ap

researchers spent evenings and weekends 
to find the worlds largest known prime number even though it has 
no practical use the company said tuesday 
its like going to the moon in a sense theres not a lot 
there but its important scientifically to do it because the 
technology proves so useful said bodo parady one of six 
researchers for sunnyvalebased computer maker amdahl corp who came 
up with the number 
theres no simple way to express the largest prime number but it 
equals 391581 multiplied by 2 to the 216193rd power minus one 
the number has 65087 digits 600 times as many as the number of 
atoms in the known universe according to sergio e zarantonello 
another of the researchers 
a prime number is any whole number greater than 1 that can only 
be evenly divided by 1 or by itself for example 3 5 7 11 and 17 
are prime numbers 
the new biggest known prime number determined aug 6 beats the 
record set in 1985 by david slowinski of cray research inc the 
us supercomputer maker the new number has 37 more digits and is a 
trillion trillion trillion times larger 
searching for a largest known prime number is like looking for 
a needle in a haystack since only about one in 150000 numbers is 
prime in the region where the new record was found zarantonello 
wrote in a company memo 
the discovery was also announced at a meeting this week of the 
american mathematical society 
although the number has no known practical application the 
standard advanced multiplication programs that were honed by amdahl 
scientists during the search already are being used by scientists 
searching for pulsars the company said 
the process has other applications particularly in cryptology 
and in bank transaction coding both systems can depend on using 
large prime numbers

alabama one of the nations biggest 
dumping grounds for toxic waste announced a ban tuesday on 
hazardous waste shipments from 22 states and the district of 
columbia 
gov guy hunt said the ban the second in the nation was 
necessary to prevent alabama from becoming the waste dump of the 
nation 
alabamas ban mirrors one enacted earlier this year in south 
carolina the alabama ban takes effect sept 14 but may wind up in 
court 
richard fortuna executive director of the hazardous waste 
treatment council in washington said the lobbying group is 
determined to overturn alabama and south carolinas laws he said 
the state laws violate federal interstate commerce statutes and will 
produce a shortage of sites nationally to handle hazardous waste 
it is virually certain we will challenge one fortuna said 
the only question is whether we will challenge both 
according to figures compiled by state environmental officials 
alabama is fourth in the amount of hazardous waste it gets from 
other states when the amount of waste shipped out of each state is 
compared to the amount brought in alabama jumps to no 2 in net 
intake indiana is listed first in amount received as well as net 
intake 
alabamas ban comes from a new state law that says states cant 
ship hazardous wastes to alabama if they dont allow for disposal of 
hazardous wastes within their own borders or dont have a 
cooperative agreement with alabama alabama has signed no 
cooperative agreements 
the law was approved by the legislature and the governor in may 
but the lawmakers left it up to the state department of 
environmental management to determine which states would be 
affected a list was released tuesday 
sue robertson chief of the departments land division said the 
ban only affects a landfill at emelle which is the nations largest 
hazardous waste landfill the law leaves it up to the landfill 
operator chemical waste management to deny shipments from the 
banned states 
chemical waste spokesman chris grimshawe said the company is 
still studying the list and will decide whether to take legal action 
a violation of the ban is punishable by up to 10 years in prison 
and a 10000 fine the state could also go to court to seek civil 
penalties of up to 25000 per day per violation 
among the banned states 18 and the district of columbia have no 
disposal facilities they are alaska arizona delaware florida 
iowa kansas maine mississippi missouri new hampshire new 
mexico north carolina north dakota south dakota vermont 
virginia west virginia and wyoming 
idaho montana oregon and washington state were banned because 
they did not respond to the states request for information about 
hazardous waste disposal within their borders

under a mutual defense pact should stay 
radical students and dissidents a small but vocal minority 
daily stage violent protests demanding the withdrawal of us troops 
whose presence they believe hinders unification with north korea

support demands for immediate withdrawal of us troops and 81 
percent feel conditions will change in 10 years and south korea will 
be able to defend itself

conducted among 1500 south koreans aged over 20 and randomly 
selected from around the country between july 28 and aug 16 
details on polling techniques were not available and pollsters 
did not figure a margin of error 
north korea invaded the south in 1950 to start a bloody 
threeyear war and the poll said 842 percent of those polled feel 
their country would have become communist if us troops had not 
helped a ceasefire ended the war but a peace treaty was never 
signed and the two koreas remain enemies

may invade again and 23 percent do not it said 604 percent 
believe north korea has the capability to invade and 662 percent 
think the north koreans have better combat capability

a government agency is no longer 
considering a ranch near this border city for underground explosives 
tests but agency officials said its looking at another site in the 
area 
the defense nuclear agency had been looking at a site on the buck 
king ranch 25 miles northwest of del rio 
im convinced that they are out out of del rio out of val 
verde county del rio mayor alfredo gutierrez jr said monday 
evening after the agencys announcement i think were through 
with the dna 
gutierrez and other local leaders staged a rally against the 
underground explosion testing which some residents fear could 
damage the citys sole source of drinking water the san felipe 
springs del rio with 40000 residents is in southwestern texas 
on the usmexico border 
the series of blasts known as dughest for deep underground 
high explosive simulation test are designed to simulate the 
impact of nuclear explosions on subterranean missile silos they 
would start in 1990 with a 1000pound charge and culminate in 
november 1992 with a 470ton blast using conventional explosives 
federal officials have said 
in a letter to congressional leaders vice adm john t parker 
jr of the defense nuclear agency said the buck king ranch was no 
longer under consideration he said the agencys preliminary 
analysis of rock core from the ranch indicated it was less useful 
for the experiment than we anticipated 
but he added we are interested in investigating other texas 
sites one of which is in western val verde county much farther from 
del rio than the buck king ranch 
sen phil gramm rtexas who opposed the ranch site said he 
would try to block funding for the project if other sites in the 
county are considered 
if you do choose to proceed with an investigation of other test 
sites in val verde county however you should know that i will 
introduce an amendment to the defense department appropriations bill 
to deny dna the funding necessary to pursue this project gramm 
wrote parker 
potential damage to drinking water was the top concern among the 
approximately 1000 people attending mondays demonstration 
sylvia urby a former city councilwoman said we certainly 
dont want this to happen to del rio our spring water is our life

us policy toward panama enters an uncertain 
phase friday when the calendar runs out on the ousted presidents 
term leaving the united states with nobody to recognize as legal 
head of the country 
the situation raises a number of touchy situations such as 
notifying panamanian officials when a us naval vessel plans to 
search a panamanianflag ship suspected of carrying drugs 
panamas president eric arturo delvalle was ousted in february 
1988 by forces loyal to gen manuel antonio noriega the reagan 
administration refused to recognize that ouster and the united 
states has continued to look upon delvalle as panamas legal 
authority even though he wields no power 
but friday is the date when delvalle was supposed to step down 
officially as president according to panamas constitution with 
that date the bush administrations withdraws the mantle of 
legitimacy it accorded to delvalle

programs on the nashville network may 
look like the tonight show and entertainment tonight but 
theres a twang with the talk on this ambitious channel 
tnn an upstart 6yearold cable station is using guitars 
fiddles and fringe as keystones of programming that highlights 
country music 
the toetapping sounds and a potpourri of other shows are aimed 
at the american heartland by tnn a cousin to the cornpone show 
hee haw in the gaylord broadcasting corporate umbrella 
our target audience is you and me said general manager david 
hall we own a home have cars have kids our audience is 
america 
since 1983 tnn has brought a flavor to the screen that 
distinguishes it from its cable comrades 
on espn you see football helmets its cowboy hats on tnn 
hbo has movies but tnn has the legendary grand ole opry 
mtv offers screeching electric guitars but tnns music is 
wrenching country weepers about heartache and roaming romance 
our mission is to be the no 1 source for country music 
entertainment and information said hall who swept floors at the 
opryland usa theme park while in high school 
some country music stars say tnn which uses a guitar neck as its 
logo is indeed reaching a receptive middle american audience 
fiddlerguitarist charlie daniels observes we were on the 
tonight show recently and ill bet no more than six people 
mentioned seeing us but after were on tnn people everywhere come 
up and say they saw us 
says singer randy travis tnn has taken country music to a lot 
more people and i think thats good for us all 
nashville now broadcast for 90 minutes each weeknight is 
tnns answer to the tonight show it has music talk a live 
studio audience and host ralph emery sitting behind a desk much like 
johnny carson 
it is tnns most popular weeknight show seen by up to 750000 
households 
tnns crook and chase is similar to entertainment tonight 
except theres a live studio audience and emphasis on country music 
performers who often appear to talk with the hosts 
the network available to about 46 million households on cable 
systems across the country hasnt restricted itself to rhinestones 
to attract viewers it has drawn on some prominent noncountry 
celebrities in an effort to widen its audience 
dinah shore has a talk show john davidson and florence henderson 
star on cooking shows wolfman jack is host of a rock n roll 
oldies show kent mccord and martin milner who formerly starred in 
adam 12 have reunited in a twohour movie for tnn to be aired 
later this year 
if you can find stars who dont offend your core of support and 
might broaden your appeal you try to do that hall said you 
bring them in to open things up and give people a sample and they 
find that country music is very enjoyable 
other programming includes country music videos western movies 
concerts rodeos stock car racing features fishing remodeling 
gardening motor home use and a talent show resembling star 
search 
tnn was started by wsm inc the same broadcasting company that 
launched the grand ole opry radio show in 1925 gaylord bought the 
opry tnn opryland and related properties in 1983 
the opry music show is broadcast on the network for 30 minutes 
every saturday night another halfhour is devoted to backstage 
interviews 
if youre a country music fan and you have the chance to watch 
the opry at home on a saturday night you do it hall said 
tnn is privately held and doesnt release how much money the 
network makes 
according to paul kagan associates inc a carmel calif 
consulting company tnn has made a financial recovery since a loss 
of 6 million in 1985 the network has made money every year since 
and is expected to earn 25 million this year after taxes the 
consultant said 
there are shortfalls in the countrys two biggest markets tnn is 
not available in parts of new york city and has to share a channel 
in los angeles 
still tnn says it penetrates 50 percent of american tv homes and 
90 percent of all cable tv homes 
says hall for a 6yearold cable tv network to reach 50 
percent in such a short span of time and continue to grow at a 
dramatic pace is remarkable

if you would like a grand tour of some of the 
most treasured assets of american industry just take a stroll 
through the aisles of your local supermarket 
the soups cereals pet foods and frozen entrees come in packages 
of many colors but to the businesses that produce them many are 
solid gold 
to get a financial slant on the modern foodprocessing industry 
consider how it has fared on wall street in the 1980s 
the value line investment survey the nations largest investment 
advisory service notes that stocks of food manufacturers which 
have soared this year even faster than the market as a whole are on 
the way to their ninth straight year of outperforming the market 
averages 
in the 1980s an investor could not have found a much more 
fertile investment field value line observed 
that message hasnt gone unnoticed by the takeover artists and 
speculators of wall street who have made the food stocks one of 
their most regular haunts what attracts them is not only abundant 
sales and profits but the perception of precious assets waiting to 
be mined 
the most valuable asset of the typical leading food processor 
cant even be found on its balance sheet value line says 
that asset is the portfolio of brandname franchises the buyer 
is willing to pay a premium price for these names that translates 
into premium profits 
for a time during the 1960s and 70s it looked as though the big 
brand name was a diminishing species in food and other 
consumerproducts businesses 
the increasingly sophisticated shopper was discovering that a lot 
of money could be saved by opting for a stores private label 
merchandise or for generic goods in austere packages 
but in the 1980s hurried consumers looking for convenience and 
reliability have evidently gone back to the names they know best 
as a result says value line there is an unprecedented array 
these days of powerful brand names in the nations stores 
foodprocessing companies are spending more and more of each sales 
dollar on advertising and expanding old brand names and trying to 
develop new ones 
all this can have a selfreinforcing effect when a brand attains 
high status the large sales volume that results often allows the 
product to be made packaged and sold at a lower cost per unit 
at the same time supermarkets and other retailers tend to give 
more coveted shelf space to bigname brands more shelf space in 
turn contributes to stillhigher sales 
that is not to say by any means that this process happens 
automatically armies of people are employed to nurture protect and 
promote packagedfood products and their names 
just imagine for example all the work that has gone n the past 
few years into positioning existing food products and creating 
new ones to meet changing consumer health concerns 
when any business has been prospering for a long time people 
naturally begin to wonder if some lean years arent due pretty soon 
but the way analysts see things now prospects for food producers 
and their big brands still look bright 
the recession scare of the past few months has eased of late 
even if a downturn comes the food industry is historically 
recessionresistant 
at the investment firm of merrill lynch which is projecting a 
mild shortlived recession that might drag down profits 
somewhat in more cyclical industries analysts say the earnings 
reports of many food companies should sparkle against that dull 
background

labor unions resented by totalitarian states and 
sometimes by corporate managers are regarded by most historic 
churches as buttressing the rights and dignity of ordinary workers 
their entitlement to organize and negotiate contractual standards 
also have become protected by law in democratic countries 
that point was underlined in the 1989 labor day message of the 
us catholic conference it cited a particularly dramatic modern 
example the unionspawned turn to democracy in poland 
similar unionbacked thrusts for democracy were noted in other 
longoppressive lands sometimes meeting countermeasures some 
antiunion moves also were seen in this country 
americans can now see how trade unions in eastern europe 
africa and asia unite and uplift the aspirations for freedom and 
solidarity of oppressed peoples the message said 
called freedom justice and the role of unions the statement 
pointed up the unionenergized dawn of fuller rights in poland long 
under communist oppression and said 
all men and women of good will are heartened by the successful 
struggle of polands workers whose free democratic trade union 
solidarnosc solidarity has become the instrument of progress 
and we hope liberation 
working people in hungary in china in south africa and in 
siberia and the ukraine are asserting the same social values of 
human dignity freedom and solidarity as they work to create 
the democratic trade unions 
christianity and judaism have special grounds for concern with 
the labor movement drawn from the bible and its emphasis on mutual 
community responsibility for all persons in it including its 
lowliest workers 
we are members one of another the apostle paul wrote 
stressing the duty of all to share the burdens and needs of fellow 
toilers and also to uphold and celebrate their wellbeing 
a tentmaker himself as well as evangelist he saw work as 
honorable and essential a part of gods unfolding creation we 
are coworkers with god sloth termed by the church one of seven 
deadly sins also drew pauls scorn let him who wont work not 
eat 
major churches in this century have voiced their support for 
union organization and collective bargaining to set standards for 
workers 
the important social contributions of the labor movement has 
been recognized by almost every branch of the christian church 
says the national council of churches including most protestant and 
eastern orthodox denominations 
however labor had a long and often difficult struggle in its 
early years sometimes marked by violence on both sides as in 
efforts of coal miners led by the late john l lewis to gain 
contractual standards 
but the upheavals of the depression in the l930s and ensuing 
government reforms shored up legal rights of workers to organize and 
negotiate with their companies for basic conditions and wages 
while strains and antagonism sometimes arise in the process many 
company managements have come to appreciate the mutual stability and 
atmosphere of equity that labor agreements establish 
however the catholic labor day message while citing the 
unionbacked gains for democracy abroad says that in the united 
states ironically workers are measurably worse off than they were 
10 years ago 
structural changes in the economy increased reliance on 
imports unionbreaking efforts and a growing shift to lowerpaid 
parttime employment have left millions of americans without the 
protection of unions 
for many this has meant lower living standards no health 
benefits and less security for their families 
the catholic labor day message issued by auxiliary bishop joseph 
m sullivan of brooklyn chairman of the us catholic conference 
committee on domestic policy said 
a strong trade union movement with widespread collective 
bargaining can strengthen all of society union workers also 
are more likely to have a voice in workplace decisions and local 
affairs 
strong democratic unions can be a training ground for community 
leaders that is one reason unions have been resisted by 
totalitarian regimes and why they should be fostered in democratic 
societies 
declaring that social solidarity and the bonds of community are 
weakened when the spirit of individualism triumphs over 
communitarian values the statement said 
workers have a duty to use their unions not only for their 
own selfinterest but also for the good of the whole society this 
flows from the fact that work is a vocation a calling by god to 
participate in his creation 
since unions can only fulfill their important functions for 
their members and for society when there is full participation it 
is important for workers to take their social obligations seriously 
and to use well their opportunity for union membership

alaskas vast wilds challenge commonly held 
notions about wilderness management in the brooks range officials 
weigh the rule book against the rights of natives who obey an older 
mandate follow the caribou this is the second story in a fourpart 
series american wilderness 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this is the 
nations premier wilderness park cherished by seekers of solitude 
and protected by law from degradation a soulstirring expanse of 
rugged mountains icy rivers caribou and grizzly bears 
but something is wrong with this picture allterrain vehicles 
are rumbling across the tundra and park officials entrusted to 
guard the land propose removing 75000 acres from wilderness status 
the largest deletion in the history of the national wilderness 
preservation system 
whats going on here 
the answer involves a concept of wilderness different from 
anything found in the lower 48 states it involves a struggle to 
balance the value of alaskas wild land against the rights of humans 
who still live in it 
most of all it involves people like joby ahgook a nunamiut 
eskimo who lives in a little village high in the brooks range 
bounded on three sides by the park 
years ago when people settled here they followed the 
caribou ahgook said the other day as he and his family bounced 
across the tundra in an eightwheeled atv were still following 
the caribou i want to continue to hunt even if this is a park 
this is very important to my family and their families to be 
ahgooks village is called anaktuvuk pass after a native word 
meaning place of caribou droppings it is an odd name only to 
outsiders caribou has been the nunamiuts staff of life for 
generations their grandparents ate caribou meat fresh and dried 
they walked in caribouskin shoes lived in caribouskin tents and 
slept in caribouskin blankets 
like the animals they hunted the nunamiut were nomads each 
spring and fall they walked into the mountains to intercept caribou 
migrating through the passes in summer they headed north to trade 
with coastal eskimos 
this is not ancient history the nunamiut had no permanent 
settlement until the late 1940s by 1960 they still lived in sod 
huts 
a few huts remain but most residents now live in wellinsulated 
prefab houses the huskies that hunters once used as pack dogs have 
been replaced by snowmobiles and argos big atvs with six or eight 
lowpressure tires 
but the nunamiut still lead a harsh existence no roads connect 
anaktuvuk pass to the outside world when the winter sun barely 
sneaks over the mountains temperatures can sink to 60 below for 
days 
food and fuel are outrageously expensive since everything must 
be flown in so residents still depend on caribou for much of their 
diet antlers adorn roofs all over town and skins hang drying on 
porch rails 
its the kind of life that makes you want to cut these people 
some slack and that is just what congress did in 1980 when it 
passed the alaska national interest lands conservation act 
the act set aside more than 100 million acres of alaska in 
national parks preserves forests and wildlife refuges within 
these areas it designated 56 million acres as wilderness more than 
doubling the size of the national wilderness system 
gates of the arctics 7 million acres of wilderness together 
with 58 million acres next door in the noatak national preserve 
comprise the nations largest stretch of unbroken wilderness 
vast as it is alaskas wilderness is not as pure in definition 
as the lower 48 variety congress compromised some traditional 
wilderness restrictions out of concern for rural alaskans like the 
nunamiut who it was argued were as much a part of the wilderness 
as the caribou 
while motorized travel is strictly prohibited in most lower 48 
wilderness areas alaskas wilderness system allows snowmobiles 
motorboats and airplanes 
anaktuvuk pass residents supported creation of the park around 
them because they thought it would keep out sport hunters while 
allowing them to continue their subsistence hunt of caribou but 
they bridled at unexpected park regulations 
the biggest fight has been over atvs one of the few forms of 
mechanized transportation prohibited by the lands act anaktuvuk 
pass hunters argue the atvs are essential for summer trips 
atvs leave tracks in the fragile tundra sometimes digging deep 
ruts into wet ground while longterm damage to vegetation has not 
been proved tracks often can be seen for years afterward 
detracting from the ultimate wilderness experience that the park 
strives to give the 2000 or so visitors who fly in each year 
a 1983 agreement established a narrow atv corridor from anaktuvuk 
pass to a popular lake but that proved too limiting and in 1986 
the park service gave villagers temporary permission to continue 
what they had been doing illegally all along following the caribou 
even if it meant driving across wilderness 
local park officials meanwhile worked out a complicated deal 
with the natives that both sides feel addresses most of the problems 
the park service would deauthorize 75000 acres of wilderness 
near the village and allow the natives wandering rights over 
159000 additional acres of park land in exchange 18000 acres 
elsewhere in the park would be designated wilderness and the 
natives would give up development rights on 93000 acres of their 
own land 
i think its a reasonably fair exchange of interests says 
park superintendent roger siglin it definitely compromises 
wilderness but its also a significant compromise on the part of 
the natives involved 
siglin still has to sell the idea to his superiors the public 
and congress only congress can deauthorize wilderness something 
thats been done just twice before for minor adjustments to 
wilderness areas in vermont and florida 
environmentalists want to see a draft environmental impact 
statement due out this winter before responding formally but they 
express sympathy for the nunamiut 
i dont consider taking wilderness out of the preservation 
system very lightly no matter what the circumstances are says 
allen e smith alaska regional director of the wilderness society 
but he adds the reality is there has to be some give there is a 
legitimate problem here that has to be fixed 
siglin says he believes the compromise will win approval if 
only because i dont think anybody else has a better idea 
joby ahgook hopes that siglin is right when ahgook was 10 he 
walked behind his father on hunting forays into the mounains now 
at age 40 he loads his own five children into an atv for hunting 
trips the mechanism is different but the point is the same follow 
the caribou 
indeed as he maneuvers the noisy atv across the tundra he seems 
to have some wandering caribou spirit in him he sweeps his hand 
encompassing a dozen mountain peaks flanking the pass 
we go way past those mountains in these machines he shouts 
over the roar of the engine its great we go all over 
wherever you want 
yeah the son of nomads says smiling broadly wherever we 
want

trying to escape societys rules a wilderness

these sparkling alpine lakes live 
up to their name hikers often say they halfexpect to see an elf 
behind the next granite boulder or a gnome crouched under a lakeside 
larch 
wilderness ranger elizabeth goulet knows better there is more 
likely to be another hiker behind that boulder she says and a 
trash pile under the tree 
at the moment shes inspecting one careless campers jetsam 10 
freezedried meal wrappers a penlight battery a jar of instant 
coffee an empty sardine can a campstove burner and a tube of bug 
repellent 
usually goulet would be fuming but today shes all smiles the 
litterer also discarded an envelope with his name on it so a mr 
martinez soon will be getting a package in the mail his own trash 
sent cod 
rangers here in the alpine lakes wilderness of the cascade range 
savor such moments as they try to keep visitors from loving the 
wilderness to death most are more considerate than martinez but 
sheer numbers take their toll 
its becoming almost what we call urban wilderness goulet 
says we manage it so much for people that we sometimes lose sight 
of managing it for its wilderness value 
the us forest service which administers this wilderness area 
has resorted to an entry permit system to limit the number of 
campers in the enchantments 
its part of a growing trend national parks where the focus is 
on accommodating visitors have struggled for years with the balance 
between letting sightseers in and maintaining a place worth seeing 
but wilderness areas traditionally less used and less intensively 
managed are catching up fast 
a colorado state university survey found that 28 percent of the 
nations 474 wilderness areas now limit recreational use with 
methods such as entry permits or restrictions on stay length or 
camping still more are considering such moves the survey said 
recreational use is increasing or stable in all but 3 percent of the 
wilderness areas 
in washington the fastgrowing seattle area promises more 
pressure on the alpine lakes wilderness which already sees more 
visitors annually than mount rainier national park 
we have a very high outdoor ethic says forest service 
spokesman ron dehart in seattle people want to do more than look 
at the mountains they want to get out in them 
many choose to do it in the enchantment lakes which occupy a 
small corner of the 306000acre alpine lakes wilderness here a 
dozen crystalline lakes sit in a basin of glacierscoured granite 
all hemmed in by jagged peaks the basins lower reach features 
trees gnarled by the elements meadows of heather and tarns with 
names like talisman and leprechaun the upper basin is starker a 
haunting landscape of rock and snow 
no one knows the area better than bill stark 78 and his wife 
peggy 72 they named many of the lakes and have made a pilgrimage 
here every year since 1959 from their home in nearby leavenworth 
when we first went up it looked like nobody had ever been 
there bill stark says then we started seeing subtle signs of 
use then notsosubtle signs 
hikers trampled a growing network of trails across the basin 
lush beds of heather became matted down and wads of toilet paper 
blossomed everywhere people are pigs stark says 
by the late 1970s a summer weekend could see 300 people in the 
basin creating a lessthanenchanting situation for everyone 
the forest service tried to minimize damage toilets were 
installed in 1966 the use of horses was restricted in 1972 guided 
groups were banned in 1976 and dogs which chase wildlife and 
disturb other campers were prohibited in 1982 
the permit system was established in 1987 limiting the number of 
campers to about 60 on any given day the permit period runs from 
june 15 to oct 15 and popular summer weekends are booked solid 
within a few weeks after permit applications are accepted march 1 
the permits detract from one value of wilderness the opportunity 
to escape societys regimentation 
wilderness implies freedom and you cant get that freedom with 
the permit system goulet concedes but you couldnt get it here 
anyway because without the permits there would be crowds of 
people 
a few campers each week sneak in without permits risking a 50 
fine from one of the five rangers patrolling the enchantments but 
most visitors seem to respect the aim of the permit system 
this is a really special place whatever it takes to keep it 
special is worth it says hiker hal zimmer 39 on his seventh 
trip to the enchantments 
the permits are inconvenient says hiker jeff merkel of 
philadelphia his partner waited in line two hours at the 
leavenworth ranger station for one of the limited number of permits 
reserved for walkin business 
but merkel doesnt mind considering the alternative there 
would be people all around the place you might as well be at the 
jersey shore 
the permit system is working goulet says the crowds are gone 
giving rangers a chance to start replanting some eroded overused 
campsites 
it is still not goulets idea of true wilderness 
the ultimate wilderness would be taking an unaffected area and 
blocking it off to everybody she says i wouldnt have to go 
see it just knowing it was there would be enough knowing that 
theres an area we havent messed up 
but there is also value to an urban wilderness like the 
enchanted lakes she says a place where people can sense what the 
land was like before we got here 
it gives people a taste of nature and if it is not totally wild 
visitors can at least make believe

once they bought out a new york real estate 
company once they pretended to be developers in virginia as the 
folks at the nature conservancy have shown time and again theres 
more than one way to preserve wild lands this is the last part of a

while environmental groups have 
battled government and development interests during the 25 years of 
the wilderness act a littleknown private group has quietly put 
aside nearly 4 million acres of ecologically important lands 
in its 38 years the nature conservancy has saved threatened 
lands ranging from 343 square miles of rare new mexican desert 
grassland to a heron feeding ground on ninetenths of an acre of 
connecticut marsh 
and with a wellendowed war chest and a proven track record the 
arlington vabased nonprofit group now saves land at an average 
of a thousand acres a day 
the conservancys success is due in part to an organizational 
credo it will not fight developers in court nor seek a public forum 
to save private land it remains neutral in skirmishes involving 
government environmentalists and business interests using a 
checkbook and persuasion rather than lawyers and protests 
we used to describe ourselves as the real estate arm of the 
conservation movement said bill weeks the conservancys chief 
operating officer that role has been changing but we still will 
look to marketbased solutions rather than regulatory solutions 
the conservancys proven techniques and changing role are evident 
here in the carrizo plain 180000 acres of beautifully empty 
grasslands 150 miles north of los angeles 
home to endangered species like the kit fox and bluntnosed 
lizard the carrizo was purchased after the conservancy put together 
such unlikely partners as state and federal agencies the oil 
industry ranching interests and conservation groups 
the conservancy is involved in a new ambitious project to 
reintroduce native grasses elk and antelope lost to farming and 
cattle grazing 
grazing ended this april and the native grass is already coming 
up preserve manager chuck warner said standing in an emerald 
green island of native rye grass surrounded by the dusty brown 
lunar landscape 
nearly half the land acquired by the nature conservancy comes 
through standard real estate deals while much including the 
carrizo is turned over to state or federal stewardship the 
conservancy owns and manages the worlds largest private nature 
preserve system with nearly 1000 preserves 
other land targeted by the conservancy is protected through 
conservation easements and other agreements with landowners around 
the country 
they have done a superb job over the years said charles 
miller a national wildlife federation spokesman there is 
sometimes a lot of controversy within the conservation community 
over which way to proceed in an issue but the nature conservancy 
just goes in its own direction and does something that is a 
fantastic service 
the organization began in 1946 when a special committee of the 
ecological society of america split off to form the ecologists 
union renamed the nature conservancy in 1951 
in the early days the groups main goal was to take undisturbed 
lands out of circulation its first purchases were financed by 
mortgages on the homes of members 
since then the group has parlayed donations grants and business 
acumen into an 85 million fund and a national organization with 
540000 members staffed by more than 1000 partand fulltime 
organizers and naturalists 
the conservancy finds land to protect through its natural 
heritage program a joint venture with state governments to 
inventory and save the habitats of endangered plants and animals 
we look for habitats or ecosystems that are particularly 
threatened said steve mccormick director of the california 
nature conservancy if you wait until a species is on the 
endangered list that usually means its habitat is gone 
deals can be complicated to save a long island osprey nesting 
ground the new york chapter had to purchase an entire real estate 
company complete with manhattan brownstones and florida warehouses 
when the owner of a virginia barrier island wanted his land 
developed instead of conserved the conservancy purchased it through 
a dummy development company 
it created some publicrelations problems with the people here 
because they felt we were sneaky said barry truitt manager of 
the conservancys virginia coast preserve we didnt use any 
tactics that arent used by developers but i guess because were 
conservationists they expect our standards to be higher 
some land is donated bob butler a kennebunk maine furniture 
store owner gave the conservancy a 12acre parcel along the 
kennebuck river 
i didnt want it ever to be developed but then someone offered 
me a deal i could barely refuse he said i gave it up so i 
wouldnt be tempted again 
butler was so impressed with the conservancy that he went on to 
serve as a chairman its maine board of trustees 
the conservancy offers other deals it will take land in exchange 
for low interest loans other properties and lifetime annuities it 
will pay for conservation easements to keep land out of development 
it also sponsors a landowner notification program to tell people 
how to protect endangered species on their property 
landowners usually are surprised and delighted that they have 
something rare on their land and they become advocates said 
mccormick 
the conservancys nonconfrontational stance has put it 
increasingly in the role of mediator as when local officials and 
developers battled conservationists and government agencies over the 
habitat of the coachella fringetoed lizard a tiny reptile that 
only survives in the special sands of the coachella valley in the 
hot real estate market around palm springs 
after months of negotiations and 2 million in conservancy seed 
money the parties agreed to a 13000acre preserve developers will 
pay a 600 mitigation fee for each acre of lizard habitat that is 
developed outside the preserve 
paul selzer a attorney for some developers said the conservancy 
was able to show that setting the land aside served everyones 
interest 
another environmental group in the process could have made it 
more difficult he said 
mccormick said the bitter controversy was eased when developers 
saw their holdings would be enhanced by the preserve 
attitudes change he said the developers thought of 
environmentalists as people with a weird interest in a strange 
animal now they see it as a question of quality of life 
in addition to the role as mediator the conservancy has become 
more involved in restoration at its blowing rocks preserve on 
floridas jupiter island exotics nonnative trees like the 
australian pine and brazilian pepper have been cut to halt their 
encroachment on indigenous species and the fragile dune ecology 
its become clearer that not only species but whole biological 
systems are threatened weeks said 
the conservancy is taking greater steps to protect those systems 
through agreements that limit the use of adjacent lands at the 
virginia coast preserve the conservancy has negotiated with 
neighboring landowners to control development pressures on the 
fringes of the preserve 
we once thought we were going to be establishing nature 
preserves that would exist apart from society said weeks now 
weve come to feel the integration of these nature preserves with 
the fabric of the society around them is critical

the governing national party 
and the militants who seek to oust it agree on one momentous aspect 
of south africas parliamentary elections they they may well be the 
last that exclude the nations black majority 
if nationalists emerge with their power intact from the balloting 
this coming wednesday overcoming unparalleled challenges from white 
opposition parties on the left and far right they will have a 
mandate for their pledge to bring blacks into the political system 
on a limited basis by the end of the new parliaments fiveyear term 
antiapartheid activists say the nationalists promise is vague 
however and hope to force the government to the bargaining table 
within a much shorter period to arrange for a oneperson onevote 
system 
the activists have conducted a nationwide civil disobedience 
campaign to coincide with the campaign and have urged mixedrace and 
indian voters to boycott the elections for parliaments two separate 
junior chambers the 80seat body for mixedrace representatives and 
the 40seat chamber for indians 
the racist elections will not determine our future said jay 
naidoo generalsecretary of the militant congress of south african 
trade unions we will determine our own future 
the man who will decide how to confront this spirit of resistance 
is almost certain to be fw de klerk the national party leader who 
became acting president aug 15 after pw bothas forced 
resignation if his party retains control of parliaments dominant 
white chamber the 53yearold klerk will be elected for a fiveyear 
term as president 
de klerks immediate challenge is to ensure that his party 
survives its toughest electoral threat since taking power in 1948 
several polls have suggested the possibility of a hung 
parliament with the farright conservative party and liberal 
democratic party each gaining enough seats to deprive the 
nationalists of an outright majority 
in the outgoing parliament the national party controls 123 of 
the 166 elected seats in the white chamber the conservatives 22 and 
the democrats 20 one seat is held by a member of a nowdefunct 
moderate party 
in the most recent white election in 1987 the nationalists won 
about 52 percent of the vote rightwing candidates 30 percent and 
liberals 18 percent according to polls the national party is 
virtually certain to get less than half the white votes this time 
although it could maintain control of parliament even if its share 
of votes drops toward 40 percent 
a poll commissioned in late july by the countrys largest 
newspaper the sunday times suggested the nationalists could be 
reduced to 78 seats with conservatives winning 52 and the democrats 
36 a party needs 84 seats to rule on its own 
one of de klerks deputies development minister gerrit viljoen 
said the nationalists would prefer calling another election rather 
than govern in a coalition with either rival party 
we will go back to the voters and say make up your mind 
viljoen said if you dont want us rather kick us out and choose 
a single strong government 
no polls are allowed in the final four weeks before a national 
election in south africa and thus there have been few means of 
measuring the political impact of bothas bitter resignation botha 
objected to de klerks plans to confer with president kenneth kaunda 
of zambia one of black africas most vocal critics of apartheid 
initially commentators said the showdown would help the 
conservative party which shared bothas objections to the de 
klerkkaunda meeting but national party officials say de klerk had 
proved his mettle and held to his commitment to pursue dialogue even 
with opponents 
in contrast to the tempermental botha de klerk is viewed as a 
personable pragmatist who will work energetically to lessen south 
africas international isolation he is likely to benefit from the 
impending independence of namibia after 74 years years of south 
african rule and the increasing tendency of southern african leaders 
to favor negotiation over confrontation 
but both white opposition parties have assailed de klerk and his 
party on grounds that they are attempting to straddle difficult 
domestic issues with ambiguous evasive positions 
asked whether a black could become president for example the 
conservatives say no and the democrats say yes the nationalists 
duck the question 
similarly de klerks declarations that he opposes discrimination 
have been undercut by harsh police crackdowns on black activists 
defying segregation laws on whitesonly beaches and buses 
the countrys myriad economic problems also have provided 
ammunition for the opposition parties many whites feel they are 
fighting a losing battle against high taxes and inflation and a 
series of corruption cases involving nationalist politicians has 
served to heighten the anger 
fortyone years is long enough said denis worrall a former 
ambassador to britain who is one of the democrats three coleaders 
only a new party untainted by apartheid and economic failure 
will inspire the confidence internationally to turn this country 
around 
the conservative party says de klerks fiveyear plan will lead 
inevitably to black majority rule and hopes to score major gains in 
rural and bluecollar districts with its call for stricter 
segregation it has boasted of surmounting black consumer boycotts 
that were launched to protest the reintroduction of hardline 
segregation laws by conservativecontrolled councils in the 
industrial city of boksburg and the mining town of carletonville 
the white communitys right to selfdetermination is 
nonnegotiable says the conservatives manifesto 
but nationalist leaders believe their policies accurately reflect 
the sentiments of most of south africas 5 million whites while the 
whites generally want to ease racial tensions and win black 
cooperation they also want to protect white power and white 
privileges including segregated neighborhoods and schools 
the conservative party tries to cling to white domination and 
this will never be acceptable to people of color de klerk said in 
a recent speech the democratic partys proposals will lead to the 
usurping of power by blacks and this will never be acceptable to 
the whites

some facts and figures on south 
africas election for a new parliament 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a total of 763 candidates are contesting 166 seats in 
parliaments dominant white chamber 80 seats in the chamber for 
people of mixedrace and 40 seats in the chamber for indians the 
two junior chambers have no power to overrule the white chamber on 
matters of national policy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
according to government figures 3170667 of the countrys 5 
million whites are eligble to vote as are 1775751 of about 3 
million mixedrace people and 665870 of the roughly 1 million 
indians 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
none of south africas 28 million blacks are allowed to vote in 
national elections they can vote only for municipal officials and 
for the administrations of the countrys 10 tribal homelands 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
because the indian and mixedrace chambers of parliament have 
little power most attention is focused on the whites house of 
assembly where the national party holds 123 of the 166 elected 
seats it faces strong challenges from the farright conservative 
party which holds 22 seats and the antiapartheid democratic 
party which controls 20 seats one seat was held by a nowdefunct 
moderate party 
the conservatives favor a strengthening of segregation laws and 
oppose political rights to blacks the democrats favor abolishing 
all segregation laws and granting universal political rights with 
some provisions for ensuring that whites and other minority groups 
have a voice in government decisions the national party has 
proposed a fiveyear plan for bringing blacks into the political 
system on a limited basis it wants to ensure that blacks cannot 
overrule white interests and it wants to maintain segregated 
schools and neighborhoods for whites who want them

when it was signed sept 3 1964 the wilderness 
act started a historic carvingup of federal land that continues 
full bore today in 25 years americas wilderness system has grown 
tenfold how much more do we need contradictory answers are 
examined by ap northwest regional reporter david foster in the first 
story in a series american wilderness 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
not far from the gift shops and ski 
chalets of this crowded resort a little trail by a little creek 
offers a way to the wild hike up the ridge look to the east and 
all you see is nature no roads no vacation condos just forested 
valleys and the skyscraping pioneer mountains 
lynne stone wants to keep it that way 
on a cloudless august day she stands on the ridge and stares at 
a rocky knob bristling with lodgepole pines in this exaggerated 
landscape the hummock doesnt even rate a name on the map 
a hill like this in nebraska would be considered a national 
park stone says and then suggests how nice it would be to spread 
idahos beauty around give a mountain to omaha or a sparkling 
stream to newark of course you cant she realizes its all in 
idaho you have to protect it where it is 
and so she does or at least she tries the pioneer mountains are 
among 4 million acres of idahos national forests that 
conservationists like stone want placed in the national wilderness 
preservation system 
theyd get a better reception in newark here in idaho they are 
opposed by loggers miners ranchers and offroad vehicle users who 
would face more regulations or complete loss of access to the land 
if it is designated wilderness 
this is the latest battle in a drawnout war over americas 
roadless public lands a conflict set in motion 25 years ago by a 
simple but farreaching document called the wilderness act 
when president lyndon johnson signed it sept 3 1964 he 
institutionalized a radical idea let us protect some lands just as 
nature made them they would be places the act said where the 
earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man where man 
himself is a visitor who does not remain 
over the years those tranquil places have seen a lot of 
contention sagebrush rebels have bulldozed roads into pristine land 
to spoil it for wilderness ecoterrorists have pounded spikes 
into ancient trees to spoil them for logging 
the laws silver anniversary is a time for preservationists to 
celebrate since 1964 the national wilderness system has grown 
tenfold to nearly 91 million acres but it is also a time to take 
stock after 25 years have we set aside all the wilderness we need 
or does a growing populace in a polluted world require even more 
wild space for the sake of balance 
we dont need any more designated wilderness says john 
butterfield snowmobiler and member of the blue ribbon coalition 
which promotes multiple use of public lands the land needs to be 
managed not set aside and forgotten 
i think there ought to be twice or maybe three times as much 
land designated as wilderness counters gaylord nelson former 
us senator and now counselor to the wilderness society there 
are exceptional areas in practically every state that ought to be 
left alone forever 
in the war over wilderness balance is hard to find 
idahos dark forests and high mountains fit the classic image of 
wilderness but around the nation the preservation system also 
includes swamps beaches deserts and prairies 474 areas in all 
ranging in size from alaskas 87 millionacre wrangell st elias 
wilderness to 3acre pelican island a haven for seabirds off the 
florida coast 
nearly twothirds of the nations wilderness is in alaska and 
the west holds most of the other large chunks but smaller areas are 
scattered from sea to shining sea all but six states connecticut 
rhode island maryland delaware iowa and kansas have some 
designated wilderness 
covering 4 percent of the country wilderness areas comprise a 
sampler of the american landscape great gulf and lost creek mud 
swamp and thunder ridge 
if fords terror and hell hole bay evoke the pioneers image of 
wilderness as a fearsome foe then shining rock and wonder mountain 
reflect a kinder view a new land ethic lauding wilderness as a 
connection to our roots and a source of national character 
in wildness is the preservation of the world henry thoreau 
wrote in 1861 but it wasnt until 1924 when the us forest 
service set aside the gila wilderness in new mexico that thoreaus 
poetic words became public policy and it took conservationists 40 
more years to get what they really wanted wilderness with the force 
and permanence of law shielded from bureaucratic whims 
the 1964 wilderness act enacted after eight years of debate and 
66 versions gave congress the sole power to declare wilderness in 
wilderness the law said there would be no roads no buildings no 
travel by mechanical means hunting fishing and camping were 
allowed but commercial exploitation and development were generally 
prohibited 
like thoreau the law was long on poetry but it was short on 
details setting aside just 91 million acres of noncontroversial 
wilderness that had already been designated administratively it 
left the real battles to future sessions of congress federal 
agencies were instructed to study national park forest and wildlife 
refuge lands for wilderness suitability and make recommendations 
the agencies lumbered about this gargantuan task for years and 
as recommendations started coming out in the 1970s the designation 
process gained speed since 1980 congress has passed wilderness 
bills for 31 states this year it faces bills for 19 million acres 
in alaska arizona california colorado nevada utah and idaho 
idahos debate has been hot persistent and in many ways typical 
this year there are two idaho wilderness bills to choose from one 
is a conservationists wish list for 4 million acres introduced by 
rep peter kostmayer dpa the other more politically feasible 
one is a 14 millionacre bill sponsored by idahos senior senator 
republican james mcclure 
lynne stone entered this fray as a volunteer soon after moving to 
ketchum near sun valley in 1981 now she calls herself a working 
conservationist scraping by with seasonal government work or 
grants from environmental groups last year she flew to washington 
for a stab at lobbying she says shed rather stay in the mountains 
to be sure thats where she seems most comfortable at 41 she 
strides up the steep trail with ease narrating natural history as 
she goes she stops to inspect an elk track then reels off the 
names of plants anchored in the dry mountain soil sage and sego 
lilies colorful cinquefoils an ancient whitebark pine with gnarled 
branches scratching like claws at the sky 
pretty yes but the wilderness is good for more than scenery 
she says wild plants and animals contribute to biological diversity 
and maintain a stock of wild genes for future scientists who might 
just discover that something growing here cures cancer wilderness 
also protects watersheds and contributes to clean air stone says 
such arguments are familiar to joe hinson of the intermountain 
forestry industry association which opposes both idaho wilderness 
bills 
every time theres a wilderness bill somebody gets up and 
says this completes the wilderness system hinson says five 
years later theyre at it again as long as an area doesnt have a 
road in it youre going to have a debate over it

some wilderness is fine hinson says but you have to stop 
somewhere or at least guarantee some areas for development while 
youre locking up others idaho he points out already has 4 
million acres of wilderness 76 percent of the state 
others charge that environmentalists arent as interested in 
biological diversity as they are in creating elitist playgrounds for 
wealthy urban backpackers at the expense of local residents 
trying to make a living off the public land 
these lands belong to the people that means all the people 
not a chosen few says butterfield of the blue ribbon coalition 
lynne stone raised on an eastern oregon ranch says shes no 
yuppie backpacker and there are more ways to make a living off the 
land she adds than by logging or mining it tourism is one of 
idahos biggest industries she says and its hard to lure tourists 
to a clearcut 
in 20 years roads have been pushed through more than 8 million 
acres of idahos wild country according to the idaho conservation 
league were destroying everything that isnt protected stone 
says if we dont set it aside well lose it 
both sides have strong arguments strongly stated if not 
overstated in virtually every wilderness debate were told the 
area in question is a crown jewel of americas wildlands to be 
saved at all costs were also told by the opposition that locking 
up the land in wilderness would deal the death blow to an already 
ailing pick one logging mining or ranching industry 
congress is left to sort it out and the politics of compromise 
leave no one completely satisfied 
its amazing that this is going to be decided in some room in 
the capitol 3000 miles away stone says it doesnt have 
anything to do with idaho wilderness its who owes mcclure a favor 
at the time 
whatever happens with idaho congress faces enough other 
wilderness issues to keep busy for another 25 years 
it must decide whether 15 million acres of tundra in alaskas 
arctic national wildlife refuge is worth more for the caribou that 
migrate over it or for the oil reservoirs that may lie under it 
battles also loom over vast bureau of land management holdings in 
the deserts of utah nevada california and other western states 
the blm has inventoried about 25 million acres of potential 
wilderness and is likely to recommend some fraction of that for 
designation the wilderness society says it will push for far more 
protecting entire ecosystems has become preservationists latest 
rallying cry they hope to expand existing wilderness areas around 
yellowstone national park and in the great smoky mountains of north 
carolina and tennessee 
lynne stone meanwhile focuses on her own wild idaho backyard 
when lobbying she argues the dollars and cents of tourism but her 
real motives for saving wilderness prove more elusive more personal 
in an alpine meadow flushed purple with blooming lupines stone 
gazes at a horizon of sawtoothed peaks and tries to explain her love 
for the land she talks vaguely of hiking with friends of the world 
she hopes her 11yearold son will inherit 
finally she settles on words borrowed from a friend who has 
guided hunters and fishermen in the wild for years he says they 
dont really come for the hunting or fishing they come for the hush 
of the land 
a breeze rustles through the whitebark pines and sweeps across 
the lupines a faroff chickadee squeaks out a song thats what 
im trying to protect stone says the hush of the land

two female 
brown pelicans snap their beaks croak and flap their wings at two 
male interlopers swooping down to a bare mangrove branch 
the sea birds are fighting for precious space on threeacre 
pelican island the nations first wildlife refuge and the smallest 
parcel to receive the federal wilderness designation 
we see it as sort of the flagship of the refuge system due to 
its age said charles lee senior vice president of the florida 
audubon society while weve drawn a federal boundary around those 
lands the fact is they are being threatened on a daily basis by 
encroaching development 
as hundreds of pelicans and other birds fight for space on the 
sandy scrap of land in the refuge developers on the bordering 
orchid island have construction crews tearing into old grapefruit 
groves to make room for exclusive golf and polo club developments 
bare oceanfront lots with 125foot frontage are offered for 800000 
president theodore roosevelt created the refuge by proclamation 
in 1903 after hearing stories of plume hunters killing the islands 
exotic birds for ladies hats and pleasure boaters firing away for 
sport 
pelican island remains what it was then a choice rookery in the 
indian river lagoon a milewide section of the intracoastal 
waterway that separates the mainland of central florida near 
sebastian from the citrusrich barrier island of orchid on the 
atlantic ocean 
to you or i it doesnt look like theres anything unusual 
about the island except theres almost no green pelicans will 
break off any green shoots for their nests explained dorn 
whitmore refuge spokesman for the us fish and wildlife service 
the refuge protects 4700 acres but the wilderness area shields 
only pelican island and three acres of surrounding water 1 to 2 feet 
deep 
the island is strictly for the birds no human visitors are 
allowed except by federal wildlife officers and occasional 
scientific parties 
adjacent to the refuge on the east 200 to 225 units are proposed 
for the 400acre windsor polo and beach club which has drawn 
britains prince charles as a player to the southeast an 18hole 
golf course is the centerpiece of the planned 400unit orchid island 
golf amp beach club 
what weve got is a very viable very valuable resource with a 
potential for a great deal of stress the question is how do we 
manage it so we can keep on using it asked diane barile 
executive director of the marine resources council a 500member 
group for indian river lagoon interests 
she worries that the condition of the lagoon will continue to 
degrade citing studies showing a 30 percent loss of sea grass beds 
and an 80 percent loss of filtering mangrove swamps in the area 
we have the highest species diversity of any estuary in north 
america we can outdo chesapeake bay or puget sound any of those 
places she said if youre out there in a sailboat or a small 
boat you do get the feeling of release and being in a wild and 
lonely place and being a part of the land and the water itself its 
really a magical place

just 25 miles from the flashing 
lights and honking horns of new york citys times square is a large 
green oasis filled with the lovely sounds of silence 
the great swamp national wildlife refuge situated in the heart 
of congested northern new jersey was officially declared a 
protected area in 1968 under the federal wilderness act 
since then it has attracted urban and suburban residents looking 
for a secluded escape david franz a biology professor at brooklyn 
college sometimes brings his students across the hudson river to 
study forest communities and analyze vegetation at the refuge 
on his own time he visits great swamp just for the beauty of 
it all especially in the fall when the foliage changes on a 
sunday afternoon i often see families stopping at the refuge after 
church just to spend a few hours outside together 
the refuge is open from dawn to dusk seven days a week said 
thomas mcfadden a recreation planner at great swamp it might never 
have opened at all 
in the late 1950s the port authority of new york and new jersey 
proposed building a jetport at the site 
but local residents quickly formed a grassroots organization to 
buy as much land as possible several years later the newly formed 
new jersey conservation foundation gave the federal government the 
deed to about 3000 acres of prime undeveloped land which formed 
the heart of great swamp mcfadden said 
the refuges acreage keeps growing with almost 7000 acres now 
protected and the acquisition of 2000 more acres expected soon 
about 3660 acres of the refuge is untouched with only seven 
miles of trails for nature lovers to walk on mcfadden said the 
rest is a federal management area where grass is mowed ponds dug 
and trees cut to encourage the breeding of certain animals and 
plants he said 
its unusual to find a fairly large tract of uninhabited 
natural vegetation franz said appreciatively 
even though planes pass overhead and neighboring towns edge 
closer he said you have the feeling you are a long distance from 
mankind 
more than 160000 people most from the new york metropolitan 
area visit the great swamp each year mcfadden said 
unfortunately unwanted visitors also come said douglas spencer 
the refuges assistant property manager by day passing vehicles 
litter roads leading into the refuge he said and at night illegal 
dumpers have left even worse 
nearby development also has an impact it causes nonpoint 
pollution runoff from septic systems and the streets spencer 
said 
with each rainfall pollutants such as roadway oils and treated 
sewage effluent wash into the passaic river watershed area which 
eventually passes through the refuge spencer said 
great swamp acts as a giant filter he said

first half of 1989 the biggest drop in more than 10 years dun amp 
bradstreet corp said in a report that suggested the economy is not 
tumbling into recession 
the steady decline in business failures across the country 
underscores the overall stability of the us economy and offers 
further support for the softlanding scenario said joseph w 
duncan corporate economist and chief statistician for the 
businessinformation company 
a total of 26234 companies failed in the first six months of 
1989 vs 30697 in the first six months of 1988 dampb said monday in 
its twiceyearly report on business failures the figures reflect a 
continuation of a trend that began in 1987 and showed a sharp 
improvement in the weak farming and oil regions 
failures declined everywhere except in south atlantic states one 
of the areas that has led an economic expansion now almost seven 
years old the number of failures in that region rose 102 percent 
to 4024 from 3651

the debate continues over whether the chicago 
board of trade should have ordered the emergency liquidation of july 
soybean futures contracts 
its becoming more and more evident that the cost of this 
liquidation was all put on the back of the producers said john 
white jr of the american farm bureau federation 
but donald m mennel an ohio representative of the millers 
national federation said he thought the bot did a magnificent job 
of moving very rapidly to stop something that could have gone 
horribly wrong 
mennel and white were among more than a score of farmers 
ranchers exporters grain dealers and elevator operators who 
debated the soybean emergency action monday at a meeting of the 
commodity futures trading commissions agricultural advisory 
committee 
last month the board of trade issued an emergency order 
requiring traders to reduce their holdings in soybean futures 
contracts the move brought howls of protest from farmers and 
traders who saw the value of their futures holdings plummet after 
the order caused wild swings in soybean prices 
the cbots action was taken after a us affiliate of the italian 
grain conglomerate ferruzzi finanziaria spa refused to liquidate its 
dominant position in july soybeans the action was seen as a move to 
prevent ferruzzi from cornering the soybean market a plan which 
ferruzzi has denied 
to decide what we decided was sort of like going against apple 
pie said darl kleinbach a wheat farmer who also sits as a public 
director on the cbot and voted for the emergency action but she 
defended her vote as best for the farmer 
the american agriculture movements larry mitchell told cftc 
officials farmers want to know who did you protect with that 
action 
the answer is the market said john mielke cftc director of 
market surveillance explaining that the agencys mission was to 
preserve orderly markets we have to be price neutral 
the cftc which oversees the futures industry released its 
preliminary findings friday on the cbot action the cftc found that 
there was a reasonable basis for the emergency and that the 
board of trade took appropriate action 
the cftc also said it found no evidence of selfdealing by cbot 
officials who might have profited by selling off their holdings 
after voting to issue the emergency order 
but farm group leaders remained skeptical 
their farmers perception now is that the markets been 
manipulated by those internal forces and cftc is part of that for 
allowing the emergency action said white of the american farm 
bureau federation 
roy smith a nebraska soybean farmer and representative of the 
american soybean association told the cftcs mielke to be honest 
with you the farmers are tired of hearing you guys say everything 
is all right of hearing the board of trade say its all right 
were getting a different perception out there 
the st louisbased american soybean association has formed its 
own task force to probe the results of the emergency order 
none of the cbot directors who voted personally controlled a 
position in july soybean futures according to the cftc 
when several agricultural groups said they wanted more evidence 
proving that there had been no inside trading by cbot executives 
either for their firm or their firms customers mielke said he 
doubted it would defuse conspiracy theories 
im not sure the facts even if they were laid out would put 
the questions to rest said mielke i think people with theories 
dont need facts 
i think youre underestimating the ability of farmers to 
understand the facts countered smith

house agriculture committee chairman kika de la 
garza just back from a trip to the soviet union says the united 
states should import more soviet goods in exchange for the 
commodities the it sells that country 
de la garza dtexas said monday that his fiveday visit made it 
clear to him that the soviet union is a long way from becoming 
selfsufficient in grain production and will continue to turn to the 
united states for that commodity 
he said the soviet union also could use other us items but has 
a hard time getting them because soviet currency is not accepted and 
the united states has shown little interest in soviet products other 
than vodka 
everything they need for the comfort of the creature we could 
sell them said de la garza but they have no hard currency 
agriculture department officials say the soviets buy american 
grain with dollars that they can get by drawing upon their gold 
reserves 
de la garza said that a better understanding is developing 
between the united states and ussr 
we need to look at how we can reshape our relations so we can 
buy and sell he said we need to remove the feeling that all we 
want to do is sell sell sell 
he said the first imports may be symbolic but would go a long 
way toward achieving an arrangement that shows trade is a twoway 
street 
the soviets have an agreement with the united states that they 
will buy at least 9 million tons of grain before sept 30 they have 
already purchased 217 million tons of grain and corn and another 1 
million tons of sorghum says the agriculture department 
agriculture committee members reps dan glickman dkan jerry 
huckaby dla robin tallon dsc claude harris dala and 
david dreier rcalif accompanied de la garza on the trip 
they did not see soviet leader mikhail gorbachev but met with 
other top officials to discuss agricultural reform and enhanced 
trade between the two countries they also visited cooperative farms

president bush has given south korea 
30 more days to reach an agreement on driftnet fishing or face a 
possible ban on fish exports to the united states 
the action monday came on the heels of an agreement with taiwan 
last week that will allow the united states to monitor its use of 
driftnets in the north pacific earlier this year japan entered into 
a similar arrangement 
but so far the united states and south korea have been unable to 
come to terms on monitoring use of the enormous nets which us 
fisherman complain are making unauthorized catches of salmon 
dolphins and other species 
the vacationing president in a letter to leaders of congress 
said he was instructing the state and commerce departments to 
continue intensive bilateral negotiations with korea over the 
fishing dispute 
if they dont produce an agreement within 30 days i will be 
prepared to exercise my substantial authorities under the 
fishermens protective act that allows him to order the prohibition 
of fish imports from offending countries the president said 
it is extremely important to the international community that 
korea agrees to meet the standards of customary international law to 
cooperate with other nations and to take necessary measures to 
conserve high seas resources affected by driftnets he said 
he said the us officials conducting the negotiatons should also 
try to engage the international community in urging the adoption 
of cooperative measures on driftnet fishing 
the driftnets used by asian fleets are intended to catch squid 
but the nets can also ensnare dolphins seals and salmon 
the ustaiwan agreement allows federal authorities to track 
taiwanese fishing vessels by satellite with radio transponders 
installed in those boats and also permits us officials to board 
the ships 
conservationists have criticized the driftnets some of which are 
40 miles long for their incidental catches of thousands of sea 
birds seals and other animals as well as valuable salmon that 
spawn in the united states 
congress had set a deadline of monday for bush to act 
japan signed an agreement in june that called for the 
experimental use of transponders and a cadre of 47 observers nine 
american five canadian and 33 japanese to monitor driftnet damage 
to marine mammal populations

new prime minister toshiki kaifu hopes to build warm 
ties during his trip to the united states this week and he will 
stress the need for both countries to do more to reduce their trade 
imbalance officials said 
japanese prime ministers customarily visit washington shortly 
after taking office to establish good working relations but kaifu 
also hopes he can use the trip to establish his own diplomatic 
credentials and revitalize his governments foreign policy the 
officials said monday 
kaifu who on aug 9 became japans third prime minister in less 
than three months is a former education minister with little 
experience in foreign affairs his liberal democratic party which 
pursues conservative policies has been rocked by a series of money 
and sex scandals that have put diplomatic initiatives on hold 
the 58yearold prime minister leaves wednesday for washington 
and will later visit mexico and canada he will meet friday with 
president bush and then visit boston where he plans to meet with 
academics and watch a red sox game according to yukio okamoto 
director of the foreign ministrys first north america division 
bush is expected to seek a commitment from kaifu that japan will 
reform areas of its business and distribution system that the united 
states says limit foreign access 
foreign ministry officials said kaifu will tell bush that japan 
is willing to pursue major reform but that the united states also 
must institute changes if substantial improvement in the trade 
imbalance is to be made 
japan is prepared to address her own structural issues and 
indeed we have been addressing ourselves to these problems said 
mitoji yabunaka director of the ministrys second north america 
division but efforts should be made by both sides 
yabunaka said japan would ask the united states to boost its 
savings and business investment rates work harder to promote 
exports improve its vocational training and seek longterm 
investments rather than shortterm profits 
these are very serious issues and there is no quick fix he 
said 
japan has made major reductions in tariffs and other import 
barriers in recent years us and japanese officials have begun to 
say that the trade imbalance now stems mainly from social and 
business structures and practices in both countries 
the united states has said japans complex distribution system 
and ingrown business relationships make it difficult for foreign 
companies to penetrate the market and japans high saving rate 
reduces its purchases of foreign goods 
last year japans trade surplus with the united states was 55 
billion according to us figures 
on other issues okamoto said mr kaifu will be making clear 
to the president that there will be no change whatsoever in our 
basic position in our foreign policy 
in addition to forming a working relationship with us 
officials kaifu plans to reach out to the american public he said 
we expect mr kaifus personal traits young energetic 
accessible a caring personality will be well received by our 
american friends he said 
kaifus will visit mexico sept 46 the newspaper yomiuri 
shimbun reported monday that kaifu will offer mexican officials a 1 
billion loan to help combat air pollution in mexico city 
kaifu is to meet with prime minister brian mulroney of canada in 
ottawa on sept 7 okamoto said

pay a record 27 million fine for asbestos exposure violations 
under terms of a settlement with the federal government 
us district judge garrett brown on monday approved a pact 
between the labor department and friction division products inc the 
agreement requires the trenton factory to provide respirators 
protective clothing and other safety measures for its 125 workers 
if a safety monitor certifies the companys compliance friction 
division will avoid paying what would amount to the heftiest fine 
ever levied by the occupational safety and health administration for 
a safety violation officials said 
the agreement requires no admission of wrongdoing by the factory 
company president robert carney had not immediate comment on the 
agreement his secretary said 
federal officials when they announced the fine a month ago 
described flagrant violations of worker protection standards at the 
plant 
labor secretary elizabeth dole displayed photographs of asbestos 
dust coating tables stairs and railings and of workers eating in a 
lunchroom while wearing contaminated work clothes 
federal officials also said the workers could bring the asbestos 
home on their contaminated clothing exposing their families 
the agreement in addition to requiring respirators orders the 
company to supply soap and towels for mandatory endofshift showers 
and to make sure employees clothes are vacuumed before workers 
enter the lunchroom 
asbestos a fire and heatresisting material once commonly used 
as insulation has been linked to lung cancer and asbestosis a lung 
disease 
if the company does not follow through on the agreement osha 
will revert to the fine and other remedies said randy wilson a 
labor department public affairs officer in new york 
the head of a union local representing the plants employees said 
he was pleased by the agreement 
however ivey williams president of international chemical 
workers local 155 said the union was still considering a lawsuit to 
help the workers win compensation for whatever health damage they 
may have suffered 
the workers about half of whom have stayed off the job since 
disclosure of the safety violations are undergoing health 
screenings he said 
mrs dole said last month that investigators had found a handful

mitsui bank and taiyo kobe bank have agreed to merge 
next april to create the secondlargest bank in the world officials 
of the two banks announced tuesday 
analysts said the merger is the biggest international combination 
in recent memory 
in terms of sheer scale theres nothing like it said simon 
smithson analyst at kleinwort benson securities it dwarfs 
anything that exists in other countries he said 
the new bank will be second in total assets only to daiichi 
kangyo bank ranked the largest in the world in terms of assets 
currently sumitomo bank is the secondlargest bank in japan 
mitsui bank the countrys seventhlargest bank and taiyo kobe 
the eighth largest will merge into a new bank to be called taiyo 
kobe mitsui bank as of april 1 kenichi suematsu president of 
mitsui bank said at a news conference 
facing todays globalization and liberalization of the 
financial world a bank must have a certain degree of size or 
quality cant follow said suematsu who will become the president 
of the new bank 
we have judged forming a new bank by a merger will lead to 
providing the best financial and information services to our 
customers said yasuo matsushita president of taiyo kobe bank 
who will become chairman of the new bank 
suematsu and matsushita who said they were close friends for 
over 20 years said they hope the merger will strengthen their 
banks domestic and international networks and expand and 
rationalize operations to meet increasingly diverse needs 
the finance ministry and banking circles generally praised the 
merger 
i welcome the decision by both banks to merge given the 
liberalization and internationalization of the financial market 
said finance minister ryutaro hashimoto i think it is timely to 
bolster the operation by utilizing increased profits to provide a 
diversity of sevices to customers in and out of the country 
kuniji miyazaki president of the federation of bankers 
associations of japan and also of japans largest bank 
daiichikangyo bank hailed what he called a courageous decision 
by the banks managements kyodo news service reported 
mitsui bank one of the oldest banks in this country founded in 
1876 had available funds of 21138 trillion yen or 14679 
billion at the end of march 1989 9760 employees and 242 branches 
in japan and overseas while taiyo kobe had funds of 18511 trillion 
yen or 12854 billion 12931 employees and 374 branches 
according to statistics released by both banks 
mitsui bank is capitalized at 136 billion while taiyo kobe 
bank is capitalized at 125 billion 
it will be the second major merger for taiyo kobe bank which was 
formed by a merger between taiyo bank and kobe bank in 1973 
matsushita and suematsu stressed that the deal is an equal 
merger but said the two companies will exchange shares at the rate 
of eight mitsui shares for 10 taiyo kobe shares they said the name 
of the new bank will be reviewed and changed in three years because 
it is too long said suematsu 
the bank will be known as mitsui taiyo kobe bank in english 
reversing the names in the japanese version taiyo kobe mitsui 
ginko company officials said 
analysts said the merger is apparently aimed at consolidating and 
streamlining their operations to take advantage of forthcoming 
banking liberalization measures in japan 
the merger happened because neither bank was really big enough 
to fufill its ambitions on its own smithson said 
analysts said that the merger would join taiyo kobes extensive 
domestic network with mitsuis international expertise and create 
the economies of scale that are the basis of japanese banks 
international competitiveness 
japanese banks are generally considered less sophisticated in 
many aspects of international business than their american or 
european competitors despute their overwhelming size but can rely 
on huge deposits at home to create volume discounts 
the tokyo stock exchange suspended trading of mitsui and taiyo 
kobe banks shares all day tuesday due to the merger the exchange 
said

bondholders of resorts international 
inc face an indefinite halt on interest payments while the gaming 
company tries to rise above its huge debt company officials said 
resorts owner and chairman merv griffin issued a statement monday 
to bondholders of the company and its subsidiaries resorts 
international finance inc and griffin resorts inc 
it has become clear that resorts is a much bigger challenge 
than we anticipated the entertainer wrote 
obviously i am not pleased that resorts finds itself in the 
position that it must suspend interest payments he said but i 
believe that it is necessary in order to ensure the longterm 
financial health of the corporation 
griffins explanation did not comfort some bondholders 
the default is proof of the misstatements that were made about 
the companys financial condition said edward labaton a new york 
attorney who filed a class action lawsuit in may on behalf of one 
bondholder peter stuyvesant ltd 
the lawsuit alleges that resorts top officers inflated the worth 
of the company for a prospectus issued by drexel burnham lambert 
inc which last year offered 325 million worth of notes on top of 
more than 600 million worth of resorts existing notes 
mondays announcement merely confirms the concerns that were 
expressed in our complaint labaton said 
griffin the wealthy creator of syndicated television game shows 
such as wheel of fortune and jeopardy bought the atlantic 
citybased resorts international from developer donald trump in 
november for 365 million 
in his letter griffin explained that operating cash flow has 
been less than anticipated in part because we underestimated the 
time and capital expenditures it would take to turn around the 
companys operations to generate increased profits 
the former talk show host also wrote that it has taken resorts 
longer to sell nonoperating real estate assets than originally 
expected 
resorts president david hanlon insisted monday that the company 
is not on the verge of bankruptcy 
from a shortterm point of view we have clearly demonstrated 
our financial viability he said and we made a decision some 
time ago that we have to solve the problem on a longterm basis 
which involves major recapitalization 
the recapitalization plan will be outlined at a sept 19 
bondholders meeting hanlon said interest payments could resume 
once such a plan is in place which could take several months he 
said 
marvin roffman a gaming industry analyst with the philadelphia 
brokerage janney montgomery scott inc said monday that griffins 
deal probably will be an equity stock enticement in return for a 
reduction in interest rates or principal payments 
resorts faces payments of more than 130 million in interest and 
principal this year but its operations will not likely generate 
enough money to cover that in 1988 the companys cash flow was 
only 602 million revenues totaled 456 million 
according to figures released earlier this month resorts posted 
a 279 million net loss for the second quarter compared with a 
138 million loss for the same period in 1988 revenues for the 
second quarter totaled 1102 million down from 1223 million in 
the 1988 quarter 
in his letter griffin told the bondholders that he continues to 
believe resorts can become a valuable and successful company i 
invested 50 million personally and have provided a letter of credit 
of 10 million based on that belief 
mondays announcement however could harm griffins chances of 
winning a permanent casino license the state casino control 
commission will hold hearings next month to consider whether resorts 
has enough financial stability to merit changing griffins interim 
authorization into a license 
resorts bonds have a face value of 1000 and were issued at 
interest rates ranging from 10 percent to 16 percent in recent 
weeks the bonds have traded at prices ranging from 355 to 390

customers said yasuo matsushita president of taiyo kobe bank

friends for over 20 years said they hope the merger will strengthen 
their banks domestic and international networks 
the finance ministry and banking circles generally favored the 
merger 
i welcome the decision by both banks to merge given the 
liberalization and internationalization of the financial market 
said finance minister ryutaro hashimoto i think it is timely to 
bolster the operation by utilizing increased profits to provide a 
diversity of services to customers in and out of the country

economies of scale that are the basis of japanese banks 
international competitiveness

this may ignite a series of similar mergers in japan said 
thomas zengage senior analyst at international business institute 
a consulting firm in tokyo 
amid the deregulation and intensifying competition japanese 
banks perception about a merger is changing said zengage adding 
that mergers in japans banking industry often had been considered 
undesirable unless one company was near bankruptcy and needed a 
partners help 
japanese banks are generally considered less sophisticated in 
many aspects of international business than their american or 
european competitors despite their overwhelming size but can rely 
on huge deposits at home to create volume discounts

kobe banks shares today for the day

unisys corp officials hope a new president 
can turn around the companys recent drop in earnings by focusing on 
network computer systems and software 
unisys board of directors monday promoted james unruh to 
president and chief operating officer putting him in line to 
succeed the 63yearold chairman and chief executive michael 
blumenthal 
before unruhs promotion the company had no president and chief 
operating officer 
his top priority will be to strengthen the companys financial 
position by improving profitability and cash flow and to continue 
the companys thrust into the fastergrowing markets of distributed 
network computing systems and software and services blumenthal 
said in a news release 
unruh will handle all computer business except defense sales 
unruh 48 beat out curtis hessler 45 for the no 2 job at the 
computer giant hessler who worked with blumenthal when he was 
treasury secretary in the carter administration and unruh a former 
burroughs executive were viewed as the two candidates to take over 
when blumenthal retires 
blumenthal who engineered burroughs takeover of sperry to form 
unisys has indicated he may step down in two years 
hessler was promoted from executive vice president to vice 
chairman hesslers duties still include chief financial officer and 
head of the defense systems group 
curt hessler is a key member of the management team and this 
promotion recognizes the substantial contributions he has made and 
the broad expertise he brings to the corporation blumenthal said 
unisys reported a 67 percent drop in earnings for the second 
quarter blumenthal attributed the decrease to the expense of 
cutting inventories pricing pressures from competitors and the 
temporary suspension of unisys defense business by the pentagon 
the strong dollar also decreased the value of sales made in foreign 
currencies he said 
for the second quarter unisys reported net income of 536 
million or 17 cents per share on revenue of 257 billion in the 
second three months of 1988 net income totaled 1623 million 
the unisys board also promoted reto braun to senior vice 
president and named him president of the americaspacific division

britain is entering a period of slow investment 
growth modest increases in manufacturing output and subdued 
consumer spending the confederation of british industry said 
tuesday 
the organization representing big business said manufacturers 
order books this month were below normal for the fourth consecutive 
month while their output growth continued at rates much lower than a 
year ago 
david wigglesworth who heads the confederations industrial 
trends survey said companies would trim spending to protect profit 
margins 
there is clearly a danger that in this process investment will 
be cut back with a damaging effect on the nations ability to 
compete in international markets he said 
analysts blame britains high 14 percent base bank lending rates 
for most of the industrial and consumer spending slowdown 
the financial times business daily said tuesday that most 
forecasting groups it surveyed expect the interest rates to remain 
at about 14 percent for the rest of this year 
even in the last three months of 1990 interest rates of about 
12 percent are expected it said consumer spending is also 
expected to slow dramatically after growing by about 3 percent 
this year the survey points to growth of only 17 percent in 1990 
the lowest annual growth rate since 1982 
the daily said inflation was expected to fall from a little below 
7 percent in the last quarter of this year to just above 5 percent 
in a years time 
however it predicted exports would grow reflecting expectations 
of stronger economic growth in other countries 
britain had its second worst monthly trade deficit in july of 21 
billion pounds or 32 billion suggesting the deficit for the year 
will be around 20 billion pounds against the treasurys official 
forecasts of 145 billion pounds 
the high interest rate which is fixed by the government is a 
means of keeping the british pound strong in world currency markets 
at a time of slow industrial growth 
anne segall a financial commentator wrote tuesday in the 
conservative daily telegraph while we were nearly 10 billion 
pounds in deficit in the first six months of this year west germany 
was 20 billion pounds in surplus britains deficit is eight 
times as big as frances we are now overspending the equivalent 
of 4 percent of gross domestic product we are in an even bigger 
mess than the americans

a federal judge has ruled that a shareholder 
lawsuit against sundstrand corp can be brought to trial reversing 
his march ruling that the claims should first be submitted to the 
companys board sundstrand says 
the lawsuit seeks to recover millions of dollars in fines levied 
against the aerospace contractor for federal contract fraud 
us district judge paul plunkett last wednesday denied 
sundstrands motion to dismiss the case ruling that the amended 
complaint contained enough allegations to bypass the board of 
directors and go to trial the company said in a release monday 
rockfordbased sundstrand pleaded guilty to fraud in october and 
agreed to pay a 115 million fine the largest fraud settlement in 
defense department history several managers were subsequently fired 
the lawsuit first filed in september by rodney b shields of 
chandler ariz and joined by several other shareholders said 
company board members and some officers should be personally liable 
for the penalties 
plunkett approved sundstrands motion for dismissal of the case 
in march saying the plaintiffs had failed to give adequate reasons 
for taking the case to court before submitting their claims to the 
company board 
but he left plaintiffs the option of amending the complaint 
in last weeks ruling plunkett denied the companys bid for 
dismissal of the amended lawsuit sundstrand said 
the government said sundstrand overbilled the department for 
aircraft parts and obtained contracts by underbidding actual costs 
and attempting to recover them through overhead accounts set up for 
other purposes 
on jan 26 sundstrand agreed to pay an additional 623 million 
to the pentagon and make costsaving concessions on future contracts 
that one federal official estimated could be worth an additional 34 
million

the dallas times herald won a temporary 
restraining order barring its rival the dallas morning news from 
publishing two dozen syndicated columns and comic strips beginning 
next week 
the question of who has publication rights to the features also 
is under the scrutiny of a federal judge in kansas city where a 
hearing was scheduled today 
the features including such items as dear abby and tank 
mcnamara would have disappeared from the times herald beginning 
sept 3 had a contract obtained by the morning news not been 
challenged 
universal press syndicate the kansas citybased firm which 
distributes the features has sued the times herald under federal 
copyright laws a hearing on that suit is set for friday 
state district judge david west in houston said his restraining 
order monday could mean no dallas newspaper will be carrying the 
features and comics until the logjam is broken thats what the 
result is he said 
last week west declined to grant a similar temporary restraining 
order sought by the times herald citing an order by us district 
judge d brook bartlett that nothing be done to infringe the federal 
judges jurisdiction 
at the kansas city hearing today attorneys for the times herald 
were to seek to have bartletts order vacated according to times 
herald officials 
the smaller times herald wants to prevent morning news owner ah 
belo corp from acquiring exclusive dallasarea rights to the 26 
comics and features 
belo announced early this month it had formed a joint venture 
with universal press to explore television programming possibilities 
for some of the syndicates features as part of the agreement belo 
which also owns dallas toprated television station wfaa 
acquired exclusive rights to the syndicates features 
that prompted the suit from the times herald which accused belo 
of unfairly increasing its influence in the dallas market 
morning news attorney paul watler insisted the federal courts 
jurisdiction should not be disturbed but west said he felt he 
needed to do something 
im interested in the public rather than the parties west 
said the public has a right to competing newspapers and has a 
right to read these columns 
the legal actions are not the first involving the intense rivals 
last year the two newspapers settled a dispute over circulation 
figures 
according to editor amp publisher the morning news has a daily 
circulation of 354000 issues to 224000 for the times herald

miss piggy kermit the frog and other 
muppets have been given the keys to the disney castle and will soon 
join mickey mouse dumbo and the other regulars at disney theme 
parks 
later muppets will star in disney movies and television shows 
there is virtually no area in which there isnt an opportunity 
for jim henson to make an enormous contribution said jeffrey 
katzenberg chairman of the walt disney studios 
henson the creator of the muppets and the walt disney co 
announced an agreement monday to put at disneys disposal all of the 
existing muppet characters and their library of film and television 
shows 
thats not mentioning what is to come what will be created 
disney chairman michael eisner said 
the merger of the two kiddie entertainment giants will blend the 
colorful characters from the muppet show the most widely seen 
tv program in the world with an estimated 235 million viewers in 
some 100 countries into disneys theme parks movies tv shows and 
retail merchandising products 
katzenberg said the muppets will be presented at the disneymgm 
studios theme park in a stateoftheart interactive 3d 
experience we will use many technologies in doing some things that 
have never been done before the muppet theater will open next 
memorial day 
henson and eisner refused to disclose the purchase price of 
henson associates inc it has been reported as ranging from 100 
million to 150 million 
ive loved disney i grew up on its movies and im happy 
to have the muppets at the parks said the bearded henson who 
created kermit in 1955 and followed that up with miss piggy animal 
fozzie bear gonzo scooter and others 
henson who also created most of the stars of the sesame 
street television series will retain his association with that 
show separately from the disney agreement he and eisner told 
reporters 
big bird oscar the grouch the cookie monster and other henson 
creations for sesame street are not part of the disney deal 
analysts have said the studios park needed something such as the 
muppets to better compete with rival universal studios florida 
which will have two attractions geared to children when it opens 
next may 1 
eisner and henson publicist susan berry said the muppets would 
retain their familyoriented humor and not become strictly 
childrens characters the muppets attraction to small children is 
primarily visual ms berry said 
miss piggy for instance whose humor is adult humor is not 
going to change she said 
henson said he it was always fun creating new characters i 
look forward to that

us department of agriculture scientists have 
developed an infrared device that takes the guesswork out of buying 
watermelons cantaloupes and honeydews 
after 16 years of research gerald dull a usda chemist in 
athens has unveiled a meter that measures the sugar content of 
individual melons 
the no 1 parameter of quality is sweetness dull said in a 
recent interview if you havent got sweetness you havent got a 
good melon 
growers and consumers currently have to rely on appearance in 
judging ripeness and quality dull noted but similarlooking melons 
can vary from 5 percent to 10 percent in sweetness 
theres no one who can look at the outside and tell you whether 
that melon is good he said 
the melon meter shines infrared light into the top of the fruit 
and then measures the amount of light that comes out the side the 
computerized device determines the amount of soluble solids based 
on the amount of light that is absorbed by the fruit 
dull said soluble solids are predominantly sugars 
doyle smittle a horticulturist at the university of georgias 
coastal plain experiment station said ripeness is critical because 
melons can add a quarter of a pound of sugar in just a few days 
sugar is produced during the photosynthesis process 
melons need a sugar content of at least 9 percent to taste good 
and the best contain 12 percent to 14 percent sugar 
if you get one that is 7 or 8 percent its an unpleasant 
experience dull said its kind of like eating a raw cucumber 
the melon meter is 85 percent accurate in the laboratory and the 
chemist is testing a portable version with hundreds of melons grown 
under smittles supervision near tifton 
dull developed the meter with help from usda engineer gerald 
birth who recently retired another usda scientist physicist dick 
leffler of athens is perfecting the computer program that will 
analyze signals from the light detector and give a sweetness reading 
several companies have already expressed an interest in producing 
melon meters dull said and they probably will be installed 
initially in packing sheds where the fruit is graded packed and 
shipped 
he believes they will appeal to suppliers who want to provide 
consumers with the highestquality melons 
i think were just opening the door on analyzing fresh 
produce he said with computers and highspeed equipment we 
might be able to get down to measuring the vitamins

years and had increased fears that the economy could be facing an 
imminent recession 
however more recent government statistics have shown that 
economic activity in the second quarter was not as weak as 
previously believed prompting economists to put away their gloomy 
forecasts of an impending downturn 
in another report today the commerce department said sales of 
new homes shot up 144 percent in july their biggest monthly 
increase in almost three years the gain which put sales at an 
annual rate of 739000 units was credited to the big drop in 
mortgage rates which occurred during the month 
analysts said the exceptionally large upward revision in the gnp 
and the strong home sales report showed that the economy was moving 
ahead at a healthy clip in the seventh year of the current expansion 
this is a clear indication if anyone needed such assurance 
that this economy is not headed into a recession said lyle 
gramley chief economist for the mortgage bankers association 
the white house was sure to be cheered by the upward revision 
since more robust economic growth makes it easier to meet the 
administrations deficitreduction goals 
in more good news todays gnp report showed that inflation did 
not worsen even though growth was stronger than originally thought 
an inflation gauge tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 51 
percent from april through june down slightly from an original 
estimate of 52 percent made a month ago the increase in prices 
which followed a rate of 48 percent in the first quarter was 
blamed on higher energy costs 
almost twothirds of todays upward revision in growth came from 
higher consumer spending than previously believed 
consumer purchases climbed at an annual rate of 22 percent 
double the previously reported rate 
other areas of strength were government purchases which rose at 
a rate of 123 percent and spending for business investment which 
rose 82 percent 
one remaining area of weakness was housing construction which 
fell 126 percent in the second quarter the biggest decline since 
the recession year of 1982 
the administration is forecasting that the economy will expand by 
29 percent this year down from gnp growth of 44 percent in 1988 
the fastest pace in four years 
to meet the administrations growth forecast the economy would 
have to expand at an annual rate of just 22 percent in the second 
half of the year a level that many economists believe is obtainable 
the administration two weeks ago criticized the federal reserve 
for keeping interest rates so high that they threatened to topple 
the country into a recession 
however todays report was likely to strengthen the feds 
resolve to keep rates about where they are now given the business 
signals showing that growth remains fairly robust 
in another report today the government said that corporate 
profits after taxes fell a sharp 54 percent in the second quarter 
the decline which followed a 11 percent drop in the first three 
months of the year was the biggest setback since a 165 percent 
decline in the first quarter of 1986 
trade was another bright spot in the gnp report the trade 
deficit declined by 25 billion in the second quarter reflecting 
the fact that exports grew at a faster rate than imports 
the 27 percent gnp growth rate in the second quarter followed a 
37 percent increase in the first quarter however most of the 
firstquarter advance stemmed from a rebound in the farm sector 
following last summers drought the nonfarm economy actually grew 
at a lackluster 15 percent rate in the first quarter 
the various changes in the gnp put the total output of goods and 
services at an annual rate of 4134 trillion in the second quarter 
after adjusting for inflation

in an attempt to get an edge in a highly 
competitive market two manufacturers are coming out with car 
batteries they say will make jumper cables obsolete 
some industry analysts however are uncertain whether the 
general public will be willing to invest in the costlier product 
first to hit the market will be gnb incs champion switch 
battery with an initial run of 500000 going on sale in the 
southeast in october 
johnson controls inc the nations top auto battery maker will 
bring out its everstart in early spring 
the technology is different but both batteries have a reserve 
store of energy that cannot run down or be tapped unless a switch is 
thrown under the hood 
its going to be a blockbuster said anita clark a 
spokeswoman for johnson controls a milwaukee company that makes 
batteries for some of the nations largest retailers under their 
house names 
its going to do for the battery industry what radial tires did 
for the tire industry she said 
the suggested retail price for everstart will be 12995 while 
champion switch carries the recommeded price of 10999 the normal 
range for car batteries is 60 to 80 
eli lustgarten a financial analyst in new york with paine webber 
inc wonders how it will go over with the general public 
its nice to have reserve power but you know the question is 
whether the consumer is going to pay for it lustgarten said 
its an interesting marketing technique but i doubt if it will 
revolutionize the market 
both batteries are being introduced at the 1989 automotive parts 
amp accessories association show this week the show which is closed 
to the public during its monday through thursday run features 920 
exhibitors for the trade in the 150 billionayear industry 
both companies say their batteries will fit about 70 percent of 
the cars on the road 
everstart holds its power in reserve in a separate battery 
packaged in the same shell as the main battery the spare battery is 
powerful enough to start cars with dead batteries but is not 
designed to run all the electrical accessories 
both batteries activate their spare power in the same fashion 
if you drain the battery down you just simply lift the hood 
and theres a big yellow switch you turn on to activate the 
reserve said bill kennedy head of marketing for gnb a st paul 
minn company that has been making batteries for 70 years 
theres ample cranking amperage in reserve to activate the car 
lustgarten noted that most new cars have automatic lightshutoff 
features or a warning signal to alert the motorist who leaves his 
lights on a primary cause of dead batteries 
but theyre not failsafe either said eric smith a 
technical executive with gnbs holding company pacific dunlop 
international battery group of australia 
lustgarten conceded that the new batteries will probably find a 
successful nitch in the upper range of batteries 
whether they can replace batteries costing half as much is 
another question 
sure id like to have the added protection for free but i 
dont know if id want to pay for it lustgarten said

federal regulators unveiled proposed rules 
changes today to combat the alleged fraud and price manipulation 
uncovered earlier this month in chicagos commodity futures 
exchanges 
among the changes proposed would be a steppedup presence of 
government regulators on exchange floors at the start and end of 
trading days 
more than 40 brokers and traders were indicted on a laundry list 
of charges aug 2 after a twoyear probe of the chicago mercantile 
exchange and the chicago board of trade 
the commodity futures trading commission which oversees the 
futures industry voted unanimously 5to0 to submit a package of 
rules changes for public comment 
in addition to tightening surveillance on the nations commodity 
exchange floors the package calls for better record keeping and 
requires more accountability by individuals and firms 
the proposed rules changes if adopted also would prevent 
individuals with a previous history of rules violations from serving 
on the governing boards disciplinary committees or arbitration 
panels of exchanges or registered futures associations 
the proposed changes do not take effect immediately but are 
subject to comment by interested parties for the next 30 days before 
final approval by the commission 
the message is that the commission is very vigilant in its 
efforts to ensure that these markets have integrity and have the 
public confidence cftc chairwoman wendy gramm told reporters 
after the commission voted to submit the proposed changes for 
comment 
a surveillance pilot program calls for direct examination of 
trading cards and other trading records right on the exchange floor 
deterrence of criminal activity can be enhanced through 
adequate record keeping andrea corcoran director of the cftcs 
division of trading and markets told commission members at the 
meeting

a canadian partnership raised to 308 million 
tuesday its hostile bid for dunkin donuts inc despite a lawsuit 
pending in delaware chancery court officials said 
dd acquisition corp a partnership of kingsbridge capital group 
and cara operations ltd said it had raised its price to 45 a 
share from 43 regardless of how the delaware judge rules in the 
trial that begins sept 11 
unless extended the offer expires sept 15 the torontobased 
partnership said 
dunkin donuts board of directors meanwhile said it would meet 
to evaluate the revised tender offer with the assistance of the 
companys outside legal and financial advisors in a statement 
the company urged shareholders not to act until officials had made 
their recommendation 
the offer is there and isnt contingent on success in court 
said eric w evans a kingsbridge associate director 
he said dd acquisition would continue its bid if the court finds 
dunkin donuts was within its rights when it set up a series of 
tough defenses including an employee stock ownership plan which 
holds about 16 percent of its outstanding common shares 
the company also has a shareholder rights plan or poison 
pill designed to increase the number of shares in the event of a 
takeover making a merger prohibitively expensive 
and it has sold 28 million of preferred stock convertible to an 
11 percent stake in the company to an avowedly friendly investor 
general electric capital corp 
we think we have a very good case in court and that the court 
will find that those measures were improperly put in place but even 
if they werent well still continue with the bid evans said 
he said the offer was however valid only if 501 percent of 
dunkin donuts common shares were tendered 
based on publicly available financial information on dunkin 
donuts including its results for the most recent quarter we 
believe this revised offer is generous and fair earl i rotman 
president of kingsbridge said in a statement 
dunkin donuts reported a 34 percent drop in thirdquarter 
earnings much of which it attributed to costs associated with 
battling the hostile takeover bid 
the doughnut shop chain reported earnings for the three months 
ended july 29 of 21 million or 24 cents a share on revenue of 
303 million compared with earnings of 32 million or 49 cents a 
share on revenue of 292 million a year earlier 
for the nine months ended july 29 dunkin donuts earnings 
totaled 762 million or 108 a share on revenue of 897 
million down 227 percent from 986 million or 149 a share on 
revenue of 824 million for the same period a year earlier

iglo products maker of a coolant for car air 
conditioners that is linked to depletion of the earths protective 
ozone layer on tuesday announced a recycling and consumereducation 
program to help address the problem 
ultimately we hope this program will help to move the 
marketplace toward less dependence upon cfc12 in particular and 
toward a gradual total phaseout of this environmentally harmful 
chemical said hoyt b wilder company president during a news 
conference at the 1989 automotive parts and accessories show 
under the program recycling units are to be established at 
service centers by mid1990 to capture escaped particles of the 
cfc12 coolant known as freon and allow them to be reused 
the chemical breakup of cfc12 and other chlorofluorocarbons 
cfcs in the earths upper atmosphere has been linked to the 
depletion of the earths protective ozone layer and the warming of 
the atmosphere known as the greenhouse effect 
iglo also plans to eliminate inexpensive doityourself 
coolantinjection kits with a high potential for misuse 
they are to be replaced by deluxe diagnostic kits costing 
about five times more and designed for the sophisticated car owner 
considered more likely to follow directions aimed at protecting the 
environment the new kits are expected to go on the market in 
january 1991 
iglo hopes elimination of the 4 to 5 kits will send users to 
service centers that will eventually use the recycling units wilder 
said 
the company also plans to invest 1 million in a 
consumereducation program designed to promote proper use and 
recycling of cfc12 displays in retail stores and public service 
announcements are planned 
scientists say cfcs are nontoxic when released into the 
atmosphere but 10 to 100 years later when they rise 15 to 20 miles 
to the stratosphere their chemical bonds break apart resulting in 
damage to the ozone layer 
environmentalists say car air conditioners are among the nations 
single biggest source of ozone depletion 
iglo a lexington kybased division of valvoline oil co 
bills itself as the nations leading marketer of automotive 
refrigerant 
under an international agreement called the montreal protocol 
the united states and 37 other countries are committed to a 50 
percent reduction in production and consumption of cfcs by 1998 
wilder said his industry is hoping for a total phaseout of 
cfccontaining coolants by the turn of the century 
the industry may be forced to address the question sooner than 
that as several states and congress are considering restrictions or 
bans on cfccontaining products said david gardiner legislative 
director for the sierra club 
the sierra club an environmental group based in san francisco 
is lobbying to phase out the use of cfcs completely by 1995 
gardiner said in a telephone interview from his washington dc 
office 
iglos new program sounds basically good gardiner said 
certainly the recycling thing is a good thing to do with 
something like 100 million cars on the road today unless we do 
something thats potentially the biggest source of 
chlorofluorocarbons

a manufacturer has agreed to give refunds to 
people who bought a pistolshaped juice container for children that 
has been recalled the state attorney generals office said tuesday 
mackie international inc based in santa fe springs calif 
reached an agreement with the us consumer product safety 
commission early this month to recall the toy called chilly bang 
bang it had sold 578688 of them in new york between april and june 
the federal and state agreements were based on a plastic piece on 
the toy that could choke young children however the company agreed 
to discontinue sales on june 2 because of complaints about teaching 
children to put guns in their mouths 
the agreement released by the attorney generals office said the 
products wrapper pictures a boy with the barrel of the chilly bang 
bang in his mouth and the directions twist tip of barrel 
squeeze and drink 
a threeeighths of an inch plastic piece must be removed from 
the barrel before drinking the liquid inside 
this plastic piece is easily broken off the barrel when twisted 
or bitten by a child the attorney generals office said this 
circular plastic piece because of its size can be aspirated by a 
child under the age of three and thus presents a choking hazard 
after the soft drink is gone the container can be used as a 
water gun 
mackie which admitted no wrongdoing has agreed to immediately 
stop selling or distributing chilly bang bang in new york 
it also will direct its wholesale customers to pull the product 
from their shelves display a poster about the choking hazard run 
advertisements in local papers and give refunds to customers who 
return the product leslie gersing a spokesman for the attorney 
generals office said those provisions were not included in the 
federal agreement 
mackie also must file an affidavit in 180 days detailing its 
compliance with the new york agreement 
the product also was sold in california michigan mississippi

stellar computer inc and its japanesebacked 
rival ardent computer corp are expected to announce a merger 
wednesday of two of the top makers of expensive graphics 
minisupercomputers according to sources close to the deal 
the companies which normally steer clear of each other have 
called a news conference wednesday in new york that will be attended 
by chief executives of both companies 
sources close to the deal said both privately held companies are 
losing money and are hoping that by uniting they will be able to 
stave off mounting competition from other rivals particularly 
silicon graphics inc 
computers made by ardent and stellar have list prices of roughly 
100000 and can be used by only one person at a time usually a 
highly paid scientist or engineer so they have a limited market 
sales of each company are about 20 million a year 
graphics minisupercomputers are used for jobs that require heavy 
calculation and detailed threedimensional displays such as 
analyzing the way air flows over turbine blades in jet engines or 
the molecular structure of pharmaceuticals 
ardent and stellar are remarkably similar both founded a month 
apart at the end of 1985 and both having about 210 employees the 
biggest difference is that ardent has the backing of japans kubota 
ltd a maker of tractors and industrial equipment which is a more 
patient investor than most american venture capitalists 
kubota owns about 44 percent of ardent it was not clear tuesday 
how much it will own of the combined companies 
a source familiar with the deal said the combined company 
probably would try to save money by merging the two product lines 
combining the chip design used by ardent with the graphics system 
used by stellar that could be bad for stellars current customers 
because their software would not run on the ardent chip 
stellar is based in newtown mass and is headed by j william 
poduska its founder chairman and chief executive he previously 
cofounded prime computer inc and apollo computer inc 
ardent computer corp based in sunnyvale calif has allen h 
michels as its president and chief executive michels is founder and 
former president of convergent technologies inc which is now part 
of unisys corp

copper futures contracts had risen more than 22 percent in value 
from july 31 through last friday when the bull move peaked with the

the rally had been fueled by fears of tight supplies based 
largely on strikes at the highland valley copper cos highland 
valley mine in british columbia and a nationwide peruvian copper 
miners strike that began on aug 14 
but supply fears eased tuesday after highland valley confirmed it 
had resumed negotiations with workers aimed at settling a 56dayold 
strike and perus secondlargest copper mine was reported operating 
at full capacity following a failed attempt to expand the copper 
strike into a general work stoppage

of copper warehoused for delivery against lme futures contracts had 
risen by 3325 tons last week to 80625 traders had expected the 
report to show a slight decrease

some profittaking said bette raptopoulos metals analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
bernard savaiko senior metals analyst with painewebber inc in 
new york said the move had created a technical chart formation 
known as a twoday island top which frequently signals the end 
of a bull run 
this could be just a long overdue correction to an overbought 
situation but then again it could indicate a top said savaiko

the 25 billion merger of the lucky and alpha 
beta supermarket chains was kept on hold tuesday by a judge who 
allowed the california attorney general to post a nominal 10000 
bond while appealing to the us supreme court to overturn the 
merger 
us district judge david kenyon said he believes along with 
us supreme court justice sandra day oconnor that the state has a 
good chance to win its fight to block the merger 
california attorney general john van de kamp contends that 
reduced competition from the merger would cost california shoppers 
400 million a year american stores inc of salt lake city which 
owns both chains says increased efficiency from the consolidation 
would save customers 50 million to 60 million a year 
kenyon said the evidence so far indicates that the merger of the 
supermarket giants lucky is the states biggest chain alpha beta 
the fourthlargest would cause irreparable harm to consumers 
although he earlier ordered a 162 million bond kenyon said the 
case has changed radically in recent weeks and that the 8 million 
bond proposed by american stores was unnecessary 
he alluded to briefs filed by chief deputy attorney general 
andrea sheridan ordin who said the state could afford a 10000 
bond and no more to ensure that the litigation goes forward 
attorney frank rothman representing american stores argued that 
the company would lose millions if the lawsuit was delayed further 
and if ultimately the supreme court refused to review it 
in her ruling last week oconnor said there was a fair prospect 
the appeal would succeed before the high court but she later 
ordered van de kamp to post a reasonable bond 
alpha beta and lucky which have a total of 550 stores plan to 
combine their operations under the lucky banner 
the federal trade commission approved the merger but van de 
kamp in a suit claiming violation of federal antitrust law 
contended that the merged chain would dominate the marketplace in 
many areas and lead to higher prices

leadership by the united states has helped 
reduce income taxes all over the world a treasury official said 
tuesday 
bruce bartlett deputy assistant secretary for economic policy 
compiled a list of 86 countries showing that 55 have lowered their 
top rates since 1985 only two lebanon and luxembourg have 
increased them the 29 others have kept the same rate 
some have enacted reductions that have not yet gone into effect 
he added 
in japan the highest rate has gone down to 50 percent from 70 
percent and in france to 568 percent from 60 percent britain 
remained steady at 60 percent bartlett pointed out that britains 
reductions had started earlier from higher rates than in the united 
states 
italy went down to 50 percent from 65 percent 
theres no way of explaining these policies except by the 
leadership of the united states he said in an interview 
the top us rate went down to 28 percent from 50 percent 
he called rates over 50 percent confiscatory saying they 
only serve to justify high rates on lower incomes 
when someone with a low income pays 25 percent its consoling 
to think that the fellow with millions is paying 90 percent 
bartlett said 
he said high rates encourage people and money to leave a country 
discourage effort and do not increase total revenues 
the southern african republic of zambia one of the worlds 
poorest countries has the highest top rate of the 86 on his list 
it dropped only to 75 percent from the 80 percent of 1985 the 
average zambian earned 240 in 1987 
bartlett cautioned that the top rate is applied to very different 
incomes in different countries in mexico for example the 40 
percent rate is charged on incomes over 13170 in honduras almost 
next door that is also the top rate but it is applied only on 
incomes of 500000 in a country where the average income in 1987 
was 780 
you should get as close as possible to a flat rate bartlett 
said adding that he would favor a flat rate for the united states 
a flat rate charges the same percentage against all income high 
or low the us system was designed as a progressive tax based on 
the taxpayers ability to pay with higher rates on higher incomes 
bartlett praised bolivia where he said the 10 percent rate the 
lowest on his list is a flat rate 
many governments unlike the united states rely for their 
revenues more on sales taxes than on income taxes 
he pointed out that his figures do not include social security 
taxes taxes for health services and local income taxes the top 
federal rate in canada for example is only 29 percent but in 
quebec the total tax burden can reach 491 percent he calculated 
his figures were drawn from tax guides issued by two 
international accounting firms price waterhouse and coopers and 
lybrand they were first published in a table in tuesdays wall 
street journal

one of the founders of kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co the worlds largest corporate buyout firm sued his former 
partners tuesday claiming they enriched themselves at his expense 
in a 23page complaint filed in new york supreme court the 
states triallevel court jerome kohlberg jr alleges that henry r 
kravis and george r roberts sharply cut back on his stake in 
several companies they had acquired jointly through the new york 
firm 
we are saddened that mr kohlberg felt it necessary to sue his 
partners and kohlberg kravis roberts a spokesman for kravis and 
roberts told the new york times we believe he is wrong both as to 
the facts and his interpretation of the agreement between us and we 
fully expect to prevail in court 
kohlberg 64 resigned in 1987 from the firm he helped found in 
1976 citing philosophical differences with his former partners he 
remained a limited partner in the firm which removed him from 
managerial duties but enabled him to continue to participate as an 
investor in kkr deals 
kohlbergs suit contends his former partners used the opportunity 
presented by several refinancings of old deals to declare them new 
transactions under the terms of their agreement and to reduce his 
ownership position 
kohlberg charges that in doing so his former partners have 
breached their ethical and fiduciary duties 
his suit also suggests that his former partners identified 
certain deals that were lucrative and then increased their stake in 
those deals at the expense of investors whose money they were 
managing 
kkrs investors include a number of state and corporate pension 
funds who might feel they also were shortchanged should kohlbergs 
accusations be found true 
kohlberg now runs his own investment firm 
kkr has raised billions of dollars for corporate takeovers its 
most spectacular deal was the 25 billion leveraged buyout of rjr 
nabisco inc completed earlier this year the deal was the largest 
ever 
in a leveraged buyout the assets of the target company are used 
as collateral to raise the money needed to buy all the firms stock 
transforming it into a private company

a federal judge has rejected a complaint filed by 
texas air corp alleging that united airlines contracts governing 
travel agents use of its computerized reservations system violated 
antitrust laws united officials said tuesday 
in a decision handed down monday us district judge milton 
pollack of new york dismissed the claims of texas airs system one 
computerized reservations system that united exercised monopoly 
power and acted in restraint of trade in its contracts with 21 
travel agencies united said 
telephone calls late tuesday to charlotte kirk a spokeswoman for 
houstonbased system one were not returned 
in his decision pollack noted that the record bears no 
evidence of any substance that uniteds apollo computerized 
reservations system contracts and marketing practices suppress or 
destroy competition control prices or otherwise constitute an 
unreasonable restraint on trade 
texas air parent of continental and eastern airlines identified 
12 cities including denver and honolulu in which uniteds apollo 
system has a leading share of the market but pollack said there 
were no anticompetitive practices by united in those markets 
united is delighted that the court has spoken so clearly and 
forcefully to validate the legality of our contracts to provide 
computerized reservations services to retail travel agents said 
edward h hoenicke uniteds senior vice president and general 
counsel united is a division of chicagobased ual corp 
reservations systems are a key marketing tool since an airline 
can influence which carriers flights show up first on a travel 
agents computer screen if they own the system

an agreement announced tuesday will allow 
the washington public power supply system to proceed with a 
temporarily derailed sale of 450 million in bonds 
the sale is expected to take place the week of sept 11 said a 
news release from wppss the bonneville power administration and 
chemical bank of new york 
the sale had been scheduled for last week however chemical bank 
claimed in an 11thhour memo it had a lien on proceeds from the 
bonds and the sale was postponed 
wppss estimates it could save 70 million to 80 million a year 
over 30 years by refinancing highinterest bonds through the new 
bonds the 450 million is a first installment of the plan to 
eventually refinance some 2 billion worth of bonds bearing interest 
rates of 10 to 15 percent 
wppss hopes to sell the new bonds at interest rates of 7 to 8 
percent 
until this year wppss had been effectively barred from 
approaching the bond market because of a 1983 default on 225 
billion worth of bonds sold to finance wppss nuclear power projects 
nos 4 and 5 it was the largest default in municipal bond history 
the supply system lost its bond ratings after the default though 
it continued to make bond payments with the help of the bonneville 
power administration on bonds sold to finance its other three 
nuclear power plants nos 1 2 and 3 
wppss regained bond ratings from standard amp poors corp and 
moodys investors service inc the two main creditrating agencies 
after a trial last year tentatively resolved the default case 
the 450 million sale is on bonds sold to finance wppss plants 
nos 1 and 3 those plants are twins of the defaulted plants 
nos 4 and 5 and there is a separate legal action over joint 
financing of those plants called the cost sharing case as 
twins the plants shared certain mechanical systems 
chemical bank as trustee for wppss nos 4 and 5 bondholders 
claims some costs for nos 1 and 3 were inappropriately billed to 
nos 4 and 5 
the agreement announced tuesday was formalized in an order signed 
by us district judge william browning of tucson ariz who has 
been hearing the wppss cases the agreement provides for chemical 
bank to release any claim against proceeds of the refinancing sale 
in return bonneville agreed to a stronger guarantee that it 
would pay any settlement eventually ordered in the costsharing case 
under a complicated arrangement bpa has essentially assumed the 
wppss debts on plants 1 2 and 3 it did not assume responsibility 
for the debts on nos 4 and 5 
tuesdays agreement does not affect or settle the costsharing 
litigation wppss attempted to build five nuclear power plants in 
the 1970s one plant no 2 located at the hanford nuclear 
reservation in southcentral washington is operating nos 1 and 3 
were mothballed unfinished and there is little likelihood they will 
be completed nos 4 and 5 were abandoned after the 225 billion 
had been invested
