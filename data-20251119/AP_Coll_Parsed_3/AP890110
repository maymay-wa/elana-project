1906 for a 60 million 18month renovation 
its very strange its very lonely donald timbie the 
hotels general manager and vice president said monday as the hotel 
shut down 
the quake which destroyed much of the city triggered a fire 
which gutted the original sevenstory hotel but 12footthick 
brick walls saved the shell and it was rebuilt to its current nine 
stories and reopened dec 16 1909 with other alterations in 1915 
1919 and 1925 
tenor enrico caruso was a guest as the temblor struck he was 
tossed from his bed and vowed i will never set foot in san 
francisco again 
actually the earthquake only destroyed 8 percent of the 
structure said jim kilroy the hotels director of marketing 
the fire did the rest 
the hotel has been host to presidents ulysses s grant william 
howard taft theodore roosevelt franklin d roosevelt and harry 
truman warren g harding died there in room 8064 on aug 2 1923

there and the garden court held the official banquet honoring the 
opening session of the united nations 
king david kalakaua of hawaii the last of the islands monarchs

the hotels exterior will not be altered neither will the garden 
court a 9350squarefoot restaurant originally built as a carriage 
entrance it was declared a city landmark in 1969 and the only work 
there will involve a cleanup and a change in color scheme

opera guild event drew about 12 people who sat at one table dwarfed 
by the huge room that features an arching dome of iridescent glass

the murder of ecologist and union leader 
francisco chico mendes on dec 22 to which a ranchers son 
confessed focused attention on the struggle between 
conservationists and ranchers in the vast amazon rain forest an ap 
reporter visited the region and filed this report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dusk fell on a sultry evening just before 
christmas and francisco chico mendes invited his two police 
bodyguards to share a family dinner of fried fish urging them to 
start while he showered in the stall outside 
it was a typically friendly gesture by mendes it also was a 
fatal one 
the bodyguards had become almost fixtures in the household since 
mendes began getting death threats because of his campaign to save 
the amazon rain forest from destruction by ranchers and land 
speculators 
i was nervous and worried his widow ilzamar said later 
the death threats were getting more frequent they said he 
wouldnt make it past christmas but chico tried to hide it from 
me 
mendes made it only to three days before christmas 
he was home at noon in the sleepy amazon town of 5000 people 
2700 miles northwest of rio de janeiro near the border with 
bolivia 
at 4 pm he was engrossed in his favorite pastime playing 
dominoes with friends from the workers party and the local rubber 
tappers union of which he was president as usual he won 
his friends left and at 7 pm mendes stood up and asked 
ilzamar to bring the new blueandwhite towel that was a present for 
his 44th birthday a week earlier 
stepping to the back door of the fourroom wooden cabin perched 
on rotting wooden pilings he peered past the coconut guava and 
cupuacu trees toward the siltbrown acre river 50 yards away 
its so dark outside those guys could be out there waiting to 
ambush me he said seeming almost to joke the guards continued 
eating 
at least to men perhaps three crouched unseen 15 feet away near 
the white concrete outhouse and shower stall 
with his new towel over his right shoulder and a lantern in his 
hand mendes cautiously pushed the door open 
a 20gauge shotgun boomed mendes staggered back lurched past 
the kitchen table to the door of the childrens room and collapsed 
the killers fled through the back gate 
i was on the sofa feeding the kids and raced back to the 
kitchen ilzamar said i passed the two bodyguards running the 
other way they jumped out of the window 
chico had his hands up to his head like he was in a lot of 
pain i just saw a little blood at first and thought good its not 
serious hes going to live but it was just that the towel was new 
and it took awhile for the blood to soak through 
the shotgun blast blew a hole in the towel and left nearly 50 
pellets in his chest and arms he died almost immediately 
i wanted to cry but couldnt said julio barbosa de aquino 
who succeeded mendes as union president nobody believed they 
could kill a man like that who never hurt anybody 
a lifelong battle to preserve the rain forest made powerful 
enemies for mendes 
he became a rubber tapper as a boy of 10 and believed the jungle 
should be exploited for latex and brazil nuts not destroyed to make 
cattle ranches in the past decade a section of rain forest the 
size of california has been razed and burned for farms and pasture 
mendes helped unionize rubber tappers and in 1976 was elected 
assemblyman for xapuri 
with age his ideas became more radical 
in the beginning he wasnt political aquino said he just 
wanted to help tappers sell their latex and not be kicked off the 
land but lately he was talking about defense of the forest and 
union of jungle peoples like tappers and indians 
ilzamar said mendes admired augusto cesar sandino the nicaraguan 
revolutionary of 60 years ago and named their 2yearold son for 
him their 4yearold daughter elenira was named for a brazilian 
communist guerrilla killed by soldiers during the military rule of 
196485 
he became much more radical she said he said he wouldnt 
stand for another tree to be cut down people called him a 
communist he said that if being a communist was defending the 
amazon and the rubber tappers he accepted the name 
one technique mendes used was the empate or stalemate in 
which tappers usually unarmed would surround a work gang preparing 
to raze a section of forest they would withdraw only when the owner 
signed an agreement to leave the area intact 
mendes preached nonviolence but gunmen working for landowners 
have ambushed and killed many tappers few have been brought to 
trial 
this is organized crime and the cattle raisers and land 
speculators are behind it said moacyr grechi roman catholic 
bishop of rio branco the acre state capital 110 miles from xapuri 
they have total impunity and chico mendes was on the firing line 
facing their gunmen every day 
officials generally considered mendes too rigid in his defense of 
the environment 
he wanted the total preservation of the forest but we think 
its important to have economic development of the area too said 
jose carlos castelo branco the acre state secretary of security 
the union leaders knowledge of the amazon environment made him a 
soughtafter consultant to the world bank and other institutions he 
traveled abroad and often had foreign visitors 
there were teams of gringos here almost every week they loved 
my food ilzamar said standing beside a bookcase that held 
plaques from the un environment program and the better world 
society 
fatima carvalho mastub a neighbor said she took calls at all 
hours from around the world for mendes because he did not have a 
telephone 
a successful empate at the cachoeira rubber grove which 
covers thousands of acres probably led to his death 
the owner was darly alves da silva a feared rancher wanted by 
police in southern parana state in connection with several killings 
after the confrontation at cachoeira the federal government 
expropriated the holding and made it an extractivist reserve 
meaning the rubber and brazil nut trees would remain for tappers and 
harvesters 
mendes said da silva vowed to kill him he reported the threats 
and gov flaviano melo gave him police protection 
four days after mendes was killed da silvas 21yearold son 
darcy confessed he told reporters his father had been forced into 
hiding to escape persecution by police and rubber tappers 
romeu tuma the federal police chief said police believed the 
shooting was a family decision by the da silvas 
chico mendes knew he was courting death mrs mastub the 
neighbor quoted him as saying i know im hanging by a thread 
but ill keep going to the end 
bishop grechi said mendes was just one of 89 murder victims in 
rural brazil in 1988 and not one of the killers has been brought to 
justice the solution is land reform but the government doesnt 
have the authority to carry it out

on the sidelines of the world chemical weapons 
conference experts say bleakly no headway has been made on the most 
worrisome threat keeping the chemicals away from terrorists or 
leaders bent on genocide 
sentiment aside they say poison gas works and it is nearly 
impossible to control its components without energetic voluntary 
action by governments and private industry 
at the same time they add many small nations refuse to ban such 
weapons while neighbors have atomic bombs the way a streetwise 
youth carries a switchblade because of bullies down the block 
few technicians among the 151 delegations attending the fiveday 
paris conference wanted to be named leaving the limelight to 
statesmen drafting a declaration against producing and using 
chemical or biological weapons 
a european specialist summed up the mood this conference is 
one thing controlling the stuff is another you have to conclude 
that chemical weapons won the war for iraq that sends a very strong 
negative message 
iraq acknowledged using poison gas in its eightyear war with 
iraq in which a ceasefire was reached aug 20 
an american expert said many third world military strategists are 
seeking advice from iraq which he said had five years of experience 
with mustard gas and nerve gas 
another us specialist said gas and biological agents would 
remain effective against inconvenient minorities even if nations 
could be kept from using them outside their borders 
iraq has been accused of using poison gas against rebellious 
kurds 
terrorists could wreak havoc with small amounts of nerve agents 
without complex delivery systems 
max friedersdorf us envoy to the geneva disarmament talks 
agreed in an interview that a gulf exists between what probably will 
be negotiated and what can be applied 
there is a technical gap and 100 percent verification is 
almost impossible but that doesnt mean we should not continue 
he said 
richard perle the former senior defense department official 
involved in negotiations went further in a telephone interview from 
washington 
in this case 100 percent nonverification is the fact he 
said you cannot control this 
perle and most experts agreed the only effective measure is to 
stop companies from exporting essential chemicals or helping other 
countries make weapons 
although some poison gases are easy to make they say mass 
production and accurate delivery systems require sophisticated 
assistance 
you cannot let yourself be put off by the hand 
throweruppers one american delegate said of course it is 
hard but the horse is not all the way out of the barn we have to 
do this fast 
us and west german specialists estimated 20 to 25 companies 
regularly sell chemicals to third world countries making deadly 
agents and about another 300 have made sales in recent years they 
said most of the companies were west german 
the only control now is the informal australia suppliers group 
representatives of 19 nations who meet regularly in paris to discuss 
possible dangerous sales by private suppliers 
we have to rely on each country to provide information and take 
action said a delegate who regularly attends those meetings 
our effect is limited 
even with the best of political will it would take two to three 
years to agree on a treaty and 10 more to eliminate chemical 
weapons he said and that is a long time to keep up political 
pressure 
west german authorities say they want to prevent dangerous 
exports but are hampered by lack of an international code 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher addressing the 
conference appealed for a ban on chemical weapons combined with 
mandatory inspections on 48 hours notice in cases of suspicion 
us negotiators first suggested such challenge inspections in 
1984 perle said but subsequent study showed that in a matter of 
days even hours all evidence can be removed 
he added referring to libyan leader col moammar gadhafi even 
if an accord were reached for investigators to leave the moment they 
had a suspicion who in their right mind would believe that someone 
like colonel gadhafi would allow it to happen 
the united states accuses libya of building a chemical weapons 
plant with the help of a west germany company libya says it is a 
pharmaceutical factory 
perle said the west germans should police their own exporters 
they allow their companies to get involved in this cover it up 
and go around lecturing us he said another american delegate 
commented it is not an accident that people as efficient as the 
germans cannot control these people

military authorities have arrested five 
junior officers who urged the military not to meddle in politics and 
charged them with violating the military code by engaging in 
political activity 
dissidents and opposition parties backed the officers who were 
arrested monday and demanded they be exonerated 
the defense ministry said capt lee dongkyun and four colleagues 
from an army engineering battalion near seoul issued a statement 
thursday at the korea national council of churches calling on the 
military to stay out of politics 
they also were charged with accusing some political officers 
of disgracing the militarys image by meddling in political affairs 
in the past 
the officers were charged with taking collective action to 
express their political view conviction could mean two years in 
prison 
south korean military codes strictly ban political activity by 
soldiers 
the military has played a strong role in south korean politics 
since the late president park chunghee then an army general 
staged a coup and toppled a civilian government in 1960 
in 1980 chun doohwan a former army general seized power with 
military backing the expresident has been accused of corruption 
and other abuses since he stepped down last february 
president roh taewoo also a former army general and once close 
ally of chun has promised to end military intervention in politics 
and to introduce complete democracy

a new surgeon generals report on smoking scheduled 
for release this week increases the estimate of smokingrelated 
deaths by 30 percent to 390000 a year the christian science 
monitor reported monday 
the report which comes 25 years after the first surgeon 
generals report on smoking also cites cigarette smoking as the 
cause for nine out of 10 lung cancer deaths among women the 
newspaper said 
other conclusions in the report by dr c everett koop are that 
lung cancer now surpasses breast cancer as the leading cancer killer 
among women 43 chemicals in tobacco are now confirmed as cancer 
causing and smoking is a major cause of cerebral vascular disease 
koops increase in his estimate of smokingrelated deaths from 
300000 annually is due to more accurate accounting rather than more 
lethal cigarettes the monitor said in a release it distributed two 
days before the report was to have been made public 
koop estimates that 50 million americans still smoke the 
newspaper said 
children especially girls are smoking at younger ages the 
monitor quoted the report as saying with 80 percent of smokers born 
since 1935 starting before the age of 21 despite state age 
restrictions on the purchase of cigarettes 
however koop found that in 1987 nearly half of all adults who 
had smoked had quit with the trend particularly true among men 
before the report was issued the tobacco institute began a 
campaign in newspapers around the country in ads headlined 
enough is enough the institute said the results of a nationwide 
poll it commissioned shows that the majority of americans do not 
want an increase in cigarette taxes more smoking bans or the 
elimination of cigarette advertising

astronomers have spotted a star as it devoured its 
companion orb and perhaps solved a celestial mystery 
scientists have long argued about how some superdense stars 
called pulsars could get themselves spinning hundreds of times a 
second the question may now be answered by the discovery of a black 
widow binary a star that like the spider uses its companion and 
then destroys it 
if current theories are correct the star represents a celestial 
missing link a bridge between fastspinning stars that have mates 
and those that do not 
the combination of the star and its companion labeled psr 
195720 in astronomers shorthand was detected last spring by 
andrew fruchter of the carnegie institution in washington 
at a meeting monday of the american astronomical society 
scientists described the significance of the find in understanding 
the life and death of the stars 
the duo is made up of a pulsar an incredibly dense dead star 
that transmits rhythmic beats of radar it is orbited by a much 
larger ordinary star known as a brown dwarf 
astronomers have evidence that the pulsar is transmitting a 
powerful blast of energy that is literally blowing its companion 
away they believe this is the late phase of a long onesided 
relationship between the two in which the pulsar steals matter from 
its mate to boost its speed then turns on it with a blaze of atomic 
particles 
the companion is being destroyed said frederic a rasio of 
cornell university it is constantly losing matter eventually it 
could completely disappear 
the pulsar is one of six known pulsars that spin extremely 
rapidly the newly discovered pair is important because they seem to 
help explain how they get to spin so fast 
it offers a missing link between two classes of objects said 
steve maran of nasas goddard space flight center thats why 
astronomers are so excited 
a pulsar is the collapsed remains of a large star that has 
exploded in a spectacular disaster called a supernova pulsars emit 
no light but broadcast twin rotating beams of radar like 
lighthouses in the sky 
while a pulsar is only 14 miles across its mass is 50 percent 
greater than the sun one teaspoon of pulsar matter weighs billions 
of tons 
most pulsars spin about once a second and are slowing down 
however the newly discovered one spins about 600 times a second 
astronomers theorize that such fastmoving pulsars speed up by 
stealing a stream of matter from a companion star the companion 
spins up the pulsar like a top said fruchter 
however astronomers have noticed while some of these 
fastspinning pulsars have companions others do not 
people wondered if you spin up the pulsar with a companion 
where is the companion said fruchter this may explain that 
the pulsar has evaporated the companion 
in the newly spotted couple the companion is close to the 
pulsar a distance of only 2 times the suns diameter yet it is 
being bombarded with atomic particles 5000 times more intense than 
the sun 
astronomers were able to study the pair because the companion 
regularly eclipses the pulsar the companion revolves around the 
pulsar once every nine hours and each time it blocks out the 
pulsars radar beam for about 50 minutes 
this is the only one mateeating pulsar that we have seen in 
the galaxy said e sterl phinney of the california institute of 
technology but there is the exciting possibility that there will 
be many more

president reagan is leaving office proposing a 
truce in his battle with the united nations and a boost in arms aid 
to friendly nations but tossing the question of nicaraguas contra 
rebels to successor george bush 
reagans foreign policy positions were reflected in the fiscal 
1990 budget plan he sent to congress on monday officials say his 
132 billion foreign aid spending budget should remain relatively 
unchanged by the new bush administration 
consistent with past practice there was no request for contra 
assistance in reagans final budget the president routinely has 
treated that issue separately and this time it will be bushs 
decision 
another difficult problem to be resolved by bush is what to do 
about the bugriddled new us embassy building in moscow 
in his budget plan for next year reagan proposed to give the 
united nations and other international organizations the full us 
share of their budgets for the first time since 1986 
in addition reagan proposed to throw in 46 million as a 
downpayment on the 572 million in cumulative us arrears to 
international organizations 
reagan has held back part of the onefourth us share of un 
financing since 1986 to protest what he charged was the world bodys 
wasteful bureaucracy and antiamerican tone 
the budget document pronounced that pressure successful and said 
the organization has reformed enough to warrant a reward 
of the 148 billion in total foreign aid budget authority reagan 
asked for next year military assistance to us allies comes to 
slightly more than 5 billion about 7 percent over the current 
year as he has in the past reagan sought to convert loan programs 
for military sales into straight grants 
direct economic aid to friendly nations would amount to 33 
billion a slight increase from the current figure 
as usual israel and egypt were the two largest recipients of 
proposed aid israel was earmarked for 18 billion in military aid 
and 12 billion in economic assistance or 3 billion in total 
spending authority 
egypt was proposed to receive 23 billion including 13 
billion for military purposes and 815 million in economic aid 
deputy secretary of state john whitehead said bushs nominee for 
secretary of state james a baker iii had not been consulted about 
the budget made public monday 
but whitehead said that i have no reason to believe there will 
be any sharp differences in the new administration over the reagan 
budget proposals

george p shultz plans to cancel his last 
official trip overseas to a human rights conference in vienna 
unless greece gives ground in a dispute over how much of turkey 
should be covered by an eastwest arms control agreement 
a decision by the secretary of state to stay home also means he 
would miss a 32nd and final meeting with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze 
at the root of this uncertainty is an effort by the greek 
government to expose more turkish territory to conventional arms 
control coverage 
boundaries have been drawn for conventional arms control 
negotiations designed to follow the close of the rights conference 
but greece suspicious of turkey and fretful about cyprus is 
holding out 
everyone else in the 16nation nato alliance has agreed on the 
precise expanse of europe to be covered in the conventional 
stability talks with the sovietled warsaw pact to reduce troops 
tanks and artillery across the european landscape 
but unless a compromise is struck with athens and its mercurial 
prime minister andreas papandreou the vienna conference which 
makes its decisions by consensus cannot close and negotiations 
between nato and the warsaw pact will be put off indefinitely 
the rights conference which opened in november 1986 has 
reviewed compliance with the helsinki agreement the 35nation 
accord signed in the finnish capital in 1975 provided for human 
rights improvements and a lessening of tensions between east and 
west 
the arms control talks are covered by the conference because they 
aim at reducing those tensions 
the end of the vienna conference would set the stage for the 
opening within weeks of the arms control talks between nato and the 
warsaw pact 
the united states and moscow had agreed in 1983 that the area to 
be covered by reductions would stretch from the atlantic to the ural 
mountains in the soviet union but it took years of negotiations to 
define the area more exactly 
nato wanted to include the caucasus mountain region in the soviet 
union the warsaw pact wanted the us air base at incirlik turkey 
covered as well 
turkey meanwhile stretches from europe the focus of the 
negotiations to asia which is not part of the mandate the turks 
are nervous about three of their neighbors iran syria and iraq 
and have tensions with greece over cyprus to the south they would 
like to keep as many men under arms as they can 
the turkish army invaded cyprus in 1974 and still holds about 
onethird of the island where turkey set up a separate state that 
only ankara recognizes as legitimate the greek cypriots who are in 
the majority on the island and have greeces support want the turks 
to withdraw 
in vienna a deal was struck between turkey and the soviet union 
it excluded a large area along turkeys southern coast from the 
negotiations thereby guaranteeing that turkish forces in the area 
would not be part of any reduction nato and the warsaw pact work out 
nato went along with the deal but greece did not papandreous 
government wanted more of turkish territory and southern ports 
included in the arms control negotiations greeces goal is to 
reduce turkish forces facing cyprus 
the united states is not directly involved in the dispute 
weve always felt the working out should be done by the soviets 
and the turks said a us official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
but he stressed that the greeks who initially accepted the 
exclusion of an even larger area of turkey from the negotiations 
were at odds with all of nato 
everybody was taken aback when they changed their position 
the official said 
there is still some time to reach a settlement before shultzs 
scheduled departure for vienna on sunday but the time is running 
short

the war on drugs outranked cutting the deficit 
as president reagan proposed a 14 percent increase in the money 
spent to beat back the tide of illegal narcotics in the united 
states 
i think this clearly gives the message that drug law 
enforcement remains a priority of this government and this 
administration said john c lawn administrator of the drug 
enforcement administration the dea would add 164 agents and more 
than 100 supporting workers if the proposed outlays are approved by 
congress 
the total outlay requested monday for fiscal 1990 starting oct 1 
is more than 5 billion for all the agencies involved in prevention 
treatment and law enforcement that reflects a 633 million increase 
over the 44 billion to be spent in the current fiscal year 
the dea expects to increase arrests by more than 1100 in 1990 
the government said in budget documents 
of the 5 billion proposed for spending on drugrelated matters 
in 1990 some 35 billion would go for law enforcement 915 
million for drug abuse prevention and 633 million for treatment 
programs according to an administration official who has seen the 
documents summarizing the proposed drugrelated budgets of all 
federal agencies 
the us customs service for which reagan is seeking outlays of 
415 million will greatly expand the number of intensive 
examinations of highrisk containerized cargo shipments the 
budget documents said 
meanwhile the coast guard would get an additional 47 million to 
pay for two surveillance aircraft and two landbased balloons to 
help spot drug smugglers according to the documents 
the government said the addition of 940 positions proposed for 
the us attorneys office is expected to increase the number of 
drug prosecutions in 1990 by 3600 cases in addition money has 
been requested to fund 6685 new prison and jail bed spaces as well 
as leasing authority for 1160 more 
fbi director william s sessions noted that the bureaus 
national drug strategy is aligned purely to go after major drug 
trafficking and money laundering organizations and heroin and 
cocaine 
so with us every incremental increase means that we can attack 
that many more organizations said sessions referring to a 
proposed 12 million boost in fbi spending on drugs next year 
when the fbi received 15 million more as a result of the 1986 
drug bill i indicated that i felt that we could attack anywhere 
between 5 and 10 percent more that a current onethird to 40 percent 
of approximately 450 major drug trafficking organizations 
sessions said at a justice department news conference 
we feel that with the allocations we have received that is 
the positions weve received of 128 agents and 159 support well 
be able to make a significant increase and impact on major drug 
trafficking organizations sessions said 
deputy attorney general harold g christensen asked whether the 
proposed increase were enough to convey the administrations 
seriousness about the war on drugs said i think that this 
program given the constraints does address that problem 
the newly created office of drug czar would get 35 million and 
would be able to control up to 136 million in forfeitures of 
property seized in drugrelated cases 
within the law enforcement category interdiction efforts would 
receive the largest allocation 122 billion 
also proposed to receive hefty amounts would be corrections 
facilities including prisons and support for prisoners 7223 
million investigations 7164 million prosecutions 3067 
million and international programs 2383 million 
the departments or agencies that would receive significant 
amounts of money to battle illegal drugs under the budget proposal 
are the alcohol drug abuse and mental health administration 8975 
million coast guard 6469 million federal prisons 6144 
million with authorization for 664 million the drug enforcement 
administration 522 million and the us customs service 415 
million 
other agencies for which substantial amounts for drug work are 
proposed are the education department 3447 million defense 
department 3238 million us marshals service 1484 million 
state department 112 million us attorneys 1122 million and 
the fbi 874 million

the reagan administration is asking congress to 
stop paying the freight for people who ride trains go to small 
towns in planes or get around in bigcity buses 
congress hasnt bought the administrations transportation 
package in the past and the proposed 1990 fiscal outlay of 273 
billion a 207 million cut hasnt been discussed with 
transportation secretarydesignate samuel skinner but outgoing 
secretary jim burnley said monday his budget is by no means 
irrelevant 
burnley said it will form the basis for presidentelect bushs 
spending proposals i expect changes related to this versus 
starting over burnley told a news conference 
burnley stressed the budgets proposed increases for the federal 
aviation administration the coast guard and for safety programs 
the budget also outlines cuts in federal subsidies to amtrak mass 
transit systems highways and littleused airline routes and it 
would scrap the centuryold interstate commerce commission 
none of the budget cut proposals is new and all have failed to 
pass the democratcontrolled congress 
we have asked for reduction or elimination of budget authority 
where we believe federal funding serves only parochial or local 
interests burnley said those who use specialized government 
services for commercial or recreational purposes ought to pay for 
them 
under the proposals 76 percent of federal transportation costs 
in 1990 would be paid for with fees or taxes paid by people who use 
the subsidized air rail or highway transportation systems said 
burnley when reagan took office in 1981 45 percent was covered by 
such fees according to the presidents budget proposal 
the proposed budget includes 66 billion for the federal 
aviation administration a 16 percent increase over the fiscal 1989 
budget 
it is absolutely critical that congress fully fund this 
request burnley said but he noted that congress had rejected 
similar proposals in the past to cut transportation subsidies in 
favor of building up the faas air traffic control system 
the administration proposes 305 billion in outlay for the coast 
guard a 28 percent increase coast guard vice commandant clyde t 
lusk said the coast guard has been shortchanged in past budgets and 
has had to cut back other operations in favor of a congressional 
mandate to battle illegal drugs traffic 
one new proposal was for a new icebreaker after two of four used 
by the coast guard were taken out of service because of increasing 
maintenance costs 
highway subsidies would total 124 billion compared with 134 
billion projected for 1989 
the administration says in the budget proposal that funding of 
mass transit systems in a few large cities is not an appropriate 
federal role and recommends that gasoline tax receipts be 
redistributed to benefit all states and urban areas and that nearly 
all discretionary grants which total more than 2 billion for 1989 
be eliminated 
the administration has wanted for several years to sell amtrak 
but congress has not agreed the budget would dissolve the national 
passenger rail systems 584 million appropriation burnley said in 
some cases it would be cheaper for the government to buy travelers 
airline tickets rather than subsidize longdistance amtrak trips 
another proposal would cut 25 million in subsidies that go to 
airlines flying routes that would otherwise not be served because 
they are unprofitable faa administrator allan mcartor said many of 
the routes could be served by airports in other communities nearly 
threefourths of the subsidized routes average 10 or fewer 
passengers per day according to the administration

here is a chronology of the supreme courts 
major abortion decisions 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs wade the court for the first time 
legalized abortion nationwide the court in an opinion by justice 
harry a blackmun based its 72 ruling on a womans constitutional 
right to privacy 
the court said a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
it said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the 
second trimester only to protect the womans health and may take 
steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester state 
authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not 
made absolute however 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs bolton the court that same day struck 
down by a 72 vote restrictions on facilities that could be used to 
perform abortions the decision gave rise to a new kind of medical 
facility the abortion clinic 
july 1 1976 in planned parenthood vs danforth the court by 
a 63 vote said states cannot give husbands veto power over their 
pregnant wives decision to abort their pregnancies by a separate 
54 vote the court said that neither can parents of minor unwed 
girls be given an absolute veto 
june 20 1977 in maher vs roe the court 63 ruled that 
states have no legal obligation to pay for nontherapeutic 
abortions 
jan 9 1979 in colautti vs franklin reached by a 63 vote 
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion 
in determining the timing of fetal viability when a fetus can 
live outside the mothers womb the justices said states may seek to 
protect a fetus that has reached viability but that determination is 
up to doctors not courts or legislatures 
july 2 1979 in bellotti vs baird the court by an 81 vote 
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976 it implied that 
states may be able to require a pregnant unmarried minor to obtain 
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides an 
alternative procedure to parental approval such as letting the 
minor seek a state judges approval instead 
june 30 1980 in harris vs mcrae the socalled hyde amendment 
was upheld by a 54 vote the court ruled that the federal 
government and individual states are under no legal obligation to 
pay for even medically necessary abortions sought by women on 
welfare 
march 23 1981 in hl vs matheson the court ruled by a 63 
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some young girls 
those still dependent on their parents and too immature to 
decide such matters for themselves to try to inform parents before 
performing a requested abortion 
june 15 1983 in three decisions called city of akron vs akron 
center for reproductive health planned parenthood of kansas city 
vs ashcroft and simopolous vs virginia the court 63 said 
states and local communities may not require all abortions for women 
more than three months pregnant to be performed in a hospital 
the court also struck down regulations that among other things 
imposed a 24hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion 
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell 
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a human life 
june 11 1986 in thornburgh vs american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists the court voted 54 to strike down 
pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it 
invalidated in 1983 the court said states may not require doctors 
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about 
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and 
childbirth 
the court also struck down requirements that doctors performing 
thirdtrimester abortions which are rare use procedures least 
risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the womb and that two 
doctors always be present for abortions performed in the third 
trimester also invalidated was a regulation requiring doctors to 
make a record which could become available to the public of every 
abortion they perform 
dec 14 1987 in hartigan vs zbaraz the court split 44 the 
effect was to invalidate an illinois law that could have made 
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teenagers 
the decision was announced two months before justice anthony m 
kennedy joined the court and replaced justice lewis f powell who 
had retired the previous june

when presidentelect bush sits down later this 
week with his cabinet choices the question is whether there will be 
an empty seat at the table 
a top adviser conceded monday that the search for a secretary of 
energy has proven more difficult than the transition team 
anticipated 
craig fuller vice presidential chief of staff as well as 
codirector of the transition said it was taking longer to fill the 
job because there are real technical difficulties and its fraught 
with a lot of political problems 
one of the political problems was the furor that knocked james 
schlesinger an early choice for the post out of contention 
fuller acknowledged that gov william clements of texas among 
others strongly opposed the choice of schlesinger defense 
secretary under president ford and energy secretary under president 
carter schlesinger and clements became bitter enemies when they 
were the two top pentagon officials 
but fuller insisted that clements did not cause anybody to be 
put on or be taken off the list by himself 
a new name circulating for the energy post was harold brown 
defense secretary under carter 
fuller said bush planned to meet with his cabinet designees on 
thursday the presidentelect has named people to head 13 of the 14 
cabinet departments 
one top adviser who turned down an offer of a white house job 
after weeks of agonizing was pollster robert m teeter who informed 
bush that for personal and family considerations he preferred to 
remain in michigan 
in a statement announcing his decision teeter said he had 
planned to return home after the presidential campaign although the 
offer of a white house post presented me with a very difficult 
decision teeter said i have decided to stand by my original 
decision 
fuller said teeter who recently sold his share in the polling 
firm market opinion research would be available for 
consultation on strategic planning message and themes 
fuller who had hoped to be named white house chief of staff 
also is returning to private business he and teeter have been 
codirectors of the transition 
the chief of staff job went to new hampshire gov john sununu 
bush spoke to political supporters on monday and urged them to 
act as talent scouts to fill thousands of administration jobs 
we are staffing a mandate bush told the presidential 
personnel advisory committee that mandate isnt a set of issues 
and policies picked out of a hat or chosen at random since nov 8 
its a program weve run a winning national campaign on a 
program ratified in the light of intense national examination 
bush said that talk about an issueless mandateless election 
is unfair to the intelligence of the american people 
voters had strong opinions on the most important issues facing 
this country in the years to come he said where they agreed 
more with my opponent on the issues he won their votes and where 
they agreed more with me i did 
he went on to point out he defeated democrat michael dukakis by 
nearly 7 million votes while carrying 40 states 
he said he was looking for men and women republicans and 
democrats alike who understand what we understand about election 
day 1988 
bush said he was particularly concerned that our search reach 
regions the men and women in america who are too often overlooked 
in such efforts americans who lets be frank our party has 
perhaps done too little to include in the past 
i want them too he said black americans hispanic 
americans asian americans disabled americans not as tokens but 
as talent not for show but for strength of character and for 
skill

president reagan wants congress set aside money 
for the next wave of military weaponry and increase spending on star 
wars in a defense budget with little chance of winning approval as 
it is say congressional leaders and defense experts 
overall the twoyear budget the reagan administration released 
monday proposes an increase in defense spending by 2 percent above 
the rate of inflation with 3152 billion in budget authority for 
1990 and 33089 billion for 1991 
outlays the money to be spent during the 12 months of fiscal 
1990 total 303 billion including 92 billion for energy 
department nuclear weapons and research programs outlays for fiscal 
1991 amount to 3144 billion 
presidentelect bush is expected to amend the reagan budget after 
he takes office jan 20 the vice president has talked about a 
budget request that matches inflation instead of providing real 
growth 
if bush fails to change the budget congress will surely do so 
for the past four years congress has cut defense spending increases 
to levels below the rate of inflation the reaction from legislators 
to the latest reagan budget indicates that this time will be no 
different 
we know one thing about this defense budget it isnt likely to 
be approved the way it was submitted with an increase of 2 percent 
over and above inflation said rep les aspin dwis chairman of 
the house armed services committee in a statement he issued friday 
what we need to know before congress can go to work is what 
george bush wants in his defense budget i am eager not only to read 
the new presidents lips on defense but also his first defense 
message to congress aspin said 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the senate 
armed services committee said the budget is a good foundation 
but reserved comment until further study 
among the requests likely to be changed by congress or bush are 
946 million in spending authority in 1990 and 1243 million the 
next year for research on a new navy antisatellite weapon and 
elimination of a proposed singlewarhead intercontinental ballistic 
missile the midgetman 
the budget also calls for moving into production the new b2 
stealth bomber the trident ii submarinelaunched nuclear missile 
and a railmobile version of the giant mx intercontinental ballistic 
missile 
what worries me is the hasty rush to the next generation of 
military hardware said gordon adams director of the center on 
budget and policy priorities an independent analysis group 
congress is likely to question a budget that shaves the edges 
of readiness and sustainability adams said 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said the administration made 
some hard choices in either canceling or delaying two dozen 
programs but the budget will not weaken the nations ability to 
defend itself 
the moderate 2 percent real growth rate proposed in this budget 
is an attempt to steer a sustainable and fiscally responsible course 
that allows the united states to maintain its current force 
structure and to acquire the weapons systems necessary to ensure our 
national security he said 
the budget includes an increase in spending authority on the 
strategic defense initiative commonly known as star wars from 41 
billion in 1989 to 59 billion in 1990 and 7 billion in 1991 
bush has said he supports star wars research but it remains 
unclear how quickly he will pursue the program 
star wars is a softball for cutting according to adams who 
believes the inflated total will give bush a chance to trim the 
budget by about 2 billion 
sdi is destined to be no more than a research program said 
john steinbruner director of foreign policy studies at the 
brookings institution a liberal think tank 
the budget plan also requests 500 million to begin shutting down 
unneeded military bases reduce the defense departments civilian 
workforce of 11 million by 5000 people and shift more than two 
dozen existing weapon programs toward multiyear contracts 
meanwhile reagan asked congress for a small increase in funding 
for veterans medical care and pensions as he proposed outlays of 
299 billion for the new department of veterans affairs 
outlays for the veterans administration which provided benefits

with less than two weeks to go as one of the 
longestserving cabinet officers in american history secretary of 
state george p shultz offered a rare glimpse of some of the things 
that try his patience 
it was a valedictory speech of sorts delivered monday night on 
the occasion of a farewell event for shultz sponsored by a 
private group called the citizens network for foreign affairs 
shultz touched only peripherally on foreign affairs in the 
speech focusing instead on the things that trouble him in 
washington where he has lived off and on for 30 years more than 11 
in the cabinets of presidents reagan and nixon 
some of shultzs pet peeves 
people who say that america is in decline these are false 
prophets shultz said contending that great powers that have 
declined were imperial absolutist or dominated by traditionbound 
classes america he said is none of these because american 
democracy holds the potential for resilience and rejuvenation 
lie detector tests within an office or department or any 
organization shultz said putting trust in people will produce 
trustworthy people the foremost of many reasons against the 
widespread use of lie detector tests management through fear and 
intimidation he said is not the way to promote honesty and 
protect security 
people who leak and lie and dont know when to give up theres 
nothing wrong with fighting before a decision is reached he said 
but leaks and lies subvert honest discourse once decisions are 
made they should be carried out like it or not 
legislative sabotage as shultz described it dialogue between 
the branches cannot yield productive results when no matter what 
the apparent agreement any faction any staffer any subcommittee 
any member of congress can delay and impede even the will of the 
majority 
bureaucratic encroachment the defense department shouldnt tell 
the state department how to negotiate with the soviets and the cia 
shouldnt find policy more fun than intelligence and objective 
analysis because when it does its intelligence and analytic 
products have no credibility 
shultz was too polite to name names but his comments on the cia 
seemed aimed primarily at agencys late director william casey who 
was better known within the state department establishment for his 
advocacy of hardline policies than for disinterested analysis 
during his six years at the cia 
as for the pentagons perceived encroachment on states turf 
there seems little doubt that shultz had in mind former defense 
secretary caspar weinberger with whom shultz had many a runin 
concerning those lawmakers who shultz says dont play fair none 
gave him a harder time than sen jesse helms rnc who 
singlehandedly was able to hold up confirmation of state department 
appointees not to his liking for months at a time 
casey weinberger and helms all are known for their conservative 
views but shultz took on some liberals as well he expressed 
satisfaction that all the candidates who advocated protectionism 
mostly democratic presidential aspirants last year were soundly 
defeated 
and he also seemed to have liberals in mind when he attacked the 
declinists people who espouse an american withdrawal from the 
world in order to regain economic or moral security 
they play to the darker side to the idea that america no 
longer has anything to give the world shultz said 
despite the many disappointments and discouraging times shultz 
encountered he seems satisfied that most change has been for the 
better since he first came here 
on the whole the facts suggest optimism especially optimism 
about americas future he said i find that while some things 
are worse much is better

the labor department responding to concerns by 
health care workers about contracting aids and other bloodborne 
diseases is proposing new safety regulations requiring that all 
blood and body fluids be handled as if they were infected 
the proposal would affect the 53 million health care workers at 
620000 worksites who have frequent contact with potentially 
infectious materials the labor department said 
any standard should meet the critical needs by giving health 
care workers the protection they want and have every right to 
expect labor secretary ann mclaughlin said monday in announcing 
the proposal it can literally be a lifesaver 
a department spokesman said a draft of the proposed regulations 
would be published in the federal register in about two weeks 
public comment will be accepted before the department decides on 
final language 
current workersafety laws in general require employers to 
provide safety equipment and worker education when there are 
potential hazards but there are no specific regulations concerning 
bloodborne diseases 
the occupational health and safety administration an agency 
within the labor department promised last year to draft the 
regulations as part of a program to address concerns raised by 
health care workers 
mclaughlin said the proposed regulation would require the use of 
safety equipment worker training in handling infected blood and 
body fluids and other specific precautions tailored to the specific 
worksite 
about 12000 health care workers are infected with hepatitisb 
each year resulting in approximately 200 deaths annually according 
to government figures 
the department had no specific figures on the number of health 
care workers who contract aids because of their jobs 
where diseases like aids and hepatitisb are concerned our 
health care professionals are truly on the front line mclaughlin 
said theyre working to contain the problem we must ensure that 
they are not victims of it

the prosecution in the trial of oliver north 
says it has added to its witness list the names of a former 
congressman whom north is accused of misleading over aid to the 
contras and beer magnate joseph coors who says he gave the 
nicaraguan rebels 65000 after meeting with north 
also on the revised list of prosecution witnesses against the 
fired national security council aide is william langton president 
of southern air transport a former cia proprietary involved in both 
the contra resupply operation and the administrations secret arms 
sales to iran 
the new names were on a list that actually contains fewer names 
40 rather than 87 reflecting a motion by independent counsel 
lawrence walsh to dismiss the two central charges of conspiracy and 
theft against north 
but at a hearing monday us district judge gerhard gesell said 
he wouldnt dismiss the charges until attorney general dick 
thornburgh explains the administrations refusal to declassify 
information gesell says must be released for north to get a fair 
trial 
an interagency intelligence group in the reagan administration 
has declined to declassify certain material in 300 prosecution 
exhibits walsh wants to present at trial which forced walsh to seek 
dismissal of the two central charges twelve charges remain 
walsh said he is quite sure he can get an affidavit from 
thornburgh and gesell said he hopes to receive it by thursday 
justice department spokesman loye miller declined to comment on 
whether thornburgh would supply an affidavit but a department 
source speaking on condition of anonymity said he assumed the 
attorney general probably will submit one 
former us rep michael barnes newly on the prosecution witness 
list in mid1985 asked the nsc whether the staff was assisting the 
contras and requested all information pertaining to contact between 
north and rebel leaders 
north prepared thennational security adviser robert mcfarlanes 
written response to the democrat from maryland according to the two 
counts in the indictment against north that charge him with 
obstruction of congress and making false statements 
the response to barnes said that none of us has solicited 
funds facilitated contacts for prospective potential donors or 
otherwise organized or coordinated the military or paramilitary 
efforts of the resistance 
barnes at the time was chairman of the house subcommittee on 
western hemisphere affairs in congressional testimony on the 
irancontra affair in 1987 north testified that i probably 
helped draft mcfarlanes response to barnes but that i dont 
recall specifically there were a number of these responses to 
congressional inquiries 
the letter to barnes accounted for one of the misdemeanor charges 
of withholding information from congress to which mcfarlane pleaded 
guilty last march in the irancontra affair 
coors made the 65000 contribution to the contras after meeting 
with north in 1985 less than three months before the letter to 
barnes from the nsc 
coors has said he met in june 1985 with thencia director william 
casey who referred coors to north when coors expressed an interest 
in giving money to the contras at a time when us military aid to 
them was banned by congress 
at a meeting in caseys office in the old executive office 
building next to the white house the cia director said ollie 
north is the guy to see coors said in 1987 in congressional 
testimony on the irancontra affair 
coors then walked over to see north who said the contras needed 
a maule aircraft and gave coors the number of a swiss bank account 
where he could send his contribution 
the account number was for lake resources inc part of the maze 
of companies which richard secord and albert hakim who also are 
charged in the irancontra case used to funnel money to the contras 
from the administrations arms sales to iran as well as from a 
private fundraising network 
coors arranged for 65000 to be sent to the lake resources 
account and then contacted north saying he had made it clear he 
wanted to give humanitarian nonmilitary aid to the contras coors 
said north indicated that this plane would fit into that pattern 
north denied in 1987 congressional testimony that he had 
solicited the funds saying instead that coors offered the money 
and i told him where to send it

us commercial and private airplane accidents 
killed 875 people in 1988 the lowest number this decade with small 
planes showing the most improvement government figures indicate 
the decrease shown in preliminary figures from the national 
transportation safety board came despite steady increases in the 
number of hours and miles flown and a 30 percent increase in the 
number of commercial flights over the last decade 
the most dramatic reduction was in the number of people killed in 
small private plane accidents down from 1556 in 1978 to 782 
flying hours for small planes have decreased about 20 percent since 
then according to the federal aviation administration 
the next lowest number of fatalities came in 1986 when 1034 
people died in commercial and private airplane accidents the ntsb 
figures do not include military crashes 
the 875 total fatalities in 1988 do not include the 270 people 
killed when pan am flight 103 exploded over lockerbie scotland 
dec 21 because investigators have determined it was not an 
accident but an act of sabotage 
they do include two other crashes that received widespread 
attention a delta airlines boeing 727 crashed during takeoff aug 
31 near dallas killing 14 people and a flight attendant was killed 
when an aloha airlines boeing 737 lost the top of its fuselage 
before landing near maui hawaii on april 28 
the board said the accident rate for scheduled airline flights 
was 0389 per 100000 departures which means that roughly one out 
of every 257000 flights resulted in an accident 
the rate for fatal accidents last year was one in 36 million 
flights the safety board tallied 72 million us airline 
departures in 1988 
major airliner accidents dropped to 29 from the 13year high of 
33 in 1987 the board said 
twentyone people were killed in 20 commuter airline crashes last 
year down from 61 fatalities and 34 accidents in 1987 the accident 
rate for commuter flights dropped by nearly half from 1987 
in general aviation which includes all small private plane 
flights the number of accidents dropped to 2332 from 2471 in 
1987 the board said it was a record low since it began collecting 
statistics and the sixth consecutive annual decrease in the accident 
rate 
the total of 438 accidents with one or more fatality in 1988 was 
three more than in 1987 
the accident rate for small planes which is reported as 
accidents per 100000 flight hours decreased from 846 to 795 the 
board estimates that small planes flew 2935 million hours in 1988 
charter airline flights had only one accident an incident in 
which no one was killed for their best record since 1981 when there 
was also one accident the accident rate of 0346 per 100000 
departures last year was more than five times better than in 1987 
small aircraft operating nonscheduled services known as air 
taxis had 97 accidents two fewer than in 1987 fifty seven people 
died seven fewer than a year earlier 
the total killed in all types of airplane crashes was at a high 
of 1919 in 1978 the first year included in the current statistics

americans let their plastic do the purchasing 
in november running up 45 billion more in consumer debt than they 
paid off as the holiday season approached the government reports 
the federal reserve board said monday that the november increase 
followed a jump of 39 billion in october and a tiny 2 million 
rise in september 
novembers increase represented an 82 percent rise in the annual 
rate of credit growth up from a 72 percent pace in october the 
november gain was pinned on brisk growth in the category of debt 
that includes credit cards while auto loans grew at about the same 
rate as in october 
its just another piece of evidence that consumers started to 
spend more for the holiday season said michael evans head of a 
washington consulting firm consumers became more optimistic about 
spending and about borrowing for the moment consumers are 
relatively satisfied with the way the economy is going 
evans noted that retail sales took off in the days after 
thanksgiving and that retailers reported strong sales continuing 
into december 
consumer spending is watched as a barometer of economic health 
because it accounts for twothirds of the gross national product 
revolving debt the category that includes credit cards 
increased by 31 billion during november a 203 percent annual 
rate of growth that followed a 26 billion increase during 
october or a 175 percent rate of growth 
auto loans rose by 14 billion during november a 58 percent 
annual rate of growth after having risen by 13 billion during 
october 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate decreased 
by 49 million in november a 04 percent drop in the annual rate 
after falling by 50 million a month earlier and by 158 million in 
september 
loans for mobile homes increased by 73 million or a 34 percent 
annual rate of growth in november after rising by 30 million in 
october 
overall total consumer debt reached a seasonally adjusted 6617 
billion in november up 87 percent from a year earlier

in the last years of his abbreviated life 
ecologist francisco chico mendes may well have spent more time 
in boardrooms and conference halls than in the amazon rainforest he 
died defending 
as president of the xapuri rubber tappers union and as a senior 
environmental consultant for the world bank and other institutions 
mendes was often far from his beloved rubber groves in this western 
amazon town 
to his friends however he confided a desire to return to the 
virgin rainforest where he was born and raised 
chico was a great tapper always five or six trees ahead of the 
rest of us said miguel teixeira mendes francisco mendes cousin 
and himself a rubber tapper he loved the jungle and always talked 
about coming back some day but his political duties were too 
great 
the virgin forest provides tappers with food and livelihood the 
giant rubber and brazil nut trees only produce in the uncut 
wilderness the abundant deer monkeys birds and other game supply 
meat 
most tappers live in wooden cabins set in clearings among stands 
of trees more than 100 feet high 
as parrots and monkeys screech from branches overhead the tapper 
daily works his trails of rubber trees he collects the white 
latex or milk in hollow brazil nut pods about the size of a 
grapefruit 
each tapper has two or three trails each about 11 miles long 
with 250 to 300 trees he sells the raw latex to a middleman for 
about 40 cents a pound and earns about 180 a month three times 
brazils minimum wage harvesting of brazil nuts also is lucrative 
though it only lasts two months 
rubber tapping is a mans work a real man i know but a 
tapper who works hard can thumb his nose at a lot of city folks 
said miguel mendes smiling 
tappers say the problem is the encroachment of cattle breeders 
and land speculators who cut down the forest and drive the tappers 
out francisco mendes died opposing them one week after his 44th 
birthday he was killed by a shotgun blast on the night of dec 22 
a ranchers son confessed to the murder 
this week rubber tapper luiz de oliveira surveyed the landscape 
here of bare slopes and black burned stumps 
when i came here 35 years ago this all was untouched forest 
he said our fight is to save what we still have

president reagan in his final report on the 
state of the economy took credit today for an unparalleled period 
of peacetime prosperity and said a tax increase could undermine 
his legacy 
reagans eighth and final economic report says that the 
stagflation high inflation coupled with slow growth of the 1970s 
has given way during his tenure to the longest economic expansion 
since the 1960s and the lowest unemployment rate in 14 years 
today it is as if the world were born anew the president 
said in a ninepage introduction to this years report prepared by 
his council of economic advisers 
by reducing taxes and regulatory bureaucracy we have unleashed 
the creative genius of ordinary americans and ushered in an 
unparalleled period of peacetime prosperity he said 
although the report credited the administration with favorable 
economic developments it sought to minimize the importance of the 
us budget and trade deficits and it placed the blame for the worst 
year for bank and savings institution failures elsewhere 
also democrats point out that reagans military buildup had the 
effect of running the economy on a wartime footing his deficit 
spending they say had the effect of creating prosperity now at the 
expense of future generations who will have to pay the bill 
beryl w sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser said 
the new report was aimed at placing the reagan record in the context 
of postworld war ii economic history he said reagan was the first 
president since harry truman to leave office with both lower 
unemployment and inflation rates than when he took office 
unemployment dropped from 76 percent in 1981 to 55 percent in 1988 
and consumer price inflation from 103 percent to 44 percent 
after suffering a sharp recession in the beginning of reagans 
term the country in october finished its sixth year of economic 
expansion a record for peacetime but short of the nearly nineyear 
expansion during the vietnam war 
the length strength and resilience of this expansion are ample 
testimony to the wisdom of the policies that we have pursued 
reagan said 
the presidents report said the budget deficit as a percentage 
of the economy as measured by the gross national product has shrunk 
from 52 percent in 1985 to 32 percent in 1988 and reagan said 
that attempting to shrink the deficit with tax increases would sap 
economic growth 
the large budget deficit that this nation faces is not a result 
of too few taxes but too much spending all that is required to 
reduce the deficit is to halt or moderate the increase in 
expenditures reagan said 
sprinkel in projections in the report predicted continued gnp 
growth of 32 percent this year and at least that each year through 
1994 but he said that was predicated on the assumption that taxes 
would not rise and that the federal reserve board which has sought 
growth of 2 percent to 25 percent as a means of holding inflation 
in check would keep interest rates low enough to foster growth 
the report said monetary policy so far has produced solid 
results but it criticized the central bank for apparently basing 
its policy on shortterm economic developments rather on longterm 
goals for the growth of the money supply 
the report also said in effect that the us trade deficit 
which hit a record 170 billion in 1987 was caused by the strength 
of the american economy low inflation and high growth encouraged 
foreign investors to drive up the value of the dollar that in turn 
made foreign goods cheaper in the united states and american goods 
more expensive overseas 
it said the us status as a net debtor has been greatly 
exaggerated in new accounts partly because most measures 
underestimate the value of us holdings abroad foreigners hold 
only about 31 percent of us assets it said 
banks and sampl failures which in 1988 reached postdepression 
records of 221 and 217 respectively stem from improper incentives 
in the regulatory system the report said it recommended reducing 
federal deposit insurance from its current level of 100000 per 
account to encourage depositors and thus bank and sampl owners to be 
more cautious 
it said if reforms recommended in 1984 by a panel chaired by vice 
president george bush had been adopted current bank and sampl 
problems would probably be much more manageable 
congress ignoring one the recommendations lowered the amount of 
investment money or capital sampl owners have to place behind public 
deposits it said

the army corps of engineers is seeking 855 
million to start 10 new water projects from california to new york 
undaunted by a rare rebuff from congress last year during a budget 
squeeze 
the interior departments bureau of reclamation meanwhile plans 
to devote 60 percent of its proposed 655 million in construction 
money to just three projects in arizona utah and california 
for the third straight year the reclamation bureau isnt 
planning any new project starts in line with its transition from 
building dams and canals to becoming a water management agency 
last year congress refused to give money to the corps for the 
six new starts it proposed in the reagan administrations proposed 
budget for fiscal 1990 sent to congress on monday those six were 
expanded to 10 projects 
new starts on water projects have been declining because of tight 
budgets and a 1986 law that requires affected communities to put up 
their share of funds in the beginning 
overall spending by the corps would total 32 billion during 
the 12 months starting next oct 1 down slightly from the current 
326 billion 
its construction spending would total 122 billion up 89 
percent from 112 billion 
the bureau planned to spend 946 million down 14 percent from 
11 billion this year its construction spending would be 655 
million down 72 percent from 706 million this year with the 
majority of funds going toward the central arizona project the 
central utah project and the central valley project in california 
several projects were slated for only minimal spending said 
interior undersecretary earl geljde because we didnt have enough 
money to put them on an efficient construction schedule and were 
better off to not start them 
the bureau requested 37 million to buy equipment for the 
animasla plata project in colorado and new mexico and 875 million 
to wind up construction at the garrison diversion unit in north 
dakota but neither project will get a major push 
following are the 10 new army corps of engineer projects dollar

the president who rode to the white house on an 
antiwashington sentiment promising to balance the books while 
shaking things up is leaving office after the largest credit binge 
in the nations history 
the final budget submitted monday by president reagan symbolizes 
what he admits is one of his biggest disappointments and possibly 
the biggest failure of his eight years the legacy of red ink he 
leaves behind 
the federal budget reagan sent to congress his last as 
president was like all the others that bore his name it was far 
out of balance under even the rosiest of economic forecasts 
reagan said in delivering it that by getting the deficit under 
100 billion in the 1990 fiscal year his budget would show that 
gradual elimination of the deficit is possible without raising 
taxes 
at his inaugural eight years ago reagan declared you and i 
as individuals can by borrowing live beyond our means but for 
only a limited period of time why then should we think that 
collectively as a nation were not bound by the same limitation 
in one of his farewell addresses last month reagan spoke of the 
deficits with regret one of my great disappointments as i leave 
office is that the federal budget itself is not yet balanced 
reagan said 
he leaves to his successor george bush that legacy of deficits 
one that together with his notax increase pledge severely limits 
the new presidents options 
as democrats frequently point out the federal debt under reagan 
grew more than under all the presidents before him from under 1 
trillion when he took office in 1981 the national debt has risen to 
more than 26 trillion 
many point to the 25 percent tax cut reagan fought for and won 
early in his first term reducing the governments revenue and 
increasing pressure to borrow 
reagans first budget director david stockman left office a 
vocal critic of the administrations tax and budget policies in his 
book the triumph of politics stockman called the result the 
reagan eras fabulous free lunch and spoke of frustration in 
trying to get the president to confront the deficit problem 
the administrations version however is that the tax cuts 
stimulated the economy and generated growth and that congress is 
to blame for failing to carry out all the cuts in spending proposed 
by reagan in his budget reagan also blamed the 19811982 recession 
for lowering government revenues 
in his farewell speech reagan blamed a new iron triangle 
giving a new definition to a term often used in washington to 
represent the triad of special interests congress and the 
bureaucracy that supports various programs reagans version removed 
the bureaucracy for which as president he was responsible and 
replaced it with the press for what he said was uncritical 
reporting of the special interests views 
but none of his cuts would have been enough to balance the budget 
reagan has never proposed a balanced budget 
among the projections of his 1990 budget document are a balanced 
budget by the year 1993 though many doubt it possible even so 
thats 10 years later than candidate reagan was saying in 1980 
the target began slipping even before he was sworn in in his 
first budget he predicted a surplus by 1984 instead of a surplus 
the government suffered a deficit of 1853 billion that year 
it got worse peaking at 221 billion worth of red ink in fiscal 
1986 its been lower since but the deficit has not been on a 
downward trend it grew in 1988 over 1987 and is estimated to do so 
at the end of fiscal 1989 too 
while he succeeded in trimming many domestic programs reagan 
ruled out targeting the major middleclass government benefit 
programs including social security 
with the increase in debt has come the increased burden of 
interest payments in the new budget 15 cents of every dollar in 
government spending will go to pay interest on the debt 
jeff faux president of the economic policy institute a 
laborbacked thinktank called reagans final budget sad 
testament to eight years of borrowing from our children 
but stephen hess government analyst at the brookings 
institution said the budget deficits may not be a harmful legacy 
im prepared to say it may not be so big a deal hess said 
the man left us at peace literally and employed and with low 
inflation and its going to take some time to figure out how big a 
price we paid for that but that is pretty exceptional

poor old amtrak even in ronald reagans last 
shot his proposed budget for fiscal 1990 the president is trying 
to kill off the rail passenger service as a waste of taxpayers 
money 
reagan complains that the government pays 30 to amtrak every 
time a passenger gets on a train to anywhere without that federal 
subsidy of about 600 million a year amtrak officials say the 
entire rail network would have to be scrapped the reagan 
administration favors a regional system instead 
if reagans budget plan succeeds this time amtraks demise would 
be one of many ways that americans would get less from the 
government or pay more for what they get 
on many routes it would be cheaper for the federal government 
to buy bus or plane tickets for amtrak passengers rather than 
subsidize train travel says the administration urging congress 
to just say no to amtrak 
amtrak is not economically viable the budget message said 
monday about 85 percent of its routes recover less than 57 cents 
on the dollar 
proposed saving 515 million a year 
another costcutting measure would require taxpayers to pay 50 
cents or 1 to call what currently is the governments tollfree 
number for help with their income tax returns 
the charge would be called a user fee 
under reagans budget plan for next year the government would 
charge more or provide less to boat owners veterans with slightly 
disabling war injuries commuters air travelers federal retirees 
doctors people who lose their jobs to foreign competition and 
middleclass youngsters who eat subsidized lunches at school 
reagan noted that even students at high tuition private schools 
can get meal subsidies he proposed eliminating all 40cent 
lunches for children from families well above the poverty line the 
price of a lunch would rise about 26 cents unless state or local 
school districts made up the difference 
the president wants to save 12 billion over the next five years 
by ending trade adjustment assistance which provides weekly 
cash benefits training job search aid and relocation allowances to 
those who lose their jobs because of imports 
it is inequitable for the federal government to provide a 
special program to benefit one group of unemployed workers or 
uncompetitive firms the budget message says 
reagan also would cut down on the 8000 map makers working in 
more than 20 federal departments and agencies at a cost of more than 
1 billion a year the administration will see whether its cheaper 
to contract some of the work out 
for the homeless reagan proposes a program under which the 
government would buy enough food to supply food kitchens and food 
banks with 256 million meals 
he called for an aggressive prison building program to ease 
overcrowding but would eliminate subsidies that help operate 
subways and buses for commuters and a program that assures air 
service for many small communities 
military veterans with serviceconnected injuries that give them 
disability ratings of 20 percent or less would have to look to 
private health insurance for their care in veterans hospitals 
under reagans plan the government now pays for that care 
doctors would have to accept smaller fees for treating the 
elderly under medicare and the poor under medicaid getting 
especially less would be radiologists anesthesiologists and 
surgeons 
homebuyers would see a nearly fourfold increase to 38 percent 
in the current 1 percent fee for va mortgage loan guarantees

the reagan administration is proposing a 
halfbillion dollar increase in spending next year to begin cleaning 
up and modernizing the nations nuclear bomb factories lately 
crippled by environmental and safety problems 
the proposal contained in the administrations proposed fiscal 
1990 budget for the department of energy was called a first step 
toward revitalizing the governments nuclear weapons production 
complex which is administered by the department 
the process is in place to address this problem in the long 
term said joseph f salgado the deputy energy secretary he said 
priorities were being developed for a cleanup and modernization 
effort that could last 50 years or more 
cleanup work is expected to cost at least 81 billion over the 
next 20 years 
the department in the budget proposals unveiled monday said it 
would seek 18 billion over the next five years to build new atomic 
arms plants and to improve the existing weapons complex of 17 major 
factories and laboratories in 12 states 
for the 1990 budget year which begins next oct 1 president 
reagan asked congress to approve spending of 3 billion for 
modernization environmental and safety programs at the weapons 
plants that is 478 million more than is being spent on such 
programs in the current fiscal year 
the proposal quickly drew criticism from sen john glenn dohio 
who likened the environmental threat posed by pollution from the 
nuclear production facilities including a uranium processing plant 
at fernald ohio to a time bomb 
the amount proposed by reagan for cleaning up the plants in 1990 
is just a token of what is needed glenn said at a capitol hill 
news conference the reality is that these sites are an 
environmental time bomb its still ticking 
glenn said he hoped the incoming bush administration would ask 
congress for much more money as much as 4 billion a year for 
cleanup and modernization 
energy department officials gave no comprehensive breakdown of 
proposed spending on individual nuclear weapons manufacturing 
plants although they said the budget proposal included a request 
for 55 million to clean up the fernald plant that compares with 
50 million expected to be spent in the current budget year 
also the department asked for 54 million for cleanup at the 
hanford nuclear reservation near richland wash an increase of 26 
million from this year and 56 million for the savannah river plant 
near aiken sc up from 19 million 
the department also requested 303 million to begin developing 
two new nuclear weapons facilities to replace three 35yearold 
reactors at savannah river which have been shut down since last 
april for safety and technical reasons the savannah river facility 
is the nations only source of tritium a highly perishable gas used 
to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads 
the department has estimated the cost of building the two new 
reactors at 68 billion both would be expected to be in operation 
by the turn of the century 
among other spending proposals in the overall 15 billion energy 
budget are 
145 million for research on energy conservation down from 156 
million in the current budget year 
383 million for fossil energy research and development 
including projects aimed at finding ways of getting more crude oil 
from existing wells and to expand the use of coal that is down 
from 446 million in the current budget for such projects 
322 million on nuclear energy research a decline from 357 
million in the current budget year

president reagans parting budget presents 
george bush with an early test of political leadership as he seeks 
to fulfill campaign pledges of budget austerity and government 
humanity without raising taxes 
leaders of the democraticled congress say they will give bush 
the benefit of the doubt on his flexible freeze approach to 
budgeting where increases in spending above the rate of inflation 
must be offset by accompanying decreases in other areas 
but at the same time the democrats are pointing out the distance 
between reagans 115 trillion spending blueprint and bushs 
campaign promises 
bushs aides are letting it be known that he will revise reagans 
work within weeks 
reagans farewell budget calling anew for expanded military 
spending and contracted social programs provides a formula for a 
meaner harsher america said sen james sasser dtenn chairman 
of the senate budget committee 
and house speaker jim wright dtexas said the reagan budget 
obviously does not respond to the promises made by presidentelect 
bush during the campaign obviously this is not a kinder 
gentler budget 
those kinder gentler programs promised by bush include large 
proposed increases for education for the head start program for 
expanded medicaid payments to lowincome pregnant women and their 
babies and for environmental cleanup 
vice presidential chief of staff craig fuller was asked monday at 
a news briefing whether bush as president would continue to 
support such programs and wouldnt they cost the government a lot 
of money it didnt have 
yes and maybe fuller responded 
the bush camp was trying to keep above or at least out of the 
fray as reagans final spending plan went to the hill where it 
seemed guaranteed to be ignored as congressional budget writers 
await the bush amendments 
the vice president is expected to outline his modifications 
within a few weeks after his inauguration on jan 20 most likely in 
an address to a joint session of congress however aides say the 
exact format of his budget submission has not yet been decided 
its still too early to say how much of the reagan budget 
bush will keep and how much hell chuck said nicholas brady who is 
treasury secretary now and will occupy the same post in the bush 
administration 
it is certainly possible that much of the current budget will 
remain on the table brady suggested however fuller observed 
there are surely going to be variances 
during bushs campaign he often seemed to be having it both ways 
politically seeking to bask in reagans popularity as loyal vice 
president for the past 7 years while distancing himself from some 
of the more unpopular reagan deeds and policies 
now however with the final reagan budget in and the government 
about to change hands bush will no longer have the luxury of being 
able to seek refuge in reagans shadow 
regardless of who penned the initial budget proposal once the 
inauguration has passed the budget that congress sets to work on 
will be bushs 
although reagans budget appears to smooth the way for some of 
bushs modifications by not seeking such drastic cuts in social 
programs as previous budgets in many cases it appears at odds with 
bushs campaign statements 
for instance bush has proposed an increase in medicaid to help 
cover medical expenses for poor pregnant women and their babies 
reagan in the new budget has proposed more than 1 billion in 
medicaid reductions 
reagans budget again calls for austerity in social spending and 
would eliminate 82 programs at the same time the plan would 
protect his military buildup by advocating a 2 percent increase in 
pentagon spending authority above inflation 
congressional budget writers have said they expect military 
spending to be among the areas bush looks at most closely as he 
seeks to find offsetting reductions to make his flexible freeze 
work

president reagans critics say his proposed 
cuts in medicaid and medicare would curtail health care for the 56 
million elderly disabled and poor americans and could drive up 
state taxes 
public policy analysts members of congress and state officials 
all rejected reagans claim that the cuts will simply force states 
hospitals and physicians paid under the programs to be more 
efficient 
the giant federal healthcare programs have been the fastest 
growing segments of the budget of the department of health and human 
services the largest federal agency spending 37 percent of the 
governments entire budget 
reagans spending proposal for fiscal 1990 would trim medicaid 
growth chiefly by cutting grants to states by 3 percent and reducing 
payments to hospitals and physicians serving medicare patients 
even with the proposed reductions totaling 14 billion the 
medicaid budget would grow by 5 percent to 36 billion the medicare 
cuts 35 billion would reduce that programs growth rate to 10 
percent with 946 billion in projected spending 
the federal government shares the cost of the medicaid program 
with the states which administer the program and retain certain 
eligibility options 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the house health 
subcommittee said the medicaid cuts would put the states in a 
financially untenable situation and wipe out presidentelect 
george bushs promise to expand medicaid coverage to more lowincome 
children 
states will be unable to come up with the replacement dollars 
to continue coverage to the 12 million children now eligible for 
medicaid much less to expand coverage to the millions of lowincome 
families that still have no coverage at all waxman said 
robert greenstein director of the center on budget and policy 
priorities a nonprofit group that researches policy issues 
affecting the lowincome noted that even hhs secretary otis bowen 
objected to the cuts in grants to the states when they were proposed 
by the office of management and budget in a letter to omb last 
month obtained by greenstein bowen said the cuts 3 percent in 
fiscal 1990 4 percent in 1991 and 45 percent in 1992 were 
unjustified and unsupportable 
greenstein said the cuts in substantial part will be passed 
along in benefit reductions 
unless states are have or are willing to come up with more 
money which many arent their only options are to restrict 
eligibility reduce medical services or reduce fees paid to 
doctors he said 
further reductions in payments to physicians he said would make 
it harder for medicaid recipients to find a doctor willing to treat 
them 
for new york state the cuts will not affect the poor but it 
will affect everyone else in the state said brad johnson 
director of new york gov mario cuomos washington office 
we will have to raise revenues or divert resources from other 
programs he said 
the state would see its federal medicaid payments drop by 180 
million in fiscal 1990 and i dont think we can find that much in 
administrative savings he said 
martin corry director of federal affairs for the american 
association of retired people said he was more alarmed over the 
proposed medicaid cuts than those for medicare because of the 
inordinate pressures it puts on states 
the effect of the medicare cuts however would depend on how 
congress implemented them assuming they could even get passed 
on the surface it would appear that they havent done much to 
directly affect medicare beneficiaries but in reality the 
potential for costshifting could change that balance he said 
if physicians continue to charge the same as they have been while 
medicare reimbursement drops medicare recipients would be forced to 
make up the difference out of their own pockets he said 
everyone expects some reduction in medicare which has grown 
about 12 percent annually since 1980 but the problem here is the 
magnitude corry said

president reagans proposed budget provides 
generous support for science and space research next year with a 
boost in total outlays to 149 billion and emphasis on developing a 
permanently manned space station 
in the budget plan for fiscal 1990 which begins oct 1 space 
and science spending would rise by 24 billion the space station 
planned by the national aeronautics and space administration would 
get 21 billion and an unusual advance commitment for billions more 
over a threeyear period 
the final budget of the reagan administration sent to congress 
on monday also supports the 44 billion superconducting 
supercollider proposed by the department of energy and would 
bolster basic research programs of the national science foundation 
by 2 billion 
the suggested outlay for the space station is more than double 
the current fiscal years spending ceiling of 900 million 
the space station a huge orbiting craft designed to house 
astronauts permanently in space is americas major effort to 
reclaim undisputed leadership in space research 
spending authority of 250 million was proposed for the 
supercollider a massive project that is to be built in texas for 
the study of subatomic particles the funds would cover early 
expenses for the start of construction 
money for the space station helps boost the suggested outlays for 
nasa by 18 billion in addition to the station the increase would 
finance nine space shuttle flights compared with five during fiscal 
1989 
it also would help pay for improvements in the current shuttle 
fleet and allow continued work on a replacement for the destroyed 
space shuttle challenger 
under the reagan plan laws would be passed to limit space 
station construction costs to 13 billion in 1984 dollars allowing 
for inflation that would limit the station project to 16 billion 
however this does not include operating costs which are 
estimated to about equal construction spending 
two unusual provisions cover the nasa proposal 
one provides for a threeyear advance of 85 billion in spending 
authority to maintain the current schedule of development 
activities leading to an operating capability in the mid1990s for 
the space station 
the other imposed by requirements of the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law would give presidentelect bush the opportunity 
effectively to block space station development by ordering funds 
withheld 
if bush chooses to he can notify congress that he does not wish 
to spend 515 million appropriated last year for the station a 
powerful signal that he does not approve of a further 
muchaccelerated effort if he takes no action the appropriated 
money will be spent beginning may 15 
the proposed 1990 funds would also pay for 
improvements in the shuttle fleet to allow missions of up to 30 
days 
launch of the hubble space telescope the galileo space probe 
to jupiter and collection of data from voyager iis rendezvous with 
the planet neptune 
start of development of a flight past an asteroid and a comet 
upgrading research on subatomic particles at the fermi 
national laboratory and the stanford calif linear accelerator 
center 
national science foundation contributions to a research program 
aimed at understanding the earthwarming greenhouse effect and 
other changes in the earths climate and weather funds for studies 
of climatic changes also would be increased from 9 million to 20 
million in the national oceanographic and atmospheric 
administrations proposed budget

survivors of the boeing 737 crash 
praised the skill and cool nerves of the pilot for guiding the 
crippled aircraft over a village as he attempted an emergency 
airport landing 
considering the trouble he was in he must have nursed that 
plane to get so close to the airport he must have done a 
brilliant job i pray for him and hope he is ok said gareth 
jones 38 who suffered chest injuries 
pilot kevin hunt 43 managed to keep the 12weekold british 
midland airways jet with one engine on fire and the second 
apparently failing skimming over rooftops as he made for east 
midlands airport in central england 
the belfastbound plane plowed into a highway embankment a 
halfmile short of the runway on sunday killing 44 people and 
injuring the 82 others on board 
david thomas a surgeon at derbyshire royal infirmary one of the 
hospitals handling the casualties said it is incredible to have 
this number of survivors from a major accident that has got to be 
down to the skill of the pilot 
a radio ham operator was quoted today as saying the crew was so 
calm before the crash it was hard to imagine anything was wrong 
whoever was in cockpit contact with the east midlands airport 
controller sounded so calm it was difficult to image anything was 
amiss richard whittington was quoted as saying in the times of 
london 
there was no panic or fear detectable in his voice instead he 
was precise as though he was receiving everyday instructions only 
when i heard the air traffic controller who certainly did not sound 
as calm did i realize something must be terribly wrong 
hunt a 22year veteran with the airline was seriously injured 
with spine and leg fractures he was trapped for 2 hours before 
rescuers managed to free him from the smashed cockpit 
skillfully hunt kept the plane from plowing into the 
2000resident village of kegworth 
village resident bill tidy said the pilot hung on until the 
last minute what a man another resident andrew pendleton said 
suddenly the pilot seemed to pull the nose up and the plane just 
glided past 
transport minister paul channon who visited the crash site 
monday also praised firefighers who arrived within minutes 
spraying foam over the plane to prevent a blaze he said their speed 
saved many lives 
survivor mary mchugh 23 said we were only on the ground for 
three of four minutes before people started pulling us off but 
first there was the foam it just hit us large amounts of it i 
thought wow it was great it meant we werent going to get 
burned 
jones said he held the hand of a young woman next to him during 
the rapid descent when the first engine went she started crying 
and held my hand he was quoted as saying 
i tried to joke about how these things could fly on one engine 
and glide down then the second engine went and she gripped my hand 
and i said there was no way we were not getting out of that plane 
together i knew if i showed i had any fear she would have been 
worse 
firefighter eric moss who worked more than six hours helping 
free survivors and getting out the dead told a grimmer story 
the conditions inside were very difficult very tight and very 
hot we were taking away layer upon layer of wreckage inside the 
fuselage there were layers of bodies

unions representing federal employees are 
urging presidentelect bush and congress to reject president 
reagans budget recommendation of a 2 percent pay raise for 
government workers 
advocates for federal retirees also attacked the spending plan 
monday saying it was unfair for reagan to recommend that the 
retirees be denied a costofliving adjustment next year while 
awarding such an increase to social security recipients 
both groups said the principal ammunition in their fight against 
the reagan budget proposals will be the 50 percent raise the 
president recommended for members of congress federal judges and 
other government executives the unions also complained that reagan 
recommeded a 36 percent pay raise for military personnel but only 2 
percent for civilian government workers 
president reagan is leaving office as he entered bashing the 
federal work force john n sturdivant president of the american 
federation of government employees said monday after the president 
released his farewell budget 
afge will be counting on presidentelect bush to work with us 
in reforming the present civil service pay system which is totally 
inadequate and outdated said sturdivant whose union is the 
largest representing federal workers 
sturdivant and robert m tobias president of the national 
treasury employees union said federal pay scales lag about 26 
percent behind those for comparable private sector jobs 
federal employees will not settle for paltry 2 percent raises 
while top government officials get increases of up to 50 percent 
said tobias 
he expressed hope that congress which is expected to delay any 
action on the budget until bush makes his own recommendations for 
fiscal 1990 spending would be more sympathetic to federal workers 
especially at a time when the lawmakers stand to see their annual 
pay rise from 89500 to 135000 
were confident that congress will act in the best interest of 
the nation and provide a substantial pay raise for the rankandfile 
and not just a substantial pay raise for themselves tobias said 
reagan said the government would save 14 billion by freezing 
the costofliving adjustments for federal retirees next year the 
president also suggested future colas for that system be capped at 
one percentage point below inflation 
but reagan requested no such changes to social security 
here we go again said judith park legislative director for 
the national association of retired federal employees our advice 
to congress would be to remember that inflation doesnt discriminate 
and neither should inflation protection 
the approximately 36 million retirees received a 42 percent 
costofliving adjustment in january 1988 
the raises for congress federal judges cabinet members and 
other federal executives were suggested by a commission that meets 
in presidential election years to review federal salaries 
reagan last week said he endorsed the proposal and the budget he 
submitted to congress on monday contained 380 million to pay for 
the raises 
if approved those raises would also increase the pensions paid 
to reagan after he leaves office and to other former presidents 
whose pensions are tied to the salaries given cabinet members the 
raises will take effect unless both chambers of congress vote to 
reject them which is not expected 
chief among the complaints of the federal workers unions was 
that their members annual raises have lagged behind inflation 
most federal workers received a 41 percent pay increase 
effective jan 1 in january 1988 they got a 2 percent raise and in 
january 1987 a 3 percent pay boost their last raise prior to that 
was a 35 percent raise in 1985 
annual inflation for 1987 and 1988 was 44 percent up from 11 
percent in 1986 and 38 percent in 1985 according to government 
figures

drowned or otherwise died violent deaths last year after thai 
authorities turned the refugees back to sea a us human rights 
group charged today 
the government rejected the report as prejudiced and said all 
refugee boats were allowed to land 
the lawyers committee for human rights in its 193page report 
detailed several alleged incidents of murder and brutality by thai 
authorities 
it said thai pirates ravaged raped and killed hundreds of 
vietnamese boat people pushed out to sea 
the new yorkbased committee said thailand continued to refuse 
refugees permission to land despite its january 1988 announcement 
that it renounced the policy in addition about 330000 cambodian 
and vietnamese refugees were exposed to lawlessness and crossborder 
warfare in camps along the cambodian frontier last year says the 
report entitled refuge denied 
accounts by survivors received by the lawyers committee through 
their relatives in the us reveal a pattern of murder sexual abuse 
and robbery by thai security forces authorized to push off new 
vietnamese arrivals the report declared 
a written statement from the foreign ministry described the 
report as unbalanced prejudiced and at times sensational it 
said all refugee boats were permitted to land and that arrivals were 
taken to a special camp in cooperation with the un high 
commissioner for refugees 
kasit piromya chief of the department of international 
organizations disputed the committees assertion that hundreds of 
vietnamese drowned 
most of the fatalities that occurred resulted from capsizing of 
unseaworthy boats outside of thai territorial waters he said in 
the statement 
he said piracy against vietnamese boat people declined from 
attacks on 77 percent of boats in 1981 to 10 percent in 1988 the 
un refugee agency also has reported a decrease in attacks 
thailand has been praised for giving temporary asylum to hundreds 
of thousands of cambodian vietnamese and laotian refugees who have 
fled their homelands since the communist victories in indochina in 
1975 
but the thais have been criticized for the treatment some local 
authorities give refugees reluctance to act against pirates and 
policies that sometimes cause undue suffering to those seeking 
asylum 
in one case the report says 74 vietnamese refugees who came via 
cambodia in june 1988 were surrounded by thai soldiers and towed 
back to sea in four small boats the soldiers abducted eight young 
girls shot at one of the boats tried to ram another and abandoned 
the survivors the report says 
it says that in another case that month only two boys survived 
of 61 vietnamese who were towed to sea in small boats and fired on 
by soldiers with automatic rifles 
thai fishermen have interpreted the pushback policy and 
attitudes expressed by thai officials and police as a mandate to 
rape rob and murder vietnamese boat people the report said 
officials should ensure respect for the basic human rights of 
the vietnamese boat people it said it accused thailand of 
deterring refugees by creating poor living conditions at refugee 
camps 
the report was based on interviews and trips to thailand by 
committee members last year

the number of deaths in the nations mines 
dropped to 100 in 1988 a decline of 30 from the previous year and 
the lowest number in the 87 years the federal government has tracked 
mine fatalities the labor department said 
fiftytwo of the 1988 deaths were in coal mines eclipsing a 
record low of 63 fatalities in that sector of the mining industry in 
1987 the labor departments mine safety and health administration 
announced monday 
in other types of mines there were 48 reported fatalities in 
1988 a decrease of one from the previous low of 49 in 1986 the 
agency reported 
the overall previous low for mine deaths was 125 in 1985 
a contributing factor in the 1988 total was a sharp decline in 
deaths blamed on roof collapses in underground coal mines there 
were eight such deaths recorded in 1988 down from 18 the year 
before and 26 in 1986 
the labor department speculated that use of new temporary roof 
support systems required by the government since january 1988 may 
have contributed to the decline in roof collapses the temporary 
supports are used while miners install permanent supports

if its true that if you cant beat em you 
should join em then pat sajak is cbs white flag in the latenight 
network talkshow war 
from his midwestern folksiness to his middle american 
naughtiness with his hip band his plain vanilla sidekick and the 
hollywood hills backdrop behind the blue curtain deskand 
movedownone sofa sajak is carson lite carson jr carson 
wannabe 
there is simply no reason for the pat sajak show other than 
to wait for carson to retire and hope to inherit his ratings 
in most markets sajaks 90minute nightly show goes up against 
nbcs tonight show starring johnny carson and the first half of 
nbcs late night with david letterman in his first night 
monday sajak was up against carsons guest host jay leno 
sajaks entire show was a tribute to carson but his one bow to 
letterman was a baldfaced copy of a late night remote segment 
pat took viewers along on his physical and performed such 
sidesplitting antics as building a wooden fort out of tongue 
depressors while waiting for the doctor the bit was actually pretty 
funny 
if cbs can afford to keep him for a few years of slim ratings 
sajak might be an acceptable heir to carson hes quick but 
occasionally overrelaxed letting his lessthanriveting guests 
such as joan van ark take over for too long 
he did play off sidekick dan miller for easy laughs but a man 
whos been making his living cracking wise at the expense of 
contestants on wheel of fortune had no trouble playing off the 
first nights standardissue guest list 
the first guest chevy chase provided the only comic or any 
other relief during guest peter ueberroths deadly monologue on 
baseball player drug use by leaving to use the bathroom 
later michael gross of nbcs family ties said he hoped his 
tv family the keatons die in a plane crash to avoid future 
family ties reunions but any dozing viewers had probably been 
jolted into switching to letterman by then they would have 
thankfully missed comedian dennis wolfberg whose routine centered 
around a proctology exam 
by then it seemed that a 90minute talk show was awfully long 
it seemed years since sajak had opened with his monologue most of 
the jokes were lame but that too is a carson tradition sajaks 
best lines made fun of thirdplace cbs he checked his watch and 
explained in less than one minute we will officially become cbs 
longestrunning program 
in fact sajak as carson clone has a better shot at the master 
than a long list of contenders who have tried and failed including 
joan rivers in 1986 and alan thicke in 1983 the last time cbs 
mounted a carson attack was with merv griffin in 1972 
carson 62 signed an undisclosed multiyear contract in 1987 
but he has been on the air for 26 years letterman has long been 
considered the heir apparent at nbc though he professes 
occasionally to feel his more biting humor belongs after midnight 
cbs is gambling with sajak a former heartland weatherman whose 
only claim to fame is tossing quips opposite vanna white on the 
enormously popular wheel of fortune but cbs has little to lose 
since it cant do much worse than it has been doing with reruns and 
lowbudget original dramas in late night theyve been pushed back 
until after sajak 
abc has long been happy to take the high road in latenight with 
the longrunning news show nightline 
the last pretender to the carson throne miss rivers left fox 
broadcasting cos the late show and was replaced by a series of 
fillins fox finally settled on the most successful of these 
comedianactor arsenio hall 
ironically or perhaps symmetrically hall also has a new 
latenight talk show in syndication it premiered last week 
the arsenio hall show shows signs of developing a personality 
though viewers with a low tolerance for cutesiness may give up on it 
before it does the brash hall started out with a demographically de 
riguer guest list that included singer luther vandross actor leslie 
nielsen and er personality brooke shields about whom hall gushed 
the perfect first guest in a display of vapid sentimentality or 
high satire depending upon the viewers generosity

had agreed with president oscar arias suggestion that the summit be 
postponed

time to formulate a central american policy bush takes office jan 
20 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua insisted late monday that 
any decision to delay the meeting should be made jointly by all five 
regional presidents 
speaking on nicaraguas staterun radio he added however that 
if the meeting is not held next sunday and monday as originally 
planned it must be held as soon as possible 
ortega had said a postponement could practically kill the 
peace plan his leftist sandinista government has been fighting 
usbacked contra rebels who lost washingtons military support 
nearly a year ago the belligerents signed a ceasefire accord on 
march 23 but peace talks have stalled 
guatemala also objected to the postponement 
we reiterate it is urgent that the five central american 
leaders converge in one place to analyze the central amercian 
situation foreign minister alfonso cabrera hidalgo said monday 
foreign minister ricardo acevedo of el salvador said president 
jose napoleon duarte believed the summit could be held on schedule 
only if the presidents of all five countries agreed 
he said jan 2930 or feb 20 were being considered as alternate 
dates 
honduras did not comment president jose azcona hoyo traveled to 
washington on monday and was to meet today with president reagan and 
bush 
madrigal nieto said foreign ministers from the five countries 
would converge in the nicaraguan capital on jan 1718 to discuss an 
agenda 
he denied that postponement could jeopardize the regional peace 
plan which was authored by arias and signed by the five presidents 
in august 1987 
the plan calls for greater democracy an end to civil wars 
political amnesties and an end to the use of one country by rebels 
fighting in another it has been stalled since the presidents last 
met a year ago in costa rica

first foreign trip after he takes the oath of office jan 20 
washington so far has not announced who will be the us 
representative at hirohitos funeral and an official at the prime 
minister noboru takeshitas office said today that he had no 
information about a bush visit 
representatives of more than 100 countries are expected to attend 
the government today announced that it will allocate 614 
million for the funeral and a mausoleum for hirohito who died 
saturday of cancer at age 87 the cabinet approved the amount at a

hirohito death ended a 62year reign his eldest son akihito 
ascended to the throne which has limited powers 
in some countries the issue of attending hirohitos funeral has

wartime decisions by military leaders but made the decision to 
surrender to the allies in 1945

the reagan administration proposes modest 
spending increases in education health and poverty programs but 
wants to save money by cutting school lunch subsidies and home 
heating assistance along with some student loans and grants 
in its proposed 1990 budget unveiled monday the administration 
outlined a 57 percent increase for the department of health and 
human services and a 3 percent boost in outlays for education 
health and human services the largest federal department would 
receive 4244 billion in 1990 
the budget called for a 13 percent increase in spending for aids 
research and prevention raising that to 14 billion 
however the budget proposed saving some 935 million by cutting 
off school lunch subsidies that benefit middle and upper class 
students currently all students regardless of family income are 
entitled to school lunches subsidized by the government 
but under the administration plan students whose family income 
is 185 percent higher than the poverty line about 21553 for a 
family of four last year will be on their own 
overall the government will spend an estimated 5 billion on 
school and day care center lunch programs this year cutting off the 
subsidy for middle and upper income families would cost them about 
28 cents per lunch the administration estimated 
a group pushing for nutrition programs for the poor attacked the 
proposal as inexcusable 
no matter how they defend it these proposals will mean the 
denial of millions of meals to needy children in schools and day 
care centers said robert j fersh of the food research action 
center 
the administration also proposed to save 283 million by reducing 
money to help the poor pay their heating and light bills to a 11 
billion spending authority 
now that the energy crisis has ended lowincome households are 
spending smaller and smaller portions of their income on heat the 
budget document said 
meanwhile education lobbying groups said they hoped george bush 
who ran on the pledge of being the education president would 
correct what they believe are inadequacies in the final reagan 
budget 
we would hope that when the bush administration submits its own 
budget we will see a substantial increase said susan frost 
executive director of a coalition of education groups if we were 
to see basically no changes in the bush administration wed be 
very disappointed 
under the proposed budget education outlays would rise slightly 
from an estimated 206 billion to 212 billion next year 
education secretary lauro cavazos said the administration hoped 
to save some 750 million by cutting out two dozen programs 
including some student loans and grants 
however many of the programs up for elimination have survived 
past administration attempts to do away with them

a homeless man who lived secretly at bellevue 
hospital was wearing a surgical gown and stethoscope when he 
murdered and raped a pregnant physician during a robbery in her 
hospital office police said 
steven smith 23 was arrested at a mens shelter monday 
afternoon after three other homeless men brought the slain womans 
identification and credit cards to police police commissioner 
benjamin ward said at a news conference 
the men told investigators smith had given them the items to sell 
and had given a mink coat stolen from the doctor to another man to 
sell the commissioner said 
police recovered the coat with dr kathryn hinnants initials 
embroidered inside from a man at the shelter ward told reporters 
smith was charged with seconddegree murder firstdegree robbery 
and firstdegree rape in the strangulation death of hinnant smith 
had been arrested at the hospital on jan 1 for illegally possessing 
a hypodermic needle but was released and his case adjourned until 
feb 2 said gerald mckelvey a spokesman for the district 
attorneys office 
the body of the 33yearold physician who was five months 
pregnant was discovered sunday by her husband eric johnson after 
she failed to meet him the night before 
ward said smith masqueraded as a doctor and his normal behavior 
when he is at the hospital is to steal ids and eat at the hospital 
cafeteria 
hes a kind of a con person who seems to take a great joy in 
getting over on the staff ward said 
police said smith was wearing a blue scrub suit a lab coat and a 
stethoscope when he attacked hinnant on saturday afternoon 
smith told detectives he had lived periodically on the 22nd floor 
of the 25story hospital where police said they found a dirty 
hospital bed a stethoscope and bloodied hospital gloves presumedly 
used in the attack and empty beer cans 
detectives also found bloodied clothing including a blue scrub 
suit jeans and socks in a garbage container at the shelter where 
smith was arrested they also recovered a shawl that police believed 
belonged to the victim 
bellevue is a major municipal hospital where many of the citys 
homeless are taken for treatment 
the 22nd floor is a maintenance area that houses machinery and 
was not usually patrolled according to dr jo ivey boufford 
president of health and hospitals corp the city agency that runs 
bellevue she said security at the 1200bed complex would be 
reviewed but an initial check found nothing out of the ordinary at 
the time of the murder 
hospitals are not prisons they have to be open environments to 
a degree for the people to get their work done she said 
hinnant had been struck in the face and had her nose broken then 
was strangled with an appliance cord and raped authorities said 
smith told investigators a man he identified only as john 
participated in the assault and raped hinnant but ward said police 
had not even confirmed that this person exists other than in the 
mind of steven smith 
apparently hinnant kept the door of her windowless office ajar 
with a small box police said smith told detectives he and john 
walked by then returned to talk to the physician 
she didnt have to work saturday but she did it because she 
was always looking for this extra mile and that extra piece of 
excellence she could give said dr john pearson bellevues chief 
pathologist 
whoever did this wiped out a brilliant mind the doctors 
father thad hinnant said from his home in columbia sc i just 
cant imagine it 
the hinnants last saw their daughter nov 26 when she came to 
columbia for her parents 40th wedding anniversary 
she was just so happy said her mother jane she loved new 
york 
but mrs hinnant said her daughter was thinking about returning 
to the south she thought it was a better place to raise 
children she said 
mayor edward i koch who had called the killing the no 1 case 
to be solved congratulated police on the prompt arrest and said 
wards insistence on offering a 30000 reward immediately was a key 
in getting the three homeless men to come forward 
however a police spokesman said monday it wasnt known if the 
men would receive the money they havent asked for it yet sgt 
maurice howard said

a sordid chapter in alabama history 
ended when four former ku klux klansmen pleaded guilty for their 
part in a decadeold clash with black marchers that wounded nine 
people a federal judge said 
the four were the last of nine former klansmen who were indicted 
and eventually pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the gunfire 
that turned the decatur parade route into a racial battleground 
no one was killed in the may 26 1979 confrontation five police 
officers two marchers and two klansmen were wounded 
the klansmen were trying to block a southern christian leadership 
conference march protesting the prosecution of a mentally retarded 
black man charged with raping a white woman in decatur 
ray winford steele and william riccio pleaded guilty monday to 
felony obstruction of justice which carries a maximum penalty of 
five years in prison and a 10000 fine and a misdemeanor count of 
conspiring to violate civil rights 
william johnny mason and lynwood white pleaded guilty to the 
misdemeanor which carries a maximum one year prison term and 1000 
fine 
you have ended a very sordid chapter of your history and the 
history of this state us district judge john hancock said in 
accepting the pleas he delayed sentencing for up to a month 
in return for the pleas federal prosecutors agreed to drop other 
charges alleging that klansmen aided and abetted in an injury to a 
police officer 
mason white and steele entered their pleas before the start of 
the trial monday riccio indicated he wanted his trial to proceed 
but pleaded guilty before a jury was picked 
his attorney jerry quick said riccio wanted to end the case 
he is just glad its over with quick said adding he hoped 
the judge would be lenient 
al moskowitz a justice department attorney overseeing the 
prosecution said he was confident there would have been convictions 
had the cases gone to trial but he said he agreed to the plea 
arrangement in part to let the case finally come to rest 
the case was broken open when the montgomerybased southern 
poverty law center sued the klan that litigation produced testimony 
from former klansmen against klan colleagues leading to a federal 
grand jury indictment against the nine on criminal charges 
their trial was delayed after a federal judge ruled that the 
testimony produced in the civil case could not be used in the 
criminal case but that ruling was set aside on appeal

a former nazi propagandist and yale university 
lecturer who was stripped of his us citizenship and failed to 
appear for a deportation hearing has surfaced in canada and applied 
for asylum canadian television reported 
russian emigre vladimir sokolov 75 disappeared in july when 
the deportation hearing was to have been held in hartford conn 
his whereabouts were unknown until he applied for refugee status 
in montreal sometime before jan 1 claiming his life would be in 
danger if he were forced to return to the soviet union the canadian 
broadcast corp reported monday night 
no date has been set for an immigration hearing the report said 
from 1942 to 1944 sokolov was a writer and editor of a russian 
language newspaper german army occupiers published in his hometown 
of orel 220 miles south of moscow antisemitic articles appeared 
under his name although he has maintained that the most offensive 
tracts were written by nazi censors 
nevertheless the german army awarded sokolov medals for his work 
sokolovs canadian lawyer julius grey contended there were no 
grounds to return his client to the united states since hes out 
of the country hes not in violation of any law 
the soviet press has been gloating over his return and have 
called him a traitor grey said he would likely be put to death 
or given a lengthy sentence for all practical purposes it would be 
the end of his life 
cbc quoted the soviet embassy in ottawa as saying they were aware 
of the sokolov case but did not know whether there are charges 
against him in the soviet union 
grey said sokolov is in very poor health 
in one world war ii article that appeared under sokolovs name 
jews were compared to rats the article expressed the hope that 
during the war jews would be destroyed finally and forever 
grey who is jewish said his client certainly doesnt exhibit 
any antisemitic ideas now whether he ever had them or not 
even if he did write those scurrilous articles 40 years ago 
its not an overwhelming thing hes never been accused or charged 
with a war crime the test for war crimes is did you commit any 
atrocities 
the nazis systematically murdered 6 million jews in what they 
called the final solution 
sokolov failed to reveal his wartime activities in 1951 when he 
entered the united states as a displaced person 
he became a citizen in 1957 and two years later began lecturing 
on russian language and soviet dissident literature at yale 
his past was uncovered by the yale student paper in 1976 and he 
later resigned but the us government waited until 1982 before 
filing a complaint to strip him of his us citizenship 
us district judge thomas f murphy stripped sokolov of his 
citizenship in 1986 finding that he had concealed his nazi past

central american immigrants prepared to 
travel to other cities after a judge blocked a new immigration 
policy that stranded hundreds of aliens in south texas while their 
asylum requests were processed 
us district judge filemon vela blamed the policy for a sharp 
increase in the number of central americans living in makeshift 
camps and condemned buildings in cameron county texas southernmost 
county 
i am a human being i do live in this community vela said 
monday as he issued a temporary restraining order suspending the 
policy 
the us immigration and naturalization service under the dec 
16 policy told applicants they could not travel from the area or 
work while awaiting a decision on their asylum status a period of 
at least 30 days 
they said the policy was intended to curb the backlog of cases in 
other cities particularly miami and los angeles and reduce 
applications from those entering the country for economic reasons 
not political

asylumseekers of their rights to representation and access to the 
asylum process as required under the refugee act of 1980

health authorities seeking to learn how many 
americans carry the aids virus hope the offer of 50 and a plea for 
cooperation will attract people in highrisk groups to participate 
in a pilot survey 
thats one of the major problems with which were wrestling and 
which weve spent a lot of time trying to determine how to 
evaluate said dr james r allen an assistant deputy director at 
the us centers for disease control 
the survey began monday with the mailing of letters to 350 
randomly selected households in allegheny county asking people to 
anonymously reveal their sexual practices and give blood for 50 if 
the effort succeeds the survey could be extended nationwide 
if highrisk individuals avoid the survey theres no point 
in conducting a national survey said dr bruce w dixon chief of 
the sexually transmissible disease program of the county health 
department 
in august officials abandoned an attempted pilot survey in 
washington dc after opponents said the effort unfairly targeted 
blacks said peter hurley an associate director of the national 
center for health statistics 
officials say they learned their lesson and planned the 
pittsburgharea survey with the unanimous consent of a 21member 
advisory panel drawn from the community 
every concern that was expressed by members of the advisory 
panel was taken into consideration and changes were made said 
panel member leslie hunt turner assistant administrator of the alma 
illery medical center which is located in a predominantly black 
neighborhood 
everyone was skeptical said mrs turner it wasnt a thing 
where we said yeah this is a great idea lets go for it 
success here ideally in the form of 85 percent participation 
will lead to an expanded preliminary survey elsewhere officials 
said dallas and san diego are among the communities on the cdcs 
short list for the next round allen said 
if all goes well the planners could ask congress as early as 
next year for the estimated 25 million needed for a national 
survey allen said 
the advisory panel persuaded the planners not to ask for the 
individuals day of birth just the month and year to ensure 
privacy 
a question on marital status accounts for divorce and samesex 
cohabitation to reflect a lot of differences in living 
arrangements in todays society mrs turner said 
the actual results will be meaningless because so few of the 
countys 850000 housholds are to be questioned dixon said 
the effort could however define the methods to be used 
nationwide people who decline to participate will be asked why and 
their answers will be used to delete objectionable aspects from the 
survey officials said 
on saturday professional interviewers and technicians trained to 
draw blood working in teams of two will begin the four to 
sixweek job of knocking on the 350 doors asking one person age 18 
to 54 in each home to participate 
those who agree will be paid 50 they will be asked such 
questions as whether they have ever engaged in behavior that risks 
exposure to the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome risky behavior includes sex with an infected partner 
intravenous drug use by addicts and blood transfusions 
officials said each participant will complete the questionnaire 
out of sight of the interviewer and technician and will seal it in a 
tamperproof wrapper for mailing neither the blood sample nor the 
questionnaire will be labeled with the persons identity 
officials said the interviewer and technician will never see the 
answers and they risk being fired and fined 5000 for opening the 
sealed questionnaire

prospects for a 150nation conference on chemical 
arms achieving consensus that would help curb proliferation of the 
weapons appeared dim as delegates bickered over who should be 
allowed to possess the poisons 
how can any member of the international community proclaim a 
right it denies others foreign minister jadallah azouz ettalhi of 
libya asked monday reiterating the arab stance that the us is 
being discriminatory 
the united states has alleged a libya has built a chemical 
weapons plant a charge libya denies 
both washington and moscow acknowledge having huge stocks of 
chemical weapons the only nations to do so and both support 
efforts to ban the arms but a bloc of arab delegates to the 
conference has advocated linking elimination of chemical arms with 
destruction of nuclear weapons 
romania added its voice on monday to the arab position while 
britain joined the united states in opposing any linkage 
the dispute risks weakening a final statement to delivered 
wednesday and reducing the impact of the fiveday conference 
the libyan minister accused israel of maintaining stocks of 
nuclear chemical and biological weapons with the assistance of the 
united states charges that israel has nuclear weapons are at the 
heart of the arab effort 
both types of arms are viewed as machinery for mass destruction 
but unlike nuclear arms chemical weaponry has not in the past been 
considered a weapon to deter attack 
obviously we want the strongest possible final communique 
that meets our objectives and is compatible with our security 
interests us arms control official lynn hansen said monday 
the fact that there are countries that want other things means 
that we will have difficulty in reaching a consensus said hansen 
director of the bureau of multilateral affairs at the us arms 
control agency 
the final declaration must be reached by consensus meaning there 
can be no disagreements 
the conference is aimed at reaffirming the 1925 geneva protocol 
banning the use of chemical weapons and giving impetus to 
negotiations in geneva for a total verifiable ban on the use 
production and stocking of chemical arms 
the planned conference statement political in nature will have 
no legal or binding weight a working version obtained by the 
associated press makes no direct reference to linking nuclear and 
chemical arms but it refers to the need to obtain general and 
complete disarmament 
the version also voices serious concern at recent violations 
of the geneva protocol the statement if adopted is not binding 
the statement will have to take into account the preoccupations 
of certain arab countries said a french conference source 
speaking on condition of anonymity but it is a bit too early to 
say what that form will take 
iraqs use of chemical arms in its eightyear war with iran the 
latest verifiable use of the weaponry serves as a backdrop for the 
conference 
about 20 countries are thought to have chemical weapons 
capabilties and there is a growing fear that nonnuclear nations 
will stock chemical arms

a panel of 12 jurors has been selected from a 
pool of more than 1500 people to hear the trial of night 
stalker defendant richard ramirez charged with a series of savage 
nocturnal murders 
the jury whose selection was completed monday were chosen after 
five months of intense questioning on prospective jurors views on 
the death penalty and their ability to afford sitting through a 
trial that could last two years 
at least six of the 12 jurors are hispanic according to court 
records defense attorneys wanted significant hispanic 
representation and had once charged that standard selection 
procedures could not ensure the desired ethnic balance for their 
hispanic client 
ramirez 27 faces 13 counts of murder in the attacks most of 
which occurred in 1985 he also is charged with 30 other felonies 
including rape robbery and attempted murder 
the defendant who was said to have dealt in the occult and once 
yelled hail satan in court had been quiet during jury 
selection often dressing in black and wearing sunglasses 
opening statements are scheduled for jan 23 attorneys in the 
meantime will continue to select 12 alternate jurors said deputy 
district attorney alan yochelson 
yochelson said he sees no delay in selecting the alternate jurors 
we anticipate meeting that deadline and proceeding on that 
date he said 
he said that prosecutors were not looking to fill an ethnic quota 
we are just looking for fair and impartial jurors regardless 
of their ethnic backgrounds he said during extensive pretrial 
hearings evidence clearly demonstrated that the ethnic makeup of 
juries in the central district of superior court fully reflect the 
diverse racial and cultural backgrounds of this community 
a message left at defense attorney daniel hernandezs office 
after hours was not immediately returned 
the jury pool of more than 1500 people was whittled down last 
month to 143 potential jurors who were questioned for the final 
panel hundreds were excused because they could not afford to hear 
the potentially lengthy trial more were dismissed because they 
believed ramirez a drifter from texas was guilty of the brutal 
night stalker slayings 
the selection process began july 21 and was conducted in three 
phases 
if jurors convict ramirez of even one murder and special 
circumstance allegation they must then decide whether to impose the 
death penalty or decree life in prison without possibility of parole

two australian students turned societys 
love of money into a winning argument to capture debatings most 
prestigious tournament for the university of sydney union 
lets look at the real world said warren lee who teamed 
with andrew bell to win the 9th annual world universities debating 
championship at princeton university 
people dont say lets all join the peace corps and be nice 
guys 
that thrust helped the pair defeat the university of toronto and 
win the title monday for sydney for the second time 
two us teams from yale university and the university of 
pennsylvania were eliminated in the semifinal round monday 
morning a total of 116 teams of word wizards competed 
using a forcible debating style mixed with wit the australians 
were the clear crowd favorite as lee and bell argued that modern 
society reveres those who acquire wealth 
university of toronto team members justin macgregor and david 
conklin acting as the government in the british parliamentary 
style argument had the task of proving that it profits a man 
nothing to gain the world and lose his soul 
it was a good debate lee said after the australians 
finished the masses were laughing and hooting and screaming you 
always like to see that 
conklin admitted the subject was a tough one any value today 
involving some notion of justice or injustice is difficult to get 
across 
in the debate conklin argued that figures such as jesus gandhi 
and martin luther king jr shunned the material world for larger 
social gains 
christ in his death was far more important than he would have 
been had he compromised his values conklin said 
macgregor scored a few points by saying justice was served in 
the movie wall street michael douglas did go to jail in the end 
before he won his academy award 
but it wasnt enough to overcome the australians contention 
that the people who get the stuff are not punished they get the 
wealth the respect and the happiness 
earlier in the day the australians defeated yale university by 
opposing the concept that the emperor has no clothes 
the university of toronto advanced to the championship by 
defeating the university of pennsylvania with a successful argument 
that the sky is not falling 
the championship drew a record 232 participants from 18 nations 
the debaters delivered some spirited arguments during the 
weeklong tournament 
for example cheryl strauss of cornell university last week 
suggested that vegetables be the focal point of a new religion 
i think we should all pray to vegetables she said then we 
could all look down and that would make us feel good 
mark voyce of the university of maryland had an offbeat response 
sunday when given the topic how to make sports more violent 
voyce said archery should include human targets 
who wants to shoot an arrow into a bunch of hay he said

investigating magistrate as he left his home for work today

leftist extremists

suspected terrorists was hit in the arm and leg police said he 
was taken to a nearby evangelismos hospital where he was reported 
in stable condition

characterized the attack as an attempt by leftist extremists to 
intimidate other judicial officials

the zographos area of the capital the police spokesman said the 
three gunmen fled in a stolen car which was later found abandoned 
near the scene of the shooting police said

imprisonment of two people on suspicion of involvement in terrorist 
activities

arrested following an athens shootout with police that killed 
michalis prekas who was believed to be a member of the leftist 
antistate struggle and the revolutionary popular struggle groups 
revolutionary popular struggle has claimed responsibility for 
hundreds of bomb explosions around athens since 1975 no one has 
been injured in the attacks which usually target us military 
facilities and tax offices 
antistate struggle claimed responsibility for the killing of 
district attorney giorgos theofanopoulos in 1985 
no members of either group have ever been arrested 
boukuvalas and voyatzi were jailed 18 months on orders from 
androulidakis and set free when another judge said no concrete 
evidence connected them with terrorist acts

the knife used in the 1987 slaying of a 
prostitute is identical to the one found near the bodies of seven 
women discovered weeks later on a hillside in a remote area a 
prosecutor said 
dayton leroy roger is serving a life sentence for the 
prostitutes death and faces trial next month in the slayings of six 
of the seven women the seventh victim has not been identified 
the prosecution disclosed monday that the bodies of the seven 
women were nude and that their legs and feet had been sawed off 
information about the knife and the condition of the bodies was 
revealed at a clackamas county circuit court hearing on pretrial 
motions rogers trial is scheduled to begin feb 6 
the seven young women all known or suspected prostitutes were 
abducted mutilated and stabbed to death and their bodies dumped in 
a remote area near molalla about 30 miles southeast of portland 
rogers 35 was charged with six counts of aggravated murder 
deputy district attorney andrejs eglitis said the knife was found 
a matter of feet from four of the victims he characterized the 
knife as identical in size and shape to one rogers admitted 
using to kill jennifer lisa smith 
smith a portland prostitute was tortured and stabbed to death 
in a parking lot of a suburban portland restaurant a few weeks 
before the bodies were found near molalla in august and september 
1987 
rogers told jurors last year he killed smith in selfdefense but 
he was convicted of aggravated murder 
among the motions considered by judge raymond r bagley jr was a 
defense request to suppress certain evidence including the knife 
that eglitis said would be important to his case 
eglitis said there were knife wounds in the bodies of some of the 
molalla victims that were consistent with the type of wound that 
would be made by rogers knife 
there is every reason to believe that knife is the one that 
caused the wounds on the molalla victim eglitis said 
rogers attorney christopher burris argued that no human blood 
or tissues were found on the knife and that it would be inflammatory 
to introduce it as the probable murder weapon 
burris also argued against the introduction of bones from the 
legs of the molalla victims the bones he said had tool marks 
showing they had been sawed from the bodies 
eglitis said the tool marks proved that the bones werent severed 
from the bodies by foraging animals 
during the smith trial several former prostitutes testified that 
rogers has a foot fetish and was sexually fascinated with the arches 
of womens feet 
burris also asked to supress a hacksaw taken from rogers small 
engine repair shop eglitis said the saw could have been used to cut 
the womens legs 
the judge made no immediate rulings on the motions

experts today examined the flight 
recorders and wreckage of a british jetliner to determine how the 
brandnew boeing 737 apparently lost use of both engines and 
crashed against 10milliontoone odds killing 44 people 
transport minister paul channon said no evidence of sabotage 
surfaced in the british midland airways disaster but prime minister 
margaret thatcher would not rule it out we rule out nothing we 
simply cant she said 
pilot kevin hunt crashlanded the belfastbound jet at the edge 
of a major highway sunday night barely avoiding hitting the village 
of kegworth at the edge of east midlands airport 
the badly injured flier was being hailed today for his skill 
investigators work should be greatly assisted by hunt and the 81 
other survivors many of whom are well enough to describe the 
flights last minutes as hunt struggled to make an emergency landing 
police said 78 survivors remained hospitalized today thirteen of 
them in intensive care units 
survivor dr john mccrea said they had been on the plane for 10 
or 12 minutes when i felt a shudder and i looked over at the left 
wing and saw flames the pilot told them he had shut the engine 
down and was diverting to east midland 
we went on flying for a further five minutes mccrea said 
the plane seemed to drop we carried on two or three minutes 
and there were more flashes over the left side 
then the captain told passengers to prepare for an emergency 
landing it seemed like only five seconds later we were down 
said mccrea 
the plane crashed a halfmile short of the runway plowing into a 
grassy embankment at the edge of the m1 highway 100 miles north of 
london 
hunt 43 a 22year veteran with the airline was in poor 
condition with spine and leg fractures but hospital officials said 
he spoke with his wife 
credit for the high survival rate was being given to hunts 
flying to airport firefighters who smothered the burning engine and 
fuelladen wings in foam within minutes and to motorists who rushed 
from cars to help 
mrs thatcher visited hospitalized survivors on monday talked 
with relatives of those killed and went to the scene where the 
broken blue and white fuselage lay crumpled among trees 
last month she was in lockerbie scotland the village struck by 
wreckage when a bomb blew apart a pan am jumbo jet on dec 21 
killing 270 people she said she almost couldnt believe it when 
she heard about the new crash 
channon who also inspected the kegworth scene said so far 
the evidence although by no means conclusive is consistent with 
the right engine having stopped before impact and there are also 
signs of fire in the left engine 
asked whether it was almost certain that both engines 
malfunctioned the transport minister replied that certainly 
looks probable at the moment his department said results of tests 
on the cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder 
were not expected for several days 
william tench retired head of britains air accidents 
investigation board said the odds against a double engine failure 
on a boeing 737 were 10 millionto1 he suggested a technical 
mistake such as something incorrect being done to the engines during 
turnaround servicing between flights either inadvertently or 
deliberately 
freddie yetman spokesman for the british airline pilots 
association said a doubleengine failure was astonishing 
the boeing 737400 was 12 weeks old and had flown less than 500 
hours the airline said boeing said the two cfm56 engines were 
built in france by a consortium of general electric co and the 
french company snecma 
a northern ireland protestant leader the rev ian paisley flew 
to england to comfort the bereaved it is very suspiciouslooking 
because this flight is used by servicemen 
soldiers are targets of irish guerrillas in northern ireland but 
they have never been known to attack civilian airliners 
authorities said 25 soldiers stationed in northern ireland were 
on the flight and four were killed along with at least two northern 
ireland police officers

police believe they have one of the 
usmexico borders most notorious drug traffickers behind bars 
and they want to keep him there this time 
gilberto ontiveros lucero was arrested on drug charges monday at 
a house in juarez said esteban garcia villalon coordinator of the 
mexican federal judicial polices antidrug campaign in chihuahua 
state 
it marked ontiveros second arrest on drugtrafficking charges in 
less than three years he was jailed in april 1986 but a juarez 
federal judge dropped all the charges last may and set ontiveros 
free 
about 45 to 50 federal police officers began searching for 
ontiveros on dec 29 after police found nearly eight tons of 
marijuana in warehouses in south juarez officials believe ontiveros 
was planning to smuggle the mexican marijuana into the united states 
juarez is across the us border from el paso texas 
ontiveros is believed to smuggle marijuana by the ton and cocaine 
in loads of hundreds of pounds each said phil jordan district 
director of the drug enforcement administration in dallas 
they dont come any bigger than ontiveros along the 
usmexican border in terms of tonnage of narcotics smuggled into 
the us jordan said 
ontiveros is one of the deas mostwanted men and a warrant was 
issued for his arrest in the united states in december 1986 
extradition to the united states however is unlikely because of 
the charges ontiveros faces in mexico 
police seized two ak47 assault rifles and three pistols all 
loaded during their search of the house where ontiveros was 
arrested garcia said 
a few hours later they seized a cessna conquest airplane at the 
juarez airport and arrested two pilots from the gulf port of 
tampico garcia said adding the pilots had been hired to fly 
ontiveros to mexico city

police in czechoslovakia questioned banned 
playwright and human rights activist vaclav havel about an anonymous 
threat of selfimmolation at an antigovernment rally planned for 
sunday he said today 
czechoslovak authorities banned the weekend rally and the 
communist partys chief ideologist warned monday of threats to 
communist rule party leaders are facing growing calls for economic 
and political reforms 
havel who has frequently been harassed by authorities said by 
telephone from prague that he was questioned for about two hours 
monday after he received an anonymous letter from an unknown 
committee for collective suicide 
the letter contained a threat to emulate the suicide of student 
jan palach on pragues wenceslas square 20 years ago 
sundays rally intends to commemorate palachs deed he burned 
himself to protest the sovietled invasion a year earlier that 
quashed a broadbased reform movement supported by thencommunist 
leader alexander dubcek 
human rights activists say the rally will go on despite the ban 
havel taped an appeal that was broadcast by the czechlanguage 
services of western radio stations monday night urging the anonymous 
committee not to go ahead with the action 
he said police would today question dana nemcova a spokeswoman 
for the charter 77 humanr rights group who received an identical 
letter havel said 
palach set himself ablaze jan 16 1969 and died three days 
later thousands of czechoslovaks shocked and moved by his protest 
attended his funeral 
havel said representatives of charter 77 and four other groups 
who have called the rally were to meet today with authorities to 
discuss the event 
on jan 21 the same five groups plan to hold a vigil at palachs 
grave in his home village of vsetaty 18 miles north of prague 
palachs body was secretly exhumed from a prague cemetery and 
reburied in vsetaty in 1973

surgeon general c everett koop said today he 
remains as opposed to abortion as ever but that a study by his 
office cannot prove whether having an abortion affects a womans 
mental and physical health 
the surgeon general interviewed on abctvs good morning 
america said a full scientific study should be done that will 
settle the question once and for all 
on monday koop sent a letter to president reagan declining to 
issue a report on a study of the effects of abortion on women 
i remain as opposed to abortion as ever but ive always been 
able to separate my personal beliefs from my responsibilities as 
surgeon general koop said in the interview today 
the focus of the various groups that are prolife has been on a 
postabortion syndrome and they would like to be able to prove that 
that is a specific thing and i cant prove that for them except by 
anecdotes he said 
if you take the whole abortion issue at one end there are 
people who are so relieved to be rid of their pregnancy that they 
consider it a positive health benefit the surgeon general said 
at the other end there are people who are really psychologically 
upset i have dealt with women at both ends of the scale 
koops letter declining to issue the report came on the same day 
the supreme court agreed to hear an appeal that could to reverse or 
narrow the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortions nationwide 
koop noted that reversal of the decision has long been a goal of 
reagan and the presidents advisers 
at the time the report was requested there were those advising 
you and intimately involved with the social issues of abortion who 
truly believed that such a report could be put together readily 
koop said 
in the minds of some of them it was a foregone conclusion that 
the negative health effects of abortion on women were so 
overwhelming that the evidence would force the reversal he said 
koop said almost 250 studies about the psychological effects of 
abortion are under way he said the public health system he heads 
looked at the most significant of those studies but found flaws in 
the methodology 
the studies data do not support the premise that abortion does 
or does not cause or contribute to psychological problems koop 
said 
some physical problems can result from abortion such as 
infertility or damage to the cervix but they also occur in women 
who dont have abortions and there has never been any scientific 
attempt to track the physical effects he said 
an effective study would cost at least 10 million a year over 
the next five years koop told reagan

reversal of the supreme courts 1973 decision 
legalizing abortion would touch off political chaos and social 
upheaval across the country an abortionrights leader said today 
the justices said monday they will study a federal appeals court 
ruling that struck down key provisions of a missouri law regulating 
abortions 
the courts eventual decision expected by july could resolve 
the missouri controversy without disturbing the 1973 decision but 
missouri officials and justice department lawyers are urging the 
justices to use the case to overturn the landmakr roe vs wade 
ruling 
a reversal of that ruling would create political chaos and 
social upheaval across this country kate michelman executive 
director of the national abortion rights action league said on 
cbs this morning 
there would be firestorms all across this country on the 
question of abortion she said we will mobilize this 
country the likes of which you have not seen in a long long time 
this country women and men alike will never accept going back to 
the day when women have to risk their lives their health their 
families lives in order to seek an abortion 
william bradford reynolds who as an assistant attorney general 
pushed for a review of roe vs wade said on the cbs program that 
there is certainly good reason for optimism that the court is 
going to differ with the lower court as far as some of the 
strictions that have been placed in the missouri statute on 
abortion 
he added that he hopes it would go further and entertain the 
whole question of roe vs wade and reconsider it and i would hope 
that if it did that it would come to a result that is 
constitutionally sound and that we could correct the error that was 
made some years ago in this area he said 
reynolds maintained that the 1973 decision does not stand on 
very firm constitutional footing 
womens lives are literally on the line if the court reverses 
its most famous abortion ruling said eleanor smeal president of 
the fund for the feminist majority 
molly yard president of the national organization for women 
added we are now declaring a state of emergency for the women of 
america 
yard speculating on a worstcase scenario said women 
will not accept an overturn we will not go back to illegal 
abortions its going to be like prohibition we arent going to 
obey the law 
judith sewderowitz executive director of the center for 
population options said her organization is deeply concerned that 
the court may be preparing to repeal the right to abortion 
for adult women retreat from the principles of roe would be a 
major setback she said for adolescents for whom tooearly 
childbearing poses the threat of physical and emotional harm 
retreat from roe would be a disaster 
eve paul of planned parenthood said we cant predict what the 
supreme court will do but abortion has become a safe legal 
procedure which millions of women have had 
mark chopko a lawyer for the national conference of catholic 
bishops said he was cautiously optimistic that todays 
development signals the beginning of the courts reconsideration of 
roe vs wade 
samuel lee of the antiabortion missouri citizens for life 
called the case acted on monday our best shot in a number of years 
to undo roe really our best shot since 1973 because of changes on 
the court 
the court is viewed as deeply divided on abortion 
although justices harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and john paul stevens have resisted attempts to reverse or 
greatly modify the 1973 decision antiabortion forces are hoping to 
attract five votes for such a result 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice byron r white 
dissented from the 1973 ruling and from several subsequent abortion 
decisions 
justice sandra day oconnor in past decisions has questioned the 
courts reasoning in its 1973 decision 
justice antonin scalia who has not yet voted in an abortion 
decision since being named to the high court by president reagan in 
1986 is thought to favor overturning or curtailing roe vs wade 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court last feb 18 
likewise has not voted in an abortion decision his views on 
abortion and the roe vs wade decision are not known in any 
significant detail 
we dont know what kennedy is going to do said the missouri 
antiabortion groups lee but im more optimistic about him than 
planned parenthood is 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals last july struck down 
among other aspects of the missouri abortion law these five 
provisions 
a ban on using public hospitals and other facilities for 
abortions not necessary to save a womans life 
a ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or 
assisting in an abortion 
a ban on using taxpayer money for encouraging or counseling 
women to have abortions 
a requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus believed to 
be older than 19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb by 
testing for weight and lung capacity 
a declaration that the life of each human being begins at 
conception 
missouri attorney general william l webster in seeking supreme 
court review said the 1973 decision should itself be 
reconsidered if it cannot be squared with the disputed missouri 
law 
reynolds then chief of the justice departments civil rights 
division wrote to missouri officials last summer urging them to 
include a challenge of roe vs wade in the states appeal 
and in a brief filed two days after the presidential election 
nov 8 justice department lawyers supported missouris appeal 
in its 1973 ruling the supreme court said women have a 
constitutional right to abortion based on the right of privacy the 
court most recently reaffirmed that ruling in 1983 but the courts 
membership has changed since then 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide whether congress may outlaw as it tried to do 
in a 1988 law all sexually explicit telephone dialup message 
services dubbed dialaporn 
let stand over two dissenting votes a lower court ruling in an 
alabama case that allows criminal defendants to exclude potential 
jurors because of their race 
refused to let the federal government permit japanese salmon

gov james r thompson has issued a 
disaster declaration for four southeastern illinois counties that 
bore the brunt of damage from a tornado that tore through parts of 
three states 
in issuing the declaration monday the governor estimated damage 
to a fourcounty area of illinois at between 10 million and 15 
million 
the twister hit the towns of mill shoals albion and allendale 
late saturday afternoon destroying more than onethird of 
allendale a town of 600 people near the indiana border and leaving 
about 300 people homeless 
it then moved into indiana touching down near vincennes and cut 
a twomile path through the southern kentucky community of franklin 
no deaths were reported although 50 people were injured in 
illinois and three in indiana five people in indiana remained 
hospitalized in serious condition monday 
thompsons declaration covered edwards wabash wayne and white 
counties but the governor said he did not know whether the counties 
qualified for a federal disaster declaration because the damage was 
not spread over a large geographic area 
the illinois declaration allows local residents to seek property 
tax reassessment and to apply for federal assistance 
in wabash county which includes allendale the cleanup effort 
continued monday as bulldozers and farm tractors helped clear 
debris about 75 illinois national guard personnel and volunteers 
from surrounding communities pitched in and sunny skies aided the 
recovery effort

grounds said partial water and gas service was available monday 
but the area remained without electricity and telephone service was 
unreliable officials set a 5 pm curfew to prevent looting 
local residents were trying to get over the shock of their 
losses grounds said

the number of murders hit a 10year low in los 
angeles last year but the decline was overshadowed by a sharp rise 
in gangrelated killings police said 
murders in the nations secondlargest city fell to 734 in 1988 
down from 832 in 1987 and the lowest since 1978 when there were 678 
homicides according to statistics released monday 
gangrelated killings escalated to 257 last year from 205 in 
1987 while overall gangrelated crimes rose to 5371 from 5129 the 
year before 
the sheriffs department also reported that gangrelated slayings 
in unincorporated areas of the county rose to 96 last year from 79 
in 1987 the department has not completed overall homicide totals 
yet 
police cmdr william booth attributed the jump to a sharp rise in 
the number of gang members last year investigators listed nearly 
28000 known gang members compared with just 15000 the year before 
booth credited the drop in murders overall to the addition of 900 
extra street cops provided by extra overtime funds and a greater 
willingness by officers to make arrests in domestic disputes 
the los angeles murder rate of 229 killings for every 100000 
residents runs lower than that of many other large cities booth 
said

a palestinian who had allegedly cooperated with 
israeli authorities was shot and killed by fellow arabs in the west 
bank and four other arabs were reported shot and wounded today in 
clashes with israeli troops 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said for the first time that he 
would accept a un role in peace talks with palestinians but he 
insisted only direct talks between israel and its arab enemies could 
bring peace 
speaking to visiting european parliament officials shamir also 
denied reports that a new israeli peace plan had been submitted to 
us officials in paris this week 
arab reports said palestinians collaborating with israeli 
authorities killed 27yearold kayed muhammad tmaizi on monday in 
the village of idna because he had stopped collaborating 
tmaizi suffered three gunshot wounds and died en route to a 
hospital in nearby hebron arab reports said 
family members told an arab reporter that tmaizi was under 
increasing pressure from security forces to renew his role as an 
informant they said he stopped cooperating with israeli officials 
when the arab uprising started 13 months ago 
tmaizis relatives saw the assailants flee and take refuge in the 
home of another idna man who is known as a collaborator the arab 
reporter said they said the attackers were later picked up by cars 
with israeli license plates 
the army clamped a curfew on idna and took tmaizis body from a 
hospital in nearby hebron to determine the cause of death a 
military official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed a 
shooting death occurred and said security forces had nothing to do 
with it 
it was apparently an argument between families in the 
village said the official the army denies any connection 
betweeen the military and the shooting of this man 
the slaying followed a series of attacks on suspected 
collaborators after a new leaflet issued by plobacked underground 
leaders called for attacks on palestinians who work for israeli 
authorities 
two alleged collaborators were killed and two others wounded in 
the past week 
tmaizis death raised to 349 the number of palestinians killed 
since the start of the uprising against israels occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip fifteen israelis have been killed 
the army lifted curfews today from four refugee camps in the gaza 
strip as palestinian merchants opened stores following general 
strikes that paralyzed the occupied lands sunday and monday the 
strikes have been a constant feature of the uprising 
three palestinians were shot and wounded in the gaza strip and 
one was wounded in a clash with troops in the west bank town of 
ramallah arab reports and hospital officials said 
shamir told the european deputies today he would accept a role in 
the peace process for the united nations or the superpowers 
providing they refrain from any involvement in the substance of 
the talks 
the rightwing prime minister previously had rejected any un 
involvement claiming the world body was biased against israel 
shamir denied a report in the new englishlanguage daily the 
nation that foreign minister moshe arens submitted a new israeli 
peace plan to us officials in paris he said israel has not yet 
formulated its peace proposals 
there are some ideas but nobody should speak now of a formal 
peace plan laid down by the israeli government he said

a medical pathologist testifying for the defense 
in the child abuse and murder trial of joel steinberg said it 
didnt appear that 6yearold lisa steinberg was hit with full force 
by a man steinbergs size 
dr john plunkett of st paul minn testified monday that 
lisas fatal injuries would have been more extensive if she had been 
hit forcefully in the jaw and head by a man as large as steinberg 
who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds 
i would expect her jaw to be shattered plunkett said 
observing that lisas jaw was small and fragile and she still had 
her baby teeth 
the prosecution contends that lisa was killed by blows from 
steinberg and a medical expert for the prosecution had previously 
said those blows had the force of a fall from a thirdfloor window 
steinberg 47 a disbarred lawyer is charged with seconddegree 
murder in the girls beating death steinberg obtained lisa 
illegally from an unwed long island teenager and he and his 
companion hedda nussbaum raised her as their own 
lisa was removed unconscious from their apartment nov 2 1987 
she was hospitalized and died of a brain hemorrhage three days later 
steinberg has told police he did not hit the child and his 
lawyers are suggesting that ms nussbaum could have struck the fatal 
blow 
ms nussbaum 46 a former childrens book author and editor 
testified that steinberg told her he hit lisa the night she was 
fatally injured ms nussbaum was initially charged along with 
steinberg but the charges were later dropped after prosecutors 
concluded that steinberg had abused ms nussbaum so severely she 
couldnt have acted to save lisa she became a prosecution witness 
in his testimony plunkett said he believed small bruises on 
lisas left jaw and right forehead and an injury to the back of her 
head were caused when she was vigorously shaken and thrown against a 
wall 
these injuries could have been inflicted by any adult strong 
enough to pick up a 43pound child he said

trapped in a mountain enclave in south lebanon today fought off a 
tankled assault by prosyrian rivals who outnumbered them

syrianbacked amal militia stormed positions held by the 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god in the village of jbaa 
the 1000 amal militiamen spearheaded by sovietdesigned t54 
battle tanks launched their assault after two days of savage 
fighting for control of the predominantly shiite region near

mountain enclave after being driven out of several strategic 
villages monday later counterattacked and pushed amal out of the 
hilltop village 
amal is currently launching another attack the spokesman 
said 
jbaa 10 miles southeast of the port city of sidon is a key part 
of the hezbollahheld sector 
abu hussein an amal commander in sidon said the battle would be 
a fight to the finish 
there will be no ceasefire he told reporters its either 
us or them the attack will not come to an end until we finish

nightfall monday they reported that at least 105 people had been 
killed and 300 wounded since early sunday

regulations said amal now controls most of the iklim tiffah or 
apple province in the south

mission in california was the result of misfeasance and a 
breakdown in leadership according to a marine corps investigation 
lance cpl jason j rother of minneapolis probably died 24 hours 
before the marines began searching for him in the california mojave 
desert last august the report said rother was reported missing 40 
hours after he was last seen and his skeletal remains were found 
dec 4 three months and three major searches later 
the american people will not nor should they accept our 
maiming and killing their sons and daughters in socalled training 
accidents neither will i wrote marine commandant gen alfred 
m gray in endorsing the investigative findings 
rothers death was not an accident but was the result of 
misfeasance gray wrote 
rother had been posted alone as a nighttime guide on aug 30 for 
trucks that were to carry marines to a major training exercise 
no one noticed that rother didnt climb aboard any of the trucks 
as they passed and the next day platoon sergeants issued an all 
present even though he hadnt been seen the report said 
colleagues finally noticed he was missing in late afternoon on aug 
31 the report said 
the investigation recommended disciplinary action against a 
lieutenant colonel and a major in charge of the training exercise 
and against squad company and platoon leaders involved in the 
incident 
a recommendation is expected this week at camp lejeune nc on 
whether lt allen lawson who was in charge of posting road guides 
at the time should face courtmartial administrative action or if 
charges should be dropped lawson is accused of dereliction of duty 
and willful disobedience of an order to post the road guides in 
pairs and to provide a logistics officer with a list of marines 
assigned as road guides

meetings with us officials to discuss compensation were planned 
today in washington dc 
we will explore all possible avenues of compensation for 
affected parties including native communities whose source of food 
and income have been jeopardized bouchard said 
it is an acceptable principle that the polluter make 
reparations he added it is commendable that the american firm

bouchard toured the area monday with his british columbia 
counterpart bruce strachan and canadian fisheries minister tom 
siddon they met later with local and federal officials indian 
leaders and cleanup volunteers 
in washington state stormy weather and high tides in recent days 
have removed oil from some beaches and redeposited it on beaches 
farther north officials said 
this rough weather is definitely causing some movement of the 
oil said ron holcomb of the state department of ecology were 
keeping an eye on the effect of that 
the weather was rainy and windy monday for the third straight 
day with only a slight easing of conditions expected through 
wednesday 
i cant tell you how long its going to take to get all of the 
oil holcomb added 
susan ewing a spokeswoman for the state department of wildlife 
said crews hoped to finish cleaning washingtons southern beaches 
within a few days 
the crews are not being pulled out from the southern areas but 
are making really good progress toward finishing it off she said

more weeks she said

more than 1300 awaiting a scrub only 12 live birds were brought to 
the center monday while 111 were found dead on the beaches

a 71yearold woman has vowed she will not 
be moved from a ramshackle homestead she has lived in for nearly two 
decades after her nearby home was razed to make way for a state park 
the state finally wants to develop the 300acre park on the shore 
of long island sound but doris gagnon ignored a monday deadline for 
leaving the property where she lives in a camper and shacks that sit 
among tall marsh grass about 100 feet from the shore 
id like to see it a park but i dont want to have suffered in 
vain gagnon said arguing that she deserves millions of dollars 
in compensation for her ordeal i want to show they cant do this 
to an american citizen 
the state will begin eviction proceedings once officials in 
milford verify that gagnon is not leaving assistant attorney 
general grace dodier said monday the process is expected to take up 
to two months officials said 
authorities served notice nov 28 that they wanted her out of 
silver sands state park they gave her until monday to leave even 
though the law required only eight days notice dodier said 
as much as we can empathize with her the woman has no legal 
right to be there said wanda rickerby a spokeswoman for the 
department of environmental protection which plans to develop the 
park property 
the milford health department filed a complaint with the state 
after an inspection discovered bags of human sewage piled up behind 
gagnons living quarters said charles motes chief of environmental 
health 
we all feel she would be better off elsewhere rickerby said 
but gagnon is adamant about staying 
im not leaving not until i get justice she said 
chickenwire fencing surrounds her property which is also home 
to five cats three dogs and about 50 chickens geese and ducks 
gagnon said she has propane gas to heat her dilapidated 18foot 
camper and that friends bring her water and let her shower at their 
homes she said she also has an electric generator 
people are very good to me she said adding that she is able 
to survive on social security payments 
gagnons battle with the state began in the mid1960s when 
officials bought and demolished about 100 cottages to expand and 
develop the fledgling park gagnon refused to sell but a judge in 
may 1969 ruled the state would be able to take her property through 
eminent domain her beachfront cottage was demolished in 1971 
gagnon said she refused to accept a 15000 payment for the 
property the money was disbursed by the state to satisfy two liens 
in 1974 according to state records 
part of the beach at the park is used during the summer but 
there are still no permanent facilities at silver sands funding and 
environmental problems held up development of the park and it wont 
be completed for at least three years officials said

on a car today in an attack that killed three people including two 
opposition candidates for next months national elections police 
said 
police blamed the militant sinhalese peoples liberation front 
for the attack at waduwa 20 miles south of the capital colombo 
the victims were identified as indrapala abeyweera secretary of 
the sri lanka freedom party and wijeyalal mendis also a candidate 
for the feb 15 polls the third victim was a bodyguard identified 
by police only as martin 
the killings came in the wake of a statement by president 
ranasinghe premadasa saying he would allow emergency rule to lapse 
next week 
we have lived under emergency rule for now more than five 
years i feel that is enough for everybody premadasa told a group 
of highranking government officials and lawmakers while outlining 
an ambitious program to eliminate proverty on this indian ocean 
island 
the state of emergency which expires sunday was imposed in may 
1983 to curb violence between the buddhist sinhalese majority and 
the predominantly hindu tamils it has been extended by parliament 
every month since then 
tamils who comprise 18 percent of the countrys 16 million 
people claim discrimination by the sinhalese who make up 75 
percent of the population and control the government militant 
tamils have been fighting six years for an independent nation and 
more than 8500 people have died 
the peoples liberation front opposes an accord the government 
signed that was aimed at ending the tamil insurgency and vowed to 
kill anyone who supported the government 
the state of emergency gave police and soldiers broad powers to 
arrest and detain a person for up to 90 days without charges 
dispose of bodies without inquests and raid homes without search 
warrants 
premadasa said everyone imprisoned under the emergency will be 
released and that some already have been freed 
according to government officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity 574 political prisoners were released between jan 16 
during his campaign for the dec 19 presidential election 
premadasa said he would work to eliminate poverty and malnutrition 
his antipoverty program outlined today would allocate about 75 
a month to each of the countrys 7 million impoverished people or 
45 percent of the population the average annual income in sri lanka 
is about 360 
premadasa who also holds the finance and planning portfolios 
did not explain how he will finance his program 
in a bid to create harmony on this ethnically divided nation 
premadasa offered cash incentives to government employees who are 
bilingual 
everyone likes money so we will pay more to those who speak 
more than one language said premadasa who speaks the two 
official languages sinhalese and tamil in addition to english he 
did not say how much more a bilingual employee would earn 
premadasa served as prime minister for 11 years before he was 
elected president last month one of his two opponents sirmavo 
bandaranaike has asked the supreme court to nullify the election

col moammar gadhafi said if the united states 
attacks a libyan plant it claims is intended to make chemical 
weapons libya will respond by destroying anything american which 
we can reach 
in a speech broadcast live monday by libyan radio and monitored 
in london gadhafi again denied us allegations the plant is 
intended for chemical weapons 
we built a factory for medicines the libyan leader told a 
meeting of the basic peoples congress in tripoli a grassroots 
political committee 
they said this constitutes danger america with all its 
greatness said i want to destroy this factory why because it is 
a factory that constitutes a danger 
even the factories which make atom bombs are a cause of danger 
and so we should destroy them and this is what should happen if 
they the united states destroy this factory we should get ready to 
destroy anything american which we can reach 
president reagan has said he could not rule out the option of a 
military strike on the plant about 60 miles southwest of tripoli 
the libyan capital 
in an interview published today in usa today gadhafi said the 
whole world is amazed and surprised by the us claims 
asked if he approved of chemical weapons gadhafi said we are 
against the use of any type of weapons 
gadhafi also said he expected relations with washington to 
improve when reagan leaves office 
we should bury this silly and stupid policy with the previous 
administration he said 
the libyan leader again denounced last weeks shooting down by 
us fighters of two libyan jets over the mediterranean us 
officials said the incident was an act of selfdefense unrelated to 
the rabta plant 
libya claimed its planes were attacked during an unarmed 
reconnaissance mission and said the incident was a prelude to a 
largerscale us attack 
but when asked in the interview if the libyan planes had been 
armed gadhafi said only this is something new to us to debate 
if a military plane should be armed or not this is silly 
in cairo egypt libyan dissident leader mohammed yusef magariaf 
said in an interview monday his group needs us help to overthrow 
gadhafi but advised washington that bombing libyan targets would be 
the wrong kind of help 
magariaf secretarygeneral of the national front for the 
salvation of libya denied an unattributed report in the 
londonbased newsletter africa confidential that the front is being 
trained militarily by us and israeli experts in chad cameroon and 
other african countries 
this is a stupid lie he said adding that israel probably 
benefits with gadhafi in power because it keeps libya in turmoil 
the front is considered the most powerful antigadhafi its aim 
is to end gadhafis rule 
in washington pentagon spokesman fred hoffman would not comment 
on the africa confidential report another ranking us defense 
official speaking anonymously denied the defense department was 
involved but said he could not speak for the central intelligence 
agency 
magariaf said such action as the air battle might backfire by 
depicting gadhafi as a victim 
in the arab world that is not the course to get rid of 
gadhafi he said this is not the task of the united states 
instead of bombing this or that all efforts should be directed 
to helping libyans get rid of gadhafi 
he said his organization maintains a dialogue with the united 
states and other powerful countries but refused to elaborate

the fighting hens is no name for a 
football team say students at henryetta high school who squawk at 
the notion that female fowl can conjure up the right image for their 
gridiron boys 
on wednesday students will vote on a new name for their athletic 
teams something that inspires a little more fear in opponents 
like knights or diamond backs a poll shows that four out of 
five favor the change 
our male athletes object to being named for a female chicken 
said willie wind student body president and its redundant to 
call the girls teams lady hens 
the hens have been around since the 1930s when a newspaper 
account of a game played in a downpour referred to the team as the 
mud hens wind said the fighting was added later 
most alumni have opposed a change in the name arguing that it 
has become a tradition but wind said there has always been some 
opposition to the mascot 
this is something that has been discussed as long as ive been 
in school here said wind a senior but there are a lot of 
people in the community who didnt want the change 
the school mascot has received some national attention recently 
because of the success of ucla quarterback troy aikman a 1984 
graduate of henryetta high who is expected to be a top national 
football league draft choice 
but that doesnt mean that students are proud to be hens a poll 
of senior high students conducted last month showed support for a 
change in mascots by a 35281 margin 
even if the vote favors a change its still possible that the 
school board will veto it the fighting hens say theyll cross that 
road when they get to it 
if that happens wed be disappointed wind said but we 
wouldnt give up wed keep working within the system for the 
change

the supreme court in an important decision for 
anyone who sues a government employee over alleged civil rights 
violations today clarified how to determine the filing deadlines 
for such lawsuits 
by a 90 vote the justices ruled that a man who says he was 
unlawfully arrested and beaten by campus police at the state 
university of new york in albany did not wait too long to sue two 
police officers 
the ruling means tom ukures lawsuit against javan owens and 
daniel g lessard over a jan 27 1984 incident can proceed to 
trial 
the two police officers had sought a ruling that ukure who sued 
22 months after his arrest missed the appropriate filing deadline 
or statute of limitations 
ukures federal lawsuit is based on a muchused civil rights law 
in which people whose rights have been violated can collect monetary 
damages from government officials and employees 
but in passing the 1870 civil rights law and in amending it 
since congresss has never specified what statute of limitations to 
impose 
in a 1985 decision the supreme court ruled that suits filed 
under the civil rights law most often referred to as section 1983 
because that is where it appears in the us code must meet the 
same deadline as personal injury suits filed in the same state 
but some states have more than one deadline for personal injury 
suits depending on what type of wrongdoing is being alleged the 
courts 1985 decision in a case called wilson vs garcia did not 
clarify what deadline should govern in such cases 
writing for the court today justice thurgood marshall said that 
in such multipledeadline situations a states catchall deadline 
for personal injury cases should be used 
in ukures case that means new yorks general threeyear statute 
of limitations for personal injury cases governs not the states 
oneyear deadline for certain specified personal injuries as the two 
police officers had argued 
our decision in wilson promised an end to the confusion over 
what statute of limitations to apply to section 1983 actions with 
todays decision we hope to fulfill wilsons promise marshall 
said 
he noted that courts should resort to general filing deadlines 
only when state law provides multiple deadlines for personal injury 
suits and the general deadline embraces either explicitly or by 
judicial construction unspecified personal injury actions 
the case is owens vs okure 8756

investigators said today they found fire 
damage in one of the engines of a boeing 737 that crashed in central 
england and that the other engine had been inexplicably shut off 
before the crash 
eddie trimble the transport departments chief engineering 
inspector at the crash scene told reporters that while the left 
engine showed fire damage the right engine showed no sign of having 
been on fire and was in a zerothrust or shutdown condition 
he said the engine appeared to have been turned off at a 
previous point in the flight rather than in the moments before 
the plane crashed into a highway embankment while trying to make an 
emergency landing at nearby east midlands airport 
trimble refused to speculate on whether pilot error was to blame 
for shutting down the engine 
at this stage in the investigation all possibilities are open 
in that regard he said 
investigators are listening to the flight recorders and will be 
able to question the seven crew members including the pilot and 
copilot 
the british midland airways jet crashed into an embankment beside 
englands main northsouth highway sunday night killing 44 people 
it was flying from londons heathrow airport to belfast when the 
pilot reported engine trouble 
the left engine has fire damage trimble said the fire 
damage is consistent with witness reports of fire associated with 
the left engine in flight we have no evidence at the moment of a 
mechanical failure in the right engine 
transport secretary paul channon repeated trimbles findings to 
parliament and said investigators are now concentrating on 
information about the engines from the flight data and cockpit 
voice recorders both of which were recovered 
investigators rummaged on hands and knees looking for debris that 
might yield more clues theories advanced by experts included 
contaminated fuel a rupture in a combustion chamber improper 
servicing or a mechanical fault allegedly missed during tests of the 
engine 
channon said monday there was no evidence of sabotage but prime 
margaret thatcher said we rule out nothing we simply cant 
the crash occurred less than three weeks after a bomb destroyed a 
pan am jet over lockerbie scotland killing all 259 on board and 11 
people on the ground 
at the governments sophisticated laboratory at farnborough 
south of london tests began on the boeing 737s two flight 
recorders and the digital flight data recorder 
william tench retired head of britains air accidents 
investigation board said the odds against double engine failure on 
a boeing 737 were about 10 million to 1 
he suggested a technical mistake such as something incorrect 
being done to the engines during turnaround servicing between 
flights either inadvertently or deliberately 
or tench said it could be inadvertent fuel contamination 
the evening standard newspaper said today evidence was emerging 
that at least one of the planes engines broke apart 
wreckage thought to be engine blades has been found six miles 
from the crash scene the newspaper said 
a transport department spokesman requesting anonymity confirmed 
that debris probably engine fragments was found at a distance 
from the crash but he did not know the distance 
lawyer jim helmer of cincinnati who is suing the airplane 
engines maker alleges the engines contained parts that were not 
properly tested 
helmer identified the parts as timer valves but told the 
associated press he didnt know if they could have caused the crash 
the cfm56 engines were made jointly by the usbased general 
electric co and the french company snecma general electric 
spokesman dwight weber said monday night that failure of the timer 
valves would not have caused an engine to go out 
snecma spokesman olivier fagard said the timer valves are 
inspected and tested in each engine 
our records reflect all engines performed normally during the 
testing and there is no evidence whatever of any characteristics 
which could be associated with a malfunctioning timer we deny this 
has anything to do with an engine malfunctioning he said 
investigators expect to be aided by accounts from pilot kevin 
hunt and the other crew members hunt 43 a 22year veteran with 
the airline was in poor condition with spine and leg fractures but 
hospital officials said he spoke with his wife 
copilot david mcclelland was hospitalized with a broken leg and 
spinal injuries 
the plane crashed a halfmile short of the runway plowing into a 
grassy embankment at the edge of the m1 highway 100 miles north of 
london 
the boeing 737400 was 12 weeks old and had flown less than 500 
hours the airline said

the supreme court ruled today the rights of 
criminal defendants are not violated when they are denied the 
opportunity to confer with their lawyers during brief trial recesses 
by a 63 vote the justices upheld the murder kidnapping and 
criminal assault convictions of donald ray perry of south carolina 
during a 15minute trial recess while perry was testifying his 
lawyer sought to speak to him to advise him about his rights during 
crossexamination but the judge refused to allow them to talk 
justice john paul stevens in his opinion for the high court 
said the federal constitution does not compel every trial judge 
to allow the defendant to consult with his lawyer while his 
testimony is in progress if the judge decides that there is a good 
reason to interrupt the trial for a few minutes 
the truth more likely may emerge if a defendant who has been 
testifying and is about to undergo crossexamination is denied the 
chance to talk to his attorney stevens said 
permitting a witness to consult with counsel after direct 
examination but before crossexamination grants the witness an 
opportunity to regroup and regain a poise and sense of strategy that 
the unaided witness would not possess he said 
stevens drew a distinction between perrys case and one in 1976 
in which the court ruled that a defendants right to the assistance 
of his lawyer was violated when he was barred from talking with the 
lawyer during an overnight recess 
the normal consultation between attorney and client that occurs 
during an overnight recess would encompass matters that go beyond 
the content of the defendants own testimony such as the 
availability of other witnesses trial tactics or even the 
possibility of negotiating a plea bargain stevens said 
the constitution guarantees a defendant will be allowed to talk 
to his lawyer about such matters stevens said 
justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion said the 
ruling is a lapse in this courts commitment to fundamental 
fairness for criminal defendants 
marshall said prosecution witnesses routinely are allowed to 
confer with the prosecutor during brief recesses 
justices william j brennan and harry a blackmun joined 
marshalls dissent 
perry was sentenced to life in prison in the killing of mary 
heimberger whose body was found on march 7 1981 in a wooded area 
in richland county sc 
perry confessed to police that he shot the victim but said it 
was an accident 
ms heimberger had been raped shot in both kneecaps and fatally 
shot in the chest 
perry filed a federal court appeal in 1985 and a judge ruled that 
his rights were violated when the trial judge refused to allow him 
to talk to his lawyer 
but the 4th us circuit court of appeals reinstated the 
conviction in 1987 
the appeals court said there must be evidence that denying a 
defendant the opportunity to confer with his attorney prejudiced the 
case against the defendant 
the supreme court did not adopt that reasoning today citing the 
case of the overnight recess stevens said there are instances when 
the defendant must be allowed to confer with his lawyer without any 
proof of prejudice against the defendant but brief recesses do not 
qualify for that treatment stevens said 
in other action the court 
clarified how to determine the filing deadline for anyone who 
sues a government employee over alleged civil rights violations 
by a 90 vote the justices ruled that a man who says he was 
unlawfully arrested and beaten by campus police at the state 
university of new york in albany did not wait too long to sue two 
police officers 
upheld a 5 percent tax illinois imposes on all telephone calls 
charged to instate numbers 
the court in an opinion by justice thurgood marshall said the 
tax does not interfere impermissibly with interstate commerce 
the case involving criminal defendants is perry vs leeke

three selfstyled revolutionaries 
plotted to bomb courthouses military offices and corporations in an 
attempt to overthrow the us government a prosecutor said today 
assistant us attorney michael loucks also told a federal jury 
that the three defendants plotted roberies from maine to virginia 
and attempted to murder an offduty policeman to further the 
conspiracys personal political goals they are accused of 
seditious conspiracy or conspiring to overthrow the government 
racketeering conspiracy and racketeering enterprise 
loucks described the 1976 bombing of the suffolk superior 
courthouse in boston which blew down walls and injured several 
people as an attempt by the group to cripple the massachusetts 
penal system 
opening arguments from defendant raymond luc levasseur 42 of 
maine who is presenting his own case and attorneys representing 
levasseurs wife patricia gros levasseur 40 and richard williams 
41 of boston were to follow 
loucks maintained that levasseur and his wife who joined in 
1976 were core members of the group that claimed credit for the 
bombings under the names of the united freedom front and the sam 
melvillejonathan jackson unit while williams joined in 1981 
about 50 spectators packed the tiny courtroom at least 10 us 
marshals guarded the defendants and security was tight throughout 
the courthouse 
attorneys estimate the trial could last a year 
the defense attorneys say the seditious conspiracy statute is so 
broad that it could be used against protesters blocking streets it 
was enacted in 1918 to keep draft resisters from interfering with 
the conscription laws 
whats at stake here is not just the rights of the people on 
trial its the rights of every american william newman who 
represents mrs levasseur said monday 
the defendants have described themselves in a press release as 
north american antiimperialists who believe armed resistance is 
one of the necessary responses to apartheid racism sexism the 
massacres of native peoples and capitalistbacked wars 
they face up to 60 years in prison and 60000 in fines if 
convicted 
selection of a 12member jury was completed monday from a 
prescreened pool of 45 prospective panelists after 68 days of 
questioning that began in april but was delayed by pretrial motions 
and wrangling over evidence 
us district judge william g young reminded the jurors that it 
was the prosecutors responsibility to prove the defendants guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt 
the government has to prove somebody actually did something to 
make a conspiracy come about he said on no account can a 
person be prosecuted for his political beliefs 
the courtroom is outfitted with closedcircuit television 
monitors and guarded by about 40 marshals who have set up two 
walkthrough metal detectors at the courthouses entrances 
the three defendants were among eight people who were arrested in 
ohio virginia and massachusetts in 1982 and 1984 the trial was 
moved from boston to springfield 
charges were dropped in august against two defendants thomas w 
manning 42 of maine and jaan karl laaman 40 of east boston 
because they were already serving long sentences on bombing 
convictions in new york 
mannings wife carol 33 pleaded guilty last month to the three 
charges and was sentenced to a fiveyear prison term to run 
concurrent with her 15year term in new york on bombing and 
conspiracy charges 
young decided last week to hold a separate trial for laamans 
wife barbara j curzilaaman 31 
another defendant christopher king 38 has been tried 
separately and found guilty on the single count of seditious 
conspiracy he was sentenced to seven years in prison

the kremlins top envoy to afghanistan said today 
there is a serious danger the soviets will not have their troops 
out of afghanistan by a feb 15 deadline 
yuli m vorontsov the soviets first deputy foreign minister and 
the ambassador to kabul blamed the united states and hardline 
elements among afghan guerrillas for a deteriorating situation in 
the country 
the opposition says it wants to topple the current government 
in kabul militarily said vorontsov who recently met with leaders 
of the afghan resistance in iran and pakistan they dont want to 
see a broadbased government 
vorontsov also told reporters at a government news briefing that 
us arms are still being shipped to the afghan guerrillas and that 
the us government has not given any indication of its genuine 
desire to work for an afghan settlement 
asked if the soviet union might further delay withdrawal of the 
50000 troops it still has in afghanistan vorontsov replied its 
a serious danger things might shape up in such a way that the 
soviet union will be unable to do what wed decided to do as a 
matter of principle 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
administration expects the soviets to hold to the feb 15 pullout 
date 
we still expect them to meet the deadline fitzwater said 
i dont believe weve had any official notification to the 
contrary the last thing they officially told us was that they 
would be out 
under a unmediated accord signed in april the soviet union 
agreed to have all its troops out of afghanistan by feb 15 the red 
army entered the country in december 1979 to back up the government 
against afghan guerrillas sending in an estimated 100000 soldiers 
the guerrillas are backed by the united states and pakistan 
vorontsov said the soviets are seeking establishment of a 
national afghan assembly called a jurgah to represent all parties 
in the strifetorn country 
formation of such an assembly should be accompanied by a 
ceasefire to stop the shedding of afghan blood vorontsov said 
the soviets suspended their troop withdrawal in fall after 
complaining that the united states and pakistan were continuing 
their support of the guerrillas trying to overthrow the 
sovietbacked regime in kabul top soviet officials have said 
repeatedly since then however that moscow would meet its 
obligation to complete the withdrawal by feb 15 
afghan rebel leaders refused monday to resume direct talks with 
the soviets claiming moscow was trying to secure a place for its 
communist allies in a postwar government 
vorontsovs talks with the rebels reached an impasse in islamabad 
on saturday over the composition of a postwar regime 
a rebel spokesman sibghatullah mojaddidi said the guerrillas 
would not attack departing soviet troops but he ruled out a 
ceasefire sought by the soviets 
vorontsov had said in the past that the soviets would meet their 
withdrawal deadline unless departing troops were attacked by the 
guerrillas he indicated today the conditions for completion of the 
pullout depended on the military and political situation in 
afghanistan but he gave no criteria on which the kremlin would base 
its decision

the government began closing arguments today in 
its case against top teamsters officials describing for jurors how 
the unions late president and two associates allegedly carried out 
a 700000 embezzlement scheme 
the case was expected to go to the jury late today or tuesday 
following closing arguments by defense attorneys for the two 
surviving defendants and instructions by us district court judge 
george m white 
the embezzlement and labor racketeering trial began 2 months ago 
and included testimony from 80 witnesses many of whom were asked 
detailed questions about daytoday union operations as long as 10 
years ago 
the indictment issued in may 1986 named the teamsters 
thenpresident jackie presser along with harold friedman an 
international vice president for the union and anthony hughes 
local 507 recording secretary 
presser died july 9 of brain cancer 
the evidence demonstrates abuse of union office by harold 
friedman anthony hughes and jackie presser for the benefit of their 
friends and cronies in the amount of 700000 government 
prosecutor stephen jigger said during closing arguments today 
jigger reviewed in detail the testimony of three of the alleged 
ghost employees who allegedly were paid for doing no work they 
are allen friedman who is not related to harold friedman george 
argie and john a nardi jr 
we told you up front that these three were unsavory characters 
but it was not the government that paid them up to 1000 a week 
jigger said 
friedman 66 and presser who was 61 when he died were accused 
of paying the ghosts while hughes 52 was charged with being a 
noshow employee at the bakery workers local 19 which is 
affiliated with teamsters local 507 
friedman testified that hughes worked and that allen friedman 
often was too ill to work he said the other two ghost employees 
worked for presser and that it would have been uncharacteristic of 
presser to pay people for doing no work 
jackie presser was not the type to pay someone and not have 
him do any work friedman said last week if he did then shame 
on jackie presser 
court documents have indicated that presser and hughes were fbi 
informants pressers former attorney john r climaco has said 
that ressers defense would have been that the fbi authorized him to 
hire the ghost employees to enhance and protect his status as an 
fbi informant status 
but government prosecutors contend presser didnt begin working 
as an fbi informant until 1977 so he couldnt have been authorized 
to hire ghost employees as early as 1972 when the scheme 
allegedly began 
friedmans attorney said last week that presser was a government 
informant as early as 1963

defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
tuesday he approved requests for several antisatellite projects in 
the fiscal 1990 budget because such a weapon is crucial to national 
security 
i think its deplorable that we do not have an antisatellite 
deterrent capability carlucci said 
the soviets have an operational system and contrary to some 
reports ive read it is an effective system i think our lack of an 
asat antisatellite capability is our single most vulnerable point 
if there were to be a conflict 
for us to be deprived of our eyes and ears would gravely weaken 
our military capability 
according to carlucci and other reagan administration leaders 
the soviets have a crude but operational missile system for 
attacking the lowflying us spy and reconnaissance satellites that 
would be crucial in a war 
the united states spent years developing such a weapon and 
tested it effectively once against an object in space before 
congress blocked further development work 
congressional democrats maintain the current soviet system poses 
little danger to modern american satellites note the soviets have 
stopped all testing of the weapon and argue that further 
development of an american counterpart would set off an arms race in 
space 
carlucci was asked about antisatellite work during a breakfast 
meeting with pentagon correspondents tuesday one day after the 
reagan administration sent a 3152 billion military budget request 
for fiscal 1990 to congress 
included is a request for 946 million to begin development of a 
seabased antisatellite weapon the request was surprising because 
it was carlucci who just last year bowed to the congressional 
demands to halt development of an asat missile that could be fired 
from landbased jets 
that does not mean that i was prepared to give up on developing 
an asat capability carlucci said of his decision to scuttle that 
air force program 
i think its vitally important that we go ahead with some asat 
capability and we have a number of supporters in the congress 
the defense secretary added the navy effort would be one of at 
least three programs to study asat applications the army and 
strategic defense initiative organization which oversees star 
wars work also are studying asat applications with different 
types of lasers carlucci said 
the navy program will study the potential of a kinetic energy 
asat missile or one that would destroy a satellite through impact 
and not explosives 
on other matters carlucci said he had spoken with his designated 
successor former sen john tower of texas on monday and that tower 
expected to recover rapidly from recent surgery 
carlucci said tower now expects to undergo a senate hearing and 
gain confirmation by the end of the month as a result carlucci 
said he planned to step down from office on feb 1 and seek a job in 
the private sector

thirtyfive us archbishops and top vatican officials will take 
part in the talks which are expected to cover a variety of issues

were concerned about vatican disciplining of liberal archbishop 
raymond hunthausen of seattle hunthausen later was restored to full 
authority but church leaders still wanted the meeting 
during the annual meeting of the national conference of catholic 
bishops in washington two months ago its president archbishop john 
l may of st louis described the pope as being bullish on the 
church in the united states 
differences between the us bishops and the vatican have

a vatican draft document that questions the authority of national 
bishops conferences marking it as not suitable as a basis for 
discussion

a 65yearold rape victim allowed by a judge 
to select her attackers sentence chose the shortest of three 
alternatives but one that guaranteed there would be no trial 
wasnt that something the greatgrandmother said monday 
after she chose to have james halvorson serve a 54month sentence 
halvorson 25 had pleaded guilty last november to raping the woman 
in her suburban home 
hennepin county district judge william posten began the 
sentencing hearing by calling the victim to his chambers along with 
kevin johnson an assistant county attorney and cindy clarkson who 
works with sexual assault victims for the county 
posten presented the victim with three alternatives she could 
choose to have halvorson serve a 54month sentence for firstdegree 
sexual assault that would be in keeping with minnesota guidelines 
and would allow halvorson to be free in three years 
or she could have halvorson serve a 100month sentence 
recommended by probation authorities or a 108month sentence 
requested by the county attorneys office 
but if she chose either of the longer sentences halvorson would 
be allowed to retract his guilty plea and there could have been a 
trial to determine his guilt or innocence posten told her 
the victim consulted with johnson and clarkson and had only one 
question 
i knew it could be months before thered be a trial she 
said the only thing i wanted to know is if he would be in jail 
during that time 
when she was told he probably wouldnt be in jail she said she 
wanted the 54 months and she wanted it now 
the victim called the judge just beautiful he was so kind he 
said its your decision i liked that i think three years is a 
long time for a young person maybe halvorson will think about 
some things

a federal judge declared a mistrial today in the 
stock manipulation case against chemical company gaf corp and one 
of its key officers deciding that the governments failure to 
disclose possible tampering with a key piece of evidence unfairly 
hurt the defendants 
the ruling by us district judge mary j lowe stunned a packed 
courtroom but the judge said she intended to start picking a new 
jury wednesday morning for a new trial 
she denied an immediate defense motion to have all the charges 
dismissed and defense attorneys said they would appeal her denial 
contending that another trial violates their clients constitutional 
rights 
jury selection in the nowhalted trial began dec 12 
the stock manipulation charges against gaf and vice chairman 
james t sherwin is one of the major cases arising out of the ivan 
boesky insider trading scandal it was considered a major test of 
the governments ability to successfully prosecute wall street 
trading abuses 
the governments case relied partly on an invoice sent to gaf by 
jefferies amp co a los angeles brokerage that conducted stock trades 
for the company 
a line on the invoice produced by the government was partly 
obscured but us prosecutors failed to inform the defense about 
the possible tampering prior to the trial as required under criminal 
rules of evidence 
a federal grand jury indicted gaf and sherwin last july on 
charges they manipulated the price of union carbide corp stock 
through jefferies in an attempt to drive up its price 
the alleged motive was to maximize the gain gaf would realize by 
selling its chunk of carbide stock following a failed takeover 
attempt of the larger chemical company

the bomb that destroyed pan am flight 103 was in a 
front cargo hold in front of a wing transport secretary paul 
channon said today 
channon told the house of commons the fact that semtex plastic 
explosives were probably used to make the bomb pointed to a highly 
organized terrorist group planting the device 
the boeing 747 exploded over the scottish town of lockerbie on 
dec 21 killing all 259 people on board and 11 people on the ground 
the department of transports air accident investigation branch 
had narrowed the area of the bombs location to that of the no 
1 cargo hold just forward of the wing channon told lawmakers he 
didnt say which wing 
he said it was too early to tell where the luggage or article 
that contained the explosive originated 
it is essential that we discover who put the bomb in the 
aircraft and how it got there the signs of the use of 
highperformance plastic explosive which was very probably but not 
certainly semtex point to a wellorgnized and wellsupported 
terrorist group he said 
channon did not say how investigators had determined the location 
of the bomb 
western terrorist experts have said they suspect semtex an 
explosive made in czechoslovakia was used to sabotage the jumbo jet 
although czechoslovakia denies semtex was used in the lockerbie 
incident it has promised to send experts to help in the 
investigation 
a foreign office spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
said four czech experts planned to arrive wednesday for a one or 
twoday visit 
in lockerbie police said today they had recovered and identified 
another body from the crash they said they still were searching for 
the bodies of seven local residents and 21 passengers 
police released for burial the body of rosaleen somerville 40

the communist party leadership today went back on 
its promise of multiplecandidate elections for parliament by 
choosing all 100 candidates for the partys 100 seats in the new 
parliament 
a historic political reform passed into soviet law dec 1 said 
conditions would be created for nomination of an unlimited number 
of candidates for the congress of peoples deputies 
twothirds of the 2250 deputies are to be elected by the general 
public on march 26 the other third is to be chosen by certain 
organizations including the communist party which has the right to 
choose 100 deputies 
the election reform did not say whether the party members would 
vote directly on multiple candidates for their seats and kremlin 
watchers were waiting for todays plenum to find out 
the official news agency tass reported that party members 
suggested 31500 nominees but these were winnowed down and finally 
just 100 were chosen by the 12member ruling politburo those 100 
candidates were nominated by the partys 300member central 
committee today tass said 
but rankandfile party members wont have the chance to vote on 
the partys candidates tass said only party leaders will cast 
ballots in a special meeting march 15 and 16 and they will not have 
a choice of candidates 
still president mikhail s gorbachev told the central committee 
he expects a variety of political platforms to emerge in the public 
campaign tass said gorbachev offered a draft platform to the plenum 
today but details were not released 
the soviet people are entitled to know the objectives and tasks 
formulated by the party for the immediate future and the platform 
it takes to elections gorbachev said 
we should proceed from the premise that the other social 
organizations will come to the elections with their own campaign 
documents and individual candidates can also offer their views 
gorbachev said 
gorbachev was referring to other national organizations 
including trade unions and scientific groups which have been 
empowered to directly elect deputies to the congress the communist 
party is the only legal political party in the soviet union 
gorbachev also expressed satisfaction that most candidates 
nominated so far in the threemonth election campaign are supporters 
of his restructuring policy called perestroika 
under the political reform he championed the new congress will 
meet once a year to elect a working parliament of 424 members and 
retaining the name of the old rubberstamp parliament the supreme 
soviet 
tass said that before the party formally elects its 100 deputies 
all communists will have an opportunity to express their attitude 
to any of the candidates 
those actually voting for the communist partys legislators will 
be the members of its central committee its auditing commission 
first secretaries of the republic and regional party organizations 
second secretaries of the republic party organizations presidents 
and prime ministers of the republics ministers and heads of state 
agencies and commanders of military districts tass said

the government said tuesday it opposes 
legalizing a group of independent journalists who reject the 
governmentbacked professional organization set up after the 1981 
martiallaw crackdown 
government spokesman jerzy urban said a final decision on whether 
to legalize the association of polish journalists will be made by 
city administrators in warsaw but the central government takes a 
firm political position against it 
in practice urbans statement appeared to doom the application 
drafted at a meeting over the weekend for the legal revival of the 
journalists association dissolved seven years ago 
the government is decisively against organizational divisions 
of the journalistic community by political directions we speak for 
maintaining one professional organization gathering people of 
various views urban said at his weekly news conference 
he said the government especially opposes legalizing this group 
because its leaders collaborate with radio free europe the 
usfinanced radio station that broadcasts uncensored news to 
eastern europe 
asked how the stance could be reconciled with government promises 
of greater freedom of association under legislation being drafted 
for the parliament urban said that obviously any new bill will 
retain restrictions of a political kind 
the association of polish journalists with about 7600 members 
was dissolved in 1982 because its leadership was considered 
prosolidarity it was replaced by an association of journalists 
of the polish peoples republic that supported martial law 
urban said the new association has 8700 members about 80 
percent of whom were in the old group he said 90 percent of polish 
journalists are members 
many journalists who refused to join the organization lost jobs 
in the staterun press or were shunted aside to obscure publications 
during a verification of political views that followed the 
martiallaw crackdown the new organization accepted the 
verification campaign 
about 300 press and broadcast journalists gathered for the 
twoday meeting in warsaw over the weekend and voted to ask for 
registration of their old association 
with the former associations chairman stefan bratkowski 
presiding at the meeting they said that recent government promises 
of political pluralism and reform made it seem the right time to 
seek reinstatement 
while announcing the position urban defended the governments 
record on the press 
the freedom of expression of various views in poland has 
recently been very broad and is still expanding he said 
journalists of opposition character have broader and broader 
opportunities for work 
dariusz fikus deputy chairman of the polish journalists 
association when it was dissolved said he was disappointed by the 
government stance 
i think it is pure nonsense he said if mr urban treats 
pluralism in the polish press seriously and agrees that various 
orientations exist why cant there be two journalists 
organizations 
he said that the application for reinstatment of the organization 
was still being prepared and would be filed in the next few days 
in a related development urban at his news conference said there 
was a possibility for future legalization of a banned students 
group the independent students association 
members of the group which existed legally before martial law 
came to a meeting of young people at communist party headquarters 
friday and were thanked by a top party official for offering 
criticisms of official policies

the kremlins top envoy to afghanistan said tuesday 
there is serious danger the soviets wont resume their troop 
pullout in time to meet a feb 15 deadline for a total red army 
withdrawal from afghanistan 
the statement from yuli m vorontsov was the plainest yet from a 
soviet official that the kremlin may delay or freeze its military 
withdrawal from afghanistan which by unbrokered accord is to be 
completed by the middle of next month 
however it was not clear whether vorontsovs comments to 
moscowbased reporters signaled a change in soviet intent or were 
designed to pressure moslem guerrillas fighting afghanistans 
moscowbacked government to accede to peace proposals floated by the 
kremlin including talks between the insurgents and the government 
of president najib 
the soviets announced last fall they had completed the first half 
of the withdrawal of their more than 100000 soldiers from 
afghanistan they have not yet announced when the pullout of the 
remaining 50000 troops would begin 
five weeks from a unset deadline that the soviet union agreed 
in april to observe vorontsov said it was still too early to talk 
about the schedule 
asked if the soviets might delay or suspend the pullout of the 
remaining troops vorontsov who is also soviet first deputy foreign 
minister said its a serious danger things might shape up in 
such a way that the soviet union will be unable to do what in 
principle weve decided to do 
the diplomat blamed the continuation of hostilities in 
afghanistan on diehard elements among the resistance and 
continued military support from the united states 
we dont see from the united states any indication of its 
genuine desire to work for an afghan settlement vorontsov told 
the government news briefing us arms continue to be shipped to 
guerrillas in afghanistan 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the us 
administration expects the soviets to hold to the feb 15 pullout 
date 
we still expect them to meet the deadline fitzwater said 
i dont believe weve had any official notification to the 
contrary the last thing they officially told us was that they 
would be out 
state department spokesman charles e redman said the soviets had 
taken preparatory steps a few days ago to resume a troop withdrawal 
i am not going to go into specifics in terms of what that means 
in actual units or of people crossing borders other than to say we 
have indications that it has resumed he said there certainly 
is no reason they cannot be out by feb 15 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar in stockholm 
sweden said he was sure the soviet union would pull all of its 
troops out in time to meet the unarranged deadline 
as well as brandishing the threat of a continued soviet military 
presence in afghanistan vorontsov used his appearance before moscow 
reporters to make political overtures to the guerrillas saying his 
talks last week with afghan opposition figures in pakistan and iran 
convinced him a political settlement to afghanistans 10yearold 
civil war is possible 
the main issue now is the formation by the afghans themselves 
of a broadbased government where all opposing groups and basic 
political forces of the country would be represented vorontsov 
said this is something thats quite logical and this is a 
conclusion that those who are directly involved are coming very 
close to now 
guerrilla leaders who ended talks in pakistan with vorontsov on 
saturday refused monday to resume direct talks with the soviet 
union contending the kremlin was trying to secure a place for its 
communist allies in a postwar government 
because the soviets use threats look for war rather than 
peace and disrespect afghans right of selfdetermination we 
believe that negotiations are unproductive and unnecessary said 
sibghatullah mojaddidi a spokesman for the usbacked guerrillas 
based in pakistan 
mojaddidi said the soviets were trying to impose a government 
of their choice on afghans and said the soviets threatened to 
supply najibs government with new weapons if their terms were not 
accepted 
vorontsov said the kremlin is seeking the formation of a national 
afghan assembly called a jurgah to represent all parties in the 
country he indicated moscow will continue to insist on inclusion of 
najibs government and peoples democratic party of afghanistan in 
the assembly 
if it just brings together the alliance of seven the alliance 
of eight or some new alliance of 15 then there could be no use 
that could be derived from that council vorontsov said referring 
to various coalitions of afghan insurgent factions 
he said the soviets had not received a reply from afghan 
insurgents about the creation of a national assembly but added i 
think they have understood that its only diehard fanatics who 
proclaim their wish and intention to continue the bloodletting 
we keep the door to negotiations open 
vorontsov said that since jan 1 soviet troops had joined afghan 
government forces in a ceasefire and will not fire unless 
attacked by the armed opposition 
mojaddidi on monday ruled out participation by the guerrillas in 
the ceasefire which had been sought by vorontsov but said they 
would not attack departing soviet soldiers 
the soviets intervened military in afghanistan in december 1979 
to prop up its battleweary communists with more than 100000 red 
army troops but in april 1988 after unsponsored talks in 
geneva the kremlin agreed to bring all its troops home by 
midfebruary 1989

agents from the norfolk va field office on charges of espionage 
gathering or delivering classified information to a foreign 
government and disclosure of classified information said fbi 
spokesman charles w steinmetz 
steinmetz said the arrest resulted from an undercover 
investigation by the fbi and the naval investigative service that 
began last month we did stop him from providing the information 
to the soviets he said 
the suspect was arrested while trying to sell classified 
information to an undercover agent posing as a soviet spy according 
to a source familiar with the case 
the investigation was triggered when the suspect telephoned the 
soviet embassy in washington with an offer to pass along secret 
information said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
telephone calls to the soviet embassy are routinly monitored by 
us counterintelligence agencies 
kunkle a 12year veteran of the navy who was discharged in 1985 
could be given a life sentence if convicted 
a private investigator and security guard in the norfolk area 
kunkle had served in antisubmarine squadrons in the pacific and 
atlantic fleets during his navy career steinmetz said kunkle held 
a secret clearance the spokesman said 
kunkles activities were unrelated to the norfolkarea spy ring 
spearheaded by former naval officer john walker who is serving a 
life sentence for selling valuable navy secrets to the soviets

since june a million tires have been 
shredded and hauled away from a tire dump here the shredding ends 
this week completing destruction of a major mosquito breeding 
ground 
the tires had been home to the dreaded asian tiger mosquitoes 
which were thought to have been imported from asia inside used tires 
brought to jacksonville for recapping 
mayor tommy hazouri tossed a ceremonial last tire in the shredder 
monday although 3000 to 4000 still remain to be shredded the 
work is being done by the oxford tire co of buffalo ny 
im extremely happy to see that our city has taken the 
necessary steps to eliminate a serious health and fire hazard its 
wonderful to see this 12acre site become usable land again 
hazouri said 
night foreman norm park said the work would be finished by 
wednesday and grass will be planted on the site later this week 
the site was called the frasier tire dump after the retreading 
company that first began dumping unusable tires there 
ann shorstein an aide to hazouri said she is optimistic the 
city will be able to recoup the 538000 it paid for the project 
through a new exise tax on tires the law which took effect jan 1 
adds 50 cents to the price of a new tire this year and 1 next year 
workers at the frasier tire dump had been shredding since june 
21 six days a week up to 20 hours a day 
the shredded tire chips about the size of charcoal briquets are 
sold by oxford to a greek firm titan cement co which uses the 
rubber for industrial fuel in a cement plant in athens 
oxford hired an entomologist to ensure that neither the 
mosquitoes nor their eggs could survive the shredding 
the asian mosquitoes are more aggressive than native mosquitoes 
and can withstand lower temperatures officials said they also have 
been known to carry dengue fever which in rare cases can be fatal

exhibition planners went out on a limb in 
hanging a familiar painting by georgia okeeffe upsidedown from 
what her fans are used to but a curator says that was what the 
artist wanted 
at the wadsworth atheneum which owns the 1929 painting the 
lawrence tree the work was hung with the tree extending from the 
lower righthand corner of the canvas the painting depicts a 
ponderosa pine okeeffe encountered on dh lawrences taos nm 
ranch 
but since the painting has been part of a traveling retrospective 
of okeeffes work organized by the national gallery of art in 
washington dc it has been hung with the base of the tree at the 
top left corner 
the position was changed because of a 1930 photograph and a 1931 
letter by the artist that were made available to exhibition planners 
by okeeffes longtime companion and the manager of her estate said 
elizabeth kornhauser the wadsworths curator of american painting 
sculpture and drawing 
when okeeffe sold the painting to the wadsworth she indicated 
to us that it could be hung in any direction kornhauser said 
tuesday of course you have to keep in mind that a lot of 
time had elapsed betwen 1929 and 1979 when we bought the painting 
the artist died in 1986 at age 98 
however the new evidence shows the artist cared very much about 
the position at the time she did the work 
a photograph of a 1930 exhibit of the painting hung by okeeffe 
herself shows the tree with its trunk extending from the top also 
in a letter from okeeffe to a friend written in 1931 she 
complained that in a later exhibition the work was hung the opposite 
way and that was not what she had in mind 
when the painting was first exhibited in the newold position at 
the national gallery there was quite a big outcry kornhauser 
said 
people do know the picture and have gotten used to it the other 
way said katie ziglar the national gallerys public information 
specialist they blinked and said whats this 
kornhauser said she is convinced that the retrospective is 
correct in the way it is displaying the painting and the atheneum 
will follow suit when the painting is returned later this year

hungary said tuesday some soviet 
soldiers would be leaving its soil soon but it was vague in making 
the first announcement of action on mikhail s gorbachevs pledge to 
withdraw forces from eastern europe 
in a speech dec 7 at the united nations the soviet leader 
promised to reduce military forces by half a million in two years 
and pull 50000 troops and 5000 tanks out of east germany 
czechoslovakia and hungary 
gorbachevs commitment was seen as a boost to eastwest talks in 
vienna on reducing conventional forces in europe which could begin 
by march 
colgen ferenc karpati the defense minister said in a 
television interview tuesday the preparations for withdrawing some 
of the 62000 red army troops from hungary were nearly complete he 
said an armored division was among the units scheduled to leave 
the official news agency mti quoted communist party chief karoly 
grosz as telling the japanese newspaper nihon keizai the pullout 
is to commence within weeks but neither he nor karpati gave a 
date 
karpati refused to name a date when asked later by an associated 
press reporter he said the gorbachev speech indicated withdrawal 
would be more likely late this year but it could also be a 
shorter period sooner the preparatory work is ending 
he would not answer a question about whether a symbolic 
withdrawal of a small force might come before the vienna talks on 
conventional forces begin 
the defense minister said pulling out some red army forces was a 
political step intended to show the world the soviet union is 
not insisting on the idea of having troops in these countries 
hungary a leading proponent of reform in the soviet bloc has 
welcomed gorbachevs plans for reduced defense spending and 
political liberalization 
in the hungarian parliament tuesday members debated two new laws 
on freedom of assembly and association that should give citizens the 
right to hold demonstrations and form independent organizations and 
political parties 
several deputies objected to a provision in the bill on 
associations that in effect would prevent political parties from 
being active until next year 
votes were scheduled for wednesday 
dozens of independent political groups have sprung up in recent 
months many with specific platforms at least two are fullfledged 
parties and want to enter candidates in the 1990 elections 
frigyes puja a former foreign minister voicing the reservations 
of more conservative communists asked that reference to political 
parties be removed and a separate statute regulating parties be 
passed next year 
justice minister kalman kulcsar said in the debate the rights of 
association and assembly are inalienable he also outlined plans 
to make hungary the second nation in the soviet bloc after poland to 
allow an alternative to compulsory military service 
karpati said in the tv interview the alternativeservice program 
should become law by midyear about 100 hungarians are in jail for 
refusing to serve the required 18 months in the army 
poland and hungary have serious economic problems including 
large debts to western banks and are reducing their defense 
budgets after gorbachev promised the soviet troop withdrawals 
karpati announced cuts in defense spending for 1989 of 17 percent in 
real terms 
in a speech made public over the weekend gorbachev said 
preliminary study had shown soviet defense spending could be reduced 
without endangering security 
hungary pioneered economic reform in the soviet bloc during the 
1960s but stalled in the 1970s grosz is promoting marketoriented 
changes in hopes of improving the economy and reducing the 17 
billion foreign debt highest per capita in the eastern bloc 
price increases for many foodstuffs took effect monday thousands 
of workers in northeastern hungary held a 10minute warning strike 
and official trade unions demanded wage hikes to catch up 
statistics published tuesday said 26 million of hungarys 106 
million people were officially classified as poor in 1987 no 
figures are available for 1988

an insurance broker has pleaded guilty to 
making illegal campaign contributions in a scheme to help reelect 
us sen alan cranston because of his outspoken support for israel 
michael b altman of the sherman oaks area faces a maximum of one 
year in prison and a 360000 fine when he is sentenced march 27 by 
us district judge ronald lew 
altman pleaded guilty monday to a single misdemeanor count of 
aiding proisrael activist michael r goland in making illegal 
campaign donations during the 1986 election narrowly won by 
cranston a democrat he also agreed to testify against goland and 
two other men charged in the case 
authorities said cranston was not involved in the scheme 
goland and two associates plotted to support cranston who was 
outspokenly proisrael in the campaign by illegally contributing 
120000 to the campaign of american independent party candidate ed 
vallen the indictment alleged 
goland and the two associates have pleaded innocent to four 
felony counts in the same case the others charged are lyle r 
weisman 31 of beverly hills and sandor e habalow 45 of west 
los angeles 
prosecutors said the aim of the scheme was to win some support 
for vallen through a television campaign that would siphon votes 
away from republican challenger ed zschau thus improving cranstons 
chances for victory 
after paying for production of the advertisement the defendants 
in order to circumvent federal election laws limiting the size of 
individual donations sought 120000 in contributions from 55 
individuals who were later reimbursed for amounts ranging from 
1000 to 4000 prosecutors said 
vallen wound up getting 109916 votes in the election about 
5000 more than cranstons slim victory margin over zschau

criminal defendants have no constitutional 
right to talk to their lawyers during brief trial recesses the 
supreme court ruled tuesday 
by a 63 vote in a case from south carolina the justices said 
trial judges in the interest of furthering the search for truth 
may prevent a defendant about to undergo crossexamination from 
conferring with his or her attorney 
in other decisions the court 
ruled unanimously that states may tax all telephone calls even 
interstate calls charged to instate numbers the court upheld a 5 
percent tax imposed by illinois which raises 10 million a month 
for the state 
the justices were told that 10 other states have similar taxes 
they are arkansas colorado florida minnesota new mexico ohio 
oklahoma texas washington and wisconsin 
clarified in an important decision for anyone suing a 
government worker for alleged civil rights violations how to 
determine filing deadlines for such lawsuits the 90 decision said 
a man who accused two police officers at the state university of new 
york of beating him did not wait too long to sue 
in the trialrecess case justice john paul stevens wrote for the 
court when a defendant becomes a witness he has no 
constitutional right to consult with his lawyer while he is 
testifying 
the truth more likely may emerge if a defendant who has been 
testifying and is about to undergo crossexamination is not allowed 
to talk to his attorney stevens said the search for truth will be 
aided even if the defendant was not about to receive improper 
coaching from his lawyer during the break he continued 
permitting a witness to consult with counsel after direct 
examination but before crossexamination grants the witness an 
opportunity to regroup and regain a poise and sense of strategy that 
the unaided witness would not possess stevens said 
the court in 1976 ruled that a defendants right to help from his 
lawyer was violated when he was barred from talking with the lawyer 
during an overnight recess 
but brief recesses are different stevens said because 
lawyerclient talks during such breaks would be limited to the 
defendants own testimony during an overnight recess the talks 
could encompass such broader matters as the availability of other 
witnesses trial tactics or even the possibility of negotiating a 
plea bargain he said 
the constitution guarantees a defendant will be allowed to talk 
to his lawyer about such matters stevens said 
justice thurgood marshall in a dissenting opinion said the 
ruling is a lapse in this courts commitment to fundamental 
fairness for criminal defendants 
marshall said prosecution witnesses generally are free to confer 
with the prosecutor during brief recesses 
also he said the search for truth could be furthered by a few 
soothing words from counsel to the agitated or nervous defendant 
facing the awesome power of the state 
justices william j brennan and harry a blackmun joined 
marshalls dissent 
voting with stevens were chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and 
anthony m kennedy 
the ruling upheld the conviction of donald ray perry sentenced 
to life in prison for murder kidnapping and criminal assault in the 
killing of mary heimberger her body was found march 7 1981 in a 
wooded area in richland county sc 
perry confessed to police that he shot the victim but said it 
was an accident 
ms heimberger had been raped shot in both kneecaps and fatally 
shot in the chest 
perry was barred from talking to his lawyer during a 15minute 
trial recess 
he filed a federal court appeal in 1985 and a judge ruled that 
his rights had been violated 
but the 4th us circuit court of appeals reinstated the 
conviction in 1987 
the appeals court said there must be evidence that denying a 
defendant the opportunity to confer with his attorney prejudiced the 
case against the defendant before his conviction can be overturned 
the supreme court did not adopt that reasoning citing the case 
of the overnight recess stevens said there are instances when the 
defendant must be allowed to confer with his lawyer without any 
proof of prejudice but brief recesses do not qualify for that 
treatment stevens said

greek and american officials on tuesday 
began a new round of bases talks the first since an accord 
governing their operation expired last month 
the round of talks the 13th since negotiations began in november 
1987 are not expected to make much headway toward a new agreement 
on the four installations 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos would not comment on the 
talks he said a statement would be issued after negotiators brief 
premier andreas papandreou at their conclusion thursday 
a fiveyear agreement giving the united states access to the 
bases two near athens and two on the southern aegean sea island of 
crete expired dec 20 
under the old accord the united states has 17 months to 
dismantle the bases or negotiate a new agreement 
a major obstacle blocking a new agreement is papandreous 
insistence that the united states help solve greeces disputes with 
neighboring turkey over military control of the aegean its seabed 
mineral rights and the cyprus problem 
us officials have said they dont want to involve regional 
disputes in the bilateral bases talks 
papandreou who has said he will hold a national referendum on 
the installations is expected to use the bases issue to attract 
leftist votes in the june elections 
popular support for the ruling panhellenic socialist movement has 
eroded in recent months after scandals implicated senior government 
and party officials 
the premier has already said his government plans to scrap one of 
the us installations hellenikon air force base adjacent to

study conducted by the american association of clinical chemistry 
another expert said a problem of accuracy still exists among the 
150 to 200 american laboratories that test for drugs 
however frings said the aacc does not extrapolate these 
findings to say that all labs do good drug testing we maintain that 
labs that follow key procedures can test at a very high accuracy 
frings a professor at the university of alabama birmingham 
said the overall error rate of 3 percent in the associations study 
included no findings of false positives meaning that none of the 
drugfree samples was inaccurately identified as showing evidence of 
drug use 
the study involved sending urine samples that had been 
adulterated with drugs to 31 selected laboratories that agreed to 
the accuracy test the test specimens were disguised so the 
labortories could not identify them and they were included with 
other samples that were to be routinely tested 
the laboratories had no way of knowing when they received the 
test specimens said frings 
each of the samples was tested for evidence of five different 
drugs cocaine marijuana opiates amphetamines and phencyclidine 
pcp 
frings said 29 percent of the laboratories scored an accuracy of 
100 percent 64 percent had an accuracy of 97 percent or higher and 
the lowest score was 89 percent he declined to identify the 
laboratories or to give a numerical breakdown of the findings 
all of the laboratories included in the study had participated 
earlier in an open proficiency test by the association and frings 
said the labs that participated in the new study all complied with 
the standards approved by the association 
kenneth h davis jr senior research chemist at the research 
triangle institute in north carolina and a coauthor of a federal 
study on laboratory accuracies published last september in the 
journal of the american medical association said in a telephone 
interview that results in the associations study could be biased by 
the prequalifying of the test laboratories used in the blind test 
davis said his survey of 50 laboratories showed 69 percent of the 
samples were tested accurately in blind surveys about 82 percent of 
the tests were accurate in open surveys when the laboratories knew 
which samples were being tested he said the false positives in his 
study ranged up to 16 percent 
a problem does still exist in the accuracy of testing for 
drugs davis said however he agreed with the association that with 
proper facilities personnel and techniques i see no reason why 
drug testing canot be extremely accurate 
drugtesting accuracy has become a subject of rising interest 
partly because of president reagans 1986 order calling for a 
drugfree federal workplace a federal program calls for the random 
testing of workers and an estimated 50000 federal employees were 
tested last year despite court challenges the number to be tested 
this year could pass 200000 officials say and there are plans 
later this year to require testing of millions of transportation 
workers in private business 
many cases challenging the constitutionality of drug testing are 
on appeal in federal courts

when a library evicted muffin the cat 
from its corridors and crannies after seven years residence a 
93yearold animal lover was so miffed she wrote the library out of 
her will 
everybody loved that cat marjorie horton who had planned to 
leave the putnam valley library as much as 30000 said tuesday 
i was furious i wrote them a nice letter im not some young 
snotnose but no one listened now not one penny will go to the 
library 
muffin appeared on the doorstep of the privately run library as a 
kitten one cold february night seven years ago and settled 
comfortably among the volumes of chaucer shakespeare tolstoy 
eliot and the rest 
but her fate took a dickensian turn last year 
amid allegations that muffin had swatted some children without 
provocation and more importantly that one of the library trustees 
was allergic to cats the facility set about finding the tabby a new 
home 
muffin was formally evicted by a trustees vote in september 
although she stayed on for a few more months while a new home was 
found and her supporters wrote letters and gathered petition 
signatures 
we had to make a decision said peter grosewald library 
board chairman the only issue is access we have to assure access 
to everybody 
grosewald said the unidentified trustee a volunteer like the 
rest complained that she could not work in the library despite 
taking allergy shots and efforts to confine the cat to an upstairs 
room 
the trustee offered to resign he said but the board decided 
that in light of other complaints about allergic reactions and the 
alleged swipes at children it was muffin who had to go 
the september vote which was confidential prompted threatening 
phone calls grosewald said 
former trustee kathleen devlin who gathered 300 signatures to 
keep muffin pointed out that the cat had earned her keep as a 
mouser 
i feel so badly about that cat said mrs horton who had 
split her time between putnam valley and manhattan for more than 80 
years before moving permanently to manhattan with her own cat last 
year 
she said grosewald didnt even answer her letter on the cats 
behalf and that a new will has been drafted directing that whatever 
money remains after her death be divided among three animal shelters 
grosewald emphasizes that muffin now has a good home and that 
access to the library has been opened to everyone 
he said the library relies on contributions and donations but 
that mrs hortons money wasnt everything even if it were a 
million dollars it would still be a hard choice

syrianbacked shiite militiamen buried 
their dead tuesday but vowed a fight to the finish against 
iranianbacked rivals rejecting moves from damascus and tehran to 
halt three days of savage battle 
police said seven people were killed and 20 wounded in tuesdays 
fighting bringing the total to 87 dead and 220 injured since sunday 
militiamen of the mainstream amal used syrianprovided tanks 
howitzers and rocket launchers to bombard a mountain enclave where 
they have trapped rival hezbollah militiamen but they failed to 
dislodge the fundamentalists from their strategic perch 
a police spokesman said the hezbollahis have shaken off 
repeated assaults on jbaa 10 miles southeast of the provincial 
capital sidon 
the village is the key to a triangular stronghold where 500 
proiranian fighters are under siege just northwest of israels 
selfproclaimed security zone 
the police spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
said about 1000 amal fighters were attacking in a pincer movement 
in damascus the syrian capital president hafez assed met irans 
first deputy foreign minister ali mohammed besharati to discuss 
the situation syrias official news agency reported without 
elaboration 
shiite sources said besharati is expected in beirut to mediate 
between the warring factions 
however one amal commander vowed there will be no ceasefire 
there is no room for negotiations with the iranian delegates 
there is no room for any truce our decision is to finish off 
hezbollah in the south said area commander atef aoun 
nearly 500 people have been killed and 1500 wounded since the 
rival militias first clashed in april in an ongoing battle to 
dominate the 1 million shiites who are the biggest sect among 
lebanons 4 million people 
amal on monday recaptured a chain of hilltop villages in iklim 
eltiffah or apple province which hezbollah had seized sunday 
police said both groups have committed horrific atrocities 
aoun spoke in kfar filla village 12 miles west of jbaa during 
a funeral procession for five militiamen 
women ululated in grief waving photographs of the deceased and 
chanting antiiranian slogans 
death to khomeini death to the party of satan they wailed 
as male mourners several in fatigues and toting automatic rifles 
yelled the islamic war cry allahu akbar or god is great 
the police spokesman said hezbollah fighters now were sandwiched 
in a narrow ninesquaremile strip between advancing amal forces and 
the western flank of the israeli security zone 
they also are entrenched in two nearby hamlets and some pine 
woods 
sheik kamel wehbeh jbaas imam or preacher told the reporters 
the regions predominantly shiite population does not want 
hezbollah which commits massacres kills prisoners and destroys 
villages 
wehbeh who suffered shrapnel wounds in the neck left arm and 
left leg during a tour of the region monday spoke from his bed in 
sidons hammoud hospital 
the police spokesman said about 15000 predominantly shiite 
civilians have fled their villages and sought refuge in 
amalcontrolled regions of south lebanon 
he said hezbollah gunmen stabbed to death several civilians and 
amal militiamen some of the victims were found with their 
throats cut and others with their heads chopped off 
hezbollah wants to create an islamic republic in lebanon 
fashioned after ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis iran the more secular 
amal rejects irans influence 
amal drove hezbollah out of most of south lebanon in a fourday 
crackdown in april less than a month later hezbollah retaliated 
and drove amal out of south beirut slums in a threeweek 
confrontation 
syria the main power broker in lebanon sent in its army to 
quell the fighting but violence erupted again in november and 
spilled over into west beirut

outgoing commerce secretary c william verity 
likened the nations space agency to a glorified trucking 
operation tuesday and said government is not stepping aside fast 
enough to allow private enterprise to flourish in space 
our interest in space quite simply has outgrown the space 
agency verity said consequently its time to rethink that 
agencys mission i suggest we recognize that nasa should do what 
was envisioned in its original charter 30 years ago nasa should be 
responsible for promoting space science research and exploration 
speaking to the space business roundtable whose members include 
representatives of companies doing business in space verity said 
government must quit competing 
there can be no real private sector space commerce if 
government is intimately involved in the planning ownership and 
operation of the underlying infrastructure he said by 
exercising restraint in purchasing new hardware and facilities and 
instead purchasing services from you government can make way for 
private capital to be invested in the national space 
infrastructure 
the national aeronautics and space administration has financed 
the space shuttle and the space station at the expense of space 
science and exploration verity said 
only monday the reagan administration proposed to back the space 
station with 21 billion construction startup funds this year 
can we really justify spending 30 billion taxpayer dollars on 
something we arent sure how were going to use verity asked 
according to the commerce secretary nasa still seems to 
believe that the drama of humans in space is needed to win attention 
and congressional support but an unmanned space program could put 
the us back into frontline technology at far less cost 
he said he speaks not only as a government official but also as a 
grandfather who sees space as a place where his grandchildren will 
live and work 
will the future columbus study space science only to discover 
on graduation that his career options are limited to a government 
bureaucracy that runs a glorified trucking operation or a costplus 
contractor that just fills orders verity asked i hope that 
person finds a system with room for entrepeneurs and explorers

the bomb that blew up pan am flight 103 ruptured 
the fuselage in the area of the cargo hold just ahead of the wing 
and probably contained semtex plastic explosives authorities said 
tuesday 
initial examinations have established that the explosive device 
ruptured the fuselage on the left side in the area of the no 1 
cargobaggage hold just forward of the wing said a bulletin from 
the air accidents investigation branch 
it did not say what explosives were used but transport secretary 
paul channon said it was very probably but not certainly 
semtex 
the authorities did not disclose how they arrived at their 
conclusions 
semtex made in czechoslovakia is a powerful plastic explosive 
that is difficult to detect and is believed to be available to 
several terrorist groups 
the indications that semtex was used point to some 
wellorganized and wellsupplied terrorist group channon told 
parliament 
it is too early to say yet where the article which contained 
the explosive originated he said 
although czechoslovakia denied it was semtex that blew up flight 
103 on dec 21 it is sending four experts to britain to assist the 
investigation foreign office minister william waldegrave said they 
would arrive wednesday and thursday 
flight 103 blew up at 31000 feet killing all 259 people on 
board and 11 on the ground in lockerbie the scottish town that bore 
the brunt of the falling debris 
channon rejected accusations that the government refrained from 
warning the public of a bomb threat against pan am 
referring to evidence that us embassies were warned of a 
specific threat to blow up a pan am flight from frankfurt to london 
he said such warnings were constantly being received and in the 
rare circumstances where changes are needed in airport security 
these were implemented 
but in this case he said the british were given to understand 
that the threat had little credibility 
channon said the warning reached his department dec 9 in a 
federal aviation administration bulletin and as is usually the 
case it contained the explicit caveat that it was not to be further 
disseminated without the specific approval of the faas director of 
civil aviation security 
the warning identified the airline and the frankfurtus route 
he said but no mention was made of london and the warning 
threatened that an attack would take place within two weeks which 
expired before the tragedy took place on dec 21 
therefore he said it was decided that security at british 
airports was tight enough and no further measures were needed 
immediately after the bombing additional hold and cabin baggage 
checks were ordered along with tighter security around parked 
aircraft he said 
on jan 5 further measures were ordered in relation to cargo 
misrouted baggage and cabin baggage he said without elaborating 
he added that other longerterm measures are now being vigorously 
pursued 
channon promised to consider a suggestion by lawmaker michael 
colvin that every air ticket carry a 1 levy to raise 180 million a 
year for better security systems 
in lockerbie meanwhile police said tuesday they had recovered 
and identified another body from the crash they said they still 
were searching for the bodies of seven local residents and 21 
passengers 
police released for burial the body of lockerbie residents 
rosaleen somerville 40 whose husband john and children paul 
13 and lynsey 10 also died the childrens bodies are still 
missing

mountaineer tom whittaker once hovered 
between life and death for 10 days rallying out of the pain he 
incurred in a car accident to persuade doctors to save one of his 
feet 
nine years later equipped with a hightech artificial foot 
whittaker will join the american everest expedition with the goal in 
may of becoming the first handicapped climber to conquer the worlds 
highest peak 
watch out if he gets to the top of the world 
thatll blow my drawers off and it will take years to get the 
silly grin off my face he laughed 
then the man who has devoted his life to helping others overcome 
their handicaps addded 
its a challenge of life as much as a challenge of everest you 
have to reach deep into yourself to do something like this 
whittaker was driving back to his home in sun valley idaho from 
a thanksgiving holiday when an outofcontrol car struck his car 
headon he suffered multiple fractures and damage to both knees 
the original prognosis was they were going to take both feet 
off whittaker 40 recalled 
i managed to impress on them how important feet are to 
mountaineers i was able to convince them and they left my foot 
intact said whittaker who had moved from his native wales a year 
before 
surgeons repaired what they could and reconstructed what they 
could not of whittakers crushed legs his right foot had to be 
amputated but he still had his left and a desire to overcome his 
handicap and repay the kindness of a community 
before his accident the mountaineer with expeditions to the 
alps spanish pyrenees and alaskas mount mckinley had earned a 
masters degree in counseling at idaho state university and served 
as a graduate assistant in an outdoor recreation program 
the university established a relief fund that helped defray some 
of his 30000 in medical bills not covered by insurance the school 
also provided him with a room and living expenses during the three 
months he was bedridden 
i felt i had this debt of gratitude i wanted to pay back to the 
community so i put my masters degree in counseling to work in a 
local hospital helping others adjust to their handicaps whittaker 
said in a telephone interview from his pocatello home 
while giving a kayaking lesson to a struggling man with a spinal 
cord injury whittaker noticed tears pouring down the students face 
i feared i shouldnt have forced him and was trying to blurt 
out an apology whittaker said but he said hey whittaker 
youre way off base you dont need to apologize this is the first 
time ive felt alive in 2 years that basically gives me my 
validation for what i do now 
six years ago he started the universitys cooperative wilderness 
handicapped outdoor group with fewer than 20 students today 400 are 
enrolled and he lectures throughout the world 
the motto of our group is dare to be different the whole 
idea is to empower people with disabilities and help them with their 
personal rehabilitation he explained were ordinary people 
doing stuff were not outdoor jocks 
we have children 4 years old we have disabled people of up to 
72 years old in our program everybody from kids to grandfathers 
and grandmothers 
the courage of his students inspired whittaker too equipped 
with an artificial foot fashioned by a blacksmith friend he 
returned to the peaks climbing canadas notorious bugaboos during a 
snowstorm in 1981 and scaling the tough north face of wyomings 
grand teton in 1987 
but until three weeks ago a shot at conquering everest was a 
dream whittaker considered outofreach then came a call from the 
salt lake citybased american everest expedition 
the marchthroughmay expedition also includes new zealands 
peter hillary son of sir edmund hillary in 1953 the elder hillary 
and the sherpa guide tenzing norgay became the first men to conquer 
everest 
when i was involved in my car accident all hopes and dreams of 
aspiring to everest died for me whittaker said when the 
telephone rang and i was asked if i would like to go it just 
about knocked me off my stool 
expedition coleader peter athans of mt kisco ny said that 
while whittaker will be the first handicapped person to assault 
everest he is a very fit and active guy 
whittaker said if he conquers the mountain it will be on his own 
merits not on the backs of his teammates 
san diegos daw co is designing 40000 worth of new artificial 
feet to enable whittaker to handle a 150mile trek over snowfields 
to the mountains base camp and the climb itself 
i dont have to go to the top to have a fullfilling 
experience said whittaker who conceded highaltitude swelling 
and circulation problems with his stump could halt his ascent 
to be successful we just have to get one of our team 
members on the summit im a member of the team all i need to know 
is that ive tried hard and did well

delegates to the world conference on chemical 
weapons say privately the intense efforts to find common ground 
illustrate how hard it will be to achieve a ban 
public speeches evoke horrifying images of children frozen in 
anguished death from poison gas but national interests clash over 
what to do about it 
attention focused tuesday on arab demands to link a chemical 
weapons treaty with a nuclear ban this and deepseated conflicts 
paralyzed movement toward what american and french organizers hoped 
would be consensus 
even if wording is found for a political declaration in paris 
several delegates said the implications are not promising for 
negotiations in geneva that have made little headway toward a treaty 
in 10 years 
export controls on chemicals and technology are just too 
sensitive for the third world said a senior us delegate who 
like most others interviewed declined to be identified they wont 
have it this means we cant expect anything with teeth in it 
american negotiators want tough export controls to stop west 
germans and other europeans from selling chemicals that can be 
blended into poison gas or from providing the expertise needed to 
wage chemical warfare 
the germans want provisions for rapid challenge inspections 
which washington says are inconclusive and pose a problem in the 
united states where local courts protect access to private property 
there also is disagreement over dual use precursors or 
chemicals that are essential to poison gases but also useful for 
pesticides or even medicine 
let us not be fooled there are economic interests at stake 
here said an expert in the american delegation a west german 
official made a similar remark referring to the americans 
in the corridors spokesmen from several delegations spoke of 
inconsistencies of their rivals 
on tuesday three days after secretary of state george p shultz 
appealed for consciousness raising to abolish chemical weapons 
west german reporters noted the new american budget provides for two 
new chemical weapons plants 
some middle eastern countries and nations that profess 
nonalignment clearly were stalling to be able to keep chemical 
arsenals and others that favored a ban had conflicting interests 
western delegates said 
roberto de abreu sodre the brazilian foreign minister told the 
conference no accord should hamper the economic and social progress 
of nations a process in which the chemical industry certainly 
plays an important role 
he echoed the popular argument for banning chemical and nuclear 
weapons simultaneously nations without nuclear capacity should not 
be stripped of their only deterrent 
in an interview later he said brazil opposed chemical weapons 
but was raising concerns heard among delegates of advanced 
developing countries 
newly industrialized countries produce not only chemicals but 
weapons systems and several are suspicious of measures that might 
limit them as competitors or allow international access to their 
trade secrets 
african states worry as much about toxic wastes dumped by 
industrial countries as about the threat of chemical weapons in 
their region 
we have been chosen as a dumpsite for these dangerous 
substances and we must guard against this said mamadou dagra of 
niger 
soviet arms negotiator np smidovitch asked in an interview 
what moscow did not want to see in the paris declaration replied 
i cant think of anything we would object to this is a 
political conference and we should have a consensus document 
nicaraguan delegate julio icasa told the associated press 
we dont agree with the arab league position to link chemical 
and nuclear weapons we just want to rid the world of this stuff 
asked whether anyone in central america had chemical weapons he 
laughed and said only the asphyxiating gas of debt and the poison 
of us intervention

a biomedical foundation is establishing a 
pension plan for 81 aidsinfected chimpanzees 
the southwest foundation for biomedical research plans to invest 
more than 177 million over the next 10 years into chimpanzee 
retirement accounts that are expected to grow into 29 million 
through the year 2026 officials said 
we always have had a moral obligation to take care of the 
animals that we use but we can have the best intentions in the 
world but if we dont have the money there is little that we can 
do for them john speck controller of the biomedical foundation 
the fund will help in their care and is sure to be enough to buy 
bunches of bananas and lots of apples cucumbers celery and 
watermelon over the next 40 years for the chimpanzees who cannot be 
used for other research after being exposed to aids 
but roger fouts a psychology professor at central washington 
university in ellensberg who has studied chimpanzees for 20 years 
said the biomedical foundations humanitarian attempt is admirable 
but it might not be enough 
if you look at 3 million for about 40 years thats bare 
minimum he said giving a chimp enough food enough water and 
making sure that they have a dry and warm cage doesnt seem to be 
enough 
foundation officials said the chimps exposed to the aids virus 
have shown no signs they have developed the fatal disease it is 
probable the chimps will live their normal life span of about 40 
years or more pushing their care bill to 5000 each annually they 
said 
the biomedical foundation is among the leading facilities 
worldwide that conducts aids research using primates 
speck and dr jorg eichberg director of veterinary resources 
began discussing two years ago how to pay for care for the chimps 
and started the investment program in the spring 
eichberg who in june 1983 became the first scientist to infect a 
chimpanzee with the aids virus said he hopes the chimp retirement 
program would silence animals rights groups critical of the 
foundations use of animals for experiments 
we are really genuinely concerned that these animals get the 
best treatment available eichberg says we have to combine our 
emotions with pragmatism in our work and i think we have done a 
pretty good job 
but fouts said research groups should do more for the chimpanzees 
they must ensure that they lead as much as possible a normal 
life he said what we have with chimpanzees is a species that 
has been exploited by biomedical concerns but this attempt by the 
southwest foundation to help the chimpanzees is an admirable one

the incoming bush administration gave a 
highlevel advisory panel the goahead tuesday to begin work in 
earnest on forging a solution to the federal governments huge 
deficit problems 
officials of the national economic commission said they had 
received word from treasury secretary nicholas brady who will stay 
on as the bush administrations chief economic spokesman that bush 
will be looking for the panels report march 1 
commission cochairman drew lewis said the panel would not have a 
problem meeting that reporting date some commission members hailed 
news of the early deadline as a sign bush may actively use the panel 
in his effort to reach a budget compromise with congress 
the 14member commission split evenly between republicans and 
democrats was created by congress with the hopes that the panel 
could come up with a deficitreduction package that would be 
politically acceptable to the new administration and to congress 
last month bush made his two appointments to the panel 
selecting former sen paul laxalt rnev and longtime friend 
former rep thomas ashley dohio the stature of those appointments 
had eased fears that bush would ignore the panels eventual 
recommendations 
ashley who attended his first commission meeting along with 
laxalt on tuesday said he viewed the march 1 reporting date as an 
indication the bush administration had a strategy for reducing the 
budget deficit that included the commissions report 
the new administration feels it would be more helpful if we 
report early when the advice would be more timely said ashley 
who has been a close bush friend since their days together at yale 
i think there is an overall bush strategy on the economy some 
portions of which havent been announced yet which forms the 
backdrop for this decision on a march reporting date ashley said 
march 1 was the deadline for the commissions recommendations 
that had been set by law but the law also gave bush the power to 
extend the reporting date to sept 1 there was speculation that 
bush might choose the later date in an effort to play down the 
significance of any recommendations the commission makes 
bush was critical of the panel during the presidential campaign 
saying that it was little more than a stalking horse for tax 
increases which bush has vowed to oppose 
since winning election however bush has stressed the importance 
he places on reducing the federal deficit partly to calm fears of 
foreign investors who have an increasing stake in the us economy 
president reagan sent congress his final budget plan monday 
recommending spending of 115 trillion in the 1990 fiscal year 
however to reach a deficit goal of 925 billion reagans budget 
called for sharp cuts in many domestic programs efforts which have 
failed in the past 
bush has said he will unveil his own budget proposals soon after 
taking office 
the deficit commission began two days of hearings tuesday on 
economic assumptions and a review of deficitreduction proposals 
submitted to the commission by various special interest groups and 
research organizations 
the advisory panel which is headed by lewis a republican and 
by democrat robert strauss has scheduled a string of hearings in 
january and february to craft a plan originally those hearings 
were to be held in secret but a group of news organizations won a 
court victory last week when a federal judge ruled that the sessions 
had to be in public 
at tuesdays meeting strauss asked for the commissions legal 
counsel to determine whether the openmeeting requirement would 
prohibit him from discussing deficitcutting proposals with other 
commission members if less than a quorum was present 
commission members have wrangled publicly over whether new taxes 
are needed to erase the budget deficit which is expected to rise to 
161 billion this year 
lewis former transportation secretary in the reagan 
administration and now chairman of union pacific said tuesday there 
was a possibility that the commission might be forced to issue a 
majority and a minority report 
he said it would be very hard to get a consensus of 10 to 12 
members voting for a deficitcutting package that is the type of 
unanimity many believe will be necessary for the panels 
recommendations to have an impact with congress 
lewis said brady told him during a phone conversation tuesday 
that the commission should plan on meeting the march 1 deadline 
unless it hears otherwise from bush once he takes office jan 20 
lewis said there was a possibility that even after the commission 
issues its report it may be called back into session by the 
administration if a deadlock develops with congress over the budget 
if the presidentelect and congress cant solve this problem 
then we probably would be brought back into action lewis said 
lewis and strauss also met with reagan at the white house to 
bring him up to date on the panels activities

sovietborn conductor mstislav rostropovich 
will present the world premiere thursday of a musical satire 
secretly written nearly 30 years ago by the late composer dmitri 
shostakovich to express his contempt for the stalinist regime 
rostropovich told a news conference tuesday that until recently 
performing the 15minute theatrical piece entitled rayok in the 
soviet union would have meant being hidden away in a jail or 
sentenced to death 
but all that has changed with the very promising and very 
hopeful moves toward artistic freedom and repudiation of the 
stalinist era under soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs policy 
of glasnost or openness he said 
rostropovich a cello virtuoso and music director of the national 
symphony orchestra who fled the soviet union in 1974 was a close 
friend of shostakovich who died in moscow in 1975 rostropovich was 
stripped of his soviet citizenship in 1978 the year he was hired by 
the national symphony 
rayok which means little eden in russian will be 
performed publicly for the first time in the kennedy center concert 
hall with three more performances through tuesday 
the cast will include rostropovich at the piano four bass 
singers and a small mixed choir following shostakovichs meticulous 
stage directions contained in a foreword to the work 
the piece also will be performed sunday afternoon at carnegie 
hall in new york rostropovich said that maxim shostakovich the 
composers conductor son who defected to the united states in 1981 
was expected to attend the new york performance 
rostropovich said that today under gorbachev you can do this 
even in the soviet union although he knows of no plans for a 
public soviet performance 
he said he has no fears that his production might jeopardize the 
safety of shostakovichs family if i thought this would make it 
difficult for the family i wouldnt do it he said 
in words and music rayok is a scathing putdown of stalin 
and two of his senior officials in the soviet communist party 
hierarchy dmitri t shepilov and andrei zhdanov who directed a 
crackdown on soviet writers artists and musicians in the late 1940s 
about 1960 shostakovich wrote the score and a literary ally 
ln lebedinsky wrote the libretto for rayok it was based on 
speeches at a meeting of the partys central committee in 1948 where 
a host of prominent soviet composers including shostakovich and 
sergei prokofiev were denounced for formalistic tendencies and 
instructed to write music of realism for the masses 
privately rostropovich said shostakovich scorned zhdanov as an 
ignoramus whose claim to musical distinction was his ability to sing 
and play the piano with one finger 
publicly shostakovich confessed to his errors but nevertheless 
was kicked out of the moscow conservatory during a purge of the arts 
that even today is known as the zhdanovshchina 
shostakovich gave the four bass singers the roles of a master of 
ceremonies stalin shepilov and zhdanov according to his foreword 
the choir represents musical activists who greet the 
bureaucrats pronouncements with sycophantic delight and 
amusement 
rostropovich who until recently has cautiously reserved comment 
on gorbachevs domestic reforms called them very very positive 
at tuesdays news conference 
the changes that are taking place are very promising and very 
hopeful he said 
rostropovich said however that he has no plans to visit his 
homeland which he left nearly 15 years ago and where his name is 
rarely mentioned publicly by government authorities 
they have no time for me now he said 
once the recipient of the lenin prize and two stalin prizes and 
given the highest honor as peoples artist rostropovich sought 
exile in the west after he and his wife bolshoi opera soprano 
galina vishnevskaya suffered worsening government harassment 
including cancellation of foreign appearances and drastic 
curtailment of their activities in the soviet union 
it all depends on their approach to me rostropovich said 
if they are planning to do something like that theyll let me 
know im not asking to go washington is a very cozy place for me

nguyen co thach said after two days of meetings with the thai 
foreign minister siddhi savetsila who cautiously described them as 
good 
referring to cambodian guerrilla factions thach said the two 
sides are moving closer but to say no more gap is not yet 
realistic because the gap is not yet solved by the kampuchean 
cambodian parties 
asked where the gaps existed the vietnamese official said you 
must ask sihanouk and hun sen prince norodom sihanouk former 
ruler of cambodia is nominal leader of the guerrilla alliance and 
hun sen is premier of hanois client government in phnom penh 
siddhi and thach said a joint statement would be issued wednesday 
thach who also is also deputy premier said monday both 
countries agreed the cambodian question could be resolved by 
september when asked if peace was near he said it would be at 
hand during the first six months of 1989 
jetn sucharitkul spokesman for the thai foreign ministry said 
after siddhi arrived monday that new approaches would be discussed 
he said a thai proposal to resume a 1978 agreement on cooperation in 
aviation ocean commerce telecommunications posts and trade also 
was on the agenda 
siddhi is the most senior thai official to visit vietnam since 
1976 prime minister chatichai choonhavan also has announced plans 
to visit vietnam 
since taking office in august chatichai has said he would 
improve ties with communist vietnam cambodia and laos and increase 
trade provided all vietnamese forces leave cambodia 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to oust the khmer rouge 
regime of pol pot under which hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
were killed or starved to death in less than four years 
thailand backs the threeparty cambodian guerrilla alliance 
which includes the khmer rouge 
fears of a khmer rouge return to power have grown as vietnam 
withdrew some of its troops the vietnamese say the pullout will be 
completed this year 
last week the government of president heng samrin in phnom penh 
suggested an earlier withdrawal target of september 1989 if thailand 
denied sanctuary to cambodian guerrillas and supplies of weapons to 
the rebels were halted vietnam put heng samrin in power in january 
1979 
one round of informal talks on ending the cambodian conflict has 
been held in indonesia by the phnom penh government guerrillas

angola sent 450 cuban soldiers home 
tuesday several weeks early as part of a plan to remove foreign 
forces from the country after a decade of war and bring independence 
to neighboring namibia 
south african soldiers withdrew from southern angola into 
namibia also known as southwest africa last summer 
a usmediated agreement signed dec 22 by angola cuba and 
south africa which controls namibia requires 3000 cuban soldiers 
to be out of angola by april 1 and all 50000 to be gone in 27 
months 
un military observers looked on while cuban soldiers men and 
women strode between ranks of angolan troops and into three 
waiting passenger aircraft at the airport in luanda capital of 
angola an angolan military band played marches 
brig gen samuel c rodiles planas commander of the cuban 
forces and maj gen ciel da concessao angolas navy commander 
signed the withdrawal agreements at a table on the runway and handed 
them to pericles ferreira gomes the brazilian general in charge of 
un observers 
the 450 soldiers were accompanied by a dozen ranking military 
officers who came from cuba for the occasion 
col arvid geirulv second in command of the 28man un 
observers in angola said another 1000 cubans would be taken out on 
ships by wednesday and 550 more would leave by air and 1000 on 
ships by jan 15 
geirulv said the rest of the 70 un military and 20 civilian 
observers would be in angola by march 20 
in a farewell speech in may 1 square to a crowd of about 25000 
president jose eduardo dos santos said the first 3000 cubans were 
leaving ahead of the deadline as a goodwill gesture he said 
the names of those cubans who fell here will be engraved forever 
in our hearts 
no official figures are available for the number of cuban 
casualties in angola but most estimates put the number at about 
5000 dead 
cubans troops arrived in july 1975 to help the marxist government 
that won control after independence from portugal fight rebels 
supported by south africa and the united states 
all cuban forces remaining are to be north of the 15th parallel 
by aug 1 and north of the 13th parallel beyond the eastwest 
benguela railroad by nov 1 in time for elections in southwest 
africa south africa agreed to namibian independence in return for 
cuban withdrawal from angola 
the south africans captured southwest africa from germany in 
world war i and governed it under a league of nations mandate the 
un general assembly abrogated the mandate in 1966 but south africa 
had refused to leave 
south african soldiers entered angola in 1975 to support the 
national union for the total independence of angola rebel group 
known by its initials unita south african forces also raided bases 
in southern angola of southwest africa peoples organization 
guerrillas fighting for namibian independence 
neither guerrilla group was involved in the peace agreement but 
swapo indicated willingness to go along with it 
alcides sakala unita spokesman in lisbon said in a telephone 
interview tuesday the cuban withdrawal was a show theater 
its too early to say the cubans are really going to leave 
he said un observers found in rebelcontrolled territory would 
be attacked 
after a ceasefire agreement south african forces withdrew from 
southern angola on aug 22 all but 1500 south african soldiers are 
to be out of namibia by election day nov 1 
gen abelardo colome ibarra cubas deputy army minister told 
the chanting crowd the real authors of this agreement are the men 
and women who destroyed the myth of south african superiority in 
this part of the world 
he said his soldiers would do their duty until they depart 
geirulv said he foresaw no serious problems in monitoring the 
withdrawal we shall go to the locations where they have been and 
verify that they are empty he said 
angola has asked the united nations to pick up the cost of 
shipping the cubans home which it estimates at 800 million 
lt gen antonio santos franca the armed forces chief of staff 
attributed the high cost to temporary housing for the departing 
cuban troops and the need to build two airstrips in the south 
most cubans will leave from the ports of cabinda in the north and 
lobito and namibe in the south

quadruple your pleasure quintuple your fun 
the makers of doublemint chewing gum say theyre not ready to 
change the products familiar jingle not yet anyway 
but the wm wrigley jr co is working on a hightech approach to 
ensuring that your chewing gum doesnt lose its flavor on he bedpost 
overnight or on the store shelf where the oils that give gum its 
flavor can evaporate 
chicagobased wrigley the worlds largest gum producer said 
tuesday it had signed an agreement with advanced polymer systems 
inc of redwood city calif to develop a chewing gum that 
encapsulates the flavor oils in microscopic nontoxic sponges and 
releases them only when the gum is chewed 
the tiny sponges patented by advanced polymer systems already 
are used in some ointments shaving creams and cosmetics and could 
be used to extend the life of food flavorings and preservatives 
officials said 
by using these sponges instead of gum releasing all the flavor 
at once it will hold onto the flavor and release it in a sustained 
manner said sergio nacht advanced polymers vice president of 
research and development 
wrigley spokesman william piet balked at discussing the companys 
flavorextension goals saying the product was in an early stage of 
development 
the first challenge is to find out if it works he said 
chewing gum flavor generally lasts about 10 to 12 minutes but 
david light an advanced polymer spokesman said the companies hope 
to keep a flavorful chew going up to 10 minutes more 
nacht predicted it could be between 18 to 36 months before the 
product which needs approval from the federal food and drug 
administration hits store shelves 
wrigley which holds a commanding 48 percent share of the us 
chewing gum market hoped to use the technology in all its gums 
wrigley makes doublemint juicy fruit wrigleys spearmint and big 
red sugarsweetened chewing gums hubba bubba bubble gum and extra 
chewing gums which are sweetened with nutrasweet 
the companys main competitors include warnerlambert co which 
makes dentyne trident freshen up and chiclets and rjr nabisco 
inc maker of carefree beech nut and bubble yum gums neither 
nabisco nor warnerlambert immediately returned phone calls seeking 
comment 
industry analyst bonnie rivers of salomon brothers inc in 
atlanta said longerlasting flavor was top priority of chewinggum 
makers 
if you can make the flavor last longer thats a big 
positive she said 
and even if it didnt work very well the new technology still 
could give wrigley a marketing edge she said 
anything you can do to differentiate your product whether 
its a plus or not gives you something to market 
under the agreement advanced polymer will receive a small 
royalty from the sale of wrigley products made with the microsponge 
system and wrigley will get a small percentage of revenues advanced 
polymer gets in other food applications of the technology piet said

nearly 50000 workers and university 
students demonstrated tuesday in montenegro demanding the 
resignation of the republics ruling communist elite and protesting 
economic and social woes 
the demonstrations in the capital of titograd were triggered by 
what the protesters saw as the leaderships inability to cope with 
the deepening economic recession in montenegro one of yugoslavias 
poorest republics 
the protesters also called for the leaderships resignation 
because of the use of force by police to break up a similar protest 
in titograd in october 
no violence was reported although the demonstrators earlier had 
set a twohour ultimatum for the leadership to resign threatening 
to break into parliament unless their demand was met 
the protesters assembled on a square in front of the parliament 
building waved flags and chanted who dares to beat the workers 
and the people are hungry the square was ringed by a heavy 
cordon of police 
during the october unrest when at least 10 people were hurt in 
clashes with clubwielding police the leadership resisted calls to 
resign refusing to accept blame for the regions worstever 
economic recession 
subsequently the republics government which is charged with 
implementing economic policy tendered its resignation but the 
communist leadership which formulates policy refused to step down 
at the time the montenegro leadership accused followers of 
serbias ambitious leader slobodan milosevic of trying to stage a 
coup in titograd in order to install his own supporters 
yugoslavias protracted economic crisis characterized by a 250 
percent inflation rate a 21 billion foreign debt falling living 
standards and rising unemployment is most acutely felt in the 
countrys underdeveloped regions 
in montenegro the average monthly salary has declined to the 
equivalent of 80 the republic has been particularly hard hit by a 
recent spate of closures of lossmaking firms in which about 10000 
workers lost their jobs 
on tuesday hundreds of uniformed police were seen on television 
containing the everincreasing crowd but there was no apparent sign 
of the special riot squads that were used to break up last years 
demonstration 
we have come to put an end to the ignorance cowardice and 
incompetence of those who have ruled us for so long said a miner 
from a nearby bauxite mine who was not otherwise identified 
we have had enough of those who have brought yugoslavia to the 
brink of disintegration and the people to the brink of famine he 
added as the crowd roared its approval 
montenegro located on the southern adriatic coast is 
yugoslavias smallest republic with about 550000 inhabitants 
serbian nationalists have long claimed the republic should be 
part of yugoslavias largest republic of serbia since the two 
peoples share the same ethnic roots 
similar demonstrations in novi sad capital of vojvodina 
province that also erupted in october 1988 caused the downfall of 
the entire leadership of the province after it had opposed serbian 
attempts to bring it under greater central control 
at the time the media in the northern parts of the country 
widely reported that those demonstrations were orchestrated by 
milosevic and his supporters in vojvodina

as a young man ronald reagan was stirred by 
president franklin d roosevelts declaration that the only thing 
we have to fear is fear itself on tuesday as he neared 
retirement reagan acknowledged that upon hearing those words he 
never dreamed hed hold the same office 
reagan and supporters of the fdr library in hyde park ny 
gathered at the national archives for a 50th anniversary fundraiser 
and to hear recordings of roosevelts first inaugural address in 
1932 
he really did convince us that the only thing we have to fear 
is fear itself reagan said 
the luncheon commemorated the anniversary of a similar gathering 
on feb 4 1939 when roosevelt brought together 50 people to have 
lunch and become trustees of the fdr library which became the first 
in the presidential library system 
sen george mitchell dmaine the senate majority leader who 
introduced reagan said roosevelts legacy was to empower all 
americans to act through their government for the common good today 
that principle is deeply engrained in our political and social 
thought 
in one of the bestremembered passages in the recorded excerpt 
from his inaugural address roosevelt said first of all let me 
assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear 
itself nameless unjustified unreasoning terror which paralyzes 
needed effort to convert retreat into advance 
mitchell recalling roosevelts struggle with poliomyelitis told 
the audience he had known personal fear for his own future so he 
knew what he was talking about as he addressed the nation in the 
grip of the great depression 
introducing reagan the majority leader drew parallels with the 
32nd president saying like president roosevelt president reagan 
possess a legendary ability to inspire in americans pride in their 
nation and faith in its future 
reagan a former democrat turned republican said roosevelt was 
the first president he voted for and the first he ever saw at a 
campaign rally in des moines in 1936 while he was working as a radio 
announcer 
he really did convince us that the only thing we had to fear 
was fear itself he said and it was that ebullience that 
infectious optimism that made one young sportscaster think that 
maybe he should be more active as a citizen 
i assure you though he never tied that to one day holding 
public office and certainly never dreamed that destiny would take 
him to the same office fdr held

the citys murder rate dropped to its lowest 
level in 10 years but gang slayings and gangrelated crimes rose in 
los angeles last year police said 
murders in the nations secondlargest city fell from 832 in 1987 
to 734 last year the lowest total since 1978 when there were 678 
homicides according to police statistics released monday 
in my own view los angeles is what it has been all along one 
of the safest major cities in the united states said cmdr 
william booth department spokesman 
los angeles murder rate of 229 killings for every 100000 
residents is lower than that of many other large cities booth said 
washington dc the nations murder leader lists 592 murders 
per 100000 people followed by detroit with 58 murders per 100000 
and dallas with 567 
booth attributed the murder drop to 900 extra police officers on 
the street and a greater willingness by officers to make arrests in 
domestic disputes 
there were 257 gang killings in the city in 1988 compared with 
205 in 1987 an increase booth said was caused by a neardoubling of 
the gang population 
investigators listed 27795 known gang members last year compared 
with 15000 the year before 
gangrelated crime increased from 5129 reported incidents in 
1987 to 5371 in 1988 
the sheriffs department also reported an increase in 
gangrelated slayings in unincorporated areas of the county up from 
79 in 1987 to 96 last year county totals were incomplete because 
smaller city police departments have yet to compile yearend 
statistics

auto giant daimlerbenz on tuesday 
unveiled a sculpture at its headquarters in memory of thousands of 
workers forced to toil at company plants during nazi domination in 
world war ii 
the iron sculpture was commissioned from berlin sculptor bernhard 
heiliger 
daimlerbenz officials announced last year that the company would

japans voluntary quotas on car exports are 
essentially symbolic limits that mean little in the marketplace an 
american analyst a us automaker and a senior autostate 
congressman said tuesday after the japanese government said it would 
continue the restraints 
while ford motor co and chrysler corp said the limits should 
remain in place general motors corp the nations largest 
automaker said the quotas have become less and less relevant 
and the extension is almost symbolic 
the quotas are not constraining shipments from japan and are 
not expected to under current market conditions gm said more 
importantly the focus on quotas distracts from the real trade 
issue the need for further opening of the japanese market to 
exports from the united states 
far from helping the us auto industry the quotas may make it 
more difficult for the big three automakers to compete said david 
healy automotive analyst with the new york brokerage house drexel 
burnham lambert 
it is almost a psychological limit rather than a real limit in 
the sense that the japanese shipped fewer than 23 million vehicles 
to the united states in the last couple of japanese fiscal years 
healy said i think it could probably be scrapped without any real 
effects 
japanese makers have successfully circumvented the quotas by 
building more cars at plants in the united states and by exporting 
more expensive cars the quotas are set by the number of vehicles 
rather than by their value and the effect has been more 
competition in the expensive and medium price bracket for the us 
auto companies healy said 
in congress rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house 
energy and commerce committee said the quota as it stands today is 
too high to work 
there is sufficient cheating so that the number just doesnt 
have that much meaning dingell said the japanese manufacturers 
do everything they can to get around it theyre willing to call 
cars anything from trucks to wagons if it will help 
quotas cover cars but exclude light trucks and utility vehicles 
after making unprecedented inroads into the us auto market 
japan in 1981 sought to deflect protectionist sentiment in the 
united states by voluntarily limiting its car exports 
the japanese automakers are presently limited to exporting 23 
million cars a year to the united states a level they have failed 
to attain in recent years as a stronger yen on international 
exchange markets has forced up dollar prices of japanese cars 
japans minister of international trade and industry hiroshi 
mitsuzuka said his government was concerned the japanese automakers 
would push for more us sales thereby aggravating trade tensions 
with the united states 
the japanese trade surplus with the united states in 1987 was 
598 billion and constituted the largest portion of the overall 
1712 billion us trade deficit japan expects to export 22 
million cars to the united states in the fiscal year ending in 
march mitsuzuka said 
we are pleased that japan has responded to the concerns raised 
by the united auto workers union and others in agreeing to renew 
the quotas for another year said uaw president owen bieber 
at the same time we are disappointed that they did not respond to 
our proposal to adjust the limit downward so as to make 
allowance for the growth of lowus content transplant assemblies 
despite japans worries about trade tensions with the united 
states the reagan administration considers itself to have no role 
in the decision to continue the quotas said kelly shipp 
spokeswoman for us trade representative clayton yeutter 
it is solely a japanese decision she said the president 
informed the japanese government four years ago that the 
administration considered that the us industry had recovered 
its competitiveness and there was no need to continue the 
restraint 
japanese automakers produced 733000 cars in the united states 
last year through november up 232 percent from the same period in 
1987 according to the foreign ministry in tokyo 
ford the nations secondlargest automaker said it was 
pleased that the japanese government has recognized that some form 
of restraint is necessary until the serious imbalance of usjapan 
trade is corrected citing the us deficit with japan not only in 
automobiles but in semiconductors textiles and steel 
chrysler corp also said it believed the decision to continue the 
quotas was correct 
in the showroom continuation of the quotas will mean prices of 
japanese cars will remain higher than would otherwise be the case 
said martin pierce vice president of alexandria toyota in 
alexandria va 
anything that gives us additional product is good not only good 
for us but it is good for the consumer because having the supply of 
vehicles results in lower prices as a result of competition 
pierce said if there is a contrived shortage the consumer is 
going to pay more

president ranasinghe premadasa 
announced tuesday he will end the 5year state of emergency and 
free all political prisoners 
also tuesday sinhalese militants killed three people including 
two candidates for parliamentary elections 
premadasa promised he would never again impose a state of 
emergency but did not say whether he thought it had been effective 
in curbing ethnic violence between the buddhist sinhalese majority 
and mainlyhindu tamil minority 
the state of emergency which expires sunday had been reinstated 
every month since it was imposed in may 1983 
we have lived under emergency rule for more than five years 
now i feel that is enough for everybody premadasa told a publiic 
meeting of top government officials and legislators 
police said sinhalese militants tuesday firebombed and opened 
fire on a car killing opposition candidates indrapala abeyweera and 
wijeyalal mendis of the sri lanka freedom party and their 
bodyguard identified only as martin they were to contest feb 12 
national elections 
a police spokesman blamed the sinhalese peoples liberation front 
for the attack at waduwa town 20 miles south of the capital 
colombo the front is an extremist sinhalese group that opposes 
government efforts to give more autonomy to tamils 
a military spokesman said at least 12 people have been killed 
since monday including three sri lankan soldiers ambushed by tamil 
rebels in the north 
other victims all civilians in the sinhalesedominated south 
included three members of the ruling united national party and a 
buddhist priest the spokesman said all the civilians were killed by 
the peoples liberation front 
tamils comprise 18 percent of the countrys 16 million people and 
claim they are denied jobs and education by the sinhalese majority 
more than 8500 people have died since militant tamils started 
fighting six years ago for an independent nation 
premadasa told the meeting everyone imprisoned under emergency 
regulations would be released 
the emergency gives police and soldiers broad powers to arrest 
and detain people for up to 90 days without charges to dispose of 
bodies without inquests and raid homes without warrants 
if those arrested cannot be charged they should be released 
he said 
government officials who asked not to be identified said 
authorities released 574 political prisoners between jan 1 and jan 
6 but they did not say how many others still are in detention the 
exact figure is not known but is estimated at 2200 
premadasa said he has asked authorities to examine particularly 
the case against sinhalese students held for staging antigovernment 
riots that forced the closure of 10400 schools and seven 
universities last year

the nations mayors want presidentelect bush 
to reject president reagans proposed cuts in domestic spending the 
president of the us conference of mayors said tuesday 
arthur j holland head of the group and the mayor of trenton 
nj said cities and their residents would be hurt by proposed 
reductions in programs ranging from schoollunch subsidies to grants 
for community development projects 
we have come to the end of a decade that has seen a dramatic 
shift toward defense spending away from discretionary domestic 
spending holland said at a news conference 
let us hope the end of this decade is also the end of an era 
and that the 1990s will produce a federal budget that is balanced in 
every sense of the word he said 
holland a democrat commented at a news conference called to 
react to reagans proposed fiscal 1990 budget he said the cities 
have suffered cuts in urban programs throughout the reagan 
administration and called the budget nothing new its what weve 
come to expect 
he said he was pleased with proposed increases in spending for 
aids programs the superfund waste cleanup program and education 
but he said the proposal would reduce money for state and local 
enforcement treatment and education programs on drugs even while 
increasing the total appropriation for federal antidrug efforts 
holland also pointed to proposed cuts in mass transit assistance 
reductions in child nutrition spending and school lunch subsidies 
elimination of the economic development administration and a cut 
from 3 billion to 28 billion in the community development block 
grants program 
questioned by reporters holland said there is enough money now 
going to waste and fraud in the defense department to pay for urban 
needs 
you say where will the money come from its there without 
increasing the budget he said

a communist party plenum to consider the 
stance toward the banned trade union solidarity will begin monday 
government spokesman jerzy urban revealing the date said he did 
not know yet if the assembly of the 230member party central 
committee would last one or two days 
the meeting will be the second part of a plenum that began dec 
2021 its first session was highlighted by prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowskis speech instructing central committee 
members to poll the party rankandfile for their current attitude 
toward solidarity and toward union chairman lech walesa 
members were directed to come back to the plenum in midjanuary 
with their answers and specific suggestions for action 
the rakowski speech was the strongest signal to date that 
authorities are considering dropping the sevenyear legal ban on 
solidarity which is the condition that solidarity has set for 
entering talks with officials on negotiating a pact to attack 
pressing economic and political problems 
in the past two weeks there have been signs of division among 
the authorities with regard to solidarity 
articles favorable to walesa and the constructive opposition 
have appeared in the official press alternating with thinly veiled 
attacks 
urban said the party weekly polityka plans to publish the program 
of an antiwalesa faction of solidarity led by activist andrzej 
gwiazda which is on record as seeking greater confrontation with 
the authorities 
the unusual action appeared likely to spur fresh charges that 
solidarity is splintered and riddled with radicals who cannot be 
trusted to engage in dialogue 
asked if the government is ready to change its stance toward 
solidarity urban declined to answer saying the question likely 
would be addressed at the plenum 
i can only tell you that the results are unpredictable he 
said of the meeting

president reagans advisers on tuesday 
recommended curtailing deposit insurance for bank and savings and 
loan accounts triggering swift negative reaction from congress and 
the treasury department 
in its final report to reagan the presidents council of 
economic advisers said reducing protection for depositors would 
encourage them to more closely monitor the financial health of 
the institutions holding their money 
but the treasury department through rep chalmers wylie of ohio 
senior republican on the house banking committee promptly distanced 
itself from the latest proposal involving the troubled savings 
industry in which a postdepression record of more than 200 
insolvent institutions were closed last year 
at a hearing of the house committee wylie said curtailing 
deposit insurance is not an option and will not be considered as 
part of the sampl plan being developed by treasury secretary nicholas 
f brady who is staying on in the bush administration 
wylie who said he spoke after his office conferred with the 
treasury department said brady will present the plan to 
presidentelect bush by about feb 15 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the committee did 
say a gradual reduction in deposit insurance may be considered as 
part of solving the sampl crisis but he also said such a proposal 
is a very serious matter not a matter to be thrown out as a trial 
balloon 
other democratic and republican members of congress reaffirmed a 
commitment to guaranteeing deposits up to the current 100000 per 
account limit 
congress will stand foursquare behind the 100000 
agreement said rep charles schumer dny im appalled at the 
timing of the administration i think the public needs some 
reassurance 
in its report released by the white house the council of 
economic advisers also sharply criticized reaganappointed savings 
and loan regulators for postponing the day of reckoning in their 
rescues of failed institutions 
most regulatory actions taken so far will sharply increase 
costs to the general public the report said sampl regulators 
practice of guaranteeing new owners of rescued sampls against losses 
for up to 10 years weakens the incentive to manage efficiently it 
said 
the top regulator m danny wall chairman of the federal home 
loan bank board defended his agencys yearend spate of savings and 
loan bailouts as cheaper than shutting down the failed institutions 
and paying off depositors 
wall told the committee that his agency rescued 75 institutions 
in december at a cost of 155 billion to be spread out over 10 
years tax benefits arising from the deals will cost the government 
an additional 4 billion 
liquidating the sampls and shutting them down would have required 
47 billion in upfront cash far more than is available 
immediately to the federal savings and loan insurance corp wall 
said however by selling off the property of the failed sampls 
regulators eventually would have recouped all but 228 billion on 
the december transactions he said 
wall and fellow bank board members roger martin and lawrence 
white cited two benefits of rescuing institutions now and spreading 
out the cost rather than waiting to accumulate the money for 
liquidations 
first wall said the bank board stopped the operating losses at 
the rescued institutions second it eased the need for the 
institutions to pay abovemarket interest rates to attract 
depositors that in turn eases the pressure on stillhealthy sampls to 
compete by raising their rates 
for all of 1988 including december the bank board committed 
more than 38 billion to resolve the cases of 205 institutions wall 
said 
several members of the committee expressed outrage that in some 
deals buyers of failed institutions are to receive tax benefits 
worth more than the private money they are to put into rescued 
institutions 
the dealmakers who are walking away with more cash than theyre 
putting in from day 1 are laughing all the way to the piggybank 
rep jim leach riowa told wall the acquirers have robbed you 
blind 
reagans council noting estimates up to 100 billion for solving 
the sampl problem said a large portion of the payment of this bill 
will need to come directly from the public the report did not say 
tax money would have to be spent but many private analysts believe 
that is inevitable 
in the final reagan budget released monday the administration 
called for spending 64 billion on sampls through 1994 and 
acknowledged for the first time that the government does not have 
enough money coming in from the industry and other sources to handle 
the cleanup 
citing the 1980 decision by congress to boost the limit on 
deposit insurance from 40000 to 100000 reagans economic 
advisers said reducing the ceiling would restore muchneeded 
discipline to the system 
the scope of federal deposit insurance should be significantly 
curtailed it said however it did not recommend a specific 
limit nor did it say whether the curtailment should apply to 
existing deposits or only to future deposits 
deposit insurance discourages bank runs and provides individuals 
with a safe place for their money but it also dramatically 
reduces the incentives for depositors to monitor the financial 
health of their bank the report said 
the councils chairman beryl sprinkel said at the white house 
clearly there is a big price to be paid and some funds were 
allocated by the presidents last budget additional will be 
necessary in the future but if we concentrate only on the price to 
be paid and do not concentrate on reforming the industry in my 
opinion it will be a temporary stopgap measure that will lead to 
repeated losses in the future 
according to the us league of savings institutions 133 
percent of all sampl accounts at the end of 1987 exceeded the 
insurance limit however the average account had 8440

king hussein told visiting us lawmakers

conflict the official jordan news agency reported 
hussein met with republican sens nancy kassebaum of kansas and 
john mccain of arizona and then with reps mary rose oakar dohio 
james hansen rutah and james sensenbrenner rwis 
hussein said jordans renunciation in july to claims to the 
israelioccupied west bank has led to stronger relations between 
jordan and the palestine liberation organization according to the 
news agency 
kassebaum a member of the senate foreign relations committee 
said in an interview before meeting hussein that she favored a 
little more even hand in balancing us support for israel and 
arab nations 
but she said the senators told israeli and jordanian officials 
that us budget problems are not going to make any changes easy 
kassebaum said she supported the us decision to open talks with 
the plo after chairman yasser arafats decision to renounce 
terrorism and accept israels right to exist 
but renewed terrorist activity would mean everything was off 
again in terms of recognizing the plo she said 
kassebaum also said israels tough response to palestinian 
protests in the occupied territories has weakened us public 
support for israel 
constituent mail comments back home clearly reflect that 
americans want not just to unquestioningly provide major amounts of 
money to israel without saying just a minute now you have some 
problems too 
kassebaum and mccain a member of the senate armed services 
committee planned to arrive in syria wednesday night and in egypt

the 12th international film festival of 
india opened tuesday amid political protests by participating stars 
at least 200 films from more than 45 countries will be screened 
at eight theaters in the city in the next two weeks 
the start of the festival was marked by protests against the 
killing last week of safdar hashmi a director and writer of street 
plays 
shabana azmi a leading indian actress said hashmi a member of 
the marxist communist party was murdered in broad daylight by 
the followers of a member from the ruling congress party 
the actress made the remarks while being introduced to the 
audience during the function information and broadcasting minister 
hkl bhagat who inaugurated the festival rebutted the allegation 
and said strict deterrent action would be taken against those found 
guilty 
hashmi was attacked jan 1 in the town of sahibabad on the 
eastern outskirts of new delhi and died of his injuries two days 
later he was staging a play critical of the government when he was 
attacked 
ms azmi costars with shirley maclaine dame peggy ashcroft and 
twiggy in john schlesingers film madam sousatzka which was 
screened after the opening ceremony 
the annual festival has broken away from the practice of holding 
a competition section the director of the festival urmila gupta 
said the move was intended to attract a better quality of 
cinema since the competition section precluded screening films 
that had been shown at other festivals 
the quality of films this year is high and critics and 
moviegoers will not have to take chances with unknown films which 
may or may not prove good mrs gupta said 
but many critics saw the move as selfdefeating the indian 
express newspaper said the festival could have become important as 
an alternative festival and held out hopes for cinema from the 
third world 
the festival also will show retrospectives on the films of 
schlesinger vera chytilova of czechoslovakia lina wertmuller of 
italy west germanborn fritz lang and indias raj kapoor

president reagan on tuesday defended the navy 
pilots who shot down two libyan jets over the mediterranean last 
week insisting the americans were justified in doing what they 
did 
reagan in a photo session with president jose azcona of 
honduras was asked about a published report that the two navy 
pilots who downed the libyan mig23s fired after their commander had 
informed them they were in a cautionary warning yellow 
situation rather than in the red condition reserved for 
fireatwill encounters 
asked if he believed the two pilots were triggerhappy and 
had fired at the libyan jets before they should have reagan 
responded 
no i think to speculate on that is ignoring the facts i have 
said from the very beginning ive never asked people to go any 
place without the right to defend themselves against attack 
reagan said all the evidence that we have photographic sound 
everything they were justified in doing what they did 
the president told his listeners remember were not dealing 
with an earlier day with machine guns today if a plane persists 
in keeping you in line when you are avoiding it you have to assume 
they are getting ready to push the button 
spokesmen at both the white house and pentagon disputed the 
report published in the washington post on tuesday the spokesmen 
said the condition yellow issued by the commander on the scene 
allowed the pilots to take defensive actions and to fire if 
necessary 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked about the report in 
the post said the yellow warning indicates that pilots can take 
defensive actions to defend themselves the fact is that under 
the yellow caution they have the right to defend themselves and to 
fire and they did 
pentagon spokesman dan howard echoed fitzwaters comments 
saying that the warning yellow weapons hold command issued by 
the airborne warfare commander was intended to tell all of the 
pilots to be careful that there was a probability of hostilities 
and that they could shoot in self defense 
i cannot go into the rules of engagement but the actions 
taken by the crews of the f14s met the most rigorous 
interpretation of the rules they behaved prudently in 
protecting themselves their aircraft and their ship

a selfstyled revolutionary told a 
federal jury tuesday that some of the bombings of corporations that 
he his wife and a cohort are accused of plotting were protests 
against racism in south africa 
american corporations are the legs upon which the racist 
community in south africa walks raymond luc levasseur 42 of 
calais maine said at the start of the sedition trial 
you ought to ask yourself the question who are the real 
criminals those who oppose racist acts in south africa or those who 
support government interests in south africa he told the jury 
levasseur is one of three people facing trial in us district 
court on charges of seditious conspiracy under a 1918 act that makes 
it unlawful to plot to topple the government by force the other 
defendants are his wife patricia h gros levasseur 40 and richard 
williams 41 of boston 
the longawaited trial is expected to last a year and to cost 
upward of 10 million the small courtroom was packed tuesday with 
10 federal marshals and 80 spectators who entered through two 
walkthrough metal detectors guarded by more marshals 
the defendants have described themselves in a handout as north 
american antiimperialists who believe armed resistance is one of 
the necessary responses to apartheid racism sexism the massacres 
of native peoples and capitalistbacked wars 
among the 19 bombings they are accused of plotting was a 1976 
explosion at the suffolk superior courthouse in boston that injured 
22 people assistant us attorney michael loucks said in his 
opening arguments tuesday that the explosion was the groups attempt 
to cripple the massachusetts penal system 
the prosecutor said he intended to prove the defendants conspired 
to bomb courthouses military offices and corporations throughout

for human rights among the poor imprisoned and politically 
oppressed in the united states and abroad

done in support of freedom in south africa he said

needham mass on dec 12 1976 came shortly after antiapartheid 
demonstrators were fired upon in soweto

union carbide while this government collaborated with the police and 
the military to kill 1000 people he said

town his tour of duty in vietnam and his imprisonment for trying to 
sell 7 worth of marijuana in 1969 
this is how i became a revolutionary and thats what i am 
he said i dont feel i owe any allegiance to a system thats 
going to perpetrate suffering in other peoples he said 
he bristled however at the charge of racketeering enterprise 
and racketeering conspiracy i dont think you can be a 
revolutionary and a racketeer he said im neither 
profitoriented nor drugoriented 
he said he had been under police surveillance much of his life

a 65yearold woman who was raped in her home 
was allowed to decide the prison term of her attacker because of her 
age the visciousness of the assault and court delays a judge said 
tuesday 
im not advocating that the victims decide the penalty but i 
thought it was the fairest thing to do in this case said hennepin 
county judge william posten who said he told the woman you tell 
me what you want me to do and ill do it 
the victim was given a choice monday between two options in the 
prosecution of james halvorson 25 she could accept the conditions 
of a plea agreement for a 54month prison sentence that would be 
effective immediately or she could have the case go to trial and 
hope for a conviction the latter might have resulted in a prison 
term of up to 108 months 
assistant county attorney kevin johnson said a conviction was 
nearly certain because police arrested halvorson in the womans 
home but because halvorson was free on bond and the victim feared 
being attacked again she chose the 54month prison sentence in lieu 
of a trial 
she knew he would be going straight to prison and wouldnt be 
eligible for parole for three years said johnson who noted that 
the victim had become frustrated by delays that had twice postponed 
court proceedings 
cindy clarkson a sexual assault counselor who worked with the 
victim said the woman was haunted by the thought of a repeat attack 
and moved in with family members the house she had lived in for 30 
years has been put up for sale clarkson said 
she was feeling pretty powerless clarkson said what the 
judge did was wonderful just wonderful she just couldnt believe 
that someone in the system like a judge would take the time to 
listen to her and actually give her a choice 
wasnt that something the woman marveled after choosing the 
sentence 
posten said he has allowed victims to help decide the fate of 
criminals in only a few cases 
asked why he granted the privilege monday posten said 
somebody that is raped early in the morning and its a little lady 
thats a greatgrandmother all this had an effect it was the way 
the whole thing developed the delays were part of it too 
according to the criminal complaint halvorson broke into the 
womans golden valley house through a kitchen window about 430 am 
june 16 the noise awoke the woman and she went to investigate the 
man dragged her from the kitchen to the bedroom covered her head 
with a blanket and raped her he fell asleep after the attack and 
the woman ran to a neighbors house to phone police johnson said 
earl gray halvorsons attorney said his client was drunk out 
of his mind at the time he said halvorson lived near the woman 
halvorson had recently been convicted of drunken driving for a 
fourth time two days before the rape occurred he received a delayed 
jail sentence said judge eugene farrell 
prosecutors in the rape case asked that halvorson be held in jail 
under 50000 bail but bail was set at 25000 and halvorson was 
released after posting a 2500 bailbond johnson said 
the victim told the minneapolis star tribune monday that the 
judge was just beautiful he was so kind he said its your 
decision i liked that i think three years is a long time for a 
young person 
clarkson said the victim did not want to be interviewed tuesday 
because shes just kind of worn out and tired of it all but the 
woman wanted to stress that rape is horrible no matter how old a 
person is clarkson said 
gray called postens decision a very intelligent move

tax cuts helped produce peacetime prosperity in 
america and all that is required to reduce the deficit is to 
halt or moderate the increase in expenditures president reagan 
said tuesday 
in his last economic message to congress reagan said success in 
dealing with problems of unemployment inflation and taxes resulted 
from his strategy of curbing the federal governments role in the 
life of private business 
i leave office secure in the knowledge that these policies have 
worked and confident that this great nation will continue to lead 
the way toward freedom and prosperity for all mankind reagan said 
reagan said the high inflation and slow growth of the 1970s gave 
way during his term in office to a long economic expansion and a low 
unemployment rate 
by reducing taxes and regulatory bureaucracy we have unleashed 
the creative genius of ordinary americans and ushered in an 
unparalleled period of peacetime prosperity reagan said 
after ticking off economic gains over the past eight years 
reagan said that as proud as i am over these and many other 
accomplishments i will be the first to admit that the agenda is not 
yet completed first and foremost is a need to reform the budget 
process and to bring federal spending under control 
the president said that the large budget deficit that this 
nation faces is not a result of too few taxes but too much 
spending all that is required to reduce the deficit is to halt 
or moderate the increase in expenditures 
beryl sprinkel chairman of the council of economic advisers 
told reporters at a white house briefing that gains were not due 
to reagan luck but rather due to specific policies of this 
administration to reinvigorate the private sector 
in projections in the report sprinkel predicted continued gross 
national product growth of 32 percent this year and at least that 
each year through 1994 
during his briefing for reporters he noted that some critics 
have described the administrations economic growth and revenue 
forecasts as a rosy scenario 
sprinkel said the forecasts were based at least in part on the 
assumption that the basic thrust of policy in this administration 
will be continued in the bush administration 
reagan sent his last budget to congress on monday recommending a 
115 trillion spending plan bearing a 925 billion deficit for 
the fiscal year opening oct 1 
presidentelect bush has said the reagan budget generally 
reflected his own views about fiscal policies but indicated he will 
offer alternatives shortly after taking office next week 
sprinkel said he did not think it unrealistic to formulate 
projections about the nations business health on the assumption 
that a bush administration will employ the same reagan 
administration emphasis on a free marketoriented economic strategy 
i listened to the presidential campaign he said i read 
the lips i have worked with vice president bush rather closely 
at this stage of the game it seems sensible to us to assume 
that yes there will be some new priorities but no were not 
moving away from market orientation sprinkel said

a book on terrorist groups was published 
tuesday by the pentagon which said it should make americans more 
aware of the nature of terrorism and the threat it represents to 
national security interests 
charles s whitehouse assistant defense secretary for special 
operations and lowintensity conflict said the 131page book broke 
little new ground in describing terrorist groups around the world 
but should be helpful as a comprehensive reference document 
this is not an intelligence document but rather a compilation 
of opensource material that has been verified by classified 
sources whitehouse added 
copies will be distributed starting today to public government 
agencies to public libraries as well as to government libraries it 
will also be distributed to law enforcement activities diplomatic 
posts and domestic and overseas department of defense components and 
activities he said 
whitehouse said the publication had nothing to do with recent 
reagan administration claims that libya is building a plant that 
could supply chemical weapons to terrorists 
work on the book began in mid1987 he said adding the united 
states has no evidence that any terrorist group has actually tried 
to use chemical weapons in an attack 
but the fact that weapons of this kind have been used in the 
recent past in iran and iraq and are available makes the 
likelihood of their being used by terrorists greater than it was a 
year or two ago he said 
the book terrorist group profiles describes the abu nidal 
group in the middle east as the most dangerous terrorist 
organization in existence 
a second defense department official with ties to the 
intelligence community who appeared with whitehouse tuesday on 
condition he not be identified said abu nidal received that 
description because of the indiscriminate nature of their 
targeting 
when abu nidal wants to send a message to a government we 
have not seen for the most part select assassinations of that 
governments leaders but attacks on the population of the 
country the official said 
that kind of indiscriminate targeting and the tremendous 
operational security under which abu nidal operates makes it a very 
lethal dangerous group the official said 
the official declined to discuss details of the investigation of 
the recent bombing of a pan am airliner over scotland but he said 
the united states knows of eight different groups that have 
successfully detonated a bomb on an aircraft in flight that resulted 
in 11 different aircraft incidents 
so the technology of building such a bomb is more 
widespread than i think is generally understood by people the 
official said 
the official said that while libya appears to be increasing its 
support of terrorism around the world iran must still be considered 
the worlds top supporter of terrorism

president reagan waving his bandaged hand for 
the television cameras said tuesday that it feels fine and he 
expects to get a splint on it soon 
isnt it pretty reagan said with a laugh as he waved his 
left heavily bandaged hand for photographers during a picturetaking 
session with president jose azcona of honduras in the oval office 
on saturday reagan underwent 2 hours of surgery at walter reed 
army medical center to have a curvature of his left ring finger 
corrected the ailment is known as dupuytrens contracture and 
caused his finger to curve inward 
the president returned to the white house on sunday after 
spending two nights at the hospital for the operation which is 
considered routine 
asked how he felt after a day back at work reagan said i feel 
just fine 
the president went on to lavish praise on the team of physicians 
who worked on him at the hospital saying he wanted to give great 
credit to his military doctors 
i was very fortunate to have this operation here because this 
is a specialty of the military reagan said of the operation 
dr stephen shaffer a specialist in hand surgery said the field 
of hand surgery first developed in the army during world war ii but 
has since moved actively into the civilian medicine extended 
fellowship training and extra examinations are now required before a 
surgeon can become a certified hand specialist 
the guys i know at walter reed are all good surgeons he 
said but added that such expertise is now also commonly available 
in the civilian medical community 
reagan said he expects to have his hand put in a splint on 
wednesday 
the president is expected to wear what is known as a dynamic 
splint which allows the finger to flex and thereby be 
strengthened with exercise so that the finger does not return to 
the curved position caused by the ailment

multiplecandidate parliamentary elections still 
are promised for march but the kremlin set the opposite example 
tuesday by choosing only 100 nominees from the communist party one 
for each of the seats assigned to it 
historic political reforms passed into law dec 1 said 
conditions would be created for nomination of an unlimited number 
of candidates for the congress of peoples deputies the new 
soviet parliament 
twothirds of the 2250 deputies are to be elected by the public 
march 26 onethird are being chosen by organizations including 
the communist party which has 100 seats and trade unions and 
scientific groups 
but based on the central committee action tuesday party members 
will have no choice in electing their deputies since only 100 
candidates were nominated 
in a speech delivered before the decision president mikhail s 
gorbachev said 312 names remaining from tens of thousands submitted 
had gone to the ruling 12member politburo and it reduced the list 
to 100 before sending it to the central committee 
no change has been made in the language of the new election law 
but the partys example will set the standard and other 
organizations will be less likely to offer real choices a western 
diplomat said on condition of anonymity 
multiple candidates already have been nominated in some areas 
tass the official news agency said 26 candidates were chosen in 19 
moscow districts 
other signals from tuesdays meeting of the party central 
committee were conflicting 
gorbachev who has promised repeatedly that the elections will be 
part of his democratization of the soviet union offered a draft 
political platform for the party and suggested other organizations 
would offer their own 
the soviet people are entitled to know the objectives and tasks 
formulated by the party for the immediate future and the platform 
it takes to elections tass quoted gorbachev as saying the 
document was not released tuesday 
we should proceed from the premise that the other social 
organizations will come to the elections with their own campaign 
documents and individual candidates can also offer their views 
gorbachev said 
he was referring to other national organizations including trade 
unions and scientific groups which have been empowered to directly 
elect deputies to the congress the communist party is the only 
legal political party in the soviet union 
gorbachev also expressed satisfaction that most candidates 
nominated so far in the threemonth election campaign are supporters 
of perestroika his policy of reforming the soviet system 
but the president complained the campaign has produced 
manifestations of group egotism ambition and political 
careerism and worried that some candidates might play on ethnic 
disputes 
under the political reform adopted in december the new congress 
will meet once a year to elect a smaller working parliament of 424 
members 
gorbachev said that party members had suggested 31500 nominees 
for its seats in the new congress but these were winnowed down and 
finally just 100 were chosen by the 12member ruling politburo 
those 100 candidates were nominated by the partys 300member 
central committee tuesday tass said 
a western diplomat said it was possible that others could be 
nominated at the last minute 
tass said that before the party formally elects its 100 deputies 
all communists will have an opportunity to express their attitude 
to any of the candidates 
but even then rankandfile party members wont even have the 
chance to vote tass said only party leaders will cast ballots in a 
special meeting march 1516 
those empowered to vote for the partys legislators will be 
members of its central committee its auditing commission first 
secretaries of the republic and regional party organizations second 
secretaries of the republic party organizations presidents and 
prime ministers of the republics ministers and heads of state 
agencies and commanders of military districts tass said

in further experimentation with choice plans and other valuable 
reforms

too often today it is our disadvantaged children who are most 
likely to be burdened by inadequate public education bush said 
for this reason alone for the benefit of the empowerment that it 
promises to our disadvantaged kids our disadvantaged citizens 
further expansion of public school choice is a national imperative 
supporters of the choice concept say it makes schools more 
competitive and responsive improves morale and attendance reduces 
disciplinary problems and dropouts and improves learning among 
students 
president reagan addressing the choice workshop earlier in the 
day cited the examples of a harlem school district in which 
scores have risen dramatically because parents are now permitted to 
choose which school to send their children to and a minnesota 
program that is fostering unprecedented competition among public 
schools to make them more attractive to parents and students 
among those attending the workshop were the heads of the nations 
two teacher unions who said reagans speech appeared to signify an 
increased concern about strengthening public schools 
with some safeguards public school choice is an excellent 
program and ought to be supported said albert shanker president 
of the american federation of teachers 
i didnt hear anything about vouchers or tuition tax credits 
and those would be the red flags for us said mary futrell 
president of the national education association the concept of 
choice does have potential we are cautiously optimistic about 
what were hearing 
bush addressed the educators after holding separate meetings with 
honduran president jose azcona and prime minister m charles of 
dominica 
in transition personnel developments us officials said robert 
kimmett a washington lawyer who served with james a baker iii at 
the treasury department and the white house is the oddson choice 
for the no 3 job at the state department under baker 
the job of undersecretary for political affairs is usually held 
by a career foreign service officer but kimmetts connections 
evidently helped him vault past several experienced contenders 
including assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway 
only the secretary and deputy secretary have more authority 
bakers deputy will be lawrence eagleburger who spent 27 years in 
the foreign service and then entered private business 
transition officials said bush will name jennifer fitzgerald as 
deputy chief of protocol at the state department fitzgerald a 
longtime aide currently runs bushs vice presidential office in the 
senate

prime minister yitzhak shamir on tuesday for the 
first time opened the way for a united nations role in the middle 
east peace process but he again rejected the plo as a negotiating 
partner 
in the occupied territories an alleged palestinian collaborator 
was killed reportedly by other arabs and 10 palestinians were 
reported wounded in clashes with israeli troops 
shamir told representataives of the european parliament that 
israel would accept un involvement in middle east peace 
negotiations the parliament has been pressing israel to negotiate 
with the plo 
shamir said any peace talks must be held directly with arab 
parties to the conflict and ruled out the palestine liberation 
organizations sitting at the bargaining table 
such negotiations can be launched under the auspices of the 
great powers the united states and the soviet union or the united 
nations providing they refrain from any involvement in the 
substance of the talks shamir said 
shamir has contended until now that a unsponsored forum would 
be biased against israel and force concessions from the jewish state 
the arab states want an international conference attended by the 
five permanent security council members the united states the 
soviet union china britain and france who would play an active 
role in negotiations 
european parliament speaker lord plumb addressed israels 
parliament after shamirs statement saying the european community 
supported an international conference under un auspices with the 
plo as a negotiating partner 
he said european community members also believe the conflict 
could not be resolved unless israel withdrew from the occupied 
territories and recognized the palestinians right to 
selfdetermination 
it is clear that without the recognition of the legitimate 
rights of the palestinians there cannot be any prospect of a durable 
peace for any country in the region plumb said 
jewish settlers in the occupied west bank meanwhile appeared to 
adopt the tactics used by palestinian protesters and declared a 
oneday general strike in at least 32 settlements for thursday 
their leaders said the strike was to protest the death of three 
israelis in the west bank last month and palestinian stonethrowing 
attacks 
at least 10 palestinians were shot and wounded tuesday in clashes 
with israeli soldiers in a half dozen towns and refugee camps in the 
occupied territories arab reports and hospital officials said 
arab hospital officials said a 12yearold girl was shot in the 
head and wounded during a confrontation between troops and 
stonethrowing youths in shati refugee camp in the gaza strip 
they said a 17yearold youth was shot in the head with a rubber 
bullet in another gaza refugee camp and a 23yearold man was hit in 
the chest with a live round in the west bank village of beit lit 
the army confirmed nine wounded and said they included a girl 
from shati taken in serious condition to an israeli hospital 
arab reporters said palestinians who collaborate with israeli 
authorities shot and killed a 27yearold man in the west bank 
village of idna monday night after he refused to feed them 
information 
an arab reporter quoted family members as saying the victim 
kayed muhammad tmaizi acted as an informant for israeli security 
forces until the palestinian uprising began they said he recently 
was pressured to renew his cooperation 
an army official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed 
tmaizis death and maintained tmaizi was killed in a dispute among 
palestinians he did not elaborate 
the death brought to 349 the number of palestinians killed in the 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
fifteen israelis also have died since the uprising began dec 8 
1987 
shamir and the european delegates exchanged sharp words tuesday 
about israels peace stance and a possible european role in the 
mideast conflict 
shamir accused the european community of adopting positions on 
the substantive issues of the conflict which lack balance 
supporting the plo and accepting the concept of a palestinian 
state 
marco pannella of italy accused shamir of refusing to make 
concessions to the palestinians were beginning to get fed up 
with the fact that when you talk about peace you do so in very 
bellicose tones he said 
continuing in this way youll be a kind of dinosaur head of 
this very monolithic state of intolerance pannella said

diplomats on tuesday tried to resolve a 
deadlock between greece and turkey that threatens to block new 
eastwest arms talks and a landmark human rights accord before 
president reagan leaves office 
weary delegations from the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact nations 
adjourned tuesday after five days of trying to remove the 
lastminute hitch 
they agreed to resume at 11 am wednesday a us delegation 
source said on condition of anonymity 
earlier tuesday a western diplomat said if we dont have 
anything this afternoon we get very close to the time when we will 
not be able to finish before the us administration leaves office 
on jan 20 
the dispute between the two balkan nations traditionally 
suspicious of each other emerged after delegates from the east and 
the west thought they had wrapped up two long years of negotiations 
on new arms control talks and human rights guarantees in europe 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said greece 
surprised everybody last week by insisting that more of eastern 
turkey be included in the area covered by the new talks on reducing 
conventional troops and weapons across europe 
turkey had finally won agreement from the soviet union last week 
that the port of mersin and other parts of eastern turkey should be 
excluded from the new arms talks 
this seemed to open up prospects for what us ambassador warren 
zimmermann in a dec 30 interview billed as potentially the most 
important europewide arms control negotiations ever held 
the talks are designed to reduce warsaw pact and nato troops 
tanks and airborne forces from the atlantic to the ural mountains 
deep inside the soviet union 
they could begin as early as march according to diplomats from 
nato and warsaw pact nations 
but if the greekturkish dispute is not solved by the end of this 
week the new eastwest arms talks cannot be set before the reagan 
administration leaves office diplomats say 
the overall agreement at the 35nation helsinki review conference 
on security and human rights in europe also would be at risk 
the mandate for the new arms control talks is supposed to be part 
of the final document agreed on by the 35 nations at the conference 
which began work in november 1986 
a draft of the final document was presented last week a day 
before the united states and britain removed a major obstacle by 
announcing they are willing to attend a 1991 human rights meeting in 
moscow 
zimmermann hailed the human rights provisions in the draft 
document as historic and indicated only minor changes were 
needed 
but the agreement would be on hold probably subject to us 
review if it is not adopted before reagan leaves office and bush 
takes over he said 
canada still has not agreed to the moscow conference and romania 
also presented 17 major objections rejected by diplomats 
responsible for the draft to the human rights provisions 
the vienna conference includes the soviet union the united 
states canada and all european nations except for albania all 35 
nations must agree to the final accord by consensus for it to take 
effect 
austria has invited the foreign ministers of all 35 participating 
nations to a concluding session jan 1719

officials have begun nazi war 
crimes investigations of 670 people who the united nations says 
allegedly committed atrocities in world war ii a prosecutor said 
tuesday 
chief prosecutor christoph schaefer told reporters at a news 
conference in frankfurt that the names were obtained from the un 
by west german officials who track suspected nazi war criminals 
schaefer said the un records which were not made avaiable for 
nearly 40 years to west german officials contained names of people 
who were not investigated previously by the west german government 
jochen schroers a spokesman for schaefer said authorities first 
will determine among other things how many of the people being 
investigated are still alive 
as you know most of them are quite old by now and many have 
probably died schroers said 
until the investigations are complete and it is determined 
there is cause to file charges i cannot release any of the names 
he said 
schroers said the list included no prominent names 
he said he did not know when the investigations would be 
completed

a 90 trillionmilelong stream of gas is flowing 
toward the center of the milky way perhaps fueling a massive black 
hole at the very heart of the earths galaxy astronomers reported 
tuesday 
researchers said their discovery is the first evidence of a thin 
river of gas being sucked across the heavens by the awesome gravity 
of a black hole 
the radio telescope observation made by an international team 
provides new support for the stillcontroversial idea that a massive 
black hole exists at the center of the milky way 
that is the gravitational well of the galaxy we think that 
stars drift toward the center its a natural place for a massive 
black hole to form said paul ho who directed the research at the 
harvardsmithsonian center for astrophysics in cambridge he 
reported the results tuesday at a meeting of the american 
astronomical society 
a black hole is what remains when stars collapse upon themselves 
leaving only a speck of infinite density their gravitational pull 
is so strong that nothing escapes not even light 
even though black holes cannot be seen astronomers look for 
other evidence of their existence such as the gravitational tug on 
nearby celestial orbs 
hos discovery made with astronomers from the max planck 
institute in munich the university of cologne west germany and 
the massachusetts institute of technology may prove to be such 
evidence in the earths galaxy 
astronomers had earlier spotted signs of a massive gaseous cloud 
around the milky ways center which is about 30000 light years 
from earth in the constellation sagittarius a light year is 6 
trillion miles the distance light travels in a year 
experts believe that this cloud is swirling around a black hole 
that is 1 million times more massive than the sun they theorize 
that parts of the cloud constantly tumble into the black hole 
perhaps the equivalent of onethousandth of the mass of the sun 
is drawn into the black hole each year this produces tremendous 
amounts of kinetic energy the energy released by motion 
these black holes could be the most powerful generators that we 
know about said ho 
the latest discovery suggests that a stream of gas snakes across 
space providing the fuel that keeps the milky ways black hole 
going ho believes that recent stellar explosion knocked loose part 
of a large island of gas this in turn was grabbed by the gravity 
of the black hole and pulled in a stream into its own orbiting cloud 
this is a complex region said bonnerd j teegarden of the 
goddard space flight center in greenbelt md results like these 
are adding a lot to our understanding 
teegarden said that most but not all astronomers believe that a 
massive black hole exists at the milky ways center 
the nature of black holes pushes hard on the basic concepts of 
physics he said physicists dont really know what happens when 
you collapse a million solar masses of matter down to a point the 
laws of physics as we know them in the laboratory are inadequate 
to explain such an extreme situation

about 50000 people in vilnius on tuesday freely 
protested the hitlerstalin pact which led to soviet annexation of 
lithuania estonia and latvia activists reported from the 
lithuanian capital 
in september paramilitary forces in armored personnel carriers 
attacked a similar demonstration in vilnius 
tuesdays twohour rally had government approval and authorities 
even publicized it with a brief newspaper announcement valdas 
analauskas correspondent in lithuania for the unofficial journal 
ekspresskronika said by telephone from vilnius 
police were not even visible he said 
lithuanias conservative communist party chief was replaced in 
october with a reformer algirdas brazauskas who attended a 
conference of the grassroots political organization peoples front 
later that month 
he also returned the vilnius cathedral which had been used as a 
museum since the 1950s to the roman catholic church 
at tuesdays rally 20 speakers demanded lithuanian independence 
and withdrawal of the soviet occupation army calling the 1939 
hitlerstalin pact a shameful lie analauskas said the baltic 
nations were independent from the end of world war i until soviet 
annexation in 1940 
the 1939 agreement ostensibly was a nonaggression treaty between 
nazi germany and the soviet union but a secret protocol provided 
for the soviets to annex baltic states and germany to invade poland 
speakers at the demonstration tuesday represented the league for 
a free lithuania the lithuanian democratic party and the national 
council of young lithuanians analauskas said 
at the september rally police and soldiers shoved demonstrators 
and beat some with rubber truncheons they charged four times to 
disperse the tens of thousands of people singing lithuanian songs 
and carrying the flag of the former independent republic

a nurse whose colleagues jokingly 
called her angel of death because elderly patients died during 
her shift went on trial tuesday on charges of killing 17 patients 
with lethal doses of medicine 
michaela roeder is accused of killing the patients between 
february 1984 and february 1986 
the accused felt herself the mistress over life and death she 
decided who was allowed to live and allowed to die prosecutor 
karl hermann majorowsky told the court 
majorowsky said ms roeder told some patients who were able to 
understand that they were about to die alone in 1985 11 of the 
patients were murdered he said 
he said ms roeder used the drug catapresan to reduce the 
patients blood pressure to fatal levels or caliumchloride which 
caused heart failure 
ms roeder admits giving fatal doses to six elderly patients but 
says she did it to spare them pain 
her attorney siegmund benecken said ms roeder at least in 
one instance accidentally killed a patient when she administered 
the wrong injection 
majorowsky demanded that ms roeder be tried for murder on all 
counts but the court said a lesser charge of manslaughter had to be 
considered in each instance 
on tuesday ms roeder testified about her childhood difficulties 
with her mother 
my mother once told me the day i was born was the blackest day 
of her life she said 
she said she felt nursing was my vocation and that her 
ability to get along with patients was one reason she was assigned 
to the intensivecare ward at st peters hospital in wuppertal 
about 37 miles north of bonn 
she faces a possible life sentence if convicted 
the case has gained national attention because the killings 
almost went unnoticed by police 
on a tip from a hospital employee authorities had the bodies of 
28 former patients exhumed and examined 
ms roeder who began working at the hospital in 1978 was 
arrested in march 1986 
most of the 17 patients she is accused of killing were in 
intensive care following operations for ailments ranging from 
appendicitis to cancer west german news media have reported 
the court which has scheduled 26 sessions over the next several 
months is expected to hear testimony from at least 40 witnesses and 
eight medical and other experts

pro and antiabortion groups unlikely allies 
agreed tuesday that the government does not need to spend tens of 
millions of dollars to determine whether abortion damages a womans 
physical or emotional health 
surgeon general c everett koop proposed such a study he said in 
an interview with the associated press because the data simply do 
not support the premise that abortion does or does not cause a 
specific postabortion psychiatric syndrome 
koop had been asked by president reagan to prepare a 
comprehensive report on the issue but said he told the president he 
could not because there is no scientific evidence to support the 
prolife belief that abortion harms women or the prochoice stance 
that abortion is beneficial 
koop who said he remains firmly opposed to abortion told reagan 
that a comprehensive study costing from 10 million to 100 million 
would take five years to complete 
that seems like a lot of money but when you figure that 15 
million women get aborted every year thats only 75 per woman 
koop said 
pro and antiabortion groups said a study is not needed 
nancy broff of the national abortion rights action league praised 
koop for doing a fair study and said the tens of millions he 
proposes spending on another study could be better used for 
contraception research 
nellie gray of march for life said koop is highly misguided 
adding we dont need any more studies what we need is for koop 
to retire 
however one antiabortion group national right to life said a 
study like the one koop is proposing is long overdue 
psychological harm from abortion often surfaces five to 10 years 
after the abortion and existing research generally is based on 
studies of women in their first year after abortion said olivia 
gans an official of the group 
the decision on whether such a study should be conducted likely 
will fall to president electbush who upset antiabortion forces 
with his nomination of dr louis sullivan to head the department of 
health and human services 
sullivan drew an outcry from antiabortion forces when he said in 
a newspaper interview that he supported a womans right to seek an 
abortion but opposed federal aid to pay for it he later said he 
opposed abortion except in cases of rape incest and where the life 
of the mother is threatened which mirrors bushs view on abortion 
sheila tate a spokeswoman for the bush transition team said she 
did not know whether the incoming administration would pursue koops 
recommended abortion study 
reagan administration officials had nothing to say about koops 
decision not to issue a report a decision he detailed in a letter 
delivered to the white house on monday presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said reagan doesnt have any characterization one 
way or the other of the letter 
koop said that when he left the white house after talking to 
reagan aides on monday i had the impression that i would be 
hearing from mr reagan 
in the letter koop told reagan that among the presidents 
advisers it was a foregone conclusion that the negative health 
effects of abortion on women were so overwhelming that the evidence 
would force the reversal of roe versus wade the landmark supreme 
court decision 
koop said he had met with 27 groups that had philosophical 
social medical or other professional interest in abortion and 
reviewed nearly 250 studies on the issue all of which he found to 
be biased or flawed in their methodology 
the data do not support the premise that abortion does or does 
not contribute to psychological problems he said in the letter 
anecdotal reports abound on both sides however individual cases 
cannot be used to reach scientifically sound conclusions 
he said a comprehensive study free of bias would set a lot of 
things to rest 
we have two groups of people saying very honestly and very 
sincerely different things the people who are prochoice say of 
course there are health effects of abortion on women they are so 
delighted to get rid of their unwanted pregnancy its a source of 
relief and ive known people like that 
and there are the prolife people on the other hand who say 
we know all sorts of people who have tremendous problems with guilt 
after theyve had an abortion and it isnt necesarily something that 
happens the first year it can happen five or ten years later and 
ive known people like that 
but the problem is you cannot prove those things 
scientifically with the current data

unionbacked workers demanded higher pay 
after consumer prices rose in the first of four waves of price 
increases the government plans to impose this year official media 
reported tuesday 
in an open letter on monday to premier miklos nemeth the 
presidium of the csongrad county council of trade unions in southern 
hungary protested the increases taking effect the same day the 
state news agency mti said 
mti said the trade unions made it clear to the government that 
the tolerance of the population has reached a critical level 
on monday tens of thousands of workers in szabolcsszatmar 
county in northeastern hungary staged a 10minute warning strike to 
protest the price increases decreed by the government 
the price rises were caused partly by cutting state subsidies of 
a vast number of consumer goods a condition set by the 
international monetary fund for governments seeking credits or 
rescheduling arrangements 
hungarys total western debt is now believed to total about 17 
billion the highest per capita in the east bloc 
mti also said conservative estimates indicate about one out of 
every four hungarians is poor nearly 26 million out of a 
population of 106 million 
in 1987 19 million people or 18 percent of the population 
lived below subsistence level mti quoted the central statistical 
office as saying 
no figures were given for last year but government austerity 
measures new taxes and several price rises have worsened the 
problem 
mti said that in budapest the capital 25000 families or 6 
percent had rent arrears in 1987 with their total debt amounting to 
an equaivalent of 24 million 
electricity in budapest has been cut off to an average 150 
apartments a week because renters were behind on their utility 
bills the total annual debt in utility fees was 154 million mti 
said 
the news agency also said that according to figures released by 
the central peoples control committee up to 400000 elderly people 
in hungary had no pension or other regular income last year 
regular social support is given to only 48000 of them the 
report said indicating that the remainder must rely on relatives or 
friends

the soviet union on tuesday publicly joined the 
united states in opposing third world demands to link bans on 
chemical and nuclear weapons 
delegates to the 150nation conference on chemical weapons worked 
toward a compromise final declaration that could be delayed by us 
resistance on linkage and other issues 
the soviets were known to share the us view and on tuesday 
they publicly joined in opposing linkage 
we are against making the resolution of nuclear disarmament a 
precondition for chemical disarmament soviet deputy foreign 
minister victor karpov told a news conference 
in an upbeat remark karpov also told reporters the conference 
was doomed to success signifying it would achieve progress 
despite wrangling 
western delegates said a final declaration will be issued when 
the fiveday conference closes wednesday 
the declaration will have no legal power but will carry weight as 
an expression of international political will 
the final declaration is reached by consensus so any 
disagreement could mean delay or even failure 
since the conference opened saturday arab states demanded 
linkage between nuclear and chemical weapons bans they want to 
retain chemical weapons to offset what they claim is israels 
nuclear capability 
nonaligned nations offered changes to soften arab language 
eliminating explicit references to nuclear arms but the united 
states remained opposed conference sources said on condition of 
anonymity 
the aim of the conference is to reaffirm support for the 1925 
geneva protocol which bans the use of chemical weapons but not 
their manufacture and stockpiling it aims to give political impetus 
to the geneva negotiations on disarmament which includes talks on 
chemical weapons 
the united states also opposes efforts by some countries to deny 
signers of the geneva protocol the right to express reserves 
which means retaining the right to use chemical weapons in 
retaliation many of the 118 signers expressed such reserves 
the american delegation is not prepared to agree to a bad 
deal said a source close to the us delegation speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
however reports filtering from the closeddoor negotiations were 
positive 
karpov referred to a soviet pledge to start destroying chemical 
weapons stocks this year and said a trial experiment will be held 
near midyear 
but he said the pace of destruction will also depend on whether 
there is progress or not in the preparation of a geneva convention 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze announced the plan 
in paris on sunday 
well have a trial experimental stage of destruction when the 
factory is ready for use maybe by the middle of the year karpov 
said 
well see the effectiveness of the process then we can say 
how much we can destroy each year 
yuri nazarkin moscows special ambassador to the geneva 
disarmament conference said the principal problems toward a 
chemical weapons agreement have been solved 
reaching a compromise in paris could be difficult 
the americans are not blocking the conference but they are 
very strict on the two points said a top western delegate 
referring to the reserves issue and linking nuclear and chemical 
weapons 
the united states has very real preoccupations he said on 
condition of anonymity 
the arab bloc lifted its demand for an explicit reference to 
linking nuclear and chemical weapons and would accept language 
contained in a 1978 special session on disarmament calling for 
total disarmament western delegates said 
a draft proposal under study tuesday night contains no reference 
to nuclear disarmament but refers to general disarmament 
according to a conference source but the term evidently remained 
unacceptable to the united states 
the united states and soviet union are the only two countries to 
admit having chemical arms about 20 nations are thought to possess 
chemical weapons capability 
despite the differences the final declaration will be firm 
precise and direct a french delegate said we have stayed in 
the same framework originally foreseen when the conference was 
being prepared 
israel has neither confirmed nor denied it has nuclear weapons 
but has said it would not be the first country to introduce such 
weapons into the middle east

not decided tuesday whether to fight extradition

call and said he would look into whether mrs tuinman should face 
the theft of service charge which stems from 2000 in unpaid 
natural gas bills while the couple lived in sandy a salt lake 
suburb from april to june last year

about 24 million kyodo news service said 
bush spokesman steve hart said in washington that bush will 
attend the funeral in his first announced overseas trip after his 
inauguration jan 20 hart said bush will be accompanied by his 
wife barbara but he had no other details on the itinerary or the 
delegation 
prime minister noboru takeshita has been expected to visit the 
united states for talks with bush and the newspaper asahi shimbun 
quoted an unidentified government source tuesday as saying the visit 
will come in early february 
representatives from more than 100 countries are expected to 
attend the funeral including up to 50 heads of state and government 
the national police agency will mobilize more than 30000 police 
to ensure the safety of visiting dignitaries and discourage 
disruptive actions by extremists the agency said tuesday 
japans largest newspaper yomiuri shimbun said a telephone poll 
conducted saturday and sunday of 1876 people indicated that 82 
percent support the emporer as the symbol of state up 10 percent 
from three years ago 
the emperor once was considered a living god but under japans 
postworld war ii constitution he is a symbol of the state and 
the unity of the people his duties are largely ceremonial and 
include meeting visiting dignitaries and fixing his seal on new laws 
about 100 youths demonstrated against the monarchy tuesday and 
13 were arrested after protesters on a rooftop at meiji university 
in tokyo hurled flares and firecrackers onto a city street 
there were no reports of injuries or major damage police said 
about 150 riot police were dispatched to the protest during 
which the demonstrators shouted abolish the emperor system a 
police official said on condition of anonymity

half staff in an official sixday mourning period that began 
saturday most businesses were not affected and the tokyo stock 
exchanges main indicator climbed sharply to a record high for the 
second consecutive day 
florists were deluged with orders for white chrysanthemums used 
for funerals in japan and suppliers in taiwan reported they were 
hard pressed to meet the demand 
flower growers in central taiwan the major chrysanthemum 
suppliers to the japanese market could provide only 30 percent of 
the requirement said the taiwan flowers export association 
the imperial household agency said 178254 people went to the 
palace tuesday to sign a register of condolences bringing the total 
to 12 million another 350000 people had signed registers 
elsewhere in japan it said 
in an editorial in its wednesday editions asahi shimbun said of 
condolences from countries including those invaded by japan during 
world war ii 
such expressions of condolence are partly a result of the 
efforts of the emperor himself to heal the wounds of war by paying 
visits to foreign countries or meeting the heads of state who came 
to japan 
we are reminded that the wounds of war remain deep more than 40 
years after the end of the war and that it takes still more time to 
heal them as hard as it is we have to accept the historical fact 
as such and must continue our efforts to heal them

his lawyer said tuesday that vladimir sokolov 
faced death if denied refugee status but a major jewish 
organization argued canada should not be a haven for nazi 
collaborators fleeing us justice 
sokolov 75 a former yale university lecturer was found this 
week to have fled to canada after being stripped of us citizenship 
in 1986 and threatened with deportation when his world war ii nazi 
propagandist background was uncovered 
immigration authorities reported that sokolov arrived in canada 
last march and later applied for refugee status claiming his life 
would be in danger if he was forced to return to his native soviet 
union 
roger white a spokesman for the federal immigration department 
said in a phone interview from ottawa that sokolov appeared at an 
immigration center in montreal in august and indicated he wished to 
make a refugee claim hell be processed as a backlog claimant 
and hell eventually appear before a panel which will hear his 
case 
sokolovs lawyer julius grey said his client cannot be sent 
back to the united states because he is no longer an american 
citizen us authorities said sokolov concealed his nazi past when 
he entered the united states in 1951 as a displaced person 
the united states doesnt want him grey was quoted by the 
canadian press as saying in an interview im sure theyll say no 
and if they say yes itd only be for the purpose of removing him to 
the soviet union where he could be executed 
according to their law he collaborated with the enemy in 
wartime so its a serious matter but we just dont return people 
for that reason 
treason is not something that we can allow other countries to 
enforce within canada 
the news agency quoted jack silverstone national executive 
director for the canadian jewish congress which represents over 
300000 jews in canada as saying in an interview canada cannot 
continue to be a haven for nazi collaborators who are fleeing us 
justice 
had he indicated that nazi activity to the us authorities 
when he applied he would not have been eligible for a visa 
we regard this as an abuse of the refugee process and we 
obviously would hope that the canadian authorities would take prompt 
action and have him returned to the united states where he faces 
us proceedings 
sokolov failed to appear at a us deportation hearing in july in 
hartford conn 
from 194244 sokolov was a writereditor on a russianlanguage 
newspaper published by the german army in his hometown of orel 210 
miles south of moscow antisemitic articles appeared under his name 
he went to the united states in 1951 became a citizen in 1957 
and in 1959 began lecturing on russian language and soviet dissident 
literature at yale yales student paper later found out about his 
wartime activities and he quit his job us officials later began 
proceedings against him 
grey said sokolov is in poor health and is staying in a house in 
montreal he would not reveal the address

libya and the nonaligned nations offered a 
watereddown resolution tuesday deploring the united states for 
shooting down two libyan fighter jets but they continued to blast 
washington in their speeches 
britain and the united states have indicated they will veto any 
resolution that criticizes the us navy which they say acted in 
selfdefense 
it will not be passed that is what will happen vowed 
herbert s okun the secondranking us ambassador it will not 
be adopted you can be sure of that 
third world nations backed off from the harsh rhetoric that 
followed the jan 4 downing of the libyan jets their latest draft 
resolution toned down its criticism in a campaign to isolate america 
and its steadfast ally britain on the council 
originally condemning the incident and later strongly deploring 
it the latest version of the un security council resolution 
deplores the shootdown it also dropped the reference to an 
unprovoked attack 
it is totally unacceptable as far as we are concerned they 
have inserted some figleaf language said okun 
formal introduction of the resolution and a vote originally 
planned for tuesday evening were postponed after 11 members asked 
to speak before the 15member body 
decrying the use of force and us intentions toward libya were 
speakers from east germany romania czechoslovakia poland yemen 
malta the united arab emirates libya the islamic conference and 
two south african liberation groups the african national congress 
and the pan azanian conference 
libyan ambassador ali a treiki told the council the us 6th 
fleet told libya aviation authorities it planned more aerial 
maneuvers near libya jan 1617 
okun said he was unaware of such plans but afterward told 
reporters i dont think it would be strange not in international 
waters the mediterranean is a very big place 
the united states has said the two libyan mig23s were armed and 
closing in an attack approach on two us warplanes on routine 
patrol with the us navy in international waters in the 
mediterranean off libya 
washington asserts the migs changed course five times to 
intercept the us f14 tomcats before the american pilots shot them 
down 
the un charter permits nations to use force in selfdefense 
libya says the migs were unarmed reconnaissance planes on 
friday us ambassador vernon a walters showed the security 
council photographs of one of the migs which appeared to have 
missile pods on it 
libyas envoy ali sunni muntasser claimed the photographs were 
retouched to add the armaments 
on friday a first draft of the antius resolution would have 
had the council members condemn america for the unprovoked 
attack and call for the us navy to leave the mediterranean 
the latest draft diluted the criticism to having the council say 
it deplores the downing of the two libyan reconnaissance planes 
and call for the us navy to suspend its maneuvers off libya 
it dropped the previous demand that the navy leave international 
waters because french envoy m pierre brochand made clear in a 
speech monday that france could not accept the abridgement of free 
passage in international waters france borders on the mediterranean 
the softened language of the resolution is an attempt to win over 
france and other wavering members of the council that might 
otherwise abstain such as canada brazil and finland 
the five permanent members of the council who hold veto power 
are the soviet union china britain france and america the 
soviets and chinese intend to vote in favor of a critical resolution 
the nonpermanent members of the council are canada finland 
brazil and the nonaligned movement nations of colombia malaysia 
algeria ethiopia nepal senegal and yugoslavia

mayor donald james said he was suspicious 
of carl keyser jr shortly after keyser took over as city 
administrator of the southeast alaska town of kake 
i could never trust him james said tuesday i even told 
him myself i told him theres something there thats just not 
right 
james suspicions proved correct 
nearly every aspect of his resume was not true district 
attorney mark ells said 
officials filed a firstdegree theft charge against keyser last 
week alleging keyser falsified his resume and obtained about 
28000 in salary moving travel and other workrelated expenses 
from the town 
keyser a huntington wva native was being held tuesday in 
lieu of 10000 bail at the jail in petersburg south of kake 
the city council hired keyser in early october based on glowing 
recommendations from references on his impressive fourpage resume 
two months later officials learned kake was just the latest and 
most remote stop in keysers crosscountry government career a 
career officials say was based on phony resumes and bogus reference 
calls 
kake is a fishing and timber town of 665 residents mostly 
tlingit indians about 75 miles south of juneau on the northern tip 
of kupreanof island it is about as far as keyser could have gone 
from his last job a sixday stint as city manager of pikeville 
ky and remain in north america 
keyser left the kentucky post in august after the news media 
uncovered discrepancies in his resume kake officials hired him in 
october unaware he was wanted on a fugitive warrant from pikeville 
they also did not know keyser had pleaded guilty last january to 
a misdemeanor perjury charge for lying in sworn statements while 
applying for police chief in oak hill fla 
among the references keyser listed on his resumes was al haines 
city manager of beaumont texas haines said he knew little about 
keyser and did not recall keyser asking him to be a reference nor 
did kake officials call him 
james said he called the references listed on the resume but he 
now thinks the people answering the calls were impostors arranged by 
keyser 
it seems like it was set up he said 
keyser 34 declined a request for an interview however in a 
tearful interview two weeks ago with petersburg radio station kfsk 
he maintained his innocence and suggested he was a victim of a 
conspiracy in pikeville 
its a situation where the press and some of the officials 
there want to make some type of example of me he said 
pikeville charged keyser with theft by deception for failure to 
reimburse the city for 697 in travel expenses he said he would 
have returned the money had officials asked 
keysers resume listed masters and bachelors degrees in public 
administration from la salle university in philadelphia he also 
listed experience as a consultant to the international city managers 
association and the international association of chiefs of police 
officials say there is no record that keyser attended the 
university or worked for the associations in october the city 
managers group issued a warning about keyser in its newsletter 
urging members to investigate applicants resumes 
it was that warning that led kake officials to investigate he 
was fired and arrested on theft charges in december 
james said many were suspicious soon after keyser took the 
44000ayear administrators job after the city council 
authorized keyser to buy a residence for him his wife and four 
daughters he bought a luxurious 66000 doublewide mobile home 
that was more than the council expected 
he aroused further suspicions by buying two rifles and ammunition 
with city funds and refusing to publicly release his resume 
authorities said more than 200 residents signed petitions asking 
for his removal 
carl just seemed to be living beyond our means resident mike 
jackson said a lot of people were concerned about that because 
the city has had real financial problems

up to a third of those who contract nona 
nonb hepatitis may be infected with mutant strains of hepatitis b 
that elude blood donor screening an expert on the virus reported 
tuesday 
girish n vyas professor of laboratory medicine at the 
university of california at san francisco and head of the 
transfusion research program based his finding on a study of blood 
donors on the italian island of sardinia 
nona nonb is a catchall term for any hepatitis that cant be 
identified as a or b officials at blood banks around the country 
say at least 3 to 5 percent of blood product recipients in the 
united states get hepatitis 90 percent of the posttransfusion 
hepatitis is nona nonb 
chronic hepatitis is primarily b and nona nonb it is the 
major cause of liver disease around the world and the main reason 
for liver transplants 
the study showed two of 618 donors had no immunologic or other 
markers to indicate hepatitis b infection although they had genes 
from the virus in their blood only one of them had antibodies to 
hepatitis b core proteins and would have been screened out in the 
united states 
the research was detailed in tuesdays edition of the journal 
blood 
vyas said the mutant hepatitis b strains apparently make altered 
surface proteins that cant be recognized by the bodys immune 
system and so they dont stimulate production of antibodies against 
it 
current blood screening tests for hepatitis b dont recognize the 
altered proteins and cant detect the blike virus 
american blood banks also screen for the presence of antibodies 
to proteins in the core of the virus and for high levels of the 
enzyme alt for signs of liver damage but some mutant hepatitis b 
viruses also fail to stimulate antibodies to core proteins so they 
can be detected only by timeconsuming dna analysis tests looking 
directly for hepatitis b genes 
doctors quoted in last months journal lancet said there was a 
test to screen for the nona nonb hepatitis but it takes at least 
12 hours 
ucsf spokesman robert sanders also said there are other tests 
that look for indications of related problems but he said the test 
mentioned by doctors in lancet are too expensive and timeconsuming 
vyas is working on developing a test for the mutant strains 
sanders said 
sanders said that all the evidence points to the mutant strains 
seen in the sardinian study also existing in the united states 
vyas participated in the sardinian study along with colleagues at 
the university of cagliari the study was supported by a transfusion 
medicine program project grant by the national heart lung and blood 
institute of the national institutes of health 
vyas first suggested in 1981 at the international symposium on 
viral hepatitis in new york that genetic mutants of hepatitis b 
could be responsible for some cases of nona nonb 
he and dr herbert perkins director of san franciscos irwin 
memorial blood bank originally observed nona nonb 
posttransfusion hepatitis in san francisco as early as 1973 their 
observations were published as preliminary evidence in 1982 and in a 
definitive report involving a sardinian study in 1983

the government on tuesday said it 
lacked evidence backing us allegations west german companies 
helped libya build a chemical weapons plant but it proposed tougher 
export laws for chemical and nuclear techology 
italy libyas biggest trading partner said it still has no 
proof the libyan plant can make chemical weapons libya says it will 
make pharmaceuticals 
but an israeli expert said the plant in rabta 60 miles southwest 
of the libyan capital of tripoli is near completion and time is 
running out to destroy it before it starts producing poison gas 
west german chancellor helmut kohl in an interview with a 
leading west german newspaper die welt was quoted as saying 
tuesday that he was disturbed by the handling of the us 
accusations 
i think its unbearable if someone puts the germans in the 
defendants docket without us having the possibility of seeing the 
evidence that is not how friends treat each other die welt 
quoted kohl as saying in an interview to appear in the papers 
wednesday editions 
kohl told his cabinet on tuesday the government will continue to 
pursue any evidence linking west german firms to the libyan plant 
said chief government spokesman friedhelm ost 
ost said a group of german experts will fly to the united states 
on wednesday to exchange information over this issue with american 
experts he released no details on the participants or the planned 
talks 
economics minister helmut haussmann unveiled a new package of 
measures aimed at cracking down on anyone who tries to evade the 
countrys export control laws 
in the sensitive areas of chemical and nuclear technologies we 
will be strengthening our control methods with more qualified people 
and through the doubling of penalties haussmann told reporters 
no german should be allowed to participate in activities in 
other countries that are an endangerment to peace 
the new package subject to approval by parliament calls for 
raising the maximum fine for violations of the export law from 
277000 to 555000 and the maximum prison sentence from three 
years to five 
in a related development a highranking government official 
indicated a west german company had planned to export chemical 
equipment components to libya but that the deliveries would not 
be allowed if deemed illegal 
it has been ensured that there will be no rash deliveries 
without examination said lorenz schomerus head of foreign 
economic policies at the economics ministry he refused to name the 
company or identify the components 
west germany says imhausenchemie of lahr and the hamburgbased 
pen tao medical material company have been cleared of any wrongdoing 
the italian government said tuesday it has not yet received 
conclusive evidence that the libyan plant can produce chemical 
weapons 
foreign minister giulio andreotti and defense minister valerio 
zanone said the government is still seeking all the elements 
about the nature of the factory in the former italian colony 
andreotti stressed that if the us accusations are true we 
will not hesitate to condemn libya and take the necessary 
consequent steps in our relations with tripoli 
an israeli expert said tuesday the united states will have to 
bomb libyas rabta plant soon if it wants to stop leader col 
moammar gadhafi from stockpiling chemical weapons 
president reagan in december said he was considering bombing the 
plant 
they will have to do it as soon as possible because the plant 
now is reaching a critical situation it is on the eve of starting 
production aharon levran a former deputy chief of military 
intelligence told a governmentsponsored briefing 
once production started the libyans could begin storing the 
weapons in despersed locations that would make it harder to knock 
out libyas chemical weaspons stock said levran coauthor of the 
middle east military balance an annual study produced by tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies

investigators said tuesday that one engine of a 
crashed boeing 737 had fire damage while the other was inexplicably 
shut down before the aircraft plunged into a highway embankment 
killing 44 people 
the pilot of the british midland airways jet told ground control 
the fire was in the undamaged right engine which was shut off 
transport secretary paul channon said the fire was in the left 
engine but it remained in operation before the crash 
aviation experts thought it unlikely the captain could have 
confused the two engines and one pilot said the fire warning system 
may have been at fault 
asked on independent television news whether pilot error might be 
involved channon said i dont rule that out but it would be 
unwise of me to speculate on that until weve got more information 
he also said he would not rule out sabotage but he said it was 
not very likely 
the jet flying from london to belfast northern ireland crashed 
beside englands main m1 northsouth highway sunday night after 
reporting engine trouble it undershot the runway while attempting 
an emergency landing at east midlands airport in central england 
but 82 passengers and crew including pilot kevin hunt survived 
with injuries 
the british broadcasting corp said investigators believe they 
know what caused the disaster but were not yet ready to publish 
their conclusions there was no word on what caused the fire 
reporting to parliament and then speaking on tv channon said the 
pilot reported an engine on fire and when asked by ground control 
which one replied starboard 
but when the engines were examined at the crash site it turned 
out that the starboard engine had been shut down before the crash 
and investigators found no evidence in it of a fire or mechanical 
flaw 
the port engine did contain fire damage said chief investigator 
eddie trimble 
he told reporters the starboard engine had been shut down not 
shortly before the crash but at a previous point in the flight 
he said it would be premature to speculate about the reason before 
the engines were stripped down for laboratory scrutiny 
capt john guntrip of the guild of air pilots said it was 
highly improbable that the pilot confused the two engines 
because the pilot and copilot are trained very carefully to 
monitor each others actions 
asked if the system could go wrong guntrip said it is 
possible it has been known in the past there have very 
occasionally been false fire warnings on aircraft 
another guild member group capt john tritton said i find it 
unbelievable that the pilot identified the wrong engine on fire 
when a fire occurs in an engine the master caution light comes 
on there is audio warning and there is a light in the handle the 
fire handle for that particular engine indicating which engine it 
is he told bbctv 
ham radio operator mervyn solloway who picked up cockpit 
transmissions shortly before the crash has said he heard the pilot 
report engine trouble then say it was under control 
but later he says he heard a frantic voice say weve got 
problems with the other engine 
aviation experts say the odds on double engine failure on a 
twoengined boeing are astronomical they theorized blame could lie 
with impure fuel faulty maintenancing an explosion in the engines 
combustion chamber or a mechanical fault 
the plane broke into three main sections heavy lifting equipment 
was moved to the site to remove debris 
the black boxes which record cockpit flight data and 
conversations were taken on monday night to the government air 
accidents investigation branch at farnborough outside london for 
analysis 
police and soldiers scoured the area for wreckage fragments 
boeing officials flew here and joined british investigators 
a 20foothigh scaffold and tarpaulin were erected to screen the 
wreck from highway traffic 
investigators will interview the crew members who survived 
pilot hunt 43 broke his back and it was uncertain whether he 
would walk again doctors said tuesday he has been hailed as a hero 
for managing to miss the town of kegworth and avoid landing on 
highway traffic 
channon said the three other boeing 737400s operated by british 
airlines were grounded 
in the united states cincinnati lawyer jim helmer is suing the 
airplane engines maker alleging the engine contains improperly 
tested parts helmer identified the parts as timer valves but told 
the associated press he didnt know if they could have caused the 
crash 
the cfm56 engines were made jointly by usbased general 
electric and snecma of france ge spokesman dwight weber said monday 
night that timer valve failure would not have caused an engine to go 
out

a district attorney issued an arrest 
warrant for an arab accused of taking part in a cruise ship attack 
in july that left nine dead a spokesman for his office said tuesday 
piraeus district attorney giorgos vlassis issued the arrest 
warrant for mohammed adnan zozad 21 on monday said the spokesman 
but a report drafted by port authority officials and submitted to 
the district attorney on dec 23 said zozad a lebanese national 
was killed by an explosion aboard the liner the city of poros 
police said after the attack that they found remains of a leg 
they believe belonged to zozad 
the spokesman did not explain why the district attorney issued an 
arrest warrant for a person believed dead 
ninetyeight others were injured in the july 11 gun and grenade 
attack as the ship steamed toward a suburban athens marina after a 
oneday cruise through the saronic gulf islands 
a frenchman who died in the attack and was later implicated in 
the assault against the passengers is not mentioned in the arrest 
warrant the spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
the port authority report said laurent vigneron 23 was one of 
two men identified by witnesses as firing a weapon on the ship it 
did not include any other evidence linking vigneron to the attack 
greeces merchant marine minister said eight eyewitnesses 
testified the frenchman was one of the attackers 
the charge triggered a diplomatic row with france which denied 
vigneron was a terrorist and said he had been on vacation 
greek police have identified four arab terrorists involved in the 
attack they named the ringleader as hejab jaballa a libyan 
passport holder later identified as mohammed khadar 
khadar 40 the alleged operations chief for the abu nidal 
terrorist organization is said to have died in a car bomb that 
apparently detonated prematurely at an athens suburban marina a few 
hours before the cruise ship was to dock 
authorities believe the attackers wanted to free an alleged abu 
nidal terrorist held by greece and deported to libya last month 
abdel osama zomar was to have been extradited to italy for his 
alleged involvement in an october 1982 attack against romes main 
synagogue that killed a 2yearold boy 
zomar had been jailed in greece since his november 1982 arrest at 
the greekturkish border driving a car loaded with explosives

a judge convicted state naacp president 
thomas reed and 13 black lawmakers tuesday on misdemeanor 
trespassing charges in their bid to remove the confederate battle 
flag flying over alabamas capitol 
montgomery county district judge craig miller fined each of the 
14 defendants 100 plus court costs the maximum each could have 
received was three months in jail and a 500 fine 
reed who led the feb 2 protest and later last year was 
convicted in an unrelated case of extortion said he was surprised 
by millers verdict in the nonjury trial 
i knew we did not violate any state law in fact i dissuaded 
the people who were with me from breaking state laws i pleaded with 
them not to we followed every command that was given us reed 
said in a telephone interview from his tuskegee home 
reed would not comment on the legal aspects of the case but an 
appeal is expected to be filed in circuit court where the group 
could request a jury trial 
i will talk with my lawyers at the appropriate time about it 
im going to take direction from our lawyers he said 
more than 11 months ago reed and the others marched to alabamas 
capitol and tried to climb a chainlink fence surrounding it in a 
symbolic effort to remove the flag from the capitol dome they never 
got into the capitol grounds closed off during restoration work 
and were arrested when each put a hand on the fence the flag 
continues to fly on a staff atop the dome third in line below the 
american and state flags 
miller agreed with state attorneys who argued that the mere act 
act of reed and the others curling their fingers through the fence 
was enough to constitute trespassing 
reed said if that was enough to be found guilty of trespassing 
youd probably have to go back and arrest thousands of people 
because i have seen many people touching the fence 
earlier tuesday a copy of gov guy hunts sworn testimony in the 
confederate flag case was made public in it hunt a republican 
said he believes he has the authority to remove the rebel banner 
from the capitol but feels it is better for the state that it not be 
taken down 
on several previous occasions hunt has said he would not take 
down the rebel banner without instructions to do so from the 
legislature 
hunt has said the flag is a historic relic that is properly 
displayed at the capitol reed has described it as a symbol of 
bigotry and oppression against blacks 
the capitol protest followed meetings between hunt and reed in 
which attempts at compromise failed 
months after the protest reed was convicted in a federal 
extortion case and automatically was expelled from his seat in the 
alabama house reed sentenced to four years in prison has blamed 
his federal prosecution on his attempts to remove the confederate 
flag from the capitol 
he remains state president of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and is free pending appeal 
the naacp has sued in federal court to try to get the flag taken 
down last friday us district judge robert varner refused to 
dismiss the federal court lawsuit a pretrial conference is 
scheduled for next month

the head of israels mossad intelligence agency 
will be replaced within several days after more than six years in 
the post israel radio reported tuesday 
the director whose name was not given in keeping with security 
regulations will be replaced by another senior mossad official or 
by a senior personality from outside that organization the 
radio reported 
it said that during his years in service the intelligence agency 
suffered some failures among them the discovery of false passports 
used by mossad operatives in west germany and the expulsion of 
mossad agents from britain several months ago 
before taking effect the new appointment must be approved by 
prime minister yitzhak shamir head of the hardline likud bloc and 
finance minister shimon peres of the leftleaning labor party 
it was one of the conditions in the agreement between the two 
parties to form a coalition government the radio said 
the report followed a supreme court ruling tuesday allowing an 
israeli newspaper to publish an article that criticized the outgoing 
mossad chief and stated that he is to be replaced in the near future 
but the supreme court upheld the military censorship order that 
the tel avivbased weekly hair the city cancel all descriptions 
of the mossad chief in person 
the article to be published on friday was first submitted to 
the military censor last august and has since been rewritten four 
times the local news agency itim said

were a generation completely confused about 
our psyches confesses an aging baby boomer in susan millers 
tedious new play for dear life not only about their psyches 
but about cholesterol calcium oat bran muffins and human 
existence too 
these are some of the many topics touched on in millers numbing 
drama of selfabsorption that opened tuesday at the new york 
shakespeare festival public theater 
the play examines the marriage of jake a disc jockey who loves 
and plays the pop standards of the 1930s and 40s and catherine a 
film critic who thinks she ought to be doing some real work 
instead like hauling water then she could fall into bed at 
night with legitimate fatigue 
baby boomers and the yuppie generation not exacty the most 
popular people in america can be treated with some intelligence 
wit and even sympathy on stage two recent examples include 
eastern standard by richard greenberg and the heidi 
chronicles wendy wassersteins look at one womans odyssey 
through feminism and beyond their much more carefully defined 
characters may not be likable but at least they are believable 
interesting and occasionally funny 
miller doesnt have much luck with her creations or their 
conversation her dialogue is arch and more than a tad pretentious 
i like your marriage it works for me admits catherines best 
friend a wouldbe filmmaker 
unfortunately the marriage doesnt work for the playwright or 
the audience miller tells her tale in a strange manner setting the 
plays first act in the present and the other two at various points 
in the future nobody appears to age and the sets dont change 
although in act 2 sam the couples 16yearold son appears its 
an awkward device 
the son isnt any more interesting that his parents particularly 
in stephen mailers irritating and unconvincing performance none of 
the actors has a particularly successful time at it and the rest of 
the cast includes such usually fine performers as laila robins tony 
shalhoub christine estabrook and joseph lambie they are stranded 
here and norman renes static direction doesnt help 
the play has several fleeting moments of pleasure particularly 
when jake is lost in reverie with those classic pop tunes he plays 
on his radio show when the voice of fred astaire or ethel waters or 
ella fitzgerald fills the theater you keep wishing that jake would 
just spin those wonderful old records and forget about for dear 
life

five people are accused of obtaining corneas 
from 47 corpses then selling them for profit as far away as saudi 
arabia in a case a prosecutor describes as bizarre and perhaps 
macabre 
in opening arguments in a hillsborough circuit court trial 
monday a prosecutor charged that two former employees of the 
florida regional bone and tissue bank inc sold corneas supplied to 
florida regional through another eye bank university ophthalmic 
services inc set up by their wives 
robert and irene fisher of hillsborough county and robert and 
gailya grant of largo in pinellas county each are charged with 47 
counts of grand theft and one count of conspiracy also charged with 
conspiracy is charles lee gloss who worked at florida regional a 
private nonprofit business 
a sixth defendant judith sawyerackerman pleaded no contest to 
48 charges friday and agreed to testify against the others she will 
be sentenced next month 
medical examiners supplying the corneas the transparent tissues 
that cover and protect the eyeball assumed they were going to 
florida regional but the corneas were sold by university 
ophthalmic many to a saudi arabian hospital for a 650 processing 
fee each according to prosecutors 
assistant state attorney judy hoyer told jurors in her opening 
presentation monday that university ophthalmic was the entity they 
created in order to steal 
but a defense attorney told jurors that his clients ran a 
nonprofit business and are in trouble because florida regional did 
not like the competition 
from the evidence youre going to see florida regional getting 
mad at university ophthalmic and these people because florida 
regional thought they were stabbing them in the back said the 
fishers attorney marc lubet 
robert fisher 40 robert grant 45 and gloss 29 worked for 
florida regional in march 1986 when irene fisher 38 and gailya 
grant 45 founded university ophthalmic robert fisher was florida 
regionals director and robert grant was the program director in 
pinellas county 
the pinellas county medical examiners office was the university 
ophthalmics best source for corneas 
directors at the medical examiners office dealt exclusively with 
florida regional and didnt suspect the corneas were being sold 
instead of being turned over to the legitimate organization the 
state said 
gloss discovered the operation and confronted robert fisher his 
boss at florida regional hoyer said gloss accepted a check for 
200 and didnt tell anyone about the scheme she said 
the trial continued tuesday and was expected to last for several 
days 
florida regional and the florida west coast organ procurement 
foundation inc sued the fishers grants and gloss in march 1987 a 
month before the state filed criminal charges the suit has not been 
resolved

the pentagon is investigating the loss of a 
flight data recorder from a longrange atomic missile test in 1987 
and there is a possibility the soviets may have recovered the 
device the pentagon said tuesday night 
the recorder would contain valuable information about the 
performance of the minuteman 2 missile according to the cbs evening 
news which first reported the story 
the recorder was part of a july 7 1987 test shot said army 
maj bill oconnell a spokesman for the defense department 
the missile which carried a dummy warhead and not an actual 
atomic weapon was launched from california toward kwajalein atoll 
a coralringed atoll in the marshall islands which the united states 
uses to test the accuracy of its strategic atomic weapons the atoll 
is in the western pacific ocean about 5000 miles from the united 
states 
us officials recovered 400 pounds of debris from the bottom of 
the lagoon the next morning and shipped it back to the united states 
for analysis cbs said but the 45day long analysis turned up no 
sign of the flight data recorder 
part of the payload form the dummy warhead which splashed down 
in the atoll was lost said oconnell it is unlikely that the 
soviets recovered it in the hours between splashdown and the first 
search but that possibility cannot be ruled out 
there are many possibilities that might account for the loss 
including accidents during the handling of the recovered debris 
poor recordkeeping and problems in shipping he said none of 
these possibilities has been ruled out and the investigation is 
continuing 
the recorder was not classified oconnell noted but its 
recovery would be useful to our missile testing efforts and five 
searches have accordingly been mounted to find it 
the soviets may have grabbed the recorder with a minisubmarine 
cbs said a soviet trawler was about 50 miles away from kwajalein 
the network reported 
oconnell refused to say if a soviet sub had been detected in the 
area there have been a number of reports of soviet submarine 
sightings and these reports are not being ignored he said i 
cannot however confirm that there was soviet submarine activity in 
or near kwajalein 
but he did confirm a cbs report that soviet personnel may have 
landed on kwajalein which is supposed to be uninhabited 
us officials have found vodka bottles cigarettes bug spray 
and a few technical items of soviet manufacture that could not have 
floated ashore and would have been unlikely to have been left ashore 
purposefully he said 
the test shot came nine months after the soviets had ended a 
fishing agreement with kiribiati the island nation next to the 
marshalls oconnell noted if the fishing agreement had still been 
in effect the soviets would have had support capabilities to try to 
take the payload by sub he said but in july 1987 the soviet 
fishing fleet only had access to vanuatu over 2000 miles from 
kwajalein 
oconnell said in a statement that clandestine soviet landings 
in the marshall islands are illegal and a clear infringement of the 
sovereignty of the marshall islands in addition to being a 
challenge to the security of the us testing programs

soldiers stormed the fortified home of the oil 
workers union chief tuesday fought a gun battle and arrested him 
and 17 other leaders of the nations strongest and allegedly most 
corrupt union officials said 
a federal agent was killed in the gunfight between security 
forces and joaquin hernandez galicias bodyguards in the oil city of 
ciudad madero in northeastern mexico attorney general enrique 
alvarez del castillo said 
union members among mexicos highest paid workers walked off 
the job at six of the nations nine oil refineries after the raid 
this is not an attack on a union alvarez told a news 
conference it is the prosecution of crime committed by 
individuals 
we had to move to clean up things a presidential source said 
on condition of anonymity they had a plan to destabilize the 
country by taking over some of the oil installations they knew this 
was coming 
hernandez galicias power stems from the symbiotic relationship 
between the unions and the institutional revolutionary party which 
has ruled mexico for 60 years it is a relationship in which power 
and profit are exchanged for votes and peace in the workplace 
challenging the union leader who commands the loyalty of 
hundreds of thousands of workers is a bold move for president 
carlos salinas de gortari and a test of his vow to modernize 
politics and the economy 
the government news agency notimex said soldiers sealed off the 
area around hernandez galicias home fired into the air and blew 
down the door with a bazooka shot 
alvarez said 16 more people were arrested later on illegal 
weapons charges 
he said police confiscated 200 uzi submachine guns 16 other 
highcaliber weapons and 250000 rounds of ammunition at hernandez 
galicias house 
the attorney general said the treasury department had 
investigated hernandez galicia and his associates for months and 
that additional charges of murder and tax evasion would be filed 
the unions nominal leader secretarygeneral and former sen 
salvador barragan camacho was also wanted for questioning alvarez 
reported 
salinas met with his defense minister attorney general navy 
secretary and labor secretary to take measures to guarantee the 
security of the pemex installations and the supply of gasoline 
the source reported 
an estimated 6000 oil workers and their supporters quit work in 
mexico city headquarters of the stateowned oil monopoly petroleos 
mexicanos called pemex they marched to zocalo plaza shouting 
freedom for joaquin 
they were joined by busloads of workers from the refinery in 
tula to the north and more from other cities workers said buses 
arrived all afternoon carrying workers to demand freedom for la 
quina the diminutive by which hernandez galicia is known 
the 15000strong workforce at the pemex refinery and 
petrochemicals plant in the northern border city of reynosa also 
struck said gerasuro salinas editor of the newspaper el manana 
troops guarded installations but salinas described the situation as 
calm 
pemex accounts for 40 percent of mexicos revenue and about half 
the federal budget it has 180000 employees most of them union 
members 
all 8000 workers struck at the pemex refinery in salina cruz in 
oaxaca state on the pacific coast said lorenzo jaime editor at the 
newspaper el imparcial de oaxaca the refinery processes about 
70000 barrels of crude daily and serves as embarkation point for 
crude shipments to the far east he said 
notimex said partial shutdowns hit refineries in ciudad madero 
salamanca la cangrejera and cadereyta troops occupied pemex 
facilities in villahermosa capital of oilrich tabasco state in the 
southeast 
pemex said production was not affected in the bay of campeche 
notimex reported the oil monopoly appealed to the public to avoid 
panic buying of gasoline saying it had adequate inventories to meet 
demand 
augustin jimenez editor of the newspaper sol de tampico said 
oil workers blocked all major highways leading into tampico but no 
violence was reported 
soldiers occupied pemex installations at tampico and ciudad 
madero 220 miles northeast of mexico city and 250 miles south of 
brownsville texas 
at pemex headquarters spokesman francisco casanova alvarez 
reported work stoppages at mexico citys azcapotzalco refinery and 
the refinery at tula at least two refineries continued operating 
he said 
former union secretarygeneral jose sosa was among those arrested 
with hernandez galicia the attorney generals office said

central american immigrants streamed 
through southern texas on tuesday as a court order blocked the 
federal policy that had kept those applying for asylum from going on 
to their us destinations 
this morning when we opened up there were a lot of people in 
line said virginia kice spokeswoman for the immigration and 
naturalization services harlingen district at the southern tip of 
the state 
id estimate there were between 600 and 800 people in line when 
we opened up shop 
she said the crowd was one of the largest the harlingen ins 
office had seen and was reminiscent of the last days of the 
amnesty program last year when undocumented aliens primarily 
mexicans received legal status under a landmark immigrationreform 
law 
the asylumseeking immigrants tuesday were taking advantage of a 
threeday temporary restraining order issued monday by us district 
judge filemon vela that blocks an ins procedure that kept them from 
leaving the area 
greyhound lines tripled its normal houstonbound passenger loads 
tuesday on the morning and afternoon buses from brownsville and 
harlingen a company spokesman said 
most of the people about 75 percent are going to miami 
said george gravley greyhound spokesman in dallas 
gravley said similar heavy loads were expected for wednesday 
us rep solomon ortiz said meanwhile that asylumseekers who 
remain in southern texas will receive federal humanitarian relief 
possibly shelter while their cases are decided 
ortiz a democrat from corpus christi joined a special justice 
department team tuesday in taking a firsthand look at the 
immigrants needs 
what makes it a crisis is this county doesnt have the 
money or the infrastructure to provide the services ortiz said 
tuesday after meeting with officials from the justice departments 
community relations service 
the county has been impacted by a federal policy and we ought 
to do something about it the congressman said 
he said the threeperson justice department team probably would 
stay in southern texas for two or three days observing and meeting 
with local and federal officials 
ortiz said he expected the federal team to recommend food 
shelter and medical assistance the group was unavailable for 
comment he said explaining that the team wanted to avoid publicity 
the problem of homeless immigrants worsened here after the ins on 
dec 16 adopted a procedure designed to keep asylumseekers in the 
lower rio grande valley during the 30 days or more it would take to 
decide their claims for refugee status 
hundreds of central americans no longer able to travel to their 
us destinations to seek asylum began camping in empty lots and 
condemned buildings

president reagans critics say his proposed 
cuts in medicaid and medicare would curtail health care for the 56 
million elderly disabled and poor americans and could drive up 
state taxes 
public policy analysts members of congress and state officials 
all rejected reagans claim that the cuts will simply force states 
hospitals and physicians paid under the programs to be more 
efficient 
the giant federal healthcare programs have been the fastest 
growing segments of the budget of the department of health and human 
services the largest federal agency spending 37 percent of the 
governments entire budget 
reagans spending proposal for fiscal 1990 would trim medicaid 
growth chiefly by cutting grants to states by 3 percent and reducing 
payments to hospitals and physicians serving medicare patients

do credit card users simply not care about income 
taxes 
a curious turn of consumer events is developing and it might 
take the insight of a psychologist rather than an economist to 
explain it rather than falling as anticipated credit card debt is 
rising sharply 
the consequences are costly with borrowing rates rising 
interest on that debt will of course be more costly but perhaps 
even more important taxes on that debt will be much higher this 
year than last 
nevertheless borrowers went on a binge in november adding 45 
billion more in consumer debt revolving credit which grew more 
than 20 percent accounted for 31 billion made up increasingly 
of credit card activities 
last year 40 percent of interest paid qualified for deductions 
on income tax returns this year the total is cut to just 20 
percent a preliminary step toward eliminating the deductibility 
altogether 
the rise in consumer indebtedness doesnt necessarily mean that 
otherwise conservative individuals have decided to let go its more 
a reflection of the increase in the number of people working which 
is the primary ingredient of socalled consumer confidence measures 
but the continued rise is a puzzle to those analysts of the 1986 
tax changes who argued that one way to keep spending in bounds was 
to remove the tax benefits some even contended that the heyday of 
credit cards was ended 
one explanation now is that the phenomeon is a result not just of 
growing consumer confidence but of an actual need to use credit 
that is individuals with insufficient cash for their needs are 
reluctantly resorting to borrowing 
another possibility is the marketing efforts of the credit card 
people who offer various incentives and prizes based on a 
customers continued use habit convenience and some vendor 
insistence on cards tend to solidify usage 
changes in tax deductibility were imposed as part of the tax act 
of 1986 by 1991 that deductibility will be phased out altogether 
after dropping to 10 percent in 1990 
included in the phaseout is interest not just on credit card 
charges but financing charges and revolving charge account charges 
cash advances personal and automobile loans student loans 
insurance loans and tax deficiencies 
still another expense is added to those using many bank cards 
this is the annual fee which some banks have added and others 
increased over the past year or more such membership fees generally 
are not tax deductible 
in december of 1986 after the tax bill was passed the federal 
reserve reported that consumer installment debt amounted to 5949 
billion at the end of november 1988 the same debt category totaled 
66551 billion 
while much of that increase can be explained in terms of a 
growing economy it also suggests strongly that many people by 
choice need indifference or ignorance havent been scared off by 
tax and other credit expenses

the incredible pressure to win from his 
father from his coach and from himself forced runner glen 
shrevelowe to take steroids 
this timely story told in the movie finish line on turner 
network television reflects events at the summer olympics that are 
allegedly occurring in locker rooms around the world 
he was pushed from every side said josh brolin who stars as 
the young runner his father is played by his reallife father 
james brolin their appearance in tonights movie is their first 
together 
he had always been the faster runner but now that he was going 
for the olympics he ran into the really fast runners he needed an 
extra boost ben johnson needed that extra boost to beat carl 
lewis the younger brolin said referring to the canadian and us 
sprint stars 
the movie was in production in eugene ore when johnson lost 
his seoul olympics gold medal in the 100meter race after traces of 
steroids were found in urine tests 
james brolin plays martin shrevelowe an architect and former 
track star who wants his son to excel in college track and field 
glens earliest memories are those of his fathers embrace and 
praise after an athletic event he learned early that winning 
pleased his father 
he put too much emphasis on winning said the elder brolin 
the son became neurotic in fact they were both neurotic its 
passed on from generation to generation when does it stop 
josh had his point of view about how it should be done i had 
mine i think the best movies are when everyone sits down to discuss 
it and everyone disagrees on the interpretation then each person 
can bring a uniqueness to his role too often the players merely 
become an extention of the directors vision 
glen is a top sprinter in high school but he finds fierce 
competition on the collegiate level and for the olympic tryouts 
steroids seem to be the answer he becomes a winner but the drugs 
kill him 
in a survey they asked 1000 athletes would they take steroids 
if it guaranteed victory but would kill them in five years josh 
said eightyfive percent said yes but steroids are so prevalent 
its not just athletes kids on the beach who want to look good take 
them it pumps up the muscles and makes you look macho its so sad 
because nobody knows what the longterm effects are 
the movie which also stars mariska hargitay was written by 
norman morrill and directed by john nicolella its from 
guberpetersbarris productions 
the toughest part for josh was getting in shape for the running 
scenes 
im not a runner he said i had to give up smoking and 
start running its really painful i dont understand why people do 
it youre supposed to get a high but i never found it its hard 
for me to run because i have a long body and short legs 
running the 400meter run was the hardest you have to run a 
quarter of a mile my best time was 59 seconds 
although people have suggested other projects this is our 
first time together said james brolin we were looking for 
something meaningful i feel this is joshs picture i felt i was 
just there then when i saw it i realized how important my role was 
before we made it i kept saying i didnt know if this is the one 
his son added we waited such a long time to work together we 
wanted to do something substantial not just another episode of 
hotel 
the reference is to james brolins former abc series hotel 
josh was in the nbc series private eye last year their series 
were both canceled on the same day 
the elder brolin laughed when he remembered the opposite 
reactions 
you were shocked he said of his sons series fate i was 
overjoyed ive got my eyes open for another series im not in a 
hurry hotel was never my favorite but i knew it was going to 
last for a long time i thought we were going to break out of the 
aaron spelling mold then the love boat shut down and they brought 
in that crew after the first year it got watered down 
james brolin also recently completed a role in the miniseries 
voice of the heart based on the book by barbara bradford 
taylor josh was going to new york to look for work on the stage

scientists are studying the 
traditional mayan medicine still practiced by thousands of indians 
in mexicos southern highlands some of whom speak to the gods from 
sacred hilltops 
there are yerberos or experts in medicinal herbs parteras or 
midwives and pediatricians pulsadores who diagnose by reading the 
pulse and hueseros who set bones and act as the rough equivalent 
of chiropracters 
most exalted are the curanderos also called shamans or rezadores 
de los cerros those who know how to speak to the gods 
among them is sebastian gonzalez who lives in chamula a town in 
the highlands of chiapas state near the guatemala frontier 
my grandfather was a curandero amd ive been a curandero since 
i was 8 years old when i began to dream about people with big 
baskets of flowers said gonzalez 48 
those dreams led a pulsador to declare that the boy was a 
curandero at first gonzalez worked with candles a key element of 
religious ceremonies that mix ancient pantheism with the roman 
catholicism brought by spanish conquerors 
when i was about 14 or 15 years old i began to ask my 
grandfather about plants gonzalez said 
dr brent berlin a linguistic anthropologist from the university 
of california at berkeley leads a joint usmexican project to 
compile an encyclopedia of contemporary mayan medicine in several 
languages including tzotzil which is spoken in chamula 
if you could look inside a mayan indians head about 80 
percent is going to have something to do with the world of plants 
he said they are very close to the earth these people have been 
agriculturalists for thousands of years 
herbal medicine is taken seriously in mexico people in all walks 
of life and every part of the country use the cures 
government health agencies enlist the aid of practitioners and 
are studying the plants many of them use 
gonzalez president of the state organization of indigenous 
doctors says about 7000 curanderos practice in chiapas he said he 
has learned how to use about 300 medicinal plants each of which has 
special rules for preparation and use 
there are plants that cant be picked by men there are plants 
that cant be picked by women he explained there are plants 
that must be used dry and others that must be used fresh 
he said the compass points are important when a shaman prays on a 
sacred hilltop 
a curandero known as don antonio said he made his reputation in 
1926 at age 19 or 20 after a villager was hit by a truck and 
suffered a nosebleed that would not stop don antonio said he 
stopped it after a week with tree bark and prayers 
a grant from the us national science foundation in late 1986 
allowed berlin to start the ambitious project of cataloging 
contemporary mayan medicine and its array of herbs 
researchers have collected 1500 species of medicinal plants and 
identified 98 percent of them berlin said and compiled the mayan 
names of almost 200 illnesses 
he discourages the notion that miracle cures will be found and 
said his team is not yet investigating active properties of the 
plants 
thats the second stage he said first you have to find 
out what people think causes the cure 
some interesting discoveries have been made however berlin said 
solanum lancioflorium an herb commonly called sosa was found to 
contain an antibiotic 
traditional medicine has a valid role berlin said especially 
among people like the indians of chiapas he described them as a 
fourth world population that does not have access to the 
resources the assets of the rest of mexican society 
he pointed out that mayan medicine does not involve expensive 
doctors and the herbs are easily obtainable either free or 
inexpensive 
this knowledge of the medicinal properties of the flora is 
widely shared by the community he said whats not shared is 
how to talk to the gods 
modern and mayan medicine have different definitions of diseases 
and their causes as well as different cures 
the greatest dissimilarities are when the diagnosis is not 
based on symptoms but on ideology berlin said 
a physician might blame an ailment on a virus he said while a 
shaman would trace it to an offense by the patient against the gods 
or the evil eye of an enemy

presidentelect george bush will culminate his 
inauguration with prayers for gods guidance of the new 
administration stressing the importance of worship in his life 
in an open letter mailed to nearly 300000 american clergy all 
those of any kind whose addresses could be obtained he asked that 
they join in similar devotions across the country on that occasion 
he also suggested nationwide ringing of church bells at the time 
he said he and his wife barbara believe it is most fitting 
that the events of my inauguration as president conclude in an 
ecumenical service of prayer and thanksgiving 
such a service has been planned on sunday morning jan 22 at 
the washington cathedral the episcopal center in the nations 
capital and the denomination of bush and his family 
roman catholic jewish and protestant leaders are to participate 
including the head of bushs denomination episcopal presiding 
bishop edmond l browning of new york 
the service caps the weekend inaugural events following the 
formal inauguration ceremonies of jan 20 
worship is basic to my own life bush said our family has 
endeavored to uphold our faith by participation in the life of our 
church 
he added that he was particularly pleased the inauguration will 
end on a note of asking gods guidance on the new beginning which 
opens before us 
vice presidentelect dan quale and i very much hope that this 
service will be part of similar observances of prayer and 
thanksgiving throughout our country we ask that you join us by 
using elements of the national service bush added 
copies of the washington liturgy were sent to them in advance for 
their use 
roy pfautch of washington chairman of the national day of 
prayer and thanksgiving designated for the occasion said the 
affair was churcharranged to avoid any impression of ties to the 
government 
the service was scheduled at regular sunday time of worship 
washingtons episcopal bishop john t walker who is host of the 
event issued invitations to particpants including the bush family 
a similar day of prayer and thanksgiving was arranged at reagans 
secondterm inauguration in 1985 
pfautch a public affairs consultant and inactive presbyterian 
clergyman said faith was definitely an emphasis in bushs 
election and he wanted it to be the culmination of the inaugural 
this is very much part of his thinking and of his family that 
faith is the foundation part of life and he wanted it expressed in 
the inauguration pfautch said 
its very fitting and one of the beauties of the country that 
congregations of different kinds can come together in their own 
churches many using the same litanies and scripture texts 
catholic protestant and jewish 
bush in his open letter mailed to pastors throughout the nation 
by the interfaith committee headed by pfautch said 
we will be united in praise to god for the blessings which have 
endowed our nation and in asking for leadership as we face the 
challenges of the future 
as the bells ring across our land on jan 22 may their joyous 
sound express our gladness for the blessings the lord has given and 
equally express our renewed commitment to seeking goodwill and peace 
among all peoples 
in addition to the episcopal bishops walker and browning 
participants in the washington service are to include leaders of 
various us denominations with the following taking active roles 
in the liturgy 
cardinal james hickey roman catholic archbishop of washington 
archbishop iakovos of new york head of the greek orthodox

a tendency to assume that religion is concerned 
largely with salvation in the hereafter rather than with present 
life was rebutted by a recent study 
it found that religious bodies lead the field in charitable work 
for others surpassing foundations and corporations 
brian oconnell president of independent sector a coalition of 
660 corporate foundation and voluntary philantrophic organizations 
that sponsored the study said 
we realize more than we had expected how much the organized 
neighborliness of religious organizations means to the kind of 
caring society we are 
the study found that almost half of the 414 billion contributed 
in 1986 to religion was used to support services to others the rest 
was spent on internal activities such as worship and religious 
education 
pollster george gallup whose organization gathered the data 
said it showed churches are among our most costeffective 
institutions in philantropic work with minimal administrative 
overhead

president reagan who came to washington vowing 
to cut the federal government down to size slowed its growth and 
trimmed its sails but fell short of many of his more ambitious goals 
he hasnt done any of it melvin laird former secretary of 
defense and white house counselor who served for years as a 
republican member of the house appropriations committee said in an 
interview 
he hasnt done much to change the size of the bureaucracy 
said philip buchen white house counsel in the ford adminstration 
he promised more than he could deliver said charles w dunn 
professor of political science at clemson university and a former 
republican congressional aide 
he has punched at the marshmallow and the marshmallow has 
absorbed his punches pretty effectively said dunn he has 
changed the shape of the marshmallow a little bit but obviously not 
as much as he wanted to 
i wouldnt call it a revolution i would call it more of a 
retrenchment said herman belz a neoconservative historian at 
the university of maryland 
that there has been a change and a retrenchment few deny 
from 1958 to 1980 according to figures from the office of 
personnel management the federal civilian work force excluding 
postal workers increased by 420000 or about 24 percent over the 
past eight years it increased by 33000 or about 15 percent 
compared with an average population growth in the united states of 
about 1 percent 
so the change has been in the rate of the growth of government 
which essentially has stabilized in this period said william 
norton director of executive administration for the office of 
personnel management 
i think what you can say about reagan is that the size of the 
domestic government is smaller overall than it would have been 
otherwise said john e chubb senior fellow in governmental 
studies at the liberally oriented brookings institute 
in his 1980 campaign reagan pledged to abolish two cabinet 
departments the department of energy and the department of 
education both are still in place and congress with reagans 
support created a new department by upgrading the veterans 
administration to cabinet status 
government ownership of conrail general revenue sharing and 
urban development action grants were eliminated during reagans 
administration the civil aeronautics board and community services 
agency also fell by the wayside but both these were due to actions 
in the carter administration that took effect after reagan became 
president 
the neoconservative scholar belz said one thing that made a 
big difference was a reagan executive order requiring agency 
regulations to be reviewed by the office of management and budget 
this too however was a legacy of the carter administration an 
outgrowth of the paperwork reduction act that carter signed a few 
weeks before leaving office 
rather than necessarily cutting down the number of agencies he 
has made what exists work better said barbara clay spokeswoman 
for the budget office 
prior to this administration there were something like over 
400 financial accounting systems in the government and they were all 
incompatible she said so what ronald reagan has done is to 
install a governmentwide financial accounting system in order to 
make sure that for instance agricultures numbers are comparable 
to commerces numbers 
overall ms clay said what has happened is that we have 
put in management tools and systems that didnt exist prior to this 
administration 
in addition to such bookkeeping improvements and steps to share 
power with state and local governments reagan gets credit for 
helping along with the staggering budget deficit to make the 
government establishment more costconscious 
everyone who has any say about the purse strings is conscious 
that they have got to curtail the spending said buchen it is 
remarkable it seems to me that he has had so many converts among 
the democrats 
the results are pretty dismal but the talk is much better than 
it used to be the former ford white house aide said congress 
was never even talking like that now at least they pay lip service 
to the idea of cutting back 
brookings chubb said since reagan has been in office the 
agenda has really changed to what i would call an agenda of limited 
government now we are really talking about what the government can 
get out of what the government can use the private sector to 
accomplish what the government can accomplish through state and 
local government and so forth 
by chubbs calculations discretionary domestic programs such as 
education health and transportation have been in real terms cut 
in half and all of the slack has been picked up surprisingly by 
state governments and to some extent local governments 
vaughn davis bornet a professor emeritus of history at southern 
oregon state college who has written extensively on the johnson 
administration said reagan has essentially diminished the power 
of the central government and given a lot of that power back to the 
states exactly what johnson did in reverse 
beyond that said bornet who classifies himself as a 
moderate republican if you look at the fine print expenditures 
war on poverty education and so on it seems to me he has not 
reduced the federal expenditures in this area or the bureaucracy 
very much either 
clemson political scientist dunn however said reagans 
ideology and the symbols of his ideology have helped him shift the 
tone of national debate and that in tandem with the budget 
deficit has forced liberal democrats to be leery of proposing new 
programs 
chubb at brookings said that as long as the budget deficit 
endures the pressures to hold down domestic spending will remain 
and he is not sure it is an accident 
the budget deficit is reagans insurance policy he said i 
dont know whether he took it out intentionally or inadvertently 
but its the guarantee that we wont move in another direction or 
develop another agenda until thats under control 
although reagan spoke out against a washington colony of 
entrenched potomac veterans old washington hand laird said he 
believed the president fit comfortably into that scene himself in 
contrast to carter who remained an outsider through his four years 
in the white house 
i think he has gotten along very well with the people who have 
been around in government the former secretary of defense said 
he always acts as though he wants your help and counsel and 
advice 
as to why reagan did not move further to dismantle the federal 
government he campaigned so hard against laird said i think he 
has found there was a place for it

warning the opinions expressed on randy newmans 
records should not be taken too seriously 
so dont be too offended when newman urges the united states to 
drop the big one on its allies or informs us that god considers 
the human race to be little more than a source of amusement 
he doesnt really mean it 
but if youre a little sensitive dont listen too carefully to 
his new album land of dreams because you probably wont like 
the song in which newman abandons his wife and kids and tells his 
despondent son i want you to hurt like i do 
those lyrics probably will get newman in trouble a press 
conference will be hastily assembled and newman will have to explain 
his poorly chosen words 
dont laugh its happened to him before back in the 1970s 
newman had a fluke hit single with short people which contained 
the refrain short people got no reason to live listeners were 
outraged at the bigotry of the 6footplus newman causing the 
song to actually be banned on some radio stations 
its amazing how sensitive people are about that thing billy 
crystal was supposed to be upset you know what i think its pretty 
clear said newman who went on to let his offended listeners off 
the hook its not really their fault theyre not used to irony 
in songs theyre supposed to take the words at face value 
newman of course isnt entirely blameless not that he really 
dislikes short people or believes that a poor black child should 
roll with the punches as he sings on the new album 
what gets him in trouble is he expresses the most controversial 
opinions without a hint of distance he doesnt sing about racism 
he sings as a racist 
but newman pleads artistic license im not saying it hes 
doing it in the song but i disagree 
just as he disagrees with the obscene phone caller in suzanne 
and the slave trader in sail away but newman cant deny a 
certain affection for these and other sordid characters 
you can laugh at some of these people he said theyre so 
insensitive they lack such selfknowledge the audience will laugh 
becuase its so hard so rough its sort of a liberating thing 
hopefully we are better 
as sung in dixie flyer the lead track of land of dreams 
newman was born in los angeles in 1943 and lived for a few years in 
new orleans he came from a musical family movie music that is 
his uncle alfred was a soundtrack conductor 
newmans own musical background was more contemporary fats 
domino was a favorite so was ray charles but newman a piano 
player himself was not looking to be famous 
i never thought id be anything but a writer newman said 
i never thought of performing or recording 
newman got his first break in 1962 when his composition they 
tell me its summer appeared as the bside of a single by the 
fleetwoods 
after having songs covered by such artists as the ojays little 
peggy march and irma thomas his career received another boost in 
1966 when judy collins performed his i think its going to rain 
today on her popular in my life album 
by 1968 the demand for newman to make an album of his own had 
become too strong to resist john lennon called him to say all the 
beatles had his demos and dusty springfield included two newman 
songs on her classic dusty in memphis lp 
i think aampm and warners had heard the demos newman said i 
was pulled into it rather than having any great ambition 
warner bros won out and newmans selftitled debut album came 
out later that year no one not even bob dylan could have prepared 
listeners for a song like beehive state in which newman as the 
representative of utah at a national convention pleads for his 
fellow delegates to remember a whole country exists between los 
angeles and new york 
it was for people in the east he said in the west maybe 
they dont know delaware 
and in davy the fat boy davys only friend makes a deathbed 
promise to the boys parents that he will take care of their beloved 
son but proceeds to put poor davy in a sideshow 
newman has made critically acclaimed albums such as 12 songs 
and sail away but has failed to acheive major commercial 
success 
while its no longer true that all combined my records have 
sold as many copies as james taylors last album sold in des 
moines as newman once joked his sales hardly come close to 
george michael or whitney houston 
i wouldnt mind selling more records if it didnt change my 
life enormously newman said why not a million instead of 
300000 but it might affect the nature of the audiences when i 
play a place much over 10000 theres too much inattention 
he has never failed to be noticed by his peers however newmans 
songs have been used by ray charles linda ronstadt art garfunkel 
and etta james harry nilsson recorded an entire album of his 
compositions and newmans music was even used as the basis of the 
offbroadway show the middle of nowhere 
its tremendously nice when someone good thinks that im very 
good he said people who do this have always liked me showbiz 
folks harry nilsson doing an album of my songs its what always i 
wanted 
and newman hopes listeners also appreciate his unique music 
im interested in people who are a little off let the audience 
figure out how i feel about them let them enjoy these people who 
are worse off than we are

something there is about an actor who loves 
the act of giving so it was nice to find a bunch of santa 
clauses running around the set of the new james bond movie 
license revoked 
timothy dalton has been very giving as an actor said robert 
davi forgetting for the moment that his villainous character spends 
the last part of the movie trying to grind daltonbond into cocaine 
dust 
i dont think you can create anything if you dont give 
returned dalton who manages to give davis character a hole in the 
head 
hes very professional very focused said carey lowell of 
dalton shortly after saving bond from a fate worse than coke 
its better than working with somebody who doesnt give a damn 
seriously now 
i would loathe a concept of work in which people are competing 
with each other said dalton i think it is a twoway process 
it is a game where you throw something at somebody and they throw it 
back at you 
in other words these actors say this is how they work they 
have nothing to give but themselves and that can be scary but if 
an actor holds back if nothing is given nothing can be thrown back 
its probably true that some actors see it as a competition 
but it seems very ungenerous to attempt to deny to another actor the 
tools with which to work dalton said i think if you look at 
any really good actors youll find them all very giving 
lowell whose face has decorated the covers of vogue and 
mademoiselle understands that concept as one of the differences 
between modeling and acting 
its different from modeling because you dont have to give to 
the camera you give to the actors instead she said and if you 
give only to the camera in a film if youre static it shows 
immediately its difficult 
to hear these people talk youd think making moving pictures was 
fun not long hours of work intense concentration weird 
situations just what does an actor think about while hogtied on a 
conveyor belt waiting to be ground almost to magnesium dust 
thats what they use as a standin for cocaine 
when youre in the thick of it you have to think of what to do 
in the scene youve got to be on form and on key and 
concentrated said dalton 
the effort to maintain concentration is why he has a reputation 
for being difficult for outsiders to talk to on the set 
if you cant get it right you dont get a moment to do it 
again he said you just dont get a moment to do it again 
now lets back up the film is license revoked and it is due 
for release in the summer james bond loses his license to kill and 
goes off the reservation to avenge his friend cia agent felix 
leiter who gave his leg to some sharks with the help of 
franz sanchez davi an evil drug lord modeled a little bit on 
gen manuel antonio noriega de facto ruler of panama who has been 
indicted on drug trafficking charges in the united states he is 
foiled with the help of 
pam bouvier lowell a former pilot for the cia who worked with 
leiter and who saves bond and helps giftwrap sanchez at mexico 
citys churusbusco studios under the direction of john glen 
dalton 42 is a classically trained actor who has established 
his ability to play all kinds of roles everything from 
shakespeares richard ii to the male lead opposite mae west in 
sextette 
that range is the envy of lowell and davi who would like to have 
the opportunity to show that they too can change their spots 
unfortunately i always have to play a beautiful girl now i 
want to do something less stylish the 27yearold lowell said 
davi 35 would like to go up the style scale not down and to 
that end hes trying to push the envelope on the bond villain bit 
this guy could be a friend who you think itd be nice to have a 
drink with but after the last sip he stabs you it kind of makes 
him fun to play said davi 
i want to make my mark in film he said i want to be an 
international star i want to get the girl without putting a gun to 
her head im looking for mister goodguy 
dalton thinks theyve both got a chance 
everyone has to be good because you want a good movie it 
would be stupid and destructive not to be a creative giving actor 
its how we work together

if robert davi ever gets tired of being a 
villain on film he can always try opera thats how he got his 
start in show biz and when he talks about a character it can sound 
a bit well operatic 
i was a high baritone loved verdi said davi who plays drug 
lord franz sanchez in license revoked the latest james bond 
movie due out in the summer i sang for the lyric opera of long 
island 
davi 35 did that when he was 19 he even studied with tito 
gobbi one of the great voices of italy 
if i was still singing i wouldnt be doing any of this now 
he said waving at a bond set gloomy with smoke from the fire that 
destroys the villains laboratory 
i wouldnt be smoking cigars or drinking and id get out of 
this air mexico citys worldrecord pollution i wouldnt even be 
talking i would be totally crazy 
after im established as an actor id like to spend six months 
and work on the voice now the voice is getting the black mark 
timothy dalton who plays bond had proposed that davi play 
sanchez as an opera buff i suggested to him that he had to find a 
moment where he sang a bar or two probably at an odd moment right 
after or just before he killed somebody whistle or sing a couple of 
bars 
we thought about it when we first met davi said timothy 
wanted me to try something but i decided i better not i did the 
same thing in goonies sort of played a frustrated opera singer i 
didnt want to do the same thing as i did in the spielberg film 
which was full of pirate ships and fantasies i want to be 
remembered for something else in this film 
but dalton said he didnt see why davi should worry about that 
if its a good idea 
all actors have good ideas but theyre not always germane to 
the piece said davi more diplomatic than sparafucile the hired 
killer of verdis rigoletto 
but sanchez seductive charming and totally immoral as 
davi conceived him might be able to hold his own with many another 
opera bad guy 
the most difficult was when i walked through that house in 
acapulco that was supposed to be the house i owned a 30 million 
house i dont have 30 million davi said 
you know a lot of actors when they play something like that 
you see them in the house but you dont really believe that they own 
it i had to go through that house and feel like i owned it 
then he bursts into a snatch of va tosca a solo in which 
the evil scarpia boasts that hes infected toscas heart with 
jealousy by fooling her into thinking her boyfriend is fooling 
around 
watch out puccini

once a little city with clean if rainy skies and 
clear mountain views fastgrowing seattle has become a metropolis 
with the usual smog and traffic jams some people are starting to 
protest 
a citizens group turned in 18000 signatures on an initiative to 
limit the height and density of downtown buildings and debate is 
gearing up before a vote this spring 
the building boom is easy to see and much of it has occurred in 
the past decade three skyscrapers are under construction and 
permit applications for three more were submitted before a recently 
imposed sixmonth moratorium on downtown growth 
the 55story washington mutual tower was completed last year 
bumping the 50story 1001 fourth avenue plaza to third tallest no 
1 is the west coasts tallest building the 76story blackglass 
columbia seafirst center built in 1985 before downtown zoning went 
into effect a dozen office towers are 30 stories or more and all 
but three were opened in the 1980s 
the thousands of workers in these buildings plus tourists and 
shoppers make downtown seattle a lively place 
fishmongers farmers stalls crafts booths and restaurants 
compete shouldertoshoulder at the historic hectic pike place 
market 
redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront and the 
downtown retail core with major flagship department stores and a 
variety of small businesses recently settled one 30yearold 
landuse debate with the opening of westlake center a new mall of 
expensive shops and a 24story office tower 
supporters of the citizens alternative plan to downtown 
development or cap say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more 
pollution as more people commute by car and more boxlike apartmnt 
buildings replace singlefamily houses and dilute the flavor of old 
city neighborhoods 
cap wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the 
office district new office floor space would be limited to 500000 
square feet a year for the next five years and 1 million square feet 
a year from 1995 through 1999 after that the ceiling would be 
lifted unless reimposed by the city council 
by contrast nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office 
space is newly completed under construction or has received city 
permits said virginia galle a city council member and cap 
supporter 
at the present rate of growth in 10 years some 67000 new office 
workers are expected to occupy 52000 new households and make 29000 
more car trips daily into downtown she said 
there is no height limit under the citys current zoning plan a 
buildings size is worked out according to a formula based on the 
size of the site with extra height allowed in exchange for such 
amenities as plazas retail space and day care centers 
cap supporters insist they want growth but not at a high cost to 
the environment and the neighborhoods 
were not antigrowth in the traditional sense says patrick 
strosahl a jeweler and president of vision seattle which supports 
cap were really much more into shaping growth so that it 
produces and accentuates the livability of the city 
some participants in the growth debate argue the city needs 
controls that are more lenient than the cap initiative 
mayor charles royer presented a plan of his own that would limit 
office towers to about 50 stories it would stiffen the zoning code 
but not as much as cap would 
royer also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow 
developers to build higher his plan would shift the emphasis of the 
bonuses from streetlevel amenities to housing human services and 
open space 
the downtown seattle association a group of developers and 
business executives contends the 1985 zoning law is strict enough 
john gilmore president of the association says downtown growth 
makes more sense than spreading development into neighborhods and 
suburbs a downtown provides a focal point for a rapidtransit 
system something seattle needs he said and seattle must grow he 
contended were having childen like every other part of the 
country and theres got to be jobs 
folke nyberg a professor of urban planning and architecture at 
the university of washington agreed seattles location on the 
pacific rim means it will grow but disagreed that concentrated 
downtown growth is good 
seattle has an hourglass figure squeezed between puget 
sound and lake washington he said so there are some very limited 
physical constraints that makes it imperative that we have an 
effective transportation solution before we allow growth to happen 
and this was not done 
a better way to grow nyberg said would be in decentralized 
clusters throughout the region people in these smaller cities would 
live near their jobs and go to downtown seattle mainly for 
conventions and cultural events 
instead unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality 
traffic congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of 
afforable housing he said 
seattle which has been a very livable city he said failed 
to learn from other cities mistakes asked why he replied its 
all greed 
the growthcontrol initiative goes before voters in the spring 
but a date has not been set 
gilmore of the downtown seattle association said that the 
citys 1985 downtown zoning was the product of four years of debate 
and that any changes should be made through more hearings and city 
council votes the american institute of architects local chapter 
agrees 
cap supporters however say their plan is reasonable and timely 
according to strosahl san francisco needed to enact stiffer 
downtown limits in 1986 because it waited too long until the cost 
of housing went way up and the character of the city changed 
san francisco voters approved the limits after a building spree 
in which 25 million square feet of office space was added between 
1979 and 1984 the high rises nearly blocked out all the sun in san 
franciscos financial district 
san franciscos voterapproved plan limits new office space to 
475000 square feet for several years for a city with a population 
of 690000 that compares with caps limits of 500000 square feet 
for five years and 1 million square feet for the next five in a city 
of 490000 
gilmore suggests people who signed cap did not really want to 
limit growth but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown 
caused by construction of a downtown bus tunnel and a state 
convention center the initiative text was long and complicated and 
people probably did not read it he said 
whats more the petition had just 329 more signatures than it 
needed 
strosahl thinks voters will pass the initiative but he expects a 
highly financed campaign against it

its called the arsenio hall show but its 
star suggests it should be called the rainbow coalition talk 
show 
the syndicated latenight talk show was recently launched into 
competition on more than 135 stations against nbcs johnny carson 
and david letterman and fellow newcomer pat sajak on cbs 
not since the late 1960s and early 1970s when all three networks 
fielded talk shows has there been such yakking at the witching 
hour in addition about a dozen other syndicated or cable talk 
shows with stars from kenny rogers to joan rivers are in 
production or waiting in the wings 
everybodys talking about the new talk shows said 
comedianactor hall 29 i think pat sajak should call his show 
am sajak i think the people he attracts will be asleep by 1130 
at night lettermans basically a comedy show i dont care who the 
guests are i tune in to watch david and johnnys a legend hell 
be around as long as he wants 
i think the problem with most talk shows is that theyre 
caucasian boys clubs my show is going to be more reflective of 
america americas a melting pot and that makes for an interesting 
mixture i dont see that on the other shows you can tune in every 
night for a month and not see a black person 
people will say im the black talk show host he said i 
say ignore my color if im good watch it if im not good dont 
watch it talk is what i do best and most i think god put me here 
to be a talkshow host 
a few days before the arsenio hall show premiered on jan 3 
hall was feeling the tension his office at paramount studios had 
the look of a showroom for toys r us 
im trying to control the stress level hall said i cant 
move to an island so im discovering adult toys at the moment he 
was manipulating the radio control for a racing car that was 
speeding around the outer office in one corner was a basketball 
hoop there was also a table tennis set 
his private office had enough doodads to please a bored child on 
a rainy day hall settled behind the big ushaped black desk he was 
wearing a cleveland indians warmup jacket and hat perched backward 
on his head 
hall is not new to the talk show format a year and a half ago he 
took over the late show on fox broadcasting co not long after 
the departure of joan rivers the ratings began to improve but hall 
left to costar with eddie murphy in the film coming to america 
it was while he was a guest on the tonight show promoting the 
movie that hall made up his mind to accept paramounts offer for a 
new talk show i made the decision during a commercial break he 
said id told paramount no at first i didnt want to play 
against johnny carson the idol who had made me want to do what i 
do but i cant sit on the sidelines and be a fan all my life i 
cant live my life through johnny carson if i fail i fail id 
feel even worse if id never tried 
although the talk shows are on the air at the same time in many 
cities hall said he doesnt think they are competing for the same 
audience 
i dont think competition is a problem he said my shows 
a different kind of show my demographics are different my job is 
not to cure racism my job is to present entertainment its not an 
issue of blacks and whites sometimes its between the young and the 
old i may not get dolly parton but maybe ill get the next dolly 
parton 
but this is not a minority talk show im not doing soul 
train at late night i just want to be first with some new talent 
something new wave with a cutting edge its a talk show for 
people who dont have a talk show now johnny has his loyal fans 
but those fans have kids and maybe theyll watch me 
hall tapes his show late every afternoon at paramount studios and 
its sent out by satellite paramount distributes entertainment 
tonight in a similar manner 
hall started performing early in his hometown of cleveland and 
at the age of 12 told his mother he wanted to do what johnny carson 
does his parents however insisted he go to college i thought 
it was a waste of time he said but now i see its really 
helped me 
he worried that he had missed his shot by going to college i 
saw letterman get his show he said i saw garry shandling get 
his break then jay leno took me under his wing he was a great 
inspiration for me

farm price supports rural development 
programs food stamps and school lunches are bigticket budget 
categories where president reagan hopes to save money in the 
agriculture department 
but some of the fine print bears a closer look screwworm 
control for example and the everpresent fire ant and dont 
forget usdas battalion of economists and a pressing need to upgrade 
their fearless predictions 
some of what was in reagans final budget sent to congress last 
week will probably be reworked by the incoming bush administration 
but a lot will be rubberstamped as is before congress has its say 
so far congressional farm leadership has reacted grumpily to 
reagans usda budget plans rep kika de la garza chairman of the 
house agriculture committee dtexas said the reagan spending 
blueprint probably had been dead for some time before it even got to 
capitol hill 
overall the reagan budget calls for usda spending in the 1990 
fiscal year that will begin on oct 1 to be about 424 billion 
down 19 percent from 521 billion this year 
most of the 97 billion in cuts would come from commodity price 
support operations and various other programs lumped under small 
community and rural development a number of other categories would 
be cut too but some would get increases 
among the departments marketing and inspection programs for 
example the animal and plant health inspection service would be 
able to boost its services to a program level of 353 million 
from an estimated 3338 million this year the agencys cash 
outlays however would decline to 296 million from 341 million 
this year 
program level represents the total financial value of benefits 
provided to the public while outlays are actual spending the 
amounts the treasury pays to carry out various programs 
as used by usda program levels include the value of professional 
services such as research or technical assistance activities or 
inkind benefits such as governmentowned commodities 
the agency aphis would hold brucellosis eradication at 558 
million in the 1990 budget unchanged from this year under this 
program the agency works with state industry organizations and 
individual livestock herd owners to control and eliminate the 
disease 
screwworm control another aphis function also would remain at 
the current level of 32 million the control effort is aimed at 
curbing the screwworm fly which produces the larvae or maggot 
that injures and sometimes kills cattle sheep and other 
warmblooded animals if not treated 
the 1990 funds would enable aphis to continue its operations in 
mexico and guatemala to prevent the northward movement of the flies 
other aphis activities include programs to control cotton boll 
weevils medflies grasshoppers and fire ants and certain predators 
mainly coyotes that prey on livestock 
an agency that looks out for the welfare of the consuming public 
is the food safety and inspection service which was proposed to 
operate at a 1990 program level of 424 million up from an 
estimated 406 million this year the same as its outlays 
inspection at livestock and poultry slaughter plants is expected 
to account for 2422 million in 1990 up from 2316 million this 
year inspection at processing plants would rise to 988 million 
from the current operating level of 968 million 
in the agricultural marketing service regulatory operations 
would be programmed at 1711 million only slightly above this 
years 1708 million outlays are expected to rise to 127 million 
from 113 million this year 
user fees would support 81 percent of the agencys 1990 budget 
according to the reagan plan including 125 million in new user 
fees to cover postage printing and handling of tobacco market news 
reports and several other operations 
other marketing and inspection agencies include the federal grain 
inspection service the office of transportation packers and 
stockyards administration and the agricultural cooperative service 
another usda group involves economics and statistics which 
provide so much of the grist that goes into the making of farm 
policy in congress as well as within the administration 
the outlays for this group would increase to 123 million from 
this years spending of 114 million approximately the combined 
program levels for two agencies the economic research service and 
the national agricultural statistics service 
department budget officials said the ers is seeking an additional 
24 million to collect and analyze data on pesticide and chemical 
use in agriculture the nass wants an increase of 74 million to 
improve crop yield estimates and to upgrade information processing 
systems in state offices of the agency 
another category in the budget is departmental activities 
sort of a catchall item with 1990 spending pegged at 117 million 
down from this years 120 million included are operations of the 
office of the secretary of agriculture the usdas inspector general 
and general counsel and various administrative offices

fans think country music singer faron 
young who has had top billing over elvis presley and sold more than 
30 million records is more than 70 years old because hes been a 
show business fixture for almost four decades 
hes really just 56 
ive been around so long that when i tell people im 56 years 
old they laugh and say and how many more the best thing is to 
say youre 75 and then they say you look good for your age 
young has been singing about sin and sentimentality in a belting 
baritone since 1951 hes released 60 albums and had classic country 
music hits such as hello walls its four in the morning and 
sweet dreams 
his recording career tailed off in the mid1980s but hes back 
again with the album heres to you hes also on the road 
performing about 150 days a year and he appears regularly on the 
nashville network on cable tv 
young a swashbuckling whippersnapper in the mid50s feels no 
jealousy toward younger country stars such as randy travis and 
george strait who reign over the music charts like he did 30 years 
ago 
when those kids hit it big today they aint hurting me a 
bit young said in an interview they are widening the spectrum 
of country music the us mint runs 24 hours a day printing money 
theres plenty of it for all of us 
in his long career young has been brash and irreverent with a 
turbulent private life rivaling that of rock n roll pioneer jerry 
lee lewis hes been arrested on charges including driving while 
intoxicated indecent exposure assault and reckless driving 
his more madcap song titles that fed his image as a windhimup 
irrepressible partylover include live fast love hard die 
young and ive got five dollars and its saturday night 
he once said the secret of his success was drinking expensive 
whiskey 
i dont drink like i used to just twothree drinks a day he 
said recently now if i just behave myself 
just as presley was coming on the national scene in the mid50s 
young was the star of a music tour that included presley as one of 
the lesser known talents 
he wasnt making but 100 a day so when i checked into the 
motel id give him the high sign and hed come stay in my room with 
me young recalled he really couldnt afford it 
years later presley called him and offered to take him on tour 
at double youngs normal booking fee 
i asked why and he said because you helped me one time so 
then i opened his shows 
young a native of shreveport la was the first singer to have 
a hit with sweet dreams a song closely associated with the late 
country queen patsy cline who recorded the song as did emmylou 
harris 
people say to me boy you really sing that patsy cline song 
good young said it was a wellwritten tearjerking country 
song and the melody was outstanding 
similarly straits recent record if you aint lovin you 
aint livin was a hit by young 30 years ago 
besides being a country music trailblazer young has helped some 
of the biggest stars in music get started he loaned willie nelson 
1500 when nelson was a struggling littleknown songwriter he 
loaned roger miller the money to buy drums he made charley pride a 
part of his concert entourage when blacks were not welcome in 
country music he hired a young carpenter named kris kristofferson 
to panel his office walls 
young thought about leaving the road in 1985 but a divorce 
settlement required him to pay his wife of 30 years 3400 a month 
in alimony 
young known as the singing sheriff because of a role in the 
western movie hidden gun has no regrets 
i came off a dairy farm and came into this industry and this 
industry has been good to me ill never forget where i came from 
and the people who helped me make it he said 
i couldnt have done anymore than ive done really ive made 
motion pictures had hit records done tv if i did it over i 
wouldnt change a thing ive been good to everybody ive got a big 
mouth and i say what i think but im the first guy to apologize

in the 1960s and 70s jack lemmon was an ace at portraying the 
american male struggling maniacally under the pressures of modern 
society james woods seems to have inherited lemmons mantle while 
he lacks lemmons leavening humor woods packs greater intensity 
into his characterizations of tormented souls of the 80s 
in the boost he tries to cope with life in the fast lane and 
fails what defeats him are booze cocaine uppers and downers as 
well as his own foolhardiness and misguided pride 
woods is a smalltime hustler barely earning a living in the new 
york financial world his wife sensitively played by sean young 
works as a paralegal to help support their modest lifestyle and she 
pumps his sometimes flagging spirit with jolts of confidence 
applying for a corporate job he nearly blows the chance with his 
radical ideas but executive steven hill is impressed and he brings 
the young man to los angeles to sell tax shelters woods is a whiz 
and soon he acquires the trappings and habits of the fast set in los 
angeles meaning homes with views and pools fast cars and cocaine 
when the government clamps down on tax shelters woods bubble 
bursts to pay his debts and cocaine bills he steals 20000 from 
his boss the rest is all downhill husband and wife together they 
try to go straight hiding out in santa cruz but woods returns to 
his old habits and the downward slide continues 
daryl ponicsans wellcrafted script certainly underscores the 
folly of drug addiction and harold beckers direction spares none 
of the sordid details it is a grim tale but not totally convincing 
questions is cocaine still the casual hollywood party recreation 
as depicted in the boost if young loved her husband so much 
why didnt she fight harder to save him why did it take so long for 
woods to achieve success in business 
woods fascinates throughout you watch him like an undetonated 
bomb sean young gene hackmans mistressvictim in no way out 
is impressive once more in a role with less definition steven hill 
manages to add substance to every film in which he appears 
the boost is a hemdale release produced by daniel h blatt 
with mel howard as coproducer the rating is r for repeated drug use 
and language running time 95 minutes

its too bad because the original had some heat to it sex

happening this guy slams the movie but i bet its going to get 
plenty steamy with miss de mornay taking her clothes off and stuff

no such luck pilgrim get over it vadim without an idea in his 
head has tackled a vaguely feminist message and been trampled to 
death by it no wonder jane fonda divorced him there is no

symphony no 6 overtures egmont and coriolanus by 
ludwig van beethoven loiseaulyre the academy of ancient music 
conducted by christopher hogwood 
 
christopher hogwoods original instrumentalists provide a 
thoroughly fresh look at a programmatic favorite beethovens 
pastoral symphony this is not a performance out of the academy but 
a bright brisk and pungent reading 
the musicians play original instruments or accurate 
reproductions as the linear notes nicely point out in a welcome 
list of personnel the familiar lyrical themes of hill and dale and 
storm and stream are heard anew the strings have a vivid bite and 
the winds provide a beautiful variety of tones loud chords are 
punched out violin trills shimmer 
hogwood conducts with a beautiful attention to detail and takes 
generally brisk tempos one wished for a greater sense of sweep 
however and less abrupt transitions between passages 
if youre looking for sheer sonic beauty this orchestra does not 
have the rich sound of a berlin philharmonic pastoral symphony the 
violins in the first movement on occasion blared in loud passages 
and the valveless horns in the third movement sounded blatty in loud 
chords but if nothing else this recording is plain interesting 
it could also help make a case for how original instruments 
clarify musical figures the storm rumblings of the celli and basses 
in the fourth movement sounded more ominous because the bowing was 
more incisive and therefore easier to hear sixteenth note trills in 
the last movement were extremely accurate the instruments had less 
decay reducing overlap between chords 
hogwood rounds out this fine compact disk with rhythmically 
propelled renditions of the coriolanus and egmont overtures

american dream atlantic crosby stills nash and young 
 
rock reunions are usually depressing reminders of the ravaging 
effects of age david crosby stephen stills graham nash and neil 
young are the latest to prove that most memories should stay 
memories 
american dream their first album together in 18 years is a 
disaster of fairly epic proportions its boring enough to make one 
forget the joyful sounds produced when these four voices meshed two 
decades ago 
the harmonies appear sporadically throughout american dream 
but they dress up a startling lack of worthwhile material 
the inner jacket photo shows young sitting down in the studio 
looking cranky as his three colleagues share a microphone even on a 
bad day hes the most interesting of these four songwriters but the 
picture betrays a strange detachment from this project 
youngs material highlights his lighter more reflective side 
except for the title cut which explores the world of television 
evangelists thats easily the most overdone song topic of 1988 
but at least hes in this decade topics tackled by some of the 
others include the vietnam war and the environment as well as the 
old standby of loving the one youre with 
nash is insufferable when he isnt being preachy hes 
subjecting us to tedious overwrought ballads stills is to be 
commended for the pretty that girl the only worthwhile cut 
among this records 14 
crosbys longawaited compass about the drug addiction that 
landed him in jail is simply excruciating check out this line i 
have seized deaths door handle like a fish out of the water 
waiting for the mercy of the cat huh 
maybe with advancing age and declining careers these guys needed 
the money dont give them yours

the play torch song trilogy began its 
awardwinning history 10 years ago and only now is reaching movie 
screens why did it take so long 
the best explanation comes from harvey fierstein who won two 
tony awards in 1982 for writing and starring in the play i wanted 
to wait until it could be done right it took finding the right 
producer which i did about five years ago since howard gottfried 
had done paddy chayefsky films like hospital and network i felt 
that if chayefksy could work with him so could i 
then my brother ronald who is executive producer of the film 
and i went around to the studios looking for financial support that 
would give us artistic control then we found new line cinema which 
agreed to give us that control 
three more years passed before fierstein found the director he 
wanted a director that had the humor as well as the drama and the 
sensitivity for the story a lot of directors were very frightened 
of maletomale intimacy and they felt you either had a drama or a 
comedy and you dont have big laughs in the middle of a scene where 
the audience is also crying 
during his quest he discovered that the major studios did not 
have much interest even though torch song trilogy has been an 
international stage success 
they liked the play but they were afraid of the length it ran 
four hours in the theater fierstein said they were scared that 
it might become an art film thats not what i wanted to make i 
wanted to make a movie movie 
with its unabashed treatment of gay lives torch song trilogy 
created a sensation from its birth at new yorks la mama etc in 
1978 fierstein took the leading role of arnold beckoff a 
homosexual seeking respect from the heterosexual world including 
his mother 
spurned by his bisexual lover brian kerwin arnold enters into 
a relationship with a young model matthew broderick they marry 
and decide to adopt a troubled gay teenager eddie castrodad a 
role broderick originated on broadway all hell breaks loose when 
arnolds mother anne bancroft arrives from florida 
the play dealt with arnolds promiscuity but how could that be 
treated in the era of aids 
obviously aids is something i thought about especially since 
my costar for three years had aids and we lost five cast members of 
torch song through aids 
i didnt want to pay short shrift to aids just shove it off 
but torch song has nothing to do with aids i also wanted to make 
sure that some of the issues in the movie didnt get clouded i 
wanted the mother to deal with her real feelings about her son and 
the issue of his homosexuality without a virus clouding it 
fierstein was only 24 when he started his career with torch 
song trilogy some aspects of the play are autobiographical he 
was performing drag at 16 when he weighed almost 250 pounds he is 
now 170 at his parents insistence he went to brooklyns pratt 
institute but he quickly returned to the theater after graduating 
torch song emerged from oneact plays that eventually reached 
five hours the play almost folded offbroadway until a new york 
times review saved it fierstein followed his two tonys with another 
for the book of la cage aux folles he also wrote safe sex 
vignettes about aids as well as the book for peter allens new 
musical legs diamond 
how closely does arnold beckoff follow the life of harvey 
fierstein 
theres no such thing as fiction he said there is some me 
in arnold and arnold in me there is a little bit of me in all the 
characters it all gets mixed up you steal from all your 
friends you go into your friends lives and you pull out what you 
can use 
but fierstein does not parallel beckoff in one respect 
opposition of his family 
my family has always known about me he said i came out at 
13 i must be close to my brother hes executive producer on this 
film my mother and i are very close we dont have the problem that 
arnold has with his mother 
we discuss everything in fact she just called from florida 
and what did she want she wanted to know what to get my boyfriend 
for christmas

the son of heaven exhibition of chinese art 
was a major cultural success for seattle and will now be seen by art 
lovers in columbus ohio the only other stop for the historic 
display in the united states 
the exhibition one of the largest displays of chinese art and 
artifacts to be seen in this country includes more than 225 items 
associated with the kings and emperors of china 
the displays include 2500yearold ceremonial cooking vessels 
and temple bells fullsize terracotta warriors and horses from the 
tomb of chinas first emperor delicate scroll paintings from the 
15th century and an exquisitely carved and lacquered 18th century 
throne and accessories 
the show a collaboration of the chinese government and a us 
organizing committee opened in seattle on july 28 and closed jan 
8 it begins a sixmonth run in columbus on march 1 
about 500000 people attended the exhibit at the seattle center 
and exhibition president larry childs estimated the show made more 
than 400000 above its 5 million in expenses 
before the show opened organizers had forecast attendance at 1 
million childs and others say that was far too optimistic 
even though we had that ghastly 1 million number we really 
feel good about what weve been able to accomplish said claudia 
johnson the shows marketing director 
the exhibition frequently has been compared to the treasures of 
tutankhamun which drew 13 million to the same exhibit hall here 
10 years ago but johnson notes tut had been to four other 
american cities as part of a fouryear us tour before coming to 
seattle with a tremendous buildup of publicity 
the seattle run hasnt been entirely smooth childs and other 
show officials acknowledged some disorganization before the 
exhibitions start including not having a marketing budget set 
until two weeks before the opening in august there was a messy 
firing and replacement of the shows executive director harvey 
west at the time west said he had disagreed with childs over some 
aspects of the shows operation and childs said west had trouble 
delegating authority 
later there was a flap over waiving admission charges during the 
seattle centers free labor day weekend arts festival bumbershoot 
son of heaven officials eventually agreed to the free admission 
there also were numerous small changes in lighting and other 
presentations of the exhibits and in hours of the show 
childs said many of the changes were the type any show goes 
through when opening the ohio exhibition he said will benefit 
from what was learned during the seattle run 
for example he said advertising began in november with special 
efforts to target nearby cities senior citizens groups and 
students more emphasis will be placed on the gift shop which 
turned out to be a strong moneymaker and on sales of tshirts 
hats books and other son of heaven merchandise in department 
stores 
because of the exhibitions size and the cost of staging it 
seattle and columbus have been the only cities to sign up as hosts 
but childs says hes received a number of inquiries including ones 
from denver baltimore toronto and floridas epcot center 
no negotiations are under way for further sites he said adding 
that the chinese havent decided whether they want their treasures 
to remain longer in this country 
costs for the columbus exhibit have been estimated at 635 
million including remodeling central high school where the show 
will be held the columbus museum of art will produce and manage the 
exhibition 
proceeds from that show will go to the son of heaven 
foundation a nonprofit organization while proceeds from the 
seattle exhibition will be shared by two charities the resource 
center for the handicapped and vesper society group 
childs estimated the two seattle charities will split 1 million 
once the profits are divvied up at the end of the columbus run 
its going to depend on how the show does in ohio he said 
if nobody shows up in ohio its going to be kind of interesting

marriage fatherhood and his work with live aid 
have changed midge ure the evidence is in his latest album 
answers to nothing 
the last few years have changed my life said scottishborn 
ure 35 i think about more serious things now being a father 
im more concerned about the world my daughter will grow up in so 
that comes out in the songs i write songs on the album include 
take me home sister and brother and his latest single 
dear god 
the new material is spare lowkey and focused around his guitar 
a radical departure from the synthesized orchestration of 
ultravox his former group 
dear god was inspired by a pop magazine that asked him to 
list his christmas wish the song asks god for love for the 
lonely food for the hungry and peace in a restless world 
the lyrics sum up ures status as one of the outstanding pop 
artists who have put rock in the service of good causes the band 
aid hit single do they know its christmas the live aid concert 
extravaganza for african famine relief and most recently the london 
birthday rockfest for south africas jailed black leader nelson 
mandela 
ure got into charity work with the princes trust prince 
charles organization which helps young unemployed people but he is 
best remembered for his work with bob geldof raising funds for 
ethiopian famine victims 
he thought we should write a christmas record but we were only 
a month away from christmas at the time ure said in an interview 
at his london record company office 
the result was do they know its christmas geldof wrote the 
lyrics and organized the performers while ure wrote the music the 
1984 record and the july 1985 live aid concert in london and 
philadelphia raised more than 110 million 
however since this summers mandela concert he has devoted 
himself to family life with his wife annabel and their 
18monthold daughter molly 
there are a lot of great causes but i dont think a concert is 
always the answer ure said people begin to think youre doing 
it for the attention you cant expect the music industry to keep 
doing it and the public gets tired of it as well 
following live aid ultravox released its final album i 
realized at that time that my heart just wasnt in the band ure 
said to make a band work you have to compromise i didnt want 
to become a dictator and tell everyone what to do so i just bowed 
out then everyone else decided not to carry on 
the new album he insists is more true to himself 
a lot of ultravoxs vast pomposity wasnt me all that 
overblown synthesizer stuff and massive orchestration im a 
guitarist so this is more what i want 
with a wife and child to support hes more aware of having to 
make a living from music 
it would be nice to have the sort of ideals where you dont 
care if you sell records but the unfortunate truth is if you dont 
sell any your record company drops you and you dont get to make 
any more records he said 
theres a fine line between commercial success and musical 
success ive been fortunate in that ive never had to compromise 
one for the other im artistically fulfilled and people still seem 
to want to buy my records 
while ure said he missed the camaraderie of a group working 
alone allows him to keep his own schedule i couldnt keep a 
schedule like i used to working from midday to midnight i like to 
spend time with my daughter now 
the one love song on the lp just for you is about his 
daughter 
being a father is fantastic ure said getting your hands 
dirty changing nappies diapers and all it brings you right 
back down to earth with a bang 
ure agreed that his experiences over the last few years have made 
his latest album more mature i followed my own ideas to their 
ultimate conclusions in the songs they are more mature because my 
worries are different than they used to be i think i must be going 
through male menopause im only 35 but i feel like im 60

when george bush labeled campaign rival michael 
dukakis a cardcarrying member of the american civil liberties 
union frightening memories flooded back to howard fast 
in the 1950s sen joseph mccarthy achieved notoriety for his 
purges of suspected communists brandishing a piece of paper in his 
hand and charging that he had a list of cardcarrying members of 
the communist party 
fast was one of those members he confronted mccarthy at a 
hearing of the house committee on unamerican activities huac and 
went to jail in 1950 for refusing to submit names of alleged 
subversives thirtyeight years later fast has reconstructed 
that time in a novel the pledge houghtonmifflin 1895 
bushs campaign had something of the same feeling that 
cardcarrying aclu device was worked out very precisely said 
fast author of the dinner party citizen tom paine and 
other works 
pledge is based on a part of my life that was a great time of 
fear in the united states and this generation should learn that 
this happened none of them know he said in an interview 
the pledge begins in postworld war ii india and centers on a 
war correspondent bruce bacon who has reason to believe that the 
british government played a role in the famine then sweeping 
calcutta his actions come to the attention of the british and us 
governments and he is ultimately forced to leave the country 
back home bacon resumes his job as a prized newspaper reporter 
for the new york tribune but his world becomes unraveled

working americans ages 25 to 49 say they would 
like the nation to return to a simpler way of life but their own 
concern with material success has not declined a survey released 
today shows 
the telephone survey of 1001 people who work fulltime outside 
the home was commissioned by joseph e seagram amp sons inc on behalf 
of its chivas regal brand of liquor 
seventyfive percent of the respondents said they would like to 
see our country return to a simpler lifestyle with less emphasis on 
material success only 17 percent disagreed 
but in another question only 16 percent said they themselves 
were less concerned with material success than they were five years 
ago thirty percent said they were more concerned while 53 percent 
said there was no change in their attitude 
theres got to be some nostalgia going there said frank 
walton president of research amp forecasts inc the new yorkbased 
firm that prepared the survey explaining the seeming contradiction 
in the answers 
people think i wish things were simpler but if that means 
less material rewards in my life im not so sure walton said 
all but 31 percent of the respondents said they had been involved 
in some kind of public service work over the past five years 
thirtyfour percent claimed they donated 10 percent or more of their 
income to charity in the previous year 
walton said it is likely that some people exaggerated how 
charitable they were but he said it nevertheless appeared from the 
survey that americans are somewhat more publicspirited than in 
1978 when a lou harris poll found that 49 percent of americans did 
not claim involvement in community volunteer work 
more than a third of the respondents said they thought they would 
spend more time on public service in the next few years while only 
about a tenth thought they would spend less time 
clearly theres a reservoir of good intentions that hasnt 
been tapped walton said 
the survey was conducted in midoctober the margin of error on 
most questions was about 3 percent

japan expects to export 22 million cars to the 
united states in the fiscal year ending in march 100000 cars below 
a selfimposed annual quota and the government tuesday said it 
would continue the restraint 
if we removed the quota we are concerned japanese companies 
would push for more us sales and aggravate trade tensions with the 
united states said hiroshi mitsuzuka the minister of international 
trade and industry 
japans trade surplus with the united states in 1987 was 598 
billion the largest chunk of the 1712 billion us trade deficit 
mitsuzuka in a news conference was asked about complaints from 
some us lawmakers that japanese cars built in the united states 
should also be counted as us imports he replied that by 1991 the 
local content of usmade japanese cars would be 75 percent and 
we regard them as americanmade cars 
japanese automakers produced 733000 cars in the united states 
from january to november up 232 percent from the same period in 
1987 according to the foreign ministry 
news reports said the trade ministry had been expected to lift 
the export quota last year but sentiment was reversed because of 
concern over giving the wrong impression at a time of rising 
protectionist sentiment in the united states 
some japanese automakers feel the quota is outdated on economic 
grounds since 1985 the yen has doubled in value against the 
dollar wiping out the price advantage japanese cars had 
in fiscal 1987 which ended last march 221 million cars were 
exported to the united states and mitsuzuka said shipments in the 
aprilnovember period were 104 percent below a year earlier 
nevertheless he predicted sales of 22 million for this fiscal year 
also 
the united states has taken a neutral position on renewing the 
quota a us diplomatic source in tokyo said on condition of 
anonymity 
the quota began in 1981 when japan was under strong pressure 
from the us government and american automakers to cut the japanese 
inroads in the us auto market japan agreed to limit its annual 
exports to the united states to 168 million vehicles through 1983 
then to 185 million in 1984 
when president reagan decided not to ask for continued restraints 
in 1985 japan set the ceiling at 23 million and has kept that 
figure 
now the japanese led by honda which has the most sales in the 
united states are trying to penetrate the us luxury car market 
toyota and nissan the japanese big two carmakers both are 
introducing cars costing 20000 to 40000 in an attempt to lure 
americans away from jaguar mercedes and bmw models 
yutaka kume president of nissan said that while free trade is 
desirable and the quota had lost its original significance the 
matter still has to be studied in the frame of usjapan 
relations as a whole we believe the government made its 
conclusion taking this into consideration 
japan imported 133583 cars in 1988 the japan automobile 
importers association said tuesday west germanys bavarian motor 
works volkswagen and mercedesbenz were the most popular carmakers

the democratic chairmen of congress 
budgetwriting committees said today that president reagans 
farewell 115 trillion spending plan is a dead letter and that 
presidentelect bush must submit a substitute reflecting his more 
moderate policies 
this reagan budget is a continuation of what weve seen for the 
past eight years increased spending in defense cuts in domestic 
spending and a lot of red ink and george bush needs to reverse that 
trend said sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate 
budget committee 
joining sasser on nbctvs today show house budget 
committee chairman leon panetta dcalif added these kind of 
budgets have been overwhelmingly rejected by republicans and 
democrats on capitol hill 
so if bush wants a budget that no only goes someplace on 
capitol hill but also reflects some new priorities for this country 
then hes got to change the budget that was presented yesterday 
sasser said bush must cut defense spending in favor of restoring 
funds for domestic programs that were slashed under reagan 
the presidents fiscal 1990 budget submitted just 11 days before 
he retires would produce a deficit of 925 billion within the 
100 billion target mandated by the grammrudman deficitreduction 
law 
if achieved that figure would be a dramatic decrease from the 
worst of the reagan era shortfalls but drastically higher than the 
red ink run up by any previous president 
besides challenging the spending blueprints priorities the 
democrats criticized what they called its unrealistically optimistic 
economic assumptions 
even congressional republicans conceded monday that reagans 
submission is little more than a starting point for bushs budget 
efforts 
this is obviously ronald reagans book said sen pete 
domenici of new mexico the ranking republican on the senate budget 
committee george bush and the congress will write the final 
chapter 
as if to symbolize the reagan plans lack of significance 
domenici was in albuquerque nm and his house counterpart rep 
bill frenzel rminn was in europe 
bush who takes office jan 20 is not required to submit a 
spending plan of his own but his aides have indicated he will 
propose revisions to reagans plan after his inauguration and the 
presidentelect distanced himself slightly from it monday saying he 
agrees with its intent 
congressional democrats are eager for bush to submit a detailed 
proposal of his own because they are skeptical he can do everything 
he has promised reduce the deficit without raising taxes while 
still diverting federal resources to child care education 
environmental cleanups and other priorities he proclaimed during his 
presidential campaign 
reagans budget would collect 1059 trillion in revenues and 
spend 1152 trillion leaving a 925 billion imbalance that would 
be the lowest deficit since the 737 billion shortfall of fiscal 
1981 which was under way when reagan took office 
but democrats say reagans budget plan masks the true amount of 
red ink by overestimating the economys likely strength next year 
adding more revenue on paper but with no guarantee the money will 
actually be there 
the federal deficit reached its alltime high of 221 billion in 
1986 under reagan the total federal debt has so far soared to 26 
trillion almost triple the 914 billion the government owed before 
he took office the government will have to spend 170 billion this 
year just to pay interest on that debt 
the administration says it expects the current years imbalance 
to total 161 billion 
reagan would boost military outlays in the next fiscal year by 5 
billion to 303 billion his proposed pentagon spending authority of 
3152 billion which includes some outlays for years beyond 1990 
reflects an increase of 2 percent more than inflation over this 
years levels 
the increases would include boosting spending on the star wars 
missile defense system from 405 billion to 59 billion setting 
aside 946 million for a seabased antisatellite system and 
starting production of the b2 stealth bomber 
the president would devote 3 billion to clean and modernize the 
nations nuclear weapons plants a task the government has estimated 
could cost 128 billion over two decades 
he would earmark 16 billion this year and 9 billion next year 
to help the countrys failing savings and loan institutions a job 
that could ultimately cost 100 billion or more 
reagan also called for a 160 million increase to 14 billion 
for aids research adding 18 billion to the current 99 billion 
space agency budget and beefing up the governments 44 billion 
antidrug efforts to 5 billion spending on aviation including 
hiring additional air traffic controllers would grow from 57 
billion to 66 billion 
to pay for this generosity many domestic programs would be 
slashed he proposed killing 82 federal programs many of which 
congress has refused to eliminate in the past such as mass transit 
assistance aid to the amtrak commuter rail service and subsidies 
to the postal service overall 49 billion would be saved next 
year 
he would also reduce the growth of medicare spending for the 
elderly and disabled by 32 billion and cut projected increases in 
medicaid for the poor by 17 billion mostly by restricting 
payments to doctors and hospitals in recent years health care 
costs have grown much faster than inflation in general 
more savings would come from reducing agriculture spending by 
97 billion to 424 billion mostly in cuts in price supports to 
farmers and in child nutrition programs 
there would be no costofliving increases next year for retired 
federal workers but social security would not be touched 
the government would raise 6 billion from selling various 
federal assets and pocket another 1 billion by raising various 
fees such as charging 25 annually for boat owners who use waters 
patrolled by the coast guard and boosting charges paid by veterans 
getting home loan guarantees by 1 percent 
unless congress votes to block it one part of reagans budget 
would grant a 50 percent pay raise to the cabinet members of 
congress judges and the federal governments top managers another 
proposal which requires congressional approval would grant a 2 
percent pay increase to rankandfile federal workers and 36 
percent to the military

the government proposed tuesday to 
dismantle its foreign currency regulations to fully expose the 
swedish market to foreign competition 
the proposal in the 19891990 budget presented to parliament by 
finance minister kjellolof feldt was expected to open swedish 
banks to foreign competition 
the proposed budget of about 605 billion which also included a 
controversial spending cut for schools was the first with a budget 
surplus since 1962 
the deregulation will remove the final barriers for the movement 
of foreign currency which the government has been gradually 
relaxing for several years and bring sweden into line with europes 
plan to eliminate currency restrictions by 1992 
but transactions would be monitored through a foreign exchange 
bank to prevent tax evasion by investing in foreign markets 
according to the budget proposal 
under current restrictions swedes cannot hold foreign real 
estate worth more than 136000 or acquire other foreign holdings 
worth more than 40000 without special government permission 
feldt told a news conference he hoped the move to end those 
restrictions would lead to higher efficiency in the swedish economy 
in which the public sector accounts for about 60 percent of the 
gross national product 
in the long term it is deeply worrying that swedens economic 
growth is not higher despite the fact that the economy is running 
full and there is a lack of labor feldt said 
the growth rate in other western nations has been about 4 percent 
in the past five years but it has been running between 25 percent 
to 3 percent in sweden he said feldt predicted 17 percent growth 
next year 
it was not clear when the deregulation would take place feldt 
said he would propose a specific deregulation bill after the 
parliament adopts the budget bill

your chewing gum might not lose its flavor on the 
bedpost overnight now that californiastyle high tech has joined 
forces with the worlds largest gum producer 
the chicagobased william wrigley jr co announced it will work 
with advanced polymer systems inc of redwood city calif on a 
project to develop a chewing gum that keeps its flavor for longer 
william piet a wrigley vice president said monday that the key 
is a new technology that enables timed release of flavor oils 
the technology patented by advanced polymer systems uses 
microscopic sponges he said the companies said the microsponge 
systems could also be used to extend the life of food flavorings and 
food preservatives 
by using these sponges instead of gum releasing all the flavor 
at once it will hold onto the flavor and release it in a sustained 
manner said sergio nacht advanced polymers vice president of 
research and development 
it flavor will have to last significantly longer than it does 
now for people to perceive the difference he said 
piet said approval from the food and drug administration would be 
needed before gum using the sponges could be sold he said he did 
not know how long it would take to develop the product and get 
approval 
nacht predicted it could take 18 to 36 months before the new gum 
hits store shelves 
advanced polymer uses its sponge technology in aftershave lotion 
and in various womens cosmetics nacht said 
the process has also been used in topical drugs such as 
ointments for sore muscles he said 
they hold a patented process thats a good one piet said 
were confident this is a technology that can be applied to food 
products thats why we entered into this agreement 
in food the new technology would incorporate millions of 
microscopic nontoxic sponges and the little containers would 
release the flavor when the food is chewed 
under the gum agreement advanced polymer will receive a small 
royalty from the sale of wrigley products that are made with the 
microsponge system he said 
wrigley will get a small percentage of the revenue advanced 
polymer gets in other food applications of the technology piet said 
advanced polymer developed the microsponge technology in the 
early 1980s

from atop his mammoth crane jan de 
jong lifts a 25ton container from a freighter with a fiddle of his 
joystick punches a code on a computer screen and delivers the cargo 
to a railway car 200 yards away 
its quite a change compared with 20 years ago the 
49yearold de jong mused getting 25 tons of cargo from the hold 
would take us all day now its just a matter of minutes 
the change in de jongs workday routine reflects the 1980s 
transformation of rotterdam the worlds biggest and busiest port 
from a laborintensive harbor operation into a digitalized logistics 
center where fewer people handle ever more cargo 
city officials say the change has begun just in time to fend off 
the rival ports of antwerp hamburg and le havre all are preparing 
for the cutthroat competition expected throughout western europe 
after national trade barriers are removed as part of the 1992 market 
integration of the 12nation european economic community 
the dutch governments plan is to make the netherlands the main 
trading center and transit point for goods entering and leaving 
northwest europe it has begun a large program of subsidies and tax 
breaks to attract european headquarters and distribution operations 
of multinational companies 
the dutch scored a major success earlier this month when the 
japanese automaking giant nissan announced plans to locate its 
european headquarters in the netherlands 
the city of rotterdam plans to invest about 500 million by 1992 
to upgrade the 5306acre ports traffic radar and 
telecommunications network as well as build new container terminals 
and additional railway yards leading to the ports 25 miles of docks 
we need to put ourselves on the map again as a sophisticated 
link in the transport chain especially in our main market areas 
latin america the united states and the far east rotterdam 
mayor bram peper told the associated press 
in the 1970s complacency set in the prevailing opinion was 
that we were the biggest and the best a godgiven fact that wasnt 
believed subject to any change said the mayor in an interview 
paradoxically that period of smugness coincided with the 
worldwide economic slump that followed 1973s sharp rise in oil 
prices 
because of its huge volume of operations rotterdam where the 
rhine and maas rivers flow into the north sea suffered less from 
that recession than other european ports 
but another recession in the early 1980s brought a western 
european industrial retrenchment and radical changes in transport 
needs that brought rotterdams traditional bulk handling operation 
to the verge of obsolescence 
there is a marked shift in the economic activity of western 
europe a shift not only in what is being produced but also in 
where it is being manufactured said ron van harten of rotterdams 
municipal port authority 
from 1945 until the mid1970s rotterdams biggest single 
customer was west germanys ruhr area where steel mills and huge 
chemical plants consumed vast quantities of iron ore coal and 
petroleum shipped through rotterdam 
but west germanys economic center of gravity has been drifting 
southward toward bavarias new computer and component factories

the arabian american oil co said 
tuesday that saudi arabias estimated oil reserves are more than 50 
percent higher than previously estimated 
aramco said that a new study estimates saudi arabias recoverable 
crude oil reserves at 25238 billion barrels thats about 
onefourth of the worlds total known reserves and significantly 
higher than the 1715 billion barrels previously estimated 
aramco based in the capital of saudi arabias oilproducing 
eastern province also estimated saudi gas reserves at 177294 
trillion cubic feet up from approximately 14180 trillion estimated 
a year ago 
the aramco report distributed by the official saudi press 
agency said that untapped reserves could raise the estimates to 315 
billion barrels of oil and 253 trillion cubic feet of gas 
by comparison the united states has estimated oil reserves of 27 
billion barrels and the soviet union the worlds largest oil 
producer some 63 billion barrels 
the new estimates followed six years of intensive study by a 
computerized engineering center in dhahran manned by the worlds 
largest grouping of oil experts and engineers with the most 
sophisticated equipment available aramco said 
saudi arabia and neighboring gulf countries sit on twothirds of 
the worlds oil proven reserves saudi arabia is the largest 
producer in the organization of petroleum exporting countries and 
the worlds largest oil exporter 
other members of opec also recently have increased their 
government estimates of proven reserves in what some analysts say is 
part of an ongoing power struggle within the cartel 
iraq kuwait and the united arab emirates all opec countries 
each have reported estimated reserves of around 100 billion barrels 
the amount of reserves a country has are believed to be one factor 
used by opec to establish production quotas 
the arabiclanguage report did not use the word proven for 
the latest estimate but it was implied through the comparison with 
the untapped resources proven oil reserves are those that can be 
produced at current prices with current technology 
king fahd who is currently visiting the eastern province last 
week chaired a cabinet meeting that ratified saudi arabias 1989 
budget which showed a deficit for the sixth straight year because of 
weak oil prices 
the kingdom drew on its reserves to cover the earlier deficits 
but the dwindling coffers forced it to resort to public borrowing 
through treasury bonds of 8 billion last year and 67 billion this 
year

cooke cablevision inc and the new york times co 
have agreed to sell their cable television systems in separate 
transactions valued at around 2 billion 
the new york times co said monday it is selling its system in 
southern new jersey for 420 million to a venture that will be 
managed by a minority investment group 
investor jack kent cooke who controls cooke cablevision 
declined to reveal the sales price of his cable systems but the 
wall street journal quoted sources in the purchasing group as 
putting it at 2100 to 2200 per subscriber or about 15 billion 
the purchasers of cooke cablevision are seven cable companies led 
by intermedia partners of san francisco and telecommunications inc 
of denver cookes 700000 properties are scattered over 19 states 
including arizona tennessee georgia south carolina and alaska 
the separation of the properties held down the price fetched per 
subscriber 
the price in the new york times deal amounts to nearly 2600 per 
subscriber which industry analysts said made it one of the more 
expensive recent cable system sales 
because the sale was to a minoritymanaged venture the deal 
announced monday may also qualify for tax advantages that would 
boost its effective value to the times 
parties to the transaction also said it would be the nations 
biggest cable television system with sizeable minority ownership 
j bruce llewellyn who heads a softdrink bottling concern in 
philadelphia and is one of the nations top black business 
executives will head the minority group being assembled that will 
manage and have at least 20 percent interest in the new cable 
venture 
the other investors which will split evenly the remaining 
ownership in the venture are a pair of cable tv companies based in 
the philadelphia area comcast corp the nations fourthlargest 
cable operator and lenfest communications inc 
the system being sold is nyt cable tv of cherry hill nj which 
serves 162000 subscribers in 59 communities in southern new jersey 
a suburban area that analysts said should prove attractive to 
advertisers 
the times had put the cable system up for sale in late october 
saying it wanted to concentrate on its core businesses that include 
newspapers magazines broadcasting and forest products it bought 
the system in 1981 when it had about 72000 subscribers 
david gorham chief financial oficer for new york times co said 
that as a result of the minority groups involvement in the 
purchase the times requested that the federal communications 
commission grant a tax certificate in connection with the sale that 
will entitle the times to defer payment of about 138 million in 
taxes on the transaction 
the taxdeferral provision was created by congress in 1978 to 
encourage minority ownership of communications companies the 
minority group must be the managing partner in order for the deal to 
qualify 
gorham declined to estimate how much the deferral would mean to 
the times but others familiar with the negotiations said the times 
had put a value of 55 million on it which would boost the value of 
the deal to the times above 2900 per subscriber 
gorham said the times expects to record an aftertax gain of 
about 183 million or 234 per share on the sale the deal is 
expected to close in the second quarter after various federal 
regulators complete their review of it 
paula greer who works for the media research firm paul kagan 
associates inc in carmel calif said the pricepersubscriber 
that the times stands to receive would put it among the top 10 cable 
deals of the past year which included a handful of sales valued at 
more than 3000 per subscriber 
llewellyn has not finished lining up the minority investors who 
will join his group and until he does the percentage of the company 
that his group controls will not be decided according to julian 
brodsky vice chairman of comcast 
llewellyn who could not be reached for comment on the deal is 
chairman chief executive and majority stockholder of philadelphia 
cocacola bottling co inc which was listed by black enterprise 
magazine last year as the nations thirdbiggest black business 
he is also chairman and a major stockholder in the cocacola 
bottling co of wilmington delaware inc and of queen city 
broadcasting inc which owns and operates wkbwtv the abc 
affiliate in buffalo ny 
he lives in englewood cliffs nj a new york suburb 
intermedia a media investment partnership put together by former 
chronicle publishing co chief financial officer leo j hindery jr 
said it will purchase cooke systems serving about 215000 
subscribers in partnership with san francisco media executive frank 
washington 
telecommunications will acquire systems serving about 200000 
subscribers and tca cable tv inc based in tyler texas will get 
about 90000 subscribers the balance of the cooke systems will be 
divided between chambers communications corp of eugene ore 
falcon cable tv based in los angeles hawke cable a joint venture

a unanimous supreme court today upheld a 5 
percent tax that illinois imposes on all telephone calls charged to 
instate numbers 
the court in an opinion by justice thurgood marshall said the 
tax does not interfere impermissibly with interstate commerce 
the tax at issue has many of the characteristics of a sales 
tax marshall said it is assessed on the individual consumer 
collected by the retailer and accompanies the retail purchase of an 
interstate telephone call 
two illinois residents jerome f goldberg and robert mctigue 
challenged the tax in a classaction lawsuit filed four years ago in 
chicago gte sprint communications corp joined the case later 
seeking to recover taxes already paid 
from sept 15 1985 to july 1986 gte sprint paid 26 million in 
taxes under the challenged illinois telecommunications excise tax 
lawyers for the national conference of state legislatures and 
other governmental groups told the justices that illinois collects 
10 million a month under the disputed phone tax 
the tax is assessed at a flat rate on all calls intrastate and 
interstate charged to illinois service addresses 
writing for the court today marshall acknowledged that some 
interstate telephone calls could be subject to multiple taxation if 
some other state also imposes a tax on them 
this limited possibility is not sufficient to invalidate the 
illinois statutory scheme marshall said to the extent that 
other states telecommunications taxes pose a risk of multiple 
taxation the illinois laws credit provision operates to avoid 
actual multiple taxation 
using a test the supreme court devised in 1977 to judge state 
taxes challenged as unconstitutional marshall said the illinois law 
is fairly apportioned does not discriminate against interstate 
commerce and is fairly related to services which the state of 
illinois provides to the taxpayer 
the vote upholding the law was 90 but justices john paul 
stevens sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia did not join 
marshalls opinion in its entirety the three wrote separate 
concurring opinions 
the case is goldberg vs sweet 87826

a chicago bank that was the goverments biggest 
target of racial and sexual discrimination charges has agreed to pay 
14 million in back pay the largest such settlement ever obtained 
by the federal government the labor department said today 
the settlement also requires the harris trust and savings bank to 
revise its affirmative action policies provide training and other 
assistance to women and minority workers and file periodic reports 
with the government documenting its compliance with 
antidiscrimination laws 
the 14 million in back pay harris trust agreed to pay is the 
largest such settlement ever obtained by the government from a 
single employer it was not immediately clear how many current or 
former bank employees would share the award 
the agreement ends a controversial dispute with the government 
that dates back to 1977 and involved a 1965 presidential order 
requiring federal contractors to refrain from discrimination against 
minorities and women in their hiring promotion and wage policies 
what we have announced here today is a pure business 
decision b kenneth west harris trust chairman and chief 
executive officer said in chicago 
we are not at all pleased at handing over 14 million as a 
matter of principle we would have preferred to end this case with a 
definitive verdict not a negotiated settlement he said 
but by the same token we wouldnt be pleased to fight this to 
the end even if the end were in our favor at what we are 
convinced would be a far greater cost in money and internal stress 
a sidelight to the case was an unsuccessful 1985 effort by 
thenattorney general edwin meese iii and the us chamber of 
commerce to convince president reagan to repeal the executive order 
they argued that requiring affirmative action goals and timetables 
to make amends for institutional bias amounted to reverse 
discrimination 
an administrative law judge in 1981 found that harris trust had 
discriminated against women and minorities and awarded 122 million 
in back pay to plaintiffs in a classaction suit against it but 
thenlabor secretary raymond donovan set aside the decision saying 
the bank had been wrongly denied an opportunity to present 
statistical studies in its defense 
the case was then reheard in 1986 administrative law judge 
nahum litt again ruled that the bank was liable for back pay to 
women and minority employees on its payroll from 1974 until dec 22 
1986 unless it could prove it ceased the discriminatory practices 
before that date 
todays settlement expanded that time period forcing the bank to 
distribute back pay to women and minorities in its employ from may 
1974 through december 1988 
in an additional ruling in the case litt said the awarding of 
back pay should be treated as a class action a decision that meant 
each alleged victim would not have to prove he or she was 
individually subjected to discrimination 
george salem the labor departments solicitor speculated last 
march that the backpay award might exceed 20 million but at the 
same time he confirmed the department was attempting to negotiate a 
settlement with the bank 
the bank maintained throughout the 11year case that it had not 
discriminated against any of its workers 
the settlement order issued by the labor department today 
requires the bank to immediately cease any existing discriminatory 
policies and to refrain from such practices in the future 
it also requires that harris trust establish programs to assist 
women and minorities in job advancement and develop an affirmative 
action policy that meets government standards 
in addition to being the largest backpay award the federal 
government ever has obtained from a single employer salem said it 
was the largest settlement any government had received under the 
presidential order which was issued in 1965 thenpresident johnson 
this settlement represents a major step forward not only for 
the present and former employees of the harris bank who will benefit 
from it but also for all women and minority group workers in the 
american labor force the labor departments salem said it is a 
major civil rights victory for the federal government 
he said the department will supervise the search for former bank 
employees entitled to share in the settlement

an eastern airlines executive said the company may 
have to speed up planned sales of assets after the chairman of the 
national mediation board halted talks between the carrier and its 
largest union 
clearly the happenings of this last weekend will make us move 
forward faster on some asset sales than perhaps we would have done 
otherwise joseph b leonard easterns senior vice president and 
chief operating officer said monday 
the end of talks is certainly a major disappointment with 
serious implications about easterns future he added 
machinists district 100 president charles e bryan charged the 
company sabotaged the mediation session with news leaks and was 
determined to force a strike he called management actions 
unethical without principle deceptive 
mediation board chairman walter wallace abruptly ended the talks 
monday and returned to washington he said today he stopped the 
sessions because the failure to keep negotiations secret undermined 
the collective bargaining process 
media in a fish bowl yields nothing wallace said in a 
statement issued in washington in such situations the parties 
tend to make proposals and statements aimed at public relations 
objectives rather than the bargaining process he did not lay 
blame on either side 
the board will continue its efforts to bring the parties 
together under proper circumstances where a solution of the labor 
dispute can be achieved he said 
there was no indication of when more talks might be scheduled 
meanwhile monday the internal revenue service gave eastern until 
sept 15 to make 105 million in payments to employee pension plans 
that had been due last sept 15 leonard said the company would 
finance the payments by pending asset sales 
wallace had arrived friday for the talks in key largo aimed at 
ending a 15month contract stalemate that has clouded the future of 
the airline a subsidiary of houstonbased texas air corp which 
also owns nonunion continental airlines 
eastern spokesman robin matell said miami television stations 
discovered the location of the talks and began covering them friday 
matell said employee bulletins about the talks that were put out 
daily by eastern and were obtained by reporters werent a violation 
of the news blackout 
leonard blamed the breakdown on the unions refusal to set a 
deadline for negotiations eastern which says it is losing 1 
million a day has been pressing for a federal declaration of an 
impasse that would begin a 30day coolingoff period after that 
the union could strike and the company could impose its own work 
conditions on the union members 
these talks have dragged on draining easterns strengths 
with each passing day we desperately need the government to provide 
a process to resolve this dispute within 30 days leonard said 
the union has claimed eastern wants to provoke a strike so it can 
try to bust the union the machinists also have opposed attempts to 
sell parts of the airline such as the recently agreed 365 million 
sale of easterns northeast shuttle to businessman donald trump 
saying the sales also are aimed at breaking the union 
the machinists representing 8500 mechanics baggage handlers 
and other ground service workers that make up more than onefourth 
of easterns employees were seeking a raise of 50 million a year 
the airline was seeking 150 million in concessions mainly from 
nonmechanics 
leonard said the machinists were seeking an 8 percent raise 
while eastern had offered a jobsecurity program guaranteeing no 
layoffs and offering job training to enable the nonmechanics to 
gain betterpaying jobs 
bryan said the companys proposals were unchanged while the 
machinists offer totaled only a 19 percent raise over three years 
he said workrule changes offered by the union would save the 
company money overall 
eastern reported 2337 million in losses for the first three 
quarters of 1988

the incoming bush administration gave the 
goahead today for a highlevel advisory panel to begin work in 
earnest on a plan to eliminate the huge federal budget deficit 
leaders of the national economic commission said they had 
received word from treasury secretary nicholas brady that the 
bipartisan panel should plan on meeting a march 1 deadline for 
submitting its report 
commission cochairman drew lewis made the announcement as the 
14member advisory panel began an open hearing on the deficit 
problem 
there had been discussions with top bush officials about whether 
the presidentelect might postpone the commissions report until 
sept 1 todays announcement is an apparent indication that bush 
intends to take the panels recommendations seriously and will give 
them weight in his own negotiations with congress 
the commission was created by congress after the october 1987 
stock market crash with supporters hoping that the panel composed 
of leaders from government business and labor would be able to 
break the sevenyear deadlock over the federal budget deficit 
while bush derided the commission during the presidential 
campaign as a stalking horse for a tax increase his comments since 
winning the election have been more favorable and he has emphasized 
he considers reducing the budget deficit as his no 1 economic 
priority 
bushs two appointees to the commission former sen paul laxalt 
rnev and former rep thomas ashley dohio a longtime friend 
both attended todays meeting 
lewis and commission cochairman robert strauss also met today 
with president reagan at the white house to discuss the panels work 
to date 
lewis a former transportation secretary in reagans cabinet 
said brady told him that the commission should plan on meeting the 
march 1 deadline unless it hears otherwise from bush once he takes 
office jan 20 
while the panel made up equally of republicans and democrats 
has had sharp disagreements over whether taxes need to be raised 
lewis said he felt it would be able to reach agreement on a deficit 
reduction plan by march 1

the us dollars predominance in global financial 
dealings is falling as growing economic interdependence within asia 
and other regions increases reliance on the japanese yen and other 
currencies economists said tuesday 
the yen may not replace the dollar as the international official 
reserve currency but trends point to greater use of the yen and 
west german mark and a commensurate decline in the dollars 
importance david d hale chief economist of kemper financial 
services inc said 
there are very compelling arguments why the yen should become 
an important international reserve asset hale said there is a 
tremendous mismatch between the yens importance and the role it 
plays in the world economy 
contrary to expectations japan has continued to run huge trade 
surpluses in spite of a doubling of the value of its currency in 
dollars since early 1985 on tuesday the yen traded at about 126 to 
the dollar 
japans 3 trillion gross national product in 1988 the 4 
trillion capitalization of the tokyo stock exchange and 
international bank assets estimated by the bank of international 
settlements at 6258 billion compared to us assets of 492 
billion are evidence of the dramatic growth in japans relative 
economic power hale said 
the emergence of asia as a major region of economic growth is one 
reason for the dollars declining importance as a foreign reserve 
currency said economists attending a conference entitled task 
force on pacific rim strategies 
trade within the asian region is growing so quickly that it will 
soon overtake trade across the pacific said takashi hosomi 
chairman of nli research and former finance ministry adviser 
trade volume in east asia totaled 84 billion in 1987 and it is 
growing faster than transpacific trade which totaled 104 
billion hosomi said 
japanese banks are increasingly using the yen in international 
lending their foreign loans in yen are estimated at 13 trillion yen 
104 billion hale said 
japan is the largest lender to a number of asian countries and 
yen loans account for 30 percent of malaysias and indonesias 
foreign debt and 40 percent of thailands he said 
growing investment by japanese firms in factories office 
buildings and other properties in asia is also expanding the yens 
zone of influence 
it would be logical to expect in the 1990s a regional economic 
bloc to emerge around japan hale said 
economists attending the conference predicted that changes in the 
relative importance of the yen and the dollar would be gradual 
i dont think the yen will take the position of the dollar but 
will function to supplement the dollar said yasuo kanzaki 
executive vice president of nikko securities co 
instead a number of currencies may be used 
the staggering growth in the volume of international capital 
flows makes it much more difficult for a single currency to play 
such a significant role as in the past said lawrence summers 
economics professor at harvard university 
i think in the future there will be no reserve currency as we 
have known it in the past said tone grant a member of the board 
of directors of the futures industry association 
at the end of 1987 the dollar accounted for 67 percent of 
official worldwide foreign exchange reserves down from 70 to 80 
percent in the 1970s the international monetary fund says 
the yen accounted for 7 percent of world official reserves and 
the west german mark for 147 percent the british pound which 
before world war i accounted for 38 percent of official reserves 
now accounts for 26 percent 
the yen is likely to reach 14 to 15 percent of worldwide 
official reserves by the mid1990s hale said 
but a number of factors limit the yens viability as a reserve 
currency including limits on the number of investment opportunities 
in japans financial markets and exchange rate volatility which 
discourages the use of yendenominated contracts in foreign trade 
hale said 
more than 35 percent of japans export contracts are 
yendenominated up from 175 percent in 1975 and nearly 10 percent 
of its import contracts are yendenominated up from less than one 
percent in 1975 he said 
but in britain and west germany 80 percent of their exports and 
40 percent of their imports are denominated in their own currencies 
hale said 
the dollar allows better control of risks said makoto 
utsumi director general of the finance ministrys international 
finance bureau he noted that there was no particular reason not to 
use the dollar in transactions 
utsumi and other japanese officials were unenthusiastic about the 
yens potential as a reserve currency explaining that the dollar is 
supported by both military and economic power 
the yens vulnerability is that japans strength lies only in 
economic power because it lacks a defense capability and natural 
resources hosomi said 
nations accumulate international reserves when the combination of 
the balance of payments and shortterm capital movements is in 
surplus the reserves are used up when the balance of payments and 
capital transfer go into deficit

currencies in hectic european trading tuesday as the market shrugged 
off reported light centralbank intervention 
gold prices also rose 
currency dealers said the dollar began rising early in the 
european day after opening at lower levels in the wake of 
intervention by the us federal reserve and the west german 
bundesbank on monday 
traders were hesitant to take the dollar above 18300 west german 
marks for most of the day but gathered their courage late in the 
european session after noting that the bundesbank had been absent 
from the open market 
the dollars rise above 18300 marks was met by fed intervention 
at around the 18315mark level dealers said they said the 
intervention was largely ignored because it was followed by comments 
from beryl sprinkel the white house chief economic adviser who 
questioned the validity of centralbank intervention 
people are seeing the fed intervention as a market challenge 
rather than a barrier said one trader 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins

the reagan administration today recommended 
curtailing deposit insurance for bank and savings and loan accounts 
and said the public will have to bear much of the estimated 100 
billion cost of restoring the sampl industry to health 
the white house council of economic advisers in president 
reagans final economic report said reducing protection for 
depositors would cause them to more closely monitor the financial 
health of the institutions holding their money 
but treasury secretary nicholas f brady who is working on an 
sampl plan for the administration of presidentelect bush said in a 
statement released through rep chalmers wylie of ohio senior 
republican on the house banking committee that curtailing deposit 
insurance is not an option and will not be considered 
banking committee chairman henry b gonzalez dtexas said a 
gradual reduction in the 100000 insurance limit may be considered 
as part of the overall solution to the thrift crisis however he 
added lowering the amount of deposit insurance is a very serious 
matter not a matter to be thrown out as a trial balloon 
although reagans report did not address the question beryl w 
sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser said that as part 
of the insurance curb institutions should be required to publicly 
disclose more information about their financial condition 
the administration also sharply criticized sampl regulators for 
postponing the day of reckoning in their rescues of failed 
institutions 
but the top regulator m danny wall chairman of the federal 
home loan bank board defended his agencys yearend spree of 
savings and loan bailouts as cheaper than shutting the failed 
institutions down and paying off depositors 
wall a reagan appointee said at a briefing outlining his 
testimony today before the house banking committee that his agency 
rescued 75 institutions in december at a cost of 163 billion to be 
spread out over 10 years 
tax benefits arising from the deals will cost the government an 
additional 4 billion over 10 years 
the alternative to the rescues liquidating the sampls and 
shutting them down would have required 47 billion in upfront 
cash far more than is available immediately to the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp wall said 
by selling off the property of the failed sampls regulators 
eventually would have recouped all but 228 billion on the december 
transactions he said 
the board supervises nearly 3000 federally insured sampls 
both banks and sampls are failing in numbers not seen since the 
great depression reagans report noted that the problems will be 
one of the major challenges for the next administration under 
presidentelect bush 
while reagan placed much of the blame on regulators the 
administrations own record has come under fire as well critics 
point out that the administration refused to pay for additional sampl 
examiners while the problem was developing 
in the final reagan budget released monday the administration 
called for spending 64 billion on sampls through 1994 and 
acknowledged for the first time that it does not have enough money 
coming in to handle the cleanup 
citing the 1980 decision by congress to boost the limit on 
deposit insurance from 40000 to 100000 reagans economic report 
said reducing the ceiling would restore muchneeded discipline to 
the system 
the scope of federal deposit insurance should be significantly 
curtailed it said however it did not recommend a specific 
limit nor did it say whether the curtailment should apply to 
existing deposits or only to future deposits 
deposit insurance discourages bank runs and provides individuals 
with a safe place for their money but it also dramatically 
reduces the incentives for depositors to monitor the financial 
health of their bank the administration said 
it was particularly critical of regulators de facto policy of 
guaranteeing deposits above the insurance limit in large 
institutions 
maryliz meany a spokeswoman for the american bankers 
association said her organization does not support rolling back 
limits on deposit insurance but believes the current 100000 
ceiling should be enforced to expose depositors to some risk 
with virtually all deposits now protected the depositor has no 
incentive to be careful with his or her dollars she said 
the system has become a license for abuse for some financial 
managers she added before we change the current system we 
should try to make the current system work efficiently by allowing 
greater market discipline 
jon brown director of the ralph nadersponsored consumer group 
bank watch said rolling back insurance limits would encourage more 
discipline in the systembut should be part of a broader program to 
more strictly regulate banks and savings and loans 
the recommendation contradicts a study released last week by the 
fdic which concluded that deposit insurance should be preserved at 
current levels fdic chairman l william seidman said regulators 
have been unwilling to tolerate the risk to the banking system of 
forcing losses on depositors at large institutions even those whose 
funds exceed the insurance limit 
noting estimates of the sampl problem ranging up to 100 billion 
the council of economic advisers said a large portion of the 
payment of this bill will need to come directly from the public 
the rest will be levied indirectly on consumers through fees charged 
banks and sampls it said 
it also said most regulatory actions taken so far merely serve 
to postpone the problem and will sharply increase costs to the 
general public sampl regulators practice of guaranteeing new 
owners of rescued sampls against losses for up to 10 years weakens the 
incentive to manage efficiently it said 
wall at the briefing monday night in advance of his testimony 
today cited two benefits of rescuing institutions now and spreading 
out the cost rather than waiting to accumulate the money for 
liquidations 
first he said the bank board stops the operating losses at the 
rescued institutions second it eases the need for the institutions 
to pay abovemarket interest rates to attract depositors that in 
turn eases the pressure on stillhealthy sampls to compete by raising 
their rates 
wall said the december spending spree left the fslic board with 
3 billion at yearend he said the insurance fund would maintain a 
balance of 1 billion to 3 billion through 1989 but he revealed 
that a crunch requiring additional borrowing may arise in less 
than two years 
in 1987 congress authorized the bank board to borrow 106 
billion by selling bonds through september 1990 it has borrowed 
about half that so far 
when the remaining bond authority runs out and if congress does 
not provide alternate funding wall said the bank board may have to 
issue special premium anticipation notes which will be paid off 
with revenue the board expects to collect over the next 30 years 
including the december pledges the bank board last year 
committed more than 38 billion to resolve the cases of 205 
institutions wall declined to say how much more his agency had left 
to promise but he said we could do another 16 billion 
comfortably

overproduction by some members of opec 
has not become a problem yet as the cartel voluntarily cuts output 
to raise prices indonesias oil minister said tuesday 
responding to press reports of alleged overproduction by the 
united arab emirates ginandjar kartasasmita said opec has not 
confirmed that the uae is violating its quota even though he said 
the reports should be taken seriously 
some members may have a reason for overproducing and cutbacks 
may have to be done gradually this is permitted by opec what is 
not permitted is to put this overproduction on the market 
kartasasmita told reporters 
he said a meeting of an eightmember subcommittee of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries charged with 
monitoring compliance with the new quota system would be obligatory 
if overproduction occurred but he indicated a meeting would not be 
held before february 
we are barely two weeks into the accord and we cannot know what 
production will be for january he said 
opec agreed last november to limit production to 185 million 
barrels a day starting jan 1 
a scheduled meeting of the subcommittee to which venezuela and 
indonesia both belong is set for march 
kartasasmita said opec will seek cutbacks from a group of 
independent producers in a joint meeting jan 26 that need not 
amount to the 15 to 20 percent reduction opec is imposing on its 
members 
we dont ask for that much its up to them to decide how much 
they want to cut we are not demanding anything but any cut will 
help the minister said 
he said that opec would not be able to reach its price aim of 18 
per barrel without total member compliance and without cooperation 
from nonopec producers 
he said indonesia is estimating its average price this year at 
14 a barrel as part of a government policy to wean the island 
nation from its dependence on oil income 
kartasasmita arrived in caracas monday for a fiveday official 
visit which has included talks with venezuelan energy minister julio 
cesar gil and venezuelan presidentelect carlos andres perez 
he said indonesia supports perez proposal for a summit of opec 
heads of state in 1990 the year of opecs 30th anniversary 
the two countries are exploring technical cooperation in oil 
between the indonesian state oil company pertamina and petroleos de 
venezuela sa and increasing bilateral trade in nonoil goods 
kartasasmita plans to visit opec member ecuador and independent 
producers colombia and mexico following his scheduled friday 
departure from venezuela 
perez who will be inaugurated feb 2 is scheduled to visit 
iran iraq and united arab emirates next week to drum up support for 
an opec summit

honda motor co expects a more than tenfold increase 
in two years in the number of autos it produces in the united states 
and imports to japan honda president tadashi kume said tuesday 
last year japans no 3 automaker imported to japan 5385 
twodoor accord coupes made at its marysville ohio plant it was 
the first time honda imported cars it produced in the united states 
honda expects to import about 4600 accords this year from the 
united states but by 1991 when we plan to sell 800000 autos in 
the domestic japanese market we plan to import 50000 cars from 
ohio kume told a news conference 
honda which sells more cars in the united states than any other 
japanese manufacturer will produce about 360000 cars in the united 
states this year but increase production in canada from 50000 to 
80000 kume said 
honda expects to sell 800000 autos in the united states this 
year including imports up from 769000 in 1988 a us spokesman 
said 
japanese automakers still experience difficulties in selling cars 
in the united states because of the high value of the yen kume 
said the yen has doubled in value against the us dollar since 
1985 making japanese products more expensive overseas 
kume said honda would increase the number of dealerships in the 
united states to 1300 but did not give the present number 
hondas total auto production in japan this year is expected to 
be 141 million up 83 percent about half of those are exported 
and this year honda expects to sell 685000 cars in japan 109 
percent more than last year 
production of the fivedoor concerto developed jointly with 
britains austin rover group will begin this fall and the cars will 
be sold in britain and elsewhere in europe kume said 
he said the japanese governments decision tuesday to continue 
limiting auto exports to the united states would not affect honda 
which fell short of its quota last year

jobs in financial services one of the engines of 
growth in the metropolitan economy declined in new york city for 
the first time in more than a decade during 1988 according to a 
yearend review that shows the nightmare of black monday has yet to 
fade in the big apple 
the area encompassing new york city and northeastern new jersey 
experienced job growth in almost all other industries but at the 
slowest rate in the past six years the federal bureau of labor 
statistics reported tuesday 
between december 1987 and october 1988 the region added 99000 
jobs for a total of 822 million said samuel i ehrenhalt regional 
commissioner of the bureau 
the increase represented an annual growth rate of 15 percent 
compared to the national growth rate of 34 percent he said 
new york citys overall gain was less than 1 percent in 1988 or 
23000 new jobs proof that the citys economy has clearly lost 
momentum in the aftermath of the october 1987 stock market 
crash ehrenhalt said 
jobs on wall street declined by 12000 after adding an average 
of 11000 jobs a year in the prior five years a period in which the 
securities industry accounted for a fourth of all job growth in the 
citys private economy 
but area unemployment rates were mostly lower than the national 
average according to ehrenhalts review 
joblessness in the region was 39 percent for the first 10 months 
of 1988 down from 45 percent the previous year 
only hudson county in new jersey with 64 percent was higher 
than the national rate of 56 percent 
eight of the 23 counties of the region were below 3 percent 
unemployment and three of them hunterdon morris and somerset in 
new jersey were below 2 percent 
new york city showed an 18year low in joblessness 49 percent 
for the first 11 months of 1988 the decline was across the board 
reflected in better figures regardless of race sex and age 
but ehrenhalt added that the lower rates primarily reflect 
cutbacks in the number of job seekers 
nationally about 66 percent of the working age population is 
active in the job market but in new york city the figure is only 55 
percent he said 
another exception to the general job expansion in the region was 
bluecollar factory work manufacturing here continued its 
decadesold decline falling to a postworld war ii low of 117 
million jobs in the 23county metropolitan area ehrenhalt said 
the slowdown in growth was least pronounced in the new jersey 
portion of the metropolitan area ehrenhalt said 
in northeastern new jersey private sector employment increased 
by 21 percent last year compared to 3 percent the previous year 
but it still amounted to 42000 added jobs public hiring also 
picked up slightly 
long island and the suburban counties north of the city added 
16000 jobs a 11 percent increase but far below the growth of the 
previous four years 
the region covered by ehrenhalts report takes in the five 
counties of new york city and the new york state counties of plus 
nassau suffolk westchester rockland orange and putnam plus the 
new jersey counties of bergen essex hudson hunterdon middlesex 
monmouth morris sussex ocean passaic somerset and union

an attorney for sam walton the nations 
richest man and chairman of walmart stores inc on tuesday sought 
to repeal an 115 million fine against his client in connection 
with a personal injury suit 
the motion filed in 352nd district court argues that the 
sanctions violated a stay issued by the 2nd us court of appeals 
and waltons constitutional rights of appeal 
this unreasonable ruling must be reversed when a judge enters 
an order so patently wrong the party suffereing the abuse should be 
vindicated at the very first opportunity attorney vic anderson 
said in the motion 
the issue surfaced this summer when walton was asked to give a 
deposition in a lawsuit filed by andrew carrizales of houston 
against walmart and manager jerry rand carrizales claims that 
while shopping at the companys sulphur springs store in 1986 he 
slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on the floor 
when walton failed to provide testimony former 352nd district 
court judge john street ordered him to appear in fort worth for a 
deposition but the texas supreme court said streets ruling was a 
clear abuse of discretion 
street modified his order and required walton to submit to a 
videotape deposition at the companys headquarters in bentonville 
ark walton refused and street imposed sanctions against him for 
violating the modified order 
fines began at 10000 on nov 28 and reached 128 million 
before dropping back to 1 million a day walton eventually showed 
up for a deposition in fort worth on dec 15 
however anderson says the 2nd court of appeals in fort worth 
granted a stay of streets order five days after it was issued nov 
18 the stay dissolved on dec 12 and walton showed up two days 
later 
walton is currently listed as the nations richest man by forbes 
magazine with a net worth of about 67 billion

business executives expect profits to fall during 
the first quarter of 1989 with retailers in particular less 
optimistic about sales following the lucrative holiday season 
according to a survey released tuesday 
dun amp bradstreet corp a leading businessinformation marketer 
said its quarterly poll of 1500 executives found expectations about 
the economy were lower for the first three months of the year than 
the last quarter of 1988 and the same period a year earlier 
but joseph w duncan corporate economist and chief statistician 
for dun amp bradstreet said the current outlook is better than it 
appears 
expectations for firstquarter sales are down only slightly and 
we are coming off a 4year high in terms of expectations for higher 
profits duncan said 
our fourthquarter survey indicated that retailers were 
looking ahead to a strong holiday sales period so the current 
results suggest they expect consumers to take a breather after the 
christmas selling season 
duncan added that among manufacturers sales expectations 
remained at historically high levels as companies continue to 
benefit from opportunities in export markets 
the latest survey was conducted in november 
overall the report said dun amp bradstreets sales optimism index 
fell slightly for thefirst quarter to 68 from 70 in the fourth 
quarter of 1988 but among retailers the index plunged to 57 from 
72 
the index of expectations for higher profits among retailers also 
fell sharply to 53 from a 4year high of 69 in the fourth quarter 
the overall index declined to 60 from 67 
in the category for prices the overall index declined one point 
to 41 however wholesalers indicated they planned to raise prices 
in the first quarter with the index rising to 45 from 37 
the overall employment expectations index rose to 24 from 22 
largely due to a modest gain among manufacturers expectations among 
retailers and wholesalers remained essentially unchanged

digital equipment corp rolled out a 
longexpected line of computer workstations and personal computers 
tuesday including the first highpowered machine that does not 
belong to its vax line 
analysts said the most significant product was the decstation 
3100 a fast workstation for scientists engineers and financial 
analysts that will compete with models from sun microsystems inc 
apollo computer inc hewlettpackard co and others 
the decstation 3100 is a breakthrough because of its speed and 
because it cannot run software written for digitals vax computer 
line it runs a version of unix an industrystandard operating 
system 
up until this point they have maintained that the vax 
architecture is the beall and endall of the computer world said 
gregory cline a senior analyst at the yankee group in boston i 
think its a smart move cline said 
the decstation 3100 which digital billed as the worlds 
fastest desktop workstation begins at 11900 cline and other 
analysts said digitals leadership claim is probably valid but said 
digital could itself be leapfrogged soon by companies such as sun 
digital also introduced a line of slower workstations that do run 
its vax operating system and a line of industrystandard personal 
computers made to its design by tandy corp however the personal 
computers are not capable of using dec windows so programs that run 
on the pcs will not look the same as programs running on other 
digital computers

percent of a fiberoptics company owned by corning glass works the

fiber to the computing world 
the value of the deal was not disclosed 
pco inc a 175employee company based in the chatsworth area of 
los angeles specializes in devices that convert electronic signals

corning based in corning ny made an additional investment in 
pco and will keep a 65 percent interest in the company the 
remaining 10 percent will be owned by pco employees founders and

cable operators and broadcasters both fearing 
phone company intrusion into their businesses could reach a 
compromise early this year on requiring cable systems to carry local 
tv stations on their channels the cable industrys chief spokesman 
said tuesday 
the instant we get the signal from congress we will be at the 
table and we have every reason to believe the negotiations will not 
need to be protracted said james mooney president of the 
national cable television association 
the federal communications commission had required cable 
operators to include all local broadcasters in their service areas 
on their channels until 1985 when the regulations were struck down 
by the courts as unconstitutional 
at the time some cable systems faced the prospect of having to 
give up other programming because of a plethora of new broadcasters 
consuming their channel capacity 
the cable association and the national association of 
broadcasters agreed on new must carry regulations that basically 
would have reserved up to onefourth of a cable systems channels 
for local broadcasters but it too was struck down by the courts 
because of the courts rulings and the fccs reluctance to tackle 
the issue again on its own any compromise providing some kind of 
legal mandate for cable access for local broadcasters will likely 
require a congressional mandate mooney said 
legislation to do that was considered by the last congress but it 
ended up getting held hostage to president reagans vetos of bill 
reinstating the fairness doctrine that the fcc repealed in 1987 
and regulating the type and amount of advertising on shows aimed at 
children 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee already has introduced a new bill to reinstate 
the fairness doctrine requiring broadcasters to cover issues of 
public importance and reflect differing views on those issues in 
their programing 
dingell said last week that he also was willing to tackle the 
must carry issue again when congress begins work after the 
inauguration 
however it is not clear yet whether the must carry cable 
measure that broadcasters want will be handled alone or as part of a 
package that includes the fairness doctrine and restrictions on 
childrens advertising both of which broadcasters oppose 
industry officials said dingell and other lawmakers may try to 
pass the fairness doctrine and childrens advertising measures first 
to see how presidentelect bush reacts before considering the cable 
access issue

japan will continue voluntary restraints in its auto 
exports to the united states for the eighth straight year the 
japanese trade minister said tuesday 
although japanese car exports to the united states have been 
below the selfimposed quota of 23 million autos annually japan 
will keep the restraints in place minister of international trade 
and industry hiroshi mitsuzuka said 
the government is not convinced that auto exports have 
permanently declined mitsuzuka told a news conference 
japanese auto exports to the united states in fiscal 1987 which 
ended in march 1988 were 221 million and shipments from 
aprilnovember were 104 percent below a year earlier mitsuzuka 
said 
however if we removed the quota we are concerned that there 
are companies which are aggressively marketing in the united states 
and a declining tendency doesnt seem to be stabilized yet he 
said 
he left open the possibility that the quota could be removed in 
the middle of the forthcoming fiscal year if the ministry decides 
that the decline is not reversing 
japanese automakers had little reaction saying tersely that they 
would accept the measures 
the decision to extend the voluntary restraints was made by the 
two governments in consideration of current usjapan trade and 
economic relations said shoichi toyoda president of toyota motor 
corp japans largest automaker and chairman of the japan 
association of auto manufacturers it is a decision we will abide 
with 
nissan and honda the countrys no 2 and no 3 auto 
manufacturers have fallen short of their export quotas but toyota 
has been fulfilling its estimated 450000500000 car share annually 
the automakers do not release their actual quota figures 
free trade is desirable and the quota system has lost its 
original significance but the matter must be studied in the frame 
of usjapan relations as a whole we believe the government 
made its conclusion taking this into consideration said nissan 
president yutaka kume 
some us lawmakers insist that japanese cars built in the united 
states should also be counted as imports but mitsuzuka told 
reporters that by 1991 the local content of usmade japanese cars 
would be 75 percent and we regard them as americanmade cars 
japanese makers produced 733000 cars in the united states from 
januarynovember 1988 up 232 percent from same period of 1987 
according to the foreign ministry 
last year japanese news reports said the trade ministry would 
lift the export quota because it was outdated but that idea was 
abandoned because of concern about giving washington the wrong 
impression at a time of rising protectionist sentiment in the united 
states 
the quota system dates from 1981 when japan was under strong 
pressure from the us government and american automakers to cut 
japanese exports and allow the us auto industry to retrench and 
restructure japan agreed to limit its annual exports to the united 
states to 168 million vehicles through 1983 then to 185 million 
in 1984 
when us president ronald reagan decided not to ask for 
continued restraints in 1985 japan set the ceiling at 23 million 
and has maintained that figure

the dollar finished higher tuesday against most 
major currencies in global foreign exchange trading despite what 
dealers described as light dollarselling by the federal reserve 
gold prices were mixed falling in new york after rising in 
europe republic national bank in new york quoted a bid for gold as 
of 4 pm est at 40380 a troy ounce down 70 cents from mondays 
late bid 
currency dealers said the dollar began rising early in the 
european day after opening lower in the wake of central bank 
intervention on monday 
traders were hesitant to take the dollar above 18300 west german 
marks for most of the day but gathered courage late in the european 
session after noting that the west german bundesbank had been absent 
from the open market 
the fed appeared to have intervened after the dollar edged toward 
18325 marks late in the morning session in new york and reappeared 
to sell dollars again at midafternoon when the currency drifted up 
to about 18375 marks according to daniel holland vice president 
at discount corp in new york 
the move was not concerted because the other central banks had 
already gone home for the day holland said 
but he said the market wanted to know whether the fed wanted to 
curb a rise in the dollar and found the fed does mean to be 
here 
the dollars rise also was encouraged by reports of comments by 
beryl sprinkel the white house chief economic adviser who 
questioned the validity of centralbank intervention 
holland said the dollars rise came mainly on speculative 
activity by professionals traders buying to cover earlier promises 
to sell the dollar rather than real corporate demand for the 
dollar 
we have some people throwing in the towel here saying it 
doesnt look like its coming down he said 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell 039 yen to 12570 yen later in london the dollar 
was quoted at 12630 yen in new york the dollar rose to 126325

in london the dollar gained against the british pound which 
fell to 17643 from 17650 late monday the dollar also rose 
against the pound in new york where sterling fell to 176475 from 
177325 late monday

cocoa futures prices dropped sharply tuesday on new yorks 
coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange amid heavy arbitrage selling and 
rumors of large export shipments from the ivory coast the worlds 
largest cocoa producer 
on other markets coffee futures rallied precious metals 
declined energy grain soybean livestock and meat futures were 
mixed and stockindex futures retreated 
cocoa settled 56 to 73 lower with the contract for delivery in 
march at 1352 a metric ton 
the decline the fourth in as many sessions was partly a 
result of arbitrage selling linked to the dollars gain in value 
against the british pound analysts said 
when the dollar increases in value against the pound as it did 
on tuesday cocoa traders can profit by selling cocoa futures for 
dollars in new york and buying the same amount of cocoa futures for 
pounds on the london terminal market 
further selling was prompted by rumors of a large number of 
shipment declarations by the ivory coast which until recently had 
been withholding its topquality cocoa from the market in hopes of 
forcing prices higher analysts said 
the market turned bearish on sentiments that nearterm 
availability of ivorian cocoa could be up substantially from what it 
has been recently said sandra kaul an analyst in new york with 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
she said the world cocoa harvest was at its peak with production 
expected to outweigh demand for the fifth straight year 
a rumored deal among the ivory coast the french government and a 
large french trade house to withhold ivorian cocoa from the market 
is increasingly being perceived as a bearish factor since it will 
only add to the surplus overhanging the market analysts said 
new york coffee futures managed a modest rally after two days of 
steep losses coffee settled 198 cents to 259 cents higher with 
march at 15048 a pound 
gold futures extended their slide to five days and silver made 
new lifeofcontract lows on new yorks commodity exchange in quiet 
selling linked to the dollars strength 
but analysts said golds refusal so far to test the 
psychologically important level of 400 a troy ounce was encouraging 
for bullish players gold for spot delivery on the exchange finished 
the day at 40380 
with the market that close to 400 it would be easy enough 
to challenge it said craig sloane an analyst with smith barney 
harris upham amp co in new york 
gold futures settled 1 to 110 lower with february at 40560 a 
troy ounce silver was 47 cents to 48 cents lower with march at 
5995 a troy ounce 
wheat and soybean futures ended mostly lower while corn futures 
finished narrowly mixed in a quiet session on the chicago board of 
trade 
the markets opened mostly lower then rallied early in the 
session in reaction to lighterthanexpected rain in argentina the 
worlds fourthlargest soybean producer 
wheat settled cent to 2 cents lower with march at 446 a 
bushel corn was 1 cent lower to cent higher with march at 289 
a bushel oats were cent lower to 1 cents higher with march at 
239 a bushel soybeans were unchanged to 4 cents lower with 
january at 802 a bushel 
energy futures finished narrowly mixed amid a lack of new 
supplydemand developments on the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 4 cents lower 
with february at 1769 a barrel heating oil was 29 cent lower to 
03 cent higher with february at 5386 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 06 cent lower to 15 cent higher with february at

cattle futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange 
buoyed by higher cash markets while pork futures finished mixed in

tw services inc said tuesday it had rejected an 
offer by coniston partners to ease the conditions on conistons 14 
billion bid for the food services company 
tw services said its chairman frank l salizzoni sent a letter 
to the new yorkbased investment firm refusing to take any action 
on the companys poison pill antitakeover defense and refusing 
to waive a requirement that a takeover must be approved by the tw 
services board 
last week coniston said it would no longer insist on winning 
approval from the board before continuing with its offer if tw 
services dropped the poison pill either voluntarily or by court 
order 
in his letter salizzoni reiterated tw services skepticism about 
the sincerity of the coniston bid and said the company would not 
consider any action on the poison pill until such time as your 
offer has become firm and it is absolutely clear you are committed 
to acquiring the company 
augustus k oliver a principal of coniston called tw services 
response an unfortunate continuation of the same attitude that the 
board has expressed so far to our offer 
its something we find very difficult to understand 
particularly in the fact that almost 88 percent of the stock has 
been tendered to us oliver said 
it doesnt stop us from proceeding he it 
considers the embargo to have been broken this paper has told ap it 
plans to release its story for wednesday am editions

discount retailer k mart corp breached 
its contract with a wholesaler clothing buyer and must pay 73 
million in damages a federal jury decided tuesday 
after four months of testimony the sixperson jury deliberated 
for 8 hours before returning the verdict to us district judge 
ronald r lagueux 
we were disappointed said robert stephenson a spokesman at 
k mart headquarters in troy mich we plan to appeal the verdict 
on the basis that the judge made a number of substantial errors in 
judgment during the trial 
fashion house charged that k mart ignored a 1983 agreement 
requiring the retailer to purchase 85 percent of its name brand and 
designer label apparel through the wholesaler 
k mart canceled the fouryear contract in april 1986 shortly 
after fashion house filed suit against it for unpaid commissions 
robert w steele a k mart attorney told the jury the contract 
was canceled not because of the impending lawsuit but because 
fashion house repeatedly failed to obtain the name brand merchandise 
the retailer wanted 
he said the stock k mart received came in broken lots odd sizes 
and unattractive colors and that the retailer lost 45 million in 
its designer depot stores which fashion house stocked almost 
exclusively 
fashion house attorney richard sharfman said that by 1984 k mart 
had already begun to ignore the terms of the contract and was 
purchasing more than 15 percent of its clothing directly from 
manufacturers 
steele did not address the argument of k marts breach of 
contract by buying directly from the manufacturers but called the 
plantiffs request for 80 million in damages an outrageous 
exercise in greed 
the jury awarded fashion house 307 million for unpaid 
commissions 287 million for wrongful termination of contract and 
ordered k mart to pay 136 million in interest on the award 
the jury has vindicated fashion house sharfman said 
he had argued that his clients buying acumen helped turn k mart 
around in the early 1980s bringing in the brand names that helped 
boost apparel sales and profits 
k mart had 256 billion in sales in fiscal 1987 in late 
december it owned 2265 k mart stores 1231 walden books 266 
payless drugstores and 133 builders square stores 
the pawtucketbased fashion house which dealt almost soley with 
k mart went out of business in 1986 sharfman said at its peak in 
1983 it had 188 million in sales and 100 employees in new york and 
pawtucket

pan am corp strapped by losses from its main 
airline subsidiary announced tuesday that it has put another 
profitable unit up for sale 
pan am said its board of directors has decided to sell the 
companys world services subsidiary which markets security 
maintenance and other services to government agencies and other 
airlines 
world services had revenue of 550 million and pretax profit of 
23 million in 1987 pan am said in a statement financial analysts 
estimate the units potential sale value at around 200 million 
the flagship airline unit pan american world airways continues 
to drain the companys finances world airways net loss of 547 
million in the first nine months of last year contributed heavily to 
the parents net loss of 21 million on revenue of 32 billion in 
the same period 
the sale of world services will sharply improve pan ams 
working capital position said robert joedicke an airline analyst 
for investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc this is their 
negative cash flow period 
pan ams northeast shuttle service and pan am express a commuter 
airline also are considered profitable operations but they are 
more closely tied to world airways than is the world services unit 
eastern airlines recently sold its shuttle service which 
competes with pan ams to real estate developer donald trump for 
365 million in cash 
some analysts wondered whether the world services move 
represented a new pan am strategy to sell performing assets rather 
than strip away parts of lossmaking world airways such as routes 
and airport facilities 
but pan am spokesman jeffrey kriendler said the decision to sell 
the unit is based on the recognition that our primary business is 
the airline business the company considers the pan am shuttle and 
pan am express to be part of that business he said 
kriendler said the sale of world services has been under 
discussion by pan am management for several months as a way to help 
finance its planned investments for the near future those 
investments include 61 million for improvements at world airways 
main terminal at kennedy international airport in new york 25 
million for refurbishing aircraft interiors 20 million for 
improvements in information systems and other programs pan am said 
in the statement 
to finance the projects pan am also will use the 115 million 
payment it got recently from airbus industrie a european aircraft 
consortium pan am decided to scrap a firm order for 16 airbus a320s 
in exchange for the payment 
the 16 planes originally intended for pan am were included in a 
35 billion deal announced last wednesday by regional airline 
braniff inc which will acquire 50 a320s and take options on 50 
more the deal nearly tripled the size of braniffs fleet 
analysts expect potential buyers of world services to be service 
companies rather than airlines with aerospace company lockheed 
services rumored to be one of the interested parties 
last july united airlines sold its united airlines services 
corp to flight safety international which runs training programs 
for an undisclosed amount 
its a wide open kind of thing there are lots of concerns that 
could be interested said edward starkman an airline analyst for 
painewebber inc 
kriendler confirmed that the world services unit would likely be 
sold to a nonairline company

the chairman of the national mediation board on 
tuesday blamed news leaks for scuttling the talks he led between 
eastern airlines and its largest union 
however walter c wallace wouldnt say what hell do about 
company calls for an impasse declaration or a warning from the 
international machinists president of a potential nationwide 
disruption of service wallace also didnt lay blame for the end 
of the talks 
wallace abruptly left key largo fla monday on the fourth day 
of intense talks he set in hopes of resolving a 15monthold 
contract dispute between eastern and its 8500member machinists 
union 
in a statement from washington wallace said he stopped the 
sessions because the prearranged conditions planned and necessary 
to the success of such talks were compromised undermining the 
collective bargaining process and mediation by the national 
mediation board 
wallace said bargaining in a fish bowl yields nothing in such 
situations the parties tend to make proposals and statements aimed 
at public relations objectives rather than the bargaining process 
the board will continue its efforts to bring the parties together 
under proper circumstances where a solution of the labor dispute can 
be achieved 
mediation board officials declined comment but gave no sign they 
would declare an impasse that would start a 30day deadline after 
which the union could strike and eastern could impose its own work 
conditions 
union leaders charge that eastern wants to provoke a strike so it 
can try to break it and bust the union eastern says deadline 
pressure is needed to get the negotiations moving 
the mediation board which received the case in january 1988 
could schedule more talks declare an impasse or ask both sides to 
submit to binding arbitration both sides would have to agree to 
arbitration 
machinists district 100 leader charles e bryan on monday charged 
that the company sabotaged the talks by refusing to make any new 
offers and by putting out what he called deceptive employee 
bulletins that were easily obtained by the news media 
eastern officials denied they had done anything wrong 
meanwhile reporters obtained a jan 3 letter to wallace from 
william w winpisinger washingtonbased international president of 
the machinists 
winpisingers letter complained about the pressure being put on 
the mediation board by eastern its texas air corp parent and 
eastern supporters florida gov bob martinez the greater miami 
chamber of commerce and editorials in leading newspapers have called 
for declaration of an impasse 
winpisinger countered by saying the international union would 
support eastern machinists if necessary with selfhelp against 
eastern airlines and secondary activity against a number of 
other major carriers 
the responsibility for a nationwide disruption of service 
will be laid at the doorstep of eastern airlines and its allies in 
this dispute because it has adamantly refused to make any 
counteroffer whatsoever to the proposals of the iam winpisingers 
letter said 
the machinists represent workers at trans world airlines usair 
united airlines and northwest airlines winpisinger was out of town 
tuesday and couldnt be reached for comment 
eastern meanwhile reportedly has been trying to sell some of 
its planes its airport gates in philadelphia and some canadian 
routes on the heels of the recent sale of its northeast shuttle 
service to developer donald trump for 365 million in cash 
clearly the happenings of this last weekend will make us move 
forward faster on some asset sales than perhaps we would have done 
otherwise joseph b leonard easterns senior vice president and 
chief operating officer said monday 
also on monday the internal revenue service gave eastern 
permission to reschedule 105 million in pension payments due last 
sept 15 eastern now has until sept 15 of this year to finish 
making periodic payments into the employee pension plans leonard 
said the payments would be financed by pending asset sales 
eastern saying the moneylosing carriers survival is threatened 
by failure to reach a settlement with the machinists again called 
for declaration of a 30day deadline the company estimates losses 
at 1 million a day 
the two sides who last met in intense mediation in july have 
been some 200 million apart the machinists representing 8500 
mechanics baggage handlers and other ground service workers or 
more than onefourth of easterns employees were seeking a 50 
million raise the company said 
eastern was seeking 150 million in concessions mostly from the 
nonmechanics but said it was offering job security and training 
programs 
eastern which posted 2337 million in losses for the first 
three quarters of 1988 has been owned 2 years by houstonbased 
texas air which also owns nonunion continental airlines

continental airlines said tuesday it would settle 
a classaction lawsuit against its people express unit by paying 
more than 85 million to former shareholders of the discount 
airline 
the lawsuit charged that people express expanded recklessly then 
concealed its deteriorating operating and financial condition from

purposes

of chancery and in federal court in new jersey to be dropped 
continental spokesman dave messing said 
the lawsuits were brought on behalf of all people who purchased 
or otherwise acquired securities of people express inc or people 
express airlines inc from sept 1 1984 through dec 30 1986 
class members will be paid out of a fund consisting of 5 million 
in notes and 35 million in cash plus interest on the cash accrued 
since aug 17 1987 
the settlement is subject to certain conditions including the 
entry of a final order from the federal court which will review the 
fairness of the settlement

the estimated 2 billion price being paid for two 
large cable television systems shows the market for cable remains 
surprisingly strong despite the recent spate of systems for sale 
media analysts and brokers say the market is likely to remain 
bullish because the industrys days of heaviest construction 
spending are over and deregulation has given cable systems more 
freedom to raise basic rates 
also supporting system prices is the trend of advertisers 
spending more on cable and the expectation that more homes will sign 
up for cable service 
for the moment these concerns appear to be outweighing the 
perceived risks that telephone companies may be allowed to compete 
in the cable business and that congress could step in to break up 
the bigger cable system operators 
some of the new owners are also bringing a new frame of reference 
to the cable business that is likely to fuel more efficient growth 
analysts say 
we have a business that was driven by engineers that is just 
now starting to be run by managers and marketers said john waller 
iii president of the media brokerage firm waller capital corp 
that is likely to be a plus he said especially as systems make 
technological improvements that make it easier for subscribers to 
take additional services such as payperview programming 
in the latest deals in the cable business cooke cablevision inc 
and the new york times co announced separately monday that they 
have agreed to sell cable television systems in transactions 
estimated to value nearly 2 billion 
the new york times co said it is selling its system in southern 
new jersey for 420 million to a concern that will be managed by a 
minority investment group with 162000 subscribers the price came 
to about 2600 per subscriber 
investor jack kent cooke who controls cooke cablevision 
declined to reveal the sales price of his cable systems which have 
about 700000 subscribers and are being sold to a consortium of 
cable companies 
but published reports citing unidentified sources in the 
purchasing group put the sale price at 2100 to 2200 per 
subscriber or about 15 billion 
the reason cooke got less per subscriber for his holdings than 
the times did analysts said is that his properties are scattered 
over 19 states 
the number and value of cable system sales has risen as the 
industry consolidates and some owners capitalize on the values being 
placed on systems 
paula greer who works for the media research firm paul kagan 
associates inc of carmel calif said 407 deals were announced in 
the first 11 months of 1988 worth 132 billion up from 399 deals 
worth 95 billion at the same point in 1987 
the average price per subscriber was 1971 in the 1988 period 
up 165 percent from the 1692 per subscriber average reported in 
the same 1987 period she said 
ms greer said the market for cable systems appears to have 
leveled off at a pricepersubscriber of between 2000 and 2500 
for the better systems 
we have reached a plateau and probably will stay there halfway 
through next year as people get comfortable with it she said 
michael kupinski media analyst for ag edwards amp sons inc in 
st louis said the industry can look forward to revenue growth of 
12 percent a year over the next few years with 5 percent coming from 
higher rates 5 percent from subscriber growth and 2 percent from 
growth in ancillary services such as advertising 
he said basic rates rose by an average of 18 percent in 1987 and 
115 percent in 1988 the first two years since deregulation but he 
said operators are apt to limit future rises because of public and 
congressional concern over dergulated cable rates 
nielsen media research estimated that 538 percent of the 904 
million american television households subscribed to cable last 
november 
kupinski said although the easy subscriber growth from wiring 
the nation is behind the industry operators should be able to 
expand the number of subscribers further with more aggressive 
marketing 
kupinski said advertising on cable systems rose 41 percent to 
230 million in 1987 from the previous year and said cables low 
cost relative to commercial television improved ratings and its 
attractive audience makeup should push ad revenue up 25 percent a 
year to nearly 1 billion by 1993 
on the downside the analysts say are uncertainty about whether 
the former bell system telephone copmpanies will be allowed to 
compete in the cable business creating more competition for cable 
systems 
they also said it is uncertain whether a consumer backlash over 
higher rates will prompt congress to require some of the bigger 
multisystem owners to divest some of their holdings 
but kupinski noted even if size limits on cable companies were 
introduced cable companies would be expected to seek acquaitions 
concentrating on properties near existing operations

a federal judge has dismissed charges 
holding unisys corp responsible for a predecessors actions but 
retained the case against the original firm sperry corp and a 
retired air force colonel according to documents filed tuesday 
the charges against unisys were dismissed by the us district 
court in montgomery ala dec 29 two months after unisys and 
sperry were indicted 
the government alleged the former sperry federal information 
systems division had falsely billed the government for 501600 for 
work that was never performed as part of a eightyear 526 million 
contract to modernize the air forces computer network 
us district judge joel dubina left intact the indictment 
against sperry and retired ar force col robert l hedges 51 of 
montgomery who oversaw the computer project for the air force 
before his retirement in 1984 
assistant us attorney al agricola said federal prosecutors were 
unsure how to prosecute sperry because the company no longer exists 
having been absorbed in a 1986 merger with burroughs corp 
the court noted that although unisys will not be held liable for 
sperrys actions the company may have to pay fines 
hedges is charged with negotiating a consulting job with sperry 
while he was overseeing the contract from gunter air force base in 
montgomery according to us attorney jim wilson 
hedges who was under contract to unisys at the time of the 
indictment is no longer employed by the company according to 
company officials 
unisys spokeswoman charlotte legates said the corporation was 
gratified that the court confirmed the important distinction 
between unisys and a predecessor company in connection with events 
that preceded the merger 
a copy of the courts opinion dismissing the unisys charges was 
filed tuesday with the securities and exchange commission according 
to legates 
in this case unisys corp which was not even formed until 
over two years after the alleged criminal conduct could not be 
culpable therefore and thus should not be held criminally 
liable the judge ruled 
the judge said sperry was incorporated in delaware and under the 
laws of that state sperry would survive the merger for purposes 
of pending criminal actions 
legates said company officials were unclear as to the amount of 
fines and whether unisys would have to pay a fine levied against 
sperry 
she said unisys would continue to contest the federal charges 
but rod nachman a montgomery attorney representing unisys said 
dubinas order closes the case as far as his client 
agricola said the statute of limitations has expired in the case 
and no new indictments can be issued he said sperry has not been 
arraigned and no trial date has been set

wrapping up a 2month labor racketeering trial 
a federal prosecutor argued tuesday that teamsters union president 
jackie presser and two associates embezzled 700000 to pay 
friends or cronies who did no union work 
in closing arguments to jurors in us district court prosecutor 
stephen jigger stressed the role of pressers associates in the 
alleged embezzlement scheme presser died in july more than two 
years after his indictment in the case 
harold friedman a teamsters international vice president and 
ohios most powerful teamster and anthony hughes teamsters local 
507 recording secretary have been on trial since oct 24 
an attorney for friedman argued that his client is a dedicated 
labor leader who would not participate in such a scheme 
the defense would have you believe all this was jackie 
pressers responsibility jigger said poor powerless harold 
friedman living in the fear of jackie presser i submit to you that 
the evidence in this case indicates not only what jackie presser did 
but also what harold friedman and anthony hughes did 
the trial included testimony from 80 witnesses many of whom were 
asked detailed questions about daytoday teamsters operations 
pretrial documents included revelations about pressers role as 
an fbi informant saying he provided the bureau with information 
about the union and alleged links to organized crime 
presser was the fourth of the last five teamsters international 
presidents to be indicted he had inherited the job from roy 
williams when williams was sent to prison for conspiring to bribe a 
us senator 
but his declining health caused repeated postponements of the 
trial and his death from brain cancer left only friedman and hughes 
as codefendants 
friedman 66 is charged with two counts of labor racketeering 
two of embezzlement and two of filing false reports with the labor 
department he is president of the ohio conference of teamsters 
leader of teamsters joint council 41 in northeast ohio and president 
of both teamsters local 507 and bakery workers local 19 in cleveland 
hughes 52 is charged with two counts of labor racketeering and 
one of embezzlement the government contends hughes was a ghost 
employee at bakery workers local 19 which is affiliated with 
teamsters local 507 and shares an office with it 
the case will go to the jury after closing arguments are 
completed and us district judge george w white issues 
instructions on the law 
the evidence demonstrates abuse of union office by harold 
friedman anthony hughes and jackie presser for the benefit of their 
friends and cronies in the amount of 700000 jigger said 
during the trial friedman testified that presser had 
unquestioned power at teamsters local 507 in cleveland where he 
served as secretarytreasurer even while he was international 
president 
defense lawyer paul cambria representing friedman said in his 
closing statement that friedman puts in long hours of work for his 
members and that his participation in a scheme to embezzle members 
money just doesnt make any sense 
i ask you not to be misled cambria said you must 
determine whether my client was a thief jackie presser is gone 
whether it had a lot to do with him or not is another story my 
client is on trial not jackie presser 
friedman said presser hired john a jack nardi jr and george 
argie who were portrayed by the prosecution as ghost employees 
who did no union work 
now he friedman would have you believe all that power resided 
in a dead man and that he was a powerless subordinate jigger 
said you cant blame jackie presser when its your job your 
responsibility and you knew it 
jigger reviewed the testimony of three of the alleged ghost 
employees allen friedman no relation to harold friedman argie 
and nardi each testified he was paid and did little work if any 
the defense contended that nardi and argie were hired by presser 
and did whatever he wanted them to do that hughes worked and that 
allen friedman often was too ill to work 
jigger noted that nardi was the son of a reputed organizedcrime 
figure in cleveland with labor union ties that argie was a known 
gambling figure and a hughes acquaintance and that allen friedman 
was jackie pressers uncle 
john r climaco pressers former attorney has said that 
pressers defense had he lived to stand trial would have been that 
the fbi authorized him to hire the ghost employees to enhance 
and protect his status as an fbi informant 
but government prosecutors contend presser couldnt have been 
authorized to hire ghost employees because they were working as 
early as 1972 and presser didnt become an fbi informant until 1977 
harold friedmans attorney said last week that presser was a 
government informant in 1963 
the prosecution called former fbi agent robert s friedrick who 
was pressers contact at the agency but he was jailed for contempt 
of court after refusing to testify

residential resources mortgage investments corp 
a real estate investment trust filed for reorganization under 
federal bankruptcy laws tuesday and announced the resignations of 
its top officers 
the filing under chapter 11 of the federal bankrupty code allows 
residential resources to reorganize its finances while being 
protected from creditors claims 
the firm which went public in late june ran short of cash 
because of rising interest rates and shackles imposed under certain 
loan agreements according to a statement issued by morgenwalke 
associates a public relations firm representing residential 
resources 
the release said residential resources fell 13 million behind in 
the collateral requirements of one lender and suffered a 6 million 
loss when another lender sold part of the collateral for its loan 
agreements with residential resources 
edward nebb a morgenwalke employee declined to identify the 
lenders 
all of residential resources top executives have resigned and 
the company is being run by an outside board of directors nebb said 
the firms officers were chairman and president james c 
marshall vice president joseph m corrigan and chief financial 
officer roger f mcmahon 
residential resources stock was traded on the american stock 
exchange based on mondays price of about 750 per share 
residential resources was worth about 50 million however the 
washingtonbased national association of real estate investment 
trusts said the firm had a book value of 800 million with 
shareholders equity worth 68 million 
a real estate investment trust or reit is an investment vehicle 
in which small investors participate in a portfolio of real estate 
assets managed by a trust such as residential resources 
residential resources sidestepped the usual investment pattern 
for a real estate trust firm said chris lucas of the association 
lucas said the arizona company had invested in the residual 
interest in collateralized mortgage obligations and the equally 
risky principalonly mortgagebacked securities 
they did a lot of different things than even the reits that 
invest in cmoresiduals do and residential resources has been much 
more highly leveraged than most cmoresidual reits he said 
cmos are bonds secured by collateral on pools of home mortgages 
they are a volatile instrument lucas said potentially 
they return big yields but along with that comes a higher risk
