bostons top federal prosecutor announced friday 
he would not file criminal charges against senate president william 
bulger after a 2year investigation but he hinted broadly that 
corruption persists in massachusetts 
outgoing us attorney jeremiah osullivan as one of his last 
official acts told a crowded news conference that he had decided 
not to indict bulger or his associate boston attorney thomas 
finnerty who was accused of extortion in a development project 
there is simply not sufficient evidence to ask a grand jury to 
indict either of these two individuals for violation of the federal 
extortion statute or the federal tax laws osullivan said 
after a twomonth review of a 2yearlong federal 
investigation osullivan said the final decision was not a close 
call based on the admissible evidence in the exhaustively 
researched case the review had been ordered by us attorney 
general dick thornburgh 
but in reply to reporters questions osullivan indicated his 
personal belief that the development business is rife with tactics 
that are questionable although not indictable 
powerbrokering is not necessarily a federal crime he said 
at another point osullivan said the tactics involve 
influencepeddling 
the decision by osullivan helps lift a cloud of suspicion from 
bulger one of the states most powerful politicians who was 
rocked by allegations made by boston landlord and developer harold 
brown in a civil suit 
in a civil suit filed in suffolk superior court brown charged 
that finnerty a longtime associate and law partner of bulger 
extorted 500000 from him by suggesting that he could hamper 
governmental approval of an office building development in boston 
unless he was cut in on the deal 
brown accused bulger of benefiting from the payoff 
bulger and finnerty denounced those allegations but bulger has 
largely refrained from defending himself in public an aide said 
the senate president would make no comment on the prosecutors 
decision not to press charges 
brown who pleaded guilty in 1986 to bribing a city hall 
official to expedite another of his projects was apparently the 
governments key witness in the case osullivan said brown may 
have sincerely believed finnerty was trying to extort him but the 
prosecutor said the criminal issue was finnertys actions not 
browns perceptions

an agriculture department survey shows that 
farmers intend to boost corn plantings this spring with easier 
federal curbs and higher market prices helping them bounce back 
from last years drought 
the survey announced on friday showed that farmers intend to 
plant 733 million acres to corn up 8 percent from last year 
soybean plantings are expected to rise 5 percent from 1988 to 617 
million acres 
officials said the report was based on an annual us survey of 
about 65000 farmers in early march increases from last year were 
also indicated for grain sorghum wheat including winter durum 
and other spring varieties tobacco dry edible beans and sweet 
potatoes 
farmers indicated they would plant fewer acres this year of 
oats hay cotton rice and peanuts 
if farmers follow through with their plans the corn acreage 
would be the most since 767 million acres were planted for the 
1986 crop in 1985 plantings reached 834 million acres 
the planted corn acreage dropped to 602 million acres in 1983 
another year of severe drought 
last year of the 676 million acres planted 581 million were 
harvested for grain yielding 492 billion bushels down 30 percent 
from the 1987 crop average yields dropped to 846 bushels per acre 
from a record of 1194 bushels in 1987 
there was no indication of 1988 production in the report winter 
wheat output will be indicated by the usda for the first time on 
may 11 and corn figures in august along with soybeans cotton and 
other springplanted crops 
total wheat plantings for this years harvest was indicated at 
743 million acres up by more than 13 percent from last year 
winter wheat was reported at 547 million acres up 12 per cent 
durum 386 million up 16 percent and other springplanted wheat 
157 million acres up 17 percent 
officials cautioned that the actual acreage planted by farmers 
this spring may vary from intentions because of the effects of 
weather availability of production inputs changes in market 
conditions prior to planting and the impact of the usda report 
itself 
with production cut by last years drought market prices of 
grains and soybeans rose sharply the usda also relaxed 
acreagereduction requirements under wheat and feed grains programs 
for 1989 
preliminary price figures for march showed on thursday that the 
average farm price of wheat was 416 per bushel up from 274 a 
year ago corn was reported at 261 against 186 in march 1988 
and soybeans were 757 per bushel compared with 605 a year 
earlier 
other crops included in the survey report 
cotton plantings 11 million acres down 12 percent from 1988 
sorghum 118 million acres up 14 percent 
barley 962 million acres down 1 percent 
oats 132 million acres down 5 percent 
hay 631 million acres down 4 percent 
rice 286 million acres down 2 percent

former white house aide oliver l norths 
defense that he carried out administration orders by covering up 
his work for the nicaraguan contras was crippled when a federal 
judge refused to compel former president reagan to testify 
in denying a request to call reagan as a defense witness in 
norths trial us district judge gerhard a gesell said friday he 
couldnt find any evidence that the former president authorized 
norths activities 
the trial record presently contains no proof that defendant 
north ever received any authorization from president reagan to 
engage in the illegal conduct alleged either directly or 
indirectly orally or in writing gesell wrote in a fivepage 
order 
nothing there even remotely supports an authorization claim 
gesell said 
reagan in los angeles where he now lives said friday he had 
been determined to fight any attempts to force him to testify 
i made up my mind i wasnt going reagan told kesqtv i 
think it would have set a precedent that the next president doesnt 
have a right to impose on other presidents no president has ever 
been subpoenaed 
reagan would have been the first former president to be 
compelled to testify in a criminal proceeding concerning his 
conduct while in office had gesell agreed to make him appear 
the defense is scheduled to begin presenting its case monday 
the seventh week of norths trial defense attorney barry simon 
refused to identify the first witness 
the prosecution had put on 29 witnesses and on friday the judge 
denied a defense motion to dismiss remaining counts against north 
the defense argues that north was simply following reagans 
orders when he lied to congress in 1985 and 1986 about the national 
security councils involvement in helping the nicaraguan contras 
norths attorneys had subpoenaed reagan so they could ask him 
what he knew about the nscs role in raising money for the contras 
at a time congress had barred us military assistance to the 
rebels 
the 12count indictment against north accuses him of obstructing 
congress and making false statements in connection with letters he 
drafted and a meeting with house intelligence committee members 
the judge said he reached his decision about reagans testimony 
after studying the trial record thousands of pages of classified 
and unclassified documents portions of reagans personal diaries 
and written answers reagan provided to the grand jury 
gesell said no presidential privilege prevented him from 
ordering the former president to testify but the defense failed to 
prove reagans testimony was crucial to provide north a fair trial 
theodore b olson reagans personal attorney said he was 
pleased with the order simon declined comment 
the justice department had opposed reagans court appearance on 
the grounds it could have opened the door for questioning about 
sensitive national security matters 
gesell acknowledged there is understandable public interest 
in what reagan may have known or may have done but he said 
norths trial does not involve such a broad inquiry 
he noted that three conspiracy charges against north involving 
presidential matters had been dropped 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras

the bush administration is diverting 5 
million from aids research prevention and education programs so 
states can continue providing the costly drug azt to aids patients 
who cannot afford it 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said the 
action friday hours before the federal azt program expired was in 
response to a request from sen edward kennedy dmass and other 
senators 
but sullivan said that while he agreed with the compassionate 
purpose of the transfer a series of onetime appropriations 
is not the most desirable way to address the issue of support for 
purchase of aids drugs 
the funds which sullivan said are being diverted from aids 
research prevention and education should continue the program for 
six months the administration says federal support for aids 
research prevention and treatment will exceed 21 billion this 
fiscal year which ends sept 30 
nearly 7000 of the estimated 30000 aids victims using azt are 
receiving the drug under the program created by congress in 1987 
and extended for six months last september 
the drug which has been shown to extend the lives of many aids 
patients costs about 8000 a year when taken at full dosage it 
is currently the only drug approved by the government to treat 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
kennedy who spearheaded the drive to continue the temporary 
grants for state azt programs commended sullivan and the bush 
administration for recognizing the urgency of the situation and 
moving so quickly to avert a gap in this lifesaving program 
georgia and kansas had already run out of federal funds 
allocated to them under the program and idaho kentucky and utah 
were due to run out friday according to the human rights campaign 
fund an aids patient advocacy group 
programs in other states including texas and california which 
account for about onethird of all those in the program were due 
to run out of federal funds by the end of june other states have 
enough money to last through august 
carlton lee of the human rights campaign fund said that while 
we dont want to see the money come from already existing aids 
efforts we believe the financial crisis faced by so many people 
with aids is urgent enough to warrant such measures 
kennedy had tried to get a bill to extend the program through 
september approved in the senate two weeks ago before lawmakers 
left for the easter recess but the measure was blocked in a 
parliamentary move 
in a letter tuesday kennedy sen orrin hatch rutah and 11 
other senators called on sullivan to transfer 5 million in aids 
funds to the azt program 
they said hhs had been authorized by congress in september to 
redirect 15 million to the program but had provided only 10 
million they said congress had intended that the entire amount be 
redirected 
when congress agreed to extend the program last september 
giving final approval only hours before the program was to expire 
the manufacturer of azt burroughs wellcome co agreed to provide 
5 million worth of the drug free 
kennedy plans to introduce legislation this year that would 
address the issue of care for aids patients and end the haphazard 
bandaid approach to provision of drugs such as azt to patients 
a kennedy aide said 
medicaid covers about 40 percent of people with aids and 
medicare covers about 3 percent but many lowincome people with 
aids dont qualify for either program according to the human 
rights campaign fund also many private health insurance plans 
dont cover the drug or dont cover its entire cost the group said

the federal communications commission is being 
forced to review its policy of favoring minorities in the sale of 
distressed radio and tv stations because a court says the 
program is unconstitutional 
the fccs 1978 distress sale rules which allow quick sales 
at reduced rates of defunct or disenfranchised stations to blacks 
hispanics and other minorities violate the equal protection 
provisions of the fifth amendment to the constitution a federal 
appeals court said friday 
the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in a 21 
vote overturned a purchase after a hartford conn broadcaster 
said he should have been able to try to buy a station being offered 
in a distress sale 
the ruling is at odds with congress which in december 1987 
refused with thenpresident reagan concurring to allow the fcc 
to consider changing the policy 
the fcc had said it wanted to review the policy after the 
appeals court in 1986 rejected a sale based on the agencys 
comparative preference program of giving special treatment to 
women seeking fm station licenses 
but after congress acted the fcc voted 30 in february 1988 to 
reaffirm the distress sale and female preference policies 
it was not clear friday how the commission would react to the 
latest remand 
fcc commissioner patricia diaz dennis said she strongly 
supported minority entry into broadcasting and that the court had 
struck down a program mandated by congress we are now between 
the proverbial rock and a hard place she said 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick also said he supported ensuring 
minority participation in broadcasting but also that race alone 
should not control the licensing of broadcast stations 
the media access center which filed a friendofthecourt brief 
in the case said the fcc policy had worked well and the court 
made a mistake 
andrew schwartzman the centers executive director said we 
expect that congress or the supreme court will reinstate the fccs 
policy 
the fcc in 1984 denied alan shurberg and shurberg broadcasting a 
chance to compete for the purchase of whcttv in hartford from the 
stations owner 
the fcc also affirmed that a rival for the hartford station 
astroline communications company limited partnership was a 
minority enterprise and not a sham as shurberg contended 
the appeals court friday said the fcc policy did not meet 
previous supreme court tests of minority setaside programs 
including one that preferences be given to minorities only after 
raceneutral efforts to increase minority ownership had failed 
the distress sale policy is not narrowly tailored to remedy 
past discrimination and it provides no procedures for ensuring 
that the policys beneficiaries have actually suffered from the 
effects of past discrimination judge laurence h silberman said 
in the majority opinion 
chief judge patricia m wald dissented saying the distress sale 
policy legally worked to ensure diversity in programming and 
ownership and that it was narrowly tailored to address the 
critical entry barriers to minority participation in media 
ownership while imposing only minimal burdens on innocent third 
parties 
shurberg speaking by phone from hartford said he was 
delighted with the courts ruling

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev on his 
first visit to cuba on sunday may seek to defuse conflicts in 
central america and tell fidel castro the kremlin is weary of 
financing cuban adventurism 
both soviet and western analysts interviewed in moscow predict 
the reformist soviet leader will be outwardly friendly toward the 
doctrinaire cuban president but they expect gorbachev to use the 
island as a platform for a major speech signaling his desire for a 
peaceful settlement of regional strife 
president bush has urged gorbachev to use his influence with 
nicaragua to further peace efforts 
we would like to see the soviet union withdraw their resources 
and support in nicaragua white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said thursday 
in a speech in atlanta secretary of state james a baker iii 
urged the soviets to show signs of new thinking in central 
america he said the region was not a dumping ground for arms 
and failed ideologies of outsiders 
gorbachevs fourday visit to havana to be preceded by a brief 
stop sunday in ireland and followed by a visit to britain for talks 
with prime minister margaret thatcher and queen elizabeth ii had 
been set for december after addressing the united nations and 
meeting ronald reagan and george bush in new york however 
gorbachev broke off his trip and flew home after the devastating 
earthquake in soviet armenia 
we are not going to worsen our relations with cuba one 
soviet specialist on latin american affairs said of the visit to 
havana but gorbachev is a very persuasive man and he will try to 
explain his intentions 
the expert said gorbachev will inform castro that moscow is no 
longer interested in financing class struggle and wars of national 
liberation abroad 
castro who just celebrated the 30th anniversary of the cuban 
revolution has supported armed struggle not only in latin america 
but in africa as well 
after years of backing leftist forces in angola cuban troops 
recently began a withdrawal from southern africa as part of a 
sovietbacked negotiated settlement between cuba angola and south 
africa 
a senior western analyst who like the soviet expert spoke on 
condition of anonymity said gorbachev also is likely to tell 
castro privately that the kremlin cant afford to subsidize cubas 
economy indefinitely 
castro has been protected from his mistakes by soviet aid 
the western diplomat said citing us calculations that soviet 
economic assistance account for perhaps 20 percent of cubas gross 
national product 
while gorbachevs program of perestroika seeks to decentralize 
the communistcontrolled economy open markets and create financial 
incentives for improved production castros correction of 
errors campaign has clamped tighter government controls on 
production while shutting down peasants markets and seeking to 
eradicate pay differences among workers 
castros determination to follow communist doctrine in the face 
of widespread evidence that his islands economy is in shambles 
prompted the western analyst to observe its easy to talk about 
ideological purity when somebody else is paying for it 
us sources say there already have been substantial reductions 
in soviet aid to cuba as evidenced in the marked decline in the 
purchase of sugar which the soviet union buys from cuba at prices 
substantially higher than world market levels as a form of subsidy 
the soviet union has embarked on a major overhaul of its own 
ailing economy and has taken steps to extract itself from regional 
conflicts that have drained its resources while threatening to blow 
up into superpower confrontation 
gorbachev announced to the united nations on dec 7 his plan to 
pare a halfmillion men from the soviet armed forces withdraw 
thousands of tanks and other offensive military units from eastern 
europe and ease tensions on the chinese border by drawing down 
soviet forces in mongolia 
the kremlin completed its promised military withdrawal from 
afghanistan on feb 15 three weeks later it entered talks with 
the west in search of a negotiated reduction of all conventional 
forces in europe 
but soviet intentions are less clear in centeral america where 
the sandinista government in nicaragua continues to receive 
substantial soviet military aid much of it channeled through cuba 
and salvadoran rebels press their civil war with east bloc 
weaponry 
the united states meanwhile has backed the salvadoran 
government and contra guerrillas in nicaragua 
central america the western diplomat noted is one of the 
last remaining really hot regional conflicts outside the middle 
east in which theres a strong superpower presence 
in his address to the united nations gorbachev rejected the 
use or threat of force as an instrument of foreign policy 
calling instead for new world order based on universal human 
consensus and respect for individual differences 
as the world asserts its diversity he said attempts to 
look down on others and to teach them ones own brand of democracy 
become totally improper to say nothing of the fact that democratic 
values intended for export often very quickly lose their worth 
adhering to that policy gorbachev is unlikely to lecture castro 
on how to run his own country but it remains to be seen how much 
the soviet union is prepared to subsidize cubas longstanding 
deficit economy

telephone users will be charged less for their 
interstate phone calls starting today as a result of rate 
reductions by american telephone amp telegraph co and mci 
communications corp 
atampt said friday its interstate longdistance rates will drop by 
6375 million annually for a 19 percent overall reduction in its 
residential and small business prices mci communications corp 
said thursday it would cut its rates by 200 million a year 
starting today 
the cuts represent a passalong to customers of savings that 
result from a federal communications commission order that local 
companies cut the charges to the longdistance carriers for 
connecting with local phone systems 
the local companies had proposed a 489 million cut but the fcc 
ordered them last week to cut back by 705 million 
but the savings also reflect a 30cent increase in the charge 
that customers pay to help maintain the local telephone networks 
that increase is effective today as well 
and while most longdistance rates will go down under the new 
rates prices for basic longdistance calls under 292 miles will 
increase an average of 45 percent thats a change from atampts 
proposed 47 percent price increase in february 
also daytime price cuts will be larger than evening price cuts 
42 percent and 07 percent respectively and nightweekend prices 
will drop 03 percent 
consumer groups had complained in february that atampt was not 
cutting prices significantly in the night and weekend longdistance 
time periods used by residential customers while making big cuts 
in the highly competitive daytime arena 
under the new atampt rates 
basic longdistance prices will drop an average 19 percent 
rates for atampt wats calls will drop an average 39 percent 
pro wats rates will drop an average 39 percent 
atampt megacom wats rates will drop 11 percent and atampt megacom 
800 prices will be 52 percent lower 
reach out america will drop an average 26 percent 
basic atampt 800 service down 09 percent 800 readyline 
service down 33 percent beginning july 1 atampt 800 service will 
be billed according to distance and there will be additional price 
reductions of 19 percent for 800 service and 2 percent for 800 
readyline 
software defined network service prices will decline an average 
61 percent

roses are red violets are blue 
or are they 
philosophers from around the country will gather in ann arbor 
next week to discuss whether color is only in the eye of the 
beholder 
the eighth annual colloquium in philosophy april 67 at the 
university of michigan will include presentations by professors 
from princeton syracuse and nebraska universities as well as 
michigan 
whats at issue is whether we have color in the world in the 
same way that we have shape in the world said stephen l 
darwall the philosophy department chairman at michigan 
when it comes to color philosophers tend to fall into two camps 
some argue that colors have an objective existence independent 
of our perception of them darwall said 
others argue that color is an illusion that an objects 
characteristics cause it to reflect light a certain way making 
people believe they are seeing a certain color he added 
the question of color is recognized as a primary element in the 
debate between philosophers supporting a realistic outlook and 
their counterparts advocating an antirealist point of view 
darwall said 
its a litmus test for different philosophical points of 
view darwall said of the color clash 
not much is expected to be resolved at the conference darwall 
said 
its not the case in philosophy that we get discoveries that 
are recognized instantly by all credible philosophers he said

washington state on friday became 
americas 36th state with a presidential primary setting up hopes 
for a regional set of primaries that would attract candidates to 
the pacific northwest 
the senate voted 38 to 10 for an initiative submitted by the 
people after the legislature had balked for years at the idea of 
eliminating the states muchmaligned caucus system of choosing 
national convention delegates 
as drafted the legislation would enable washington to join 
oregon idaho and montana on the date oregon uses the fourth 
tuesday in may 
supporters of the measure said evangelist pat robertsons 
victory in last springs caucuses embarrassed the state into 
accepting a primary washington usually seen as a moderate 
politically progressive state carried the nations largest 
robertson delegation to the national gop convention in new orleans 
last august 
the measure already had cleared the house by an even greater 
margin since gov booth gardners signature was not required 
initiative 99 was delivered directly to the secretary of state 
minutes after passage 
champagne corks popped at an impromptu celebration staged by 
secretary of state ralph munro a longterm sponsor who exulted 
its finally over 
the state will have a primary every presidential year beginning 
in 1992 
oregon is toying with changes in its primary date and theres 
no definite agreement for a fourstate super tuesday but the 
washington legislation gives the secretary of state flexibility to 
set a mutually agreeable date

soviet authorities have released hundreds of 
dissidents from confinement but at least 100 remain in prisons 
labor camps and psychiatric hospitals amnesty international 
reported 
the group released its latest soviet human rights report on 
friday two days after the world psychiatry associations executive 
committee voted to readmit a soviet organization 
many psychiatrists in that association were reported opposed to 
the decision which must be approved by its general assembly later 
this year however amnesty officials declined comment on that vote 
the human rights organization said it had asked to speak with 
soviet officials about the cases during the threeday visit of 
president mikhail s gorbachev to britain which begins wednesday 
they said they had received no response 
amnesty also said in its report that soviet citizens still could 
be prosecuted for exercising free speech or religion 
although there has been much improvement and discussion of 
human rights in the soviet union and the rhetoric of human rights 
will no doubt dominate next weeks visit the reality is that there 
are still serious human rights concerns there said marie 
staunton director of the groups british section 
she and the coordinator for soviet affairs mick venables spoke 
to reporters about amnesty internationals most recent briefing 
paper on soviet human rights dated march 1989 
it says amnesty international knows of at least 100 prisoners 
known or thought to be dissidents including 25 in psychiatric 
hospitals but that 300 have been freed since 1987 
although some prisoners have been transferred to better 
facilities since 1987 those still in labor camps and prisons are 
kept on monotonous meager rations with only rudimentary medical 
care and have to meet excessively high work targets often 
involving heavy physical labor the report said 
venables added there has been no major improvement in the 
condition of prisoners cruelty and degrading treatment still 
continues 
psychiatric patients are given unnecessary drugs a treatment 
meted out as a form of intimidation he said 
most of the 100 prisoners are people who tried to emigrate 
without permission or conscientious objectors to mandatory military 
service amnesty said it said others are held for violating laws 
that restrict freedom of expression religion assembly and 
association 
it welcomed elements of the new soviet criminal code that 
recognize international rights agreements abolish internal exile 
and reduce the number of capital crimes from 18 to six

the 1988 presidential campaign of sen bob

corporate contributions that were channeled through individuals 
dole rkan issued a statement friday saying the fbi had 
contacted him last week asking assistance in an investigation and 
that he has ordered the filing of a complaint with the federal 
election commission 
the complaint will ask the commission for advice on who should 
receive refunds of such contributions to the dole for president

the federal home loan mortgage corp is 
changing some mortgage rules to help some homeowners to get rid of 
their private mortgage insurance earlier 
when a home buyer puts less than 20 percent down on a house the 
agency known as freddie mac requires the buyer to get mortgage 
insurance to guarantee mortgage payments 
but the insurance fee boosts the monthly payment required until 
the homebuyer builds up equity representing 20 percent of the 
homes value 
previously freddie mac required that a mortgage be held at 
least seven years before the insurance could be lifted even if the 
value of the home soars and the owners equity rises above 80 
percent 
under the change announced friday the insurance can be lifted 
in two to five years depending on circumstances and provided that 
mortgage payments have been made on time

its longtroubled public housing program or face the potential loss

real estate tycoon donald trump is taking 
control of striketorn eastern airlines northeast shuttle and 
some union officials say the sale of the rest of the carrier is a 
foregone conclusion 
trump announced late friday that he had completed a restructured 
deal to buy the threecity shuttle for 365 million the same price 
he agreed to pay in october in a tentative accord with texas air 
corp easterns parent but the final deal gives trump four more 
boeing 727s for a total of 21 
easterns unions which have crippled the airline by honoring a 
strike by its machinists union since march 4 have made the 
purchase of eastern a priority in their battle against texas air 
chairman frank lorenzo 
some union officials said friday the shuttle deal and signs that 
a group led by former baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth 
might still try to buy the rest of eastern could indicate the 
carriers sale is inevitable 
the unions long have claimed that lorenzo whom they revile as 
a union buster has been trying to strip eastern of its assets and 
funnel them to sister company continental airlines a nonunion 
carrier 
before and since eastern filed for bankruptcy protection march 
9 the unions vigorously have opposed any separate auctions of 
eastern assets such as planes airport gates and landing rights 
the recent talks could indicate a sale is likely and that it 
would be a single deal for the entire airline minus the shuttle 
the unions say 
i believe that eastern visavis frank lorenzo is now in a 
sale mode thats what we would favor said skip stokes a 
spokesman for the air line pilots association 
a used 727 fetches 45 million to 6 million indicating trump 
was getting 18 million to 24 million more in assets for the same 
price 
i am delighted to complete this transaction and very much look 
forward to building an airline that provides superior service for 
all consumers trump said friday 
the agreement still must be approved by the federal bankruptcy 
court in new york where eastern is reorganizing under protection 
from creditors the trump organization said it hoped to close the 
deal within 60 days 
this agreement proves that the value of easterns assets 
remains high and continues to be attractive to various parties 
eastern president phil bakes said 
the pilots union which has been highly critical of lorenzo 
also expressed approval of the deal 
the money that mr lorenzo gets for the shuttle has to come 
here to eastern airlines thats a positive said stokes 
before the strike the shuttle serving new york boston and 
washington was easterns only profitable operation 
trump had agreed to pay 365 million for the eastern shuttle in 
october in a tentative accord with texas air but last week he 
sought to cut the price by a third because the continuing strike by 
easterns machinists supported by its pilots and flight 
attendants had eroded the shuttles value as eastern passengers 
started switching to the rival pan am shuttle 
texas air countered by telling trump it would look for other 
buyers and america west airlines an aggressive phoenixbased 
regional carrier expressed interest 
trump said he still planned to recognize the eastern unions as 
bargaining representatives for trump shuttle employees as in his 
october accord and to negotiate separate labor agreements with the 
shuttle workers 
we have absolutely great relations with all three unions he 
said

buoyed by support from key arab leaders 
president hosni mubarak leaves for washington today to tell us 
officials they must move quickly to persuade israel to talk to the 
plo egyptian officials said 
the fourday us visit mubaraks seventh since taking office 
in 1981 follows six weeks of intensive diplomatic exchanges 
initiated by the egyptian leader the activity brought leaders from 
the soviet union israel jordan saudi arabia and the palestine 
liberation organization to egypt 
mubarak will meet with president bush on monday 
mubarak is carrying to the united states for the first time a 
unified arab position for the achievement of arabisraeli peace 
said a senior government official speaking on condition of 
anonymity this gives egypt greater credibility 
the unified position was forged in mubaraks egyptian talks 
during the past week with jordans king hussein plo leader yasser 
arafat and king fahd of saudi arabia 
the official said mubarak will argue a need for speedy movement 
by the united states to persuade israel to accept an international 
peace conference and negotiations with the plo 
israel fears it would be pressured into concessions as a result 
of such a conference and it rejects arafats group as terrorists 
the conference under un auspices would group parties to the 
conflict including the plo and the permanent members of the un 
security council the united states the soviet union britain 
france and china 
the egyptian official also said mubarak and his arab backers 
would like to see bush use his influence with israel to convene an 
international conference before the end of this year 
us ambassador frank wisner in prepared remarks for the local 
media on mubaraks visit dampened hopes for quick breakthrough as 
a result of us efforts 
it will not be easy to arrive at quick results the us 
diplomat said what we should do is build confidence to bring the 
parties to the negotiating table 
he seemed to be referring to a desire by washington for 
reciprocal moves by israel and the plo to stop violence in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza stip a palestinian uprising in 
those territories has killed more than 415 palestinians and 18 
israelis since it began in december 1987 
mubaraks washington talks also will deal with us economic and 
military aid to egypt and ways of easing cairos foreign debt 
burden 
the united states has held up 230 million in cash aid for egypt 
in 1988 and 1989 saying egypt failed to adopt significant 
economic reforms 
mubarak says he agrees on the need for economic reforms but 
disagrees with the united states on the pace of such steps he 
fears austerity measures might trigger street violence 
egypts foreign debt totals about 44 billion

a dentist has been sentenced to 30 
months probation for forgery in a bizarre case involving a dead 
man whose mummified remains were tended by his family for nine 
years 
knox county judge daniel roberts opted for probation for richard 
kunce 57 who lived for two years with the family of the dead man 
carl stevens states attorney ray kimbell had recommended a 
threeyear prison term 
kunce who has lost his license to practice dentistry was 
convicted recently of witnessing a forgery of stevens signature 
which was placed on a document by the widow carole stevens 
the judge noted at thursdays hearing that mrs stevens was 
sentenced to 24 months of probation after she pleaded guilty to two 
counts of forgery in the case last year 
during the hearing both sides recalled how carl stevens body 
was tended by his family and kunce as if he were still alive 
stevens a diabetic died in 1979 after joining a holistic 
health cult and halting his daily insulin injections in january 
1988 authorities discovered his body in the stevens home 
kunce lived at the home from summer 1986 until the body was 
discovered 
kimbell argued that kunce should be given a stiff sentence 
because he harmed mrs stevens two teenage children by promoting 
the strange idea that stevens was alive as his mummified corpse 
remained in the home 
kunce said he signed as a witness to the 1984 document that gave 
mrs stevens her husbands power of attorney because she wanted to 
refinance her home 
kunce said his immediate plans are to return to corpus christi 
texas to live with his sister and perhaps teach nutrition or 
practice dentistry if he can renew his license 
ive got to get on with my life he said i think ill 
start by going fishing

it wasnt exactly a country outing but 57 girl 
scouts went on a camping trip very few people will ever top 
they camped out friday night on the 86th floor of the empire 
state building and even got a late night visit from movie monster 
king kong known for his climb up the landmark edifice when it was 
still the worlds tallest 
although a cloudy evening obscured usually spectacular nighttime 
views of manhattan the girls didnt seem to mind as they played 
games sang songs pledged allegiance to the flag and recited the 
girl scout promise 
and the girls mostly from the citys boroughs of queens and 
brooklyn were oblivious to the rainy busy streets 1050 feet 
below as they arranged sleeping bags and blankets for the night 
some people are bothered by ants and other bugs on camping 
excursions but 9yearold lenata bristow was unconcerned by the 
insectlike things she saw 
i looked down and everything looked like bugs she said as 
she looked out of an 80thfloor window before the girls went up to 
the 86thfloor observatory 
stephine knight 9 presented an urban perspective on the merits 
of sleeping high up in the 102story building that would be lost on 
people whose idea of camping out is a bit more down to earth 
out in the country when we went one time we could get lost 
she said its nice here and its a big place its exciting 
the idea to camp out high in the empire state building was the 
rev frank rafters hes been the unofficial chaplain of the 
empire state building since the mid1960s the building opened in 
1931 
the nearest campgrounds for girl scouts he said are in new 
jersey and the citys staten island borough so he approached the 
buildings officials they agreed to an annual november trip for 
boy scouts and a yearly march outing for the girl scouts 
the idea is for the girls from different troops to make new 
friends and learn that whether theyre black white green blue or 
whatever theyre all americans rafter said 
the hike to the campsite consisted of a leisurely stroll 
around the lobby as rafter led a tour of the first floor 
but getting to the top of the campsite could be daunting 
9yearold shunte jones pointed out 
in the elevator it felt like my stomach was dropping and my 
ears stopped up she said 
for those who might think the girls are being deprived of a true 
camping experience troop leader kathy waszak was quick to point 
out the girls often camp outdoors in more sylvan settings 
waszak recalled how a freak snowstorm nearly buried the girls in 
their sleeping bags in brewster ny in october 1987 she looked 
around the enclosed area on the 86th floor where the girls would 
sleep friday and said this is quite milder with no chance of 
being snowed in 
but not everyone was ecstatic about spending the night at the 
building 
alice crowley 9 would have preferred a more natural 
environment 
id rather be camping out in the countryside she said i 
think that would be more fun

the foreign ministers from five 
central american countries broke off two days of talks after they 
were unable to agree on how to disband the army of usbacked 
nicaraguan rebels in honduras 
however the ministers said they will meet again in guatemala on 
april 1314 to continue their negotiations 
nicaragua has pushed for quick disbanding of the rebels most of 
whom live in border camps in neighboring honduras 
deputy foreign minister carlos rivera of costa rica told 
reporters that the diplomats could not arrive at an accord for 
demobilization of the contras 
the central american presidents agreed feb 14 to come up with a 
plan by midmay for disarming the rebels they would either be 
repatriated with their families or relocated in exchange 
nicaragua said it would adopt domestic democratic reforms 
the agreement took us officials by surprise they have said 
the rebels should remain in place as an army to put pressure on the 
leftist sandinista government of nicaragua to make reforms 
the foreign ministers disagreed it is the collective 
responsibility of the five governments to look for paths to obtain 
the demobilization honduran foreign minister carlos lopez 
contreras told a news conference after talks ended honduras has 
been a strong us ally but it has recently objected publicly to 
the presence of the rebels known as contras on its territory 
however the foreign minister said his government did not have a 
specific plan for demobilization what we have are ideas 
reflections he said 
the foreign ministers of nicaragua el salvador honduras 
guatemala and costa rica met in san jose to lay groundwork for a 
regional summit at which their presidents are to decide how to 
disband the contras 
lopez contreras said earlier friday that the summit would be put 
off from may 15 to june 15 to allow el salvadors new president 
alfredo cristiani to take office 
at the san jose meetings nicaraguan foreign minister miguel 
descoto also gave his colleagues a proposal for a regional fight 
against drug trafficking that would include us assistance the 
foreign ministers said they will try to meet in nicaragua april 
1112 to discuss the proposal 
they also agreed to meet in guatemala in early may to prpare for 
the presidential summit the exact dates of the second guatemala 
meeting are to be decided later 
although no accords were reached the foreign ministers said the 
talks were fruitful 
if we didnt believe peace in central america was possible we 
wouldnt be fighting for it costa rican foreign minister rodrigo 
madrigal nieto said 
the contras fought the nicaraguan government for eight years 
however the fighting has trailed off since early last year when 
the us congress cut off military aid to the rebels 
president daniel ortega said thursday that 45 million in 
nonmilitary aid under consideration by the us congress should be 
used to disband the contras 
as now envisioned the package would provide the contras with 
45 million a month through feb 28 1990 four days after what 
nicaragua pledged will be free and democratic general elections 
nicaragua says washington would be violating regional peace 
accords by maintaining the contras as a potential fighting force 
the contras and their families in honduras number 10000 to 11000 
the ministers on thursday formally approved deploying a small 
group of unarmed un military observers to monitor central 
american border conflicts 
canada spain and west germany agreed to contribute to the 
force costa rican president oscar arias said he asked venezuela to 
send observers also 
the united nations has made no decision on such a force

united artists maker of the 
oscarwinning movie rain man will be sold to an australian 
entertainment company for 1 billion in the first sale of a major 
studio to a foreign buyer 
in another development officials of japans giant sony corp 
were reportedly in discussions friday with executives of mca about 
acquiring the giant entertainment conglomerate that owns universal 
studios 
united artists is part of the entertainment complex controlled 
by financier kirk kerkorian the majority shareholder of 
metrogoldwynmayerunited artists 
under the proposal announced friday kerkorian would retain 
control of the mgm name its roaring lion logo and tv and movie 
studios as well as 34 mgm movies including moonstruck and a 
fish called wanda but the united artists moviemaking group and 
its film library would go to the australiabased qintex group one 
of the makers of the recent cbs miniseries lonesome dove 
the mgmua deal if approved would mark the first time a major 
studio passed into predominantly foreign ownership australian 
media magnate rupert murdoch became a us citizen before he bought 
20th century fox 
the mgmua deal would give qintex group most of the assets of 
mgmua communications co including rights to rain man 
also included would be a library of 4000 movies among them the 
james bond and pink panther series the video library and movie and 
television production and distribution facilities 
the agreement is subject to unspecified government shareholder 
and thirdparty approvals according to a joint announcement by the 
two companies 
mgmua officials refused to elaborate on a news release which 
said the deal was expected to be completed by late summer 
it is the second time this year kerkorian has agreed to sell 
part of the company he assembled out of the former united artists 
and metrogoldwynmayer studios in addition to a collapsed deal to 
sell an interest in the mgm name to fellow hollywood investor burt 
sugarman in july kerkorian has been publicly shopping all or part 
of mgmua for months 
kerkorian who owns 82 percent of mgmua through his tracinda 
corp pumped 180 million of his own funds into the money losing 
company in january mgmua lost 395 million in the first quarter 
of 1989 and 487 million in 1988

a scientist who reported that a simple apparatus 
may create fusion power at room temperature said his work gives 
hope for a new energy source but warned that fusion fever 
enthusiasm is premature 
i think we have a new approach to fusion but it is too 
early to say whether it will prove useful for generating 
electricity said steven jones of brigham young university in 
provo utah 
the results still must withstand scientific scrutiny and be 
confirmed by other scientists and until that happens dont sell 
your oil well jones said 
even if the results hold up it would take many years before the 
process could be put to practical use jones said friday at a 
physics colloquium and a later press conference at columbia 
university in new york 
fusion is the process that powers the sun and stars where 
tremendous amounts of energy are released when the nucleus or 
core of one hydrogen atom fuses with the nucleus of another 
hydrogen atom 
in contrast todays nuclear power plants get energy from 
fission which is the splitting of atoms 
scientists hope to harness fusion power saying it provides an 
environmentally benign energy source with a virtually unlimited 
source of fuel heavy hydrogen which occurs naturally in water 
standard fusion experiments use extremely high temperatures to 
get the hydrogen atoms to fuse but jones and scientists at the 
university of utah announced recently that they had independently 
found a simple way to produce fusion reactions at room temperature 
essentially they used electrical current to herd hydrogen atoms 
into metal electrodes where the hydrogen atoms apparently fused 
the university of utah researchers said their apparatus produced 
four times as much energy as it consumed jones in contrast said 
the brigham young device appeared to produce only about one 
tentrillionth of the energy put into it 
jones said he had not read the other teams scientific paper and 
could not explain the difference 
the brigham young apparatus included a pair of electrodes 
immersed in heavy water in which hydrogen atoms contain an 
extra particle called a neutron in the nucleus this kind of 
hydrogen is called deuterium 
when low voltage was applied to the electrodes deuterium nuclei 
were drawn into one of the electrodes there they apparently 
crowded together closely enough to fuse jones said 
researchers calculated that two fusions occurred every five 
seconds which would yield an energy output of one tentrillionth 
of a watt one watt is about enough to run an electric toothbrush 
the evidence for fusion was that the apparatus emitted neutrons 
jones said that happened when the nuclei were driven into 
electrodes made from either titanium or palladium with titanium 
giving the better results jones said 
we dont really have a good theory to explain the fusion 
jones said perhaps deuterium nuclei are forced close enough to 
fuse while hopping from site to site within the crystal structure 
of the electrode he said 
he calls the fusion approach piezonuclear fusion because 
piezo means to squeeze 
a similar process may cause part of the heat at the earths 
core he said 
in salt lake city one of two researchers who first announced 
the discovery b stanley pons said friday he had found no 
chemical explanation for the process by which he achieved 
sustained controlled nuclear fusion in a simple experiment 
it cannot be explained by any known chemical process said 
pons a professor at the university of utah i can conceive of no 
other process other than a nuclear process to explain the results

du pont issued the checks thursday and friday even though most 
employees will stay on about 1200 workers decided to retire 
many of the severance and vacation checks ranged from 20000 to 
30000 said scott murphy of the plant credit union

walt disney co and the academy of motion 
picture arts and sciences are trying to amicably resolve a dispute 
over a snow white lookalikes appearance in the oscar shows 
opening number 
the two met friday but there was no indication disney was ready 
to drop its federal trademark infringement lawsuit against the 
academy 
we are in talks with disney and we wont have any comment 
until they are completed said academy spokesman bruce davis 
fiercely protective of its image and copyrights disney filed 
the lawsuit in us district court on thursday alleging that oscar 
producers did not have permission to use the disneycopyrighted 
fairy tale character 
the broadcast seen in an estimated 27 million american homes 
began wednesday night with actress eileen bowman dressed as snow 
white following a chorus line of dancing stars into the shrine 
auditorium 
in a squeaky betty boop voice bowman then launched into a 
rendition of we only have stars for you to the tune of i 
only have eyes for you she also sang a rendition of proud 
mary with actor rob lowe 
disney spokesman erwin okun said the performance was 
unflattering to the beloved character and disney president frank 
wells said the matter could have been settled without litigation if 
the academy had publicly apologized 
for its own reasons however the academy unfortunately did 
not accede to our request wells said 
the oscar shows producer allan carr declined to comment 
because of the pending lawsuit 
all media queries were referred to davis who said it was 
strange that the use of the character had not been cleared with 
disney 
obtaining rights is one of the things we do routinely davis 
said every little three seconds of music or a film clip has to 
get cleared yes it is very puzzling we are exploring the reasons 
for that 
snow white and the seven dwarfs was released by disney in 
1937 and was the studios first featurelength animated cartoon 
critics praised the film calling it a turning point in disneys 
career and a milestone in movie history

gunners exploded in residential districts of syrianpoliced west 
beirut in the predawn shelling the spokesman said 
a christian military source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the syrians today deployed 180mm sovietdesigned howitzers for 
the first time since the current round of violence broke out march 
8 
they are using the heavy howitzers to knock out army bunkers 
and fortifications it seems they want to use it to demolish vital 
utilities as well the source said 
the clashes erupted after aoun clamped a blockade on militiarun 
illegal ports in an effort to reactivate taxcollection at the five 
government harbors along the 130mile coastline

british prime minister margaret thatcher 
today left malawi convinced she has a role to play in seeking a 
political settlement in south africa 
malawi president hastings kamuzu banda who is in his 80s 
kissed the british leaders hand as she curtsied to him in a 
departure ceremony at chileka airport near the commercial capital 
of blantyre 
thatchers destination was kept secret evidently for security 
reasons but she arrived shortly after noon today in windhoek 
namibia on the first day of that southwest african territorys 
process toward independence from south african control among those 
she was expected to meet was south african foreign minister pik 
botha 
on her current african swing the british premier has visited 
morocco nigeria zimbabwe and malawi 
on each leg of the tour she has expressed hope that conditions 
are right for a negotiated end to conflict in southern africa with 
britain playing a role in any possible political breakthrough in 
whiteruled south africa 
at a banquet hosted by banda at his hilltop palace outside 
blantyre late friday thatcher said she was visiting a continent 
torn by strife but she came with the conviction that this is the 
time of new hope for southern africa 
she cited the unsupervised independence plan for namibia 
starting today as evidence of a conciliatory mood in the region 
which secured a timetable for the withdrawal of cuban troops from 
angola namibias northern neighbor and south africas withdrawal 
from namibia 
thatcher said within south africa itself one sees a growing 
acceptance that discrimination based on race and color must end and 
will end that black south africans must be allowed to play their 
part in politics and government 
britain has said it is prepared assist in mediation efforts in 
south africa on condition jailed african national congress leader 
nelson mandela is released first and that the guerrilla leader 
renounces violence 
thatcher has argued that britain has unique expertise based on 
experience gained from relinquising power in its former african 
colonies particularly zimbabwe 
an allparty conference chaired by britian in 1979 ended a 
sevenyear guerrilla war in whiteruled rhodesia and led to the 
birth of the independent nation of zimbabwe the following year 
on her african tour thatcher has restated he opposition to an 
economic blockade of south africa contending that sanctions would 
hurt south africas 28 million blacks the most 
in namibia now there must be free and fair elections just 
like those which britain organized in zimbabwe nine years ago 
she said 
thatcher was expected to hold talks with united nations 
officials in namibia later today and visit british troops in a un 
peacekeeping force in the territory which has been controlled by 
south africa since world war 1

five oil pollution specialists from norway 
including an expert on sea birds are en route to alaska to help 
contain damage from the worst us oil spill in history 
the group is scheduled to arrive later today at prince william 
sound where the tanker exxon valdez ran aground march 24 and 
dumped 240000 barrels of crude oil along the alaskan coast 
we can show them ways to clean up oily waste and how to 
dispose of it so it breaks down more quickly said jens henning 
koefoed of the national pollution control authority 
he described a process of spreading out waste over a layer of 
bark and turning it several times a year to help nature break it 
down 
norways offer to lend its expertise was accepted by the alaska 
department of environmental conservation on thursday according to 
koefoed he is not a member of the team 
the group will be led by oeyvind schreiner another official 
with the pollution authority 
speaking in a telephone interview schreiner 44 said the 
biologists zoologists equipment and training experts in the team 
have experience from norways own offshore oil industry and from 
international oil disasters 
we have a lot of practice in monitoring oil companies 
handling of environmental problems he said 
the other team members are sea bird expert tycho ankernilssen 
35 of the institute for nature research reidar hindrum 38 a 
researcher from the natural resources directorate bjoern 
koppangen 52 an oil spill equipment specialist at the national 
operations and training center for oil pollution control and 
training specialist jan nerland 45 from the same center 
we can help select areas that most need protection and which 
research projects are needed to document the effect of the disaster 
on animals birds and fish said hindrum a wildlife expert who 
studies conflicts between ecology and the oil business

a police officer who shot and killed 
three people in seven months was fired after notches were found 
carved into his pistol 
bryan farrell 25 was dismissed friday after dallas police 
department investigators discovered two marks on the 9mm pistols 
trigger guard while looking into the third killing in the dallas 
suburb of arlington 
farrell was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the first two 
killings 
he fatally shot ray soto jr of arlington on aug 2 when soto 
raised a handgun toward farrell and a fellow officer less than 
three weeks later farrell shot 33yearold martin williams during 
a struggle that occurred along interstate 30 in fort worth 
farrell shot michael robinson 21 on feb 1 while serving a 
warrant in dallas 
the same gun was used in all three killings said officer dee 
anderson spokesman for the arlington police department 
these markings and their possible inference were obviously 
very troublesome to us anderson said during a news conference 
we do not know at this point who put the marks on the gun and 
what they signify 
farrell told investigators he was unaware of the markings 
his weapon was confiscated after each of the first two 
shootings a standard procedure but anderson said the markings 
werent found until after the third shooting 
no one noticed any markings anderson said all i can say 
is that they were not noticed or reported to us after the first two 
shootings i cant say whether they were there or not factually 
anderson would not describe the nicks and he did not speculate 
when asked if investigators felt the marks represented some sort of 
kill tally 
we have not been able to determine what they mean he said

a multimillion dollar effort will dump 
tons of rock on mount kenyas snowcapped peak to make it africas 
highest mountain a newspaper claimed today in an april fools day 
story 
haroun wandala the reporter who wrote the frontpage piece for 
the standard estimated at least half the readers who called the 
newspaper about mount kenyas purported facelift thought the story 
was true 
one fellow asked if wed considered the ecological impact such 
a project would have on the mountains streams and rivers and 
surrounding area said wandala with a laugh 
mount kilimanjaro in tanzania is africas highest peak at 19340 
feet mount kenya which straddles the equator is the continents 
second highest peak at 17058 feet 
the standard story claimed the distinctions in altitude would 
reverse by 1991 after an internationallyfunded project costing 
hundreds of millions of dollars succeeded in dumping enough 10ton 
buckets of rock and soil on its peak to add 2500 feet to its 
height 
one of the pictures accompanying the item showed a man on a 
snowy slope holding up a 12foot ruler that the paper said would be 
used to ensure the mountain reaches its height of 19552 feet 
the story was designed to suit the day said wandala

cherokee indians from across the country 
are observing the 150th anniversary of the trail of tears the 
forced march from their southeastern homeland that claimed an 
estimated 4000 lives 
in cherokee memory it is only a short time ago wilma 
mankiller chief of the cherokee nation of oklahoma told about 300 
people gathered friday on the lawn of the old cherokee national 
capitol in this northeast oklahoma city of 10000 the observance 
ends today 
the forced relocation of much of the tribe to oklahoma ended in 
late 1839 of the estimated 4000 cherokees who died many were 
buried in unmarked graves 
and yet here we are here we are despite everything that has 
happened to us ms mankiller said 
today the 93000member cherokee tribe is the nations second 
largest behind the navajos 
ms mankiller and chief jonathan taylor of the eastern band of 
cherokees from cherokee nc planted an oak tree on the capitol 
grounds in memory of many people who were on the trail who did 
not make it to the new home said deputy chief john ketcher of 
tahlequah 
officials had made it clear the prayers and speeches were to be 
more a memorial service than a celebration but some said their 
ancestors travails 150 years ago were not being emphasized enough 
pat moss of stilwell vice chairman of native americans for a 
clean environment asked that april 1 be recognized as an 
international day of sorrow in memory of those who died on the 
trail of tears 
the forced relocation of cherokee and other indigenous people 
known as the trail of tears was an act of genocide moss said 
while it is a very very sad time in our history i still 
believe we can draw strength from our ancestors said ms 
mankiller ive been able to draw strength from that terrible 
time in our history 
she emphasized that when they were relocated the cherokees were 
a civilized selfgoverning tribe 
the tribe survived the trail of tears to reform its government 
establish schools and erect civic buildings in northeast oklahoma 
however in 1906 the tribes land was taken away members were 
given individual allotments the cherokees had no constitutional 
tribal government until 1971 when the capitol was reestablished 
in tahlequah

thai pirates raided a boat full of 
vietnamese refugees in the south china sea massacred 45 of them 
and kidnapped about 11 women officials said today 
an old man and young boy were the only survivors of the attack 
which occurred within about the last seven days said the 
officials who work with refugees and who spoke with the associated 
press on condition of anonymity 
the pirates stormed the unarmed boat slashed the passengers 
with knives and threw their bodies overboard the officials said 
the attackers ran their boat over the floating bodies to make sure 
no one was alive the sources said 
the two survivors hid under planks floating in the water and 
their boat later drifted to an esso oil co rig in the south china 
sea off the trengganu coast of malaysia the officials said 
workers picked up the two on monday and sent them to the 
malaysian government hospital in kuala trengganu 180 miles 
northeast of kuala lumpur this is one of the worst cases of 
piracy reported in recent years and the pirates nowadays kill the 
people after plundering the boats so that there would be no 
witnesses said a senior refugee official 
the refugee officials said the two survivors did not give a full 
account of their experience they did not say exactly when the 
attack took place or how many pirates took part there was no word 
on the fate of the kidnapped women 
the women are normally raped and either killed and dumped into 
the sea or abandoned in remote islands said another refugee 
official 
in january refugee officials said two vietnamese women were 
raped and dumped on a remote thai island before arriving at the 
camp the women reported that 26 people in their boat were killed 
by thai pirates late last year 
the officials said such attacks by thai pirates had decreased 
since the early 1980s when thai and malaysian authorities had 
stepped up boat patrols the government reported that in march 
about 2000 vietnamese refugees landed on malaysian shores almost 
double the average for the past few months there are now about 
16500 vienamese boat people in malaysia 
malaysia and the nations of the region accept the refugees only 
for temporary stay pending permanent settlement in the west

heavily armed police today patrolled 
southern kosovo province to prevent demonstrations by ethnic 
albanians marking the anniversary of serbalbanian rioting in 1981 
helmeted riot police patrolled the provincial capital pristina 
the site of recent violence but the city was calm 
at least 24 people died and more than 200 were wounded in the 
province on monday and tuesday when thousands of ethnic albanians 
protested constitutional changes that increased serbias control 
over kosovo it was the deadliest rioting since 1981 when at least 
nine people were killed 
no incidents were reported today schools were closed public 
gatherings banned and police enforced an 8 pm to 5 am curfew 
the local communist party leadership met to discuss the recent 
rioting 
they were also to discuss the resignation of kosovos ethnic 
albanian president rahman morina he stepped down in february after 
striking miners claimed he did not represent albanian interests 
because he agreed to constitutional changes reducing kosovos 
automony 
but the party leadership was expected not to accept morinas 
resignation in a move that could cause more unrest by ethnic 
albanians according to iljaz ramajlji a member of kosovos 
politburo 
the staterun tanjug news agency accused neighboring albania of 
inciting the demonstrators and the interior minister complained out 
outside interference yugoslavia and albania have communist regimes 
that have remained independent of the soviet bloc 
kosovo interior minister jusuf karakusi said friday 
the situation has the outward appearance of becoming calmer 
but the organized hostile forces acting from the position of 
albanian nationalism and separatism are not idle they are 
preparing new actions 
he said the riots were instigated by illegal hostile forces 
that are active in kosovo and outside yugoslavia he did not name 
those forces 
a tanjug commentary said albania strongly incites extremist 
nationalists in kosovo to actions against the law and order 
the violence began after constitutional changes were made that 
gave serbia the largest republic in yugoslavia greater control 
over the judiciary police and schools in kosovo a serbian 
province kosovo had gained a substantial degree of autonomy under 
yugoslavias 1974 consitution 
but serbian leaders said the new changes which went into effect 
tuesday were necessary to protect the slav minority from 
harassment by the ethnic albanians that comprise 85 percent of 
kosovos population of 19 million

thousands of scots demonstrated today 
to protest a new tax that symbolizes the london government many of 
them reject 
bagpipers led a crowd estimated at 12000 through the streets to 
protest the change which eliminates local property taxes and 
substitutes a flat tax rate for all people 18 and over the change 
took effect today 
speakers from opposition parties churches and other groups 
urged people not to pay it a response long supported by scottish 
nationalists seeking to make the tax a major issue 
i have got absolutely no intention of paying the new tax 
said eleanor mclaughlin edinburghs lord provost she said she 
would refuse to pay to join the poor who cant afford it 
the tax is part of prime minister margaret thatchers crusade 
against socialism and highspending local governments 
it requires each local authority to calculate its expenses and 
set a uniform sum to be paid by every resident 18 and over 
the sums are expected to average 436 a year per adult with 80 
percent rebates available for those on low incomes 
the government says it will make local governments more 
accountable by forcing municipalities to stop financing social 
programs for those who pay little or no tax with money collected 
from the middle class 
but many scots have said the tax revenue will not be returned to 
scotland 
opinion polls show that many believe they will be worse off 
because of the new tax which is due to take effect in england and 
wales in a year 
the scottish national party which seeks outright independence 
for the 52 million scots was collecting signatures of people 
pledging not to pay the tax

president bush says he would have gotten 
nowhere with congress had he tried to win new military aid for the 
contras and he denies his diplomatic approach to nicaragua means 
the military efforts had failed 
there was no way not a snowballs chance in hell of getting 
a dime for lethal aid military aid from congress bush said 
friday in a questionandanswer session with a group of regional 
media representatives and i think anybody whos familiar with 
congress would acknowledge that 
bush today engaged in latin american diplomacy meeting with 
venezuelas new president carlos andres perez and several top 
administration officials 
the group including secretary of state james a baker iii and 
treasury secretary nicholas brady discussed a range of issues of 
concern to the latin world including the third world debt crisis 
and central america peace efforts according to a senior 
administration official 
in the questionandanswer session friday rejected a suggestion 
that his emphasis on diplomacy in the region amounts to an 
admission that president reagans policy of military support for 
the contras had failed 
bush said military pressure convinced nicaraguas ruling 
sandinistas to join in peace talks calling for democratic reforms 
in their country 
on other issues bush also ruled out any backing away from his 
support for expanded oil exploration in alaska to turn away from 
the oil resources in the arctic national wildlife refuge he said 
would be irresponsible despite the recent environmental disaster 
created by the 10million gallon spill from the exxon valdez tanker 
we are becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil and 
that is not acceptable to any president bush said we have to 
transport oil what we will do is not go backwards 
bushs comments friday on the contras were the first he has made 
indicating that the dim prospects for military aid influenced his 
decision to pursue a diplomatic solution 
in a bipartisan package worked out with congressional leaders 
he is proposing 40 million in nonlethal aid to keep the contras 
intact until the nicaraguan elections at the beginning of next year 
its not bad the policy has been well received he said 
we are speaking with one voice we are going to push for 
democratization 
as to el salvadors new president alfredo cristiani the 
candidate of the rightist arena party bush said we will treat 
the salvadoran winner on his word that he wants to continue the 
democracy espoused under outgoing christian democratic president 
jose napoleon duarte 
he pledged to redouble efforts for safe transport

it might be easy for those on the 
outside to dismiss president najib as a hulking former secret 
police chief presiding over a repressive government destined for 
defeat 
but this same man has proved himself to be an eloquent orator a 
shrewd combatant during political infighting and a politician deft 
at appealing to feelings of nationalism 
the test now at hand is the battle for jalalabad where 
ussupported moslem guerrillas have besieged najibs forces 
nearly four weeks 
neither side has been able to claim victory thousands of people 
have surely died although neither side has sufficient credibility 
for its casualty reports to be believed 
najib has fired his biggest guns literally and figuratively 
the sovietsupplied scudb missiles launched toward jalalabad 
from kabul several times a day are monstersize weapons but their 
impact may be as much psychological as physical 
the government makes no effort to conceal its scuds trundling 
the 36footlong missiles through the center of kabul on open truck 
beds in broad daylight the roar with which they are fired is 
unmistakable 
their message and that of the air force migs and sukhois is 
clear najibs weapons outclass any rockets mortars or shells the 
guerrillas can pack across the border from pakistan 
although the soviet union withdrew the last of its combat troops 
from afghanistan on feb 15 it continues to supply the kabul 
government with scuds smaller weapons and food and says it will do 
so as long as the united states aids the guerrillas 
the guerrillas are caught in a dilemma they are most effective 
in hitandrun attacks not bogged down in confrontation with a 
regular army that outnumbers and outguns them 
conversely regular armies rarely vanquish guerrilla forces 
militarily as the israelis learned against the palestine 
liberation organization in lebanon and the indians against tamil 
guerrillas in sri lanka 
the most effective solution is a political one which is 
impossible to achieve unless both sides agree to negotiate but 
guerrilla leaders refuse to talk to najib and say they will not 
give up the fight until his sovietstyle party is removed 
najib is giving the political side his best shot 
fratricide brings nothing but misery and agony the 
president said last week in a radio appeal aimed at the guerrillas 
local commanders inside afghanistan referring to them as dear 
compatriots and my brothers and to their pakistanbased 
political leaders as the enemy and the extremists najib 
offered a ceasefire and local autonomy to commanders who would 
stop fighting 
from guerrilla headquarters in pakistan came a rejection of 
najibs offer but the government claims it has opened negotiations 
with some local commanders it refused to identify 
najib rarely misses an opportunity to accuse pakistan of 
vicious warmongering of imposing a foreigninspired war on 
afghans it is a calculated ploy aimed at the fiercely independent 
and tribalistic afghans centuriesold antipathy to outsiders 
there also seems to be a growing feeling in warweary kabul that 
najib although unquestionably an authoritarian leader is not as 
bad as his predecessors in the ruling peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan 
the afghan monarchy ended in 1973 when king zahir shah was 
overthrown by a cousin mohammad daoud five years later the 
peoples democratic party overthrew and assassinated daoud 
bringing noor mohammad taraki to power 
taraki himself was killed in 1979 as party rival hafizullah amin 
took over with the amin regime teetering under guerrilla attacks 
and party feuds the soviet union sent troops to kabul later that 
year and amin was assassinated 
amins successor babrak karmal in turn was shunted aside by 
najib in 1986 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights monitoring 
group estimated that 35000 afghans have been imprisoned or 
disappeared the majority of them in the prenajib early 1980s 
under najib there are still political arrests but the number of 
detentions has dropped sharly according to several foreign 
observers who spoke on condition of anonymity 
taraki amin and babrak were crazy men maybe najib is not so 
bad said one businessman others have expressed similar views 
the party traditionally is divided between the parcham faction 
headed by najib and the khalq faction of the late taraki and amin 
in october najib purged parchami dissidents and a month later 
dispatched the top khalqi leader gen mohammad gulabzoi to moscow 
as ambassador a timetested afghan way of getting potential 
troublemakers out of the country

since police entered the shipyard thursday 
the shipyard is owned by the hyundai group one of the largest 
conglomerates in south korea 
hundreds of masked students carrying banners with 
antigovernment slogans streamed from the university gates shouting 
down with roh taewoo who stifles workers rights 
they burned effigies of roh and chung juyung honorary chairman 
of hyundai some hurled firebombs and swung wood and steel clubs 
while others stood on walls surrounding the campus and threw rocks 
riot police fired hundreds of tear gas shells 
the national council of student representatives a major radical 
student group said it would launch a nationwide wave of attacks on 
hyundai in support of workers hyundai offices and automobile 
showrooms were attacked friday and protesters battled police in 
seven cities 
in ulsan thousands of riot police guarded the shipyard and set 
up check points around bus terminals and on roads leading to the 
shipyard to block more sympathizers from joining the protesters 
said yonhap 
operations at the shipyard were slow although more than half of 
the 22000member work force showed up for work saturday officials 
said 
prosecutors brought formal charges against 10 union leaders for 
conspiring to cause violence and said investigations continued 
against some of 697 other workers who were arrested 
riot police stormed the shipyard thursday in a land sea and air 
attack to end a violent strike that left about 400 people injured 
hyundais trouble began dec 12 when about 5000 militant 
workers broke away from a companysanctioned union and organized a 
separate group demanding pay increases and better working 
conditions 
the police intervention triggered violent protests in seoul and 
other cities by strike sympathizers who accused the government of 
suppressing free labor and protecting conglomerates at the cost of 
workers

for his first appearance in the west 
since the armenian earthquake cut short his us visit in december 
mikhail s gorbachev has chosen a small nation that in some ways 
straddles europes political social and military divides 
the soviet presidents stopover sunday at shannon airport en 
route to cuba and then britain is the first visit by a soviet 
leader to this 95percent roman catholic country 
as the most catholic nation in europe ireland is instinctively 
anticommunist and 85 percent of the population votes for 
conservative parties but it also cherishes the neutrality that 
kept it out of world war ii and makes it the only member of the 
european economic community to stay out of the nato alliance 
the eecs drive to harmonize its members policies leads some 
irish to worry their neutrality is being compromised and a visit 
by the leader of the communist world could help restore the balance 
for a country of 35 million people still undergoing the 
transition from a rural to industrial society even a brief visit 
from a soviet leader is a big prestige boost 
irish newspapers saturday devoted special sections to the visit 
which the irish times described as confirmation of prime minister 
charles haugheys role as an international statesman the irish 
independent said the visit was both significant and symbolic 
gerald frost director of the london institute for european 
defense and strategic studies observes that an irish visit is 
obligatory for a us president but unusual for a soviet 
he said the rare visit will focus attention on and probably 
facilitate the gorbachev charm offensive 
gorbachevs sixday trip to communist cuba and then britain was 
supposed to follow his visit to washington last december but he 
had to rush home when the armenian earthquake struck 
liam skelley deputy head of aer rianta the irish airports 
authority was mindful of gorbachevs attempt to curb soviet vodka 
consumption and made tea and coffee available in addition to irish 
whiskey 
the visit underlines irishsoviet commercial ties as shannons 
dutyfree stores were open to gorbachev and his wife raisa 
aer rianta runs the dutyfree shops at moscows sheremetyevo 
airport the symbol of the sevenyear joint venture begun last year 
is a shamrock on the face of the kremlin clock 
in 1980 the soviet airline aeroflot began refueling at shannon 
on north american routes now 1500 aeroflot jets land at shannon 
each year and skelley and his staff are taking russian lessons 
aer rianta takes over the leningrad airport shops this summer 
and has a 34 million annual contract to paint aeroflot jets 
sovietirish trade totaled 625 billion last year running 31 
in moscows favor but that was down from 757 billion in 1987 
when moscow stepped up irish meat imports

more than 150 years ago legend has it alamo 
commander william b travis drew a line across the grounds of the 
old spanish mission he asked his men to step over it and defend 
the alamo against thousands of mexican troops 
today the daughters of the republic of texas who have cared 
for the alamo for 84 years are emulating travis legendary gesture 
as they battle with legislators and hispanic leaders who want to 
wrestle control of the alamo away from the 6000member group 
travis lost his battle to santa anna in march 1836 but texas 
troops rallied with the cry remember the alamo and later 
defeated mexican troops to regain the alamo and win texas 
independence from mexico 
now critics of the daughters of the republic of texas say the 
mission would be better run by a state agency accountable to the 
public particularly in light of an audit that showed the 
daughters alamo chapter with a budget surplus of nearly 2 million 
we arent hiding anything our books are open and we are 
complying with the open records and open meetings laws said 
marjorie hardy a chapter chairwoman tourism officials estimate 
chapter members usher close to 10 million visitors a year through 
the mission in the heart of downtown 
shifting control to the state ms hardy said would cost 
taxpayers because state workers would be paid for duties that 
volunteers now perform as for the surplus ms hardy said it was 
being saved to build a larger theater in the complex 
we are very proud of what we have done with the alamo but we 
are not bragging about ourselves maybe we should ms hardy said 
daughters of the republic of texas are descendants of people who 
lived in texas between 1836 and 1845 when it was an independent 
republic before becoming part of the united states the daughters 
received a state charter in 1905 to operate the alamo 
the complex includes a chapel with artifacts and flags a 
souvenir shop and research library a small building where 
documentaries are shown and enclosed grounds with several cannons 
on display admission is free and operating expenses are covered 
by souvenir sales profits no state money is used 
recently the daughters asked attorney general jim mattox to 
clarify their legal status he ruled that the group must comply 
with the state open records law because it manages a stateowned 
site 
meanwhile state rep ron wilson filed a bill that would 
transfer control of the alamo from the daughters to the texas parks 
amp wildlife department which operates numerous state parks and 
museums 
its a historical structure probably the most historical 
structure in the state and for the state not to have control or 
management of it is a little absurd he said a house committee 
is slated to have a hearing on the bill later this month 
adding fuel to the alamo controversy is jose garcia de lara 
president of the league of united latin american citizens 
garcia who says he is a descendant of bernardo gutierrez de 
lara author of the republic of texas declaration of independence 
maintains the alamo is a symbol of oppression for hispanics 
he said the league and the daughters should work together to see 
that hispanic heroes of the alamo mexicans who fought alongside 
the other alamo defenders are granted the same respect as travis 
james bowie and davy crockett 
the drt has a perception that they own the alamo and because 
of that they have managed it and handled it in a way that has 
excluded hispanics from participating in historical activities 
de lara said 
adela navarro 85yearold descendant of republic of texas 
statesman jose antonio navarro also favors state control of the 
alamo though she herself is a member of a daughters chapter 
these old girls play dirty politics the alamo doesnt belong 
to them ms navarro said they think they are superior and 
they are not 
but supporters of the daughters including mayor henry cisneros 
and state rep orlando garcia of san antonio say the group has 
done an admirable job of restoring the alamo and telling the 
history of texas accurately 
they are blood descendants of the heroes of the alamo 
cisneros said no one else will treat either the building or the 
history of the period with the care and reverence they bring to the 
task 
garcia who had asked the daughters to open their records 
agrees they take care of the alamo as no one else could and adds 
the state is not in a position to be assuming new burdens 
pauline wilson president of the daughters alamo chapter said 
hard work went into making the alamo the tourist attraction it is 
today 
the older members brought in their husbands their kids even 
their maids to clean the place out she said where were all 
these people when we were having such a hard time with it

congress finally freed of the knockdown 
draggedout fight over the nomination of john tower as defense 
secretary is focusing on resolving longoverdue problems such as 
funding the military in a zerogrowth budget and modernizing the 
nations landbased missiles 
the nearly twomonth bitter debate over tower his later 
rejection by the senate and the eventual confirmation of former 
rep dick cheney of wyoming has delayed pentagon decisions past set 
deadlines 
in turn congress defense plate remains relatively empty 
the in box drives everything rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee said in an 
interview last week 
among the pentagons missed deadlines was a feb 15 decision on 
funding for the singlewarhead midgetman the mobile 10warhead mx 
missile and other landbased modernization programs as well as 
budget action due april 3 
the delay according to aspin will limit cheney to mundane 
changes as he cuts 63 billion from the fiscal 1990 defense 
budget originally proposed by former president reagan 
the changes are not going to be very inspired aspin said 
were facing a brand new era with soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev but i dont think well see creative thinking 
aspin praised cheneys abilities but said time constraints and 
the usual delays in senate confirmation of the defense secretarys 
subordinates will limit creativity 
but sen carl levin dmich a member of the senate armed 
services committee said friday he did not envision any problems 
from the lengthy battle over a defense secretary 
its not an unreasonable delay nor is it as a result going to 
create any big problems said levin who expects cheney to make 
better decisions decisions with more credibility 
cheney is scheduled to meet next week with the defense resources 
board on final changes in the defense budget 
meanwhile the congressional budget office said that if cheney 
choses to eliminate some military forces rather than cancel weapons 
in response to budget cuts the result would be massive force 
reductions including six army divisions and four navy aircraft 
carriers 
one of the major choices facing the new defense secretary is 
deciding on a modernization plan based on the mx the midgetman or 
a combination of the two 
congress decided last year to authorize 850 million in fiscal 
1989 to fund the two programs but until feb 15 the pentagon 
could spend no more than 250 million of the total amount on the mx 
rail garrison 
a compromise plan calls for converting the existing 50 mx 
missiles from vulnerable silos to railroad cars and building 300 to 
500 midgetman missiles aspin said last week that to achieve a 
bipartisan consensus in congress both the mx and midgetman should 
be built 
but the ranking republican on the house armed services 
committee rep bill dickinson of alabama criticized the plan 
saying it would place unacceptable limits on defense programs he 
urged his gop colleagues to vote against the midgetman unless 
democrats agree to president bushs request for an increase in 
defense spending after fiscal 1990 
bush has proposed zero growth in fiscal 1990 1 percent growth 
in fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992 and 2 percent growth in fiscal 1993 
levin said he feared that the combination of mx and midgetman 
will win out 
its a very expensive thing to do im afraid that well 
end up building both too often thats the way issues will be 
solved he said 
the michigan democrat likened the situation to the decision to 
build the b1 bombers and move forward with the b2 stealth bomber 
after the b52 levin favored choosing the b2 over the b1 
weve seen huge cost overruns as a result of doing 
everything instead of making choices levin said

a judge citing a lack of 
evidence has freed two former military officials and an 
industrialist jailed three years ago in a highly publicized probe 
into rightwing kidnappings 
judge juan hector larios on friday ordered the release of former 
lt rodolfo lopez sibrian former maj jose alfredo jimenez moreno 
and industrialist orlando llovera ballete 
larios also canceled arrest warrants for five other people 
including a former army colonel 
the judge declared null the acts of a military judge who in 1986 
started the proceedings the case was transferred to civilian court 
in 1988 after it was ruled the crimes were not politically 
motivated 
larrios said statements from witnesses on the kidnappings were 
not reliable and that there was insufficient evidence to hold the 
men 
the government alleged that llovera ballete and lopez sibrian 
posed as leftist guerrillas to capture five businessmen in exchange 
for about 5 million between 1980 and 1985 
the two were reported to be close friends of cashiered army maj 
roberto daubuisson founder of the ultraconservative republican 
nationalist alliance the partys candidate alfredo cristiani won 
the march 16 presidential election 
daubuisson and his associates have been repeatedly linked to 
rightwing death squads that ran rampant in the country in the 
early 1980s daubuisson has denied the charges 
when police agents captured llovera ballete and lopez sibrian in 
march 1986 it was widely viewed as the start of a case that would 
pit the administration of christian democrat president jose 
napoleon duarte against the conservative sectors of the military 
also implicated in the case were oporto tereson roman moises 
lopez arriola and detective edgardo sigfredo linates who all died 
under suspicious circumstances in the following months 
one was found hanged in his jail cell another was shot when he 
reportedly tried to escape police custody and the other was gunned 
down just outside el salvador 
authorities said the three could have provided important 
information in the case 
lopez sibrian also was implicated in the 1981 murders of two 
american land advisers mark david pearlman of seattle and michael 
p hammer of potomac md and a salvadoran agrarian reform 
official 
the charges against lopez sibrian who was later dismissed from 
the army were dropped because of lack of evidence 
pearlman and hammer were advising the government on a land 
reform program that took thousands of acres from wealthy families 
and distributed them to peasants 
five years later two former army corporals were convicted in 
the case the us government later maintained that the 
intellectual authors of the crime had not been brought to 
justice

six years after the late harold washington 
changed the course of chicago politics the movement that crowned 
him mayor has fractured jeopardizing the brief era of black 
leadership he set up on city halls fifth floor 
the likely benefactor of the split is richard m daley the 
white threeterm cook county prosecutor who unseated mayor eugene 
sawyer in the democratic primary he heads into tuesdays election 
with polls showing him a strong favorite to occupy the office his 
political bossfather held for 21 years 
but if daley does in fact defeat thirdparty candidate tim 
evans the lone black in the race and republican edward vrdolyak 
he will have to work fast to consolidate his power in the nations 
third largestcity another election will be held in 1991 when 
washingtons second term would have expired 
one of the first things washington faced and handled well 
was sending a message to the voters that didnt back him said 
top daley campaign aide david axelrod 
he told people in the predominantly white communities that his 
administration was going to be evenhanded in distributing 
services in appointments and all facets of government then 
went out and did those things 
rich daley the candidate has said many of the same things and 
to do less than that would not only be morally and ethically 
bankrupt axelrod added it would be politically suicidal 
if daley were to model himself on washington he would in a 
sense be continuing a tradition washington the citys first black 
mayor learned more than a few of his political tricks from the 
elder daley 
the old man liked to say good government is good politics and 
good politics is good government recalled eugene kennedy a 
loyola university professor and author of himself a biography 
of richard j daley 
that translated into providing basic services which washington 
understood kennedy said 
ill never forget him walking in the white ethnic 
neighborhoods pointing out broken curbs busted lights and such 
and telling people id fix this but your alderman is blocking 
the way kennedy added sheer genius 
but while daley would have to reassure blacks that he intended 
to treat them fairly he might also have his hands full keeping his 
white constituency happy 
while everybody is wondering whether the black political 
movement can be put back together whats been overlooked is the 
high price that loyalty will cost daley if he wins said paul 
kleppner a professor of political science at northern illinois 
university and the author of chicago divided the making of a 
black mayor 
hes got to keep his own troops in line nurture the split 
among blacks and get some votes in the city council kleppner 
added and nothing in chicago politics comes cheap 
to be sure however the constraints on tuesdays winner go 
beyond the moral the ethical and even the purely political 
for one thing washington didnt so much dominate his city 
council opposition as outlast it 
for the first three years of his first term an antiwashington 
bloc of aldermen thwarted his legislative agenda at nearly every 
turn it was only after a courtordered remap increased minority 
representation in the council that washington was able to put 
together a working majority 
either evans or daley could command about 20 votes each in the 
council but daley is more likely to succeed in twisting the arms 
of the remaining 10 aldermen 
another factor limiting the new mayor will be the paucity of 
spoils that can be handed out 
during the sixterm reign of daleys father the mayor exercised 
control over 40000 patronage jobs federal court rulings since the 
1970s have prohibited most political hiring and firing which means 
the next mayor will have fewer than 1000 jobs to dole out to his 
army 
and the mayors control over another traditional source of 
spoils contracts for city services and consultants fees has 
been limited by increasing council review powers and a set of 
executive guidelines laid down by washington that guarantee 
minorities a representative share 
but neither promises of fairness nor constraints assuage all the 
fears in the black community 
nothing less than the future of blacks in politics in chicago 
is being threatened i wont beat around the bush i want a black 
mayor said lu palmer the popular black radio commentator and 
political activist 
after months of avoiding the potentially explosive issue of 
race evans wandered closer toward the minefield last week in hopes 
of energizing black voters in a city where the voting population is 
about 48 percent white against 42 percent black 
richard daley is getting ready to reopen his fathers 
plantation evans a south side alderman told a rally of 12000 
supporters gathered at the university of illinoischicago early 
last week 
sawyer lost the feb 28 primary in large part because many black 
supporters of evans stayed away from the polls the two men had 
become bitter rivals during the council fight to appoint a 
temporary successor to washington 
as a result sawyer drew nearly 130000 fewer votes in the 
citys 19 predominantly black wards than washington did in the 1987 
primary sawyer lost to daley by a margin of just over 100000 
votes 
the most recent polls show daley with about 50 percent support 
and with a lead of between 14 and 21 points over evans vrdolyak 
whose upstart writein candidacy a week before the primary won him 
the gop nomination is mired at about 5 percent support and not 
considered a factor 
a daley victory would make chicago by far the biggest us city 
to replace black control of city hall with white 
to know that richard daley would finish out harolds reign 
would be unthinkable said palmer 
but to know that blacks on the very anniversary of dr kings 
assassination would be so immobilized that we cant get enough 
people out on our own day to assure our freedom would show he 
added that we get what we deserve

pinning down and correcting the cause of the 
nations worst oil spill may be as difficult as cleaning up after 
it 
the federal inquiry into why the exxon valdez ran aground in 
alaskas prince william sound is inhibited by the time it took to 
get authorities onto the ship delays in taking urine and blood 
samples from key personnel and the refusal of two top officers to 
talk to investigators 
among important questions investigators have been unable to 
answer 
why the southbound ship which had radioed the coast guard that 
it was moving out of its own shipping lane to avoid an iceberg 
moved across both the separation lane and the northbound traffic 
lane into a charted reef just after midnight march 24 
why the third mate who was unqualified to pilot the 987foot 
tanker through the sound was put in charge while the captain who 
was qualified had left the bridge 
whether the captain who was determined to be drinking 11 hours 
after the accident also was drinking when it occurred 
the coast guard arrived 2 hours after the vessel ran aground 
and started spilling oil into the once pristine waters 
blood and urine tests of the ships officers were not completed 
until nearly 11 hours after the accident and investigators from 
the national transportation safety board were not on board until 
two full days after the ship ran aground 
coast guard spokesman capt randy peterson in washington said 
the time it took to get coast guard officers to the ship appeared 
to be reasonable given the late hour and the 25mile distance to 
the ship from valdez 
according to communications logs sent to washington the coast 
guard received first word of the 1204 am local time accident 
at 1228 am and within two minutes ordered port valdez closed to 
all traffic and dispatched the commercial tug stalwart to assist 
the oilspewing tanker 
coast guard officers left valdez for the ship at 1 am and 
arrived at about 230 
urine and blood tests of the captain the third mate the 
helmsman and a lookout couldnt be conducted before qualified 
personnel were available to conduct them said coast guard 
spokesman rick meidt in valdez 
only the captain joseph hazelwood tested positive with a 061 
alcohol content in his blood a level of 04 would disqualify him 
from operating the ship 
in most states an auto driver is considered drunk only at a 
substantially higher blood alcohol content typically 10 or 
higher 
for an averagesize man the consumption of one beer within an 
hour of the test likely would show up at about the 03to04 
level meaning a person has to drink three or more beers or 
equivalent drinks in most states to be considered legally drunk for 
the purposes of driving a motor vehicle 
board spokeswoman drucella andersen said investgators have no 
way of detecting from blood tests whether hazelwood was drunk or 
even drinking at the time of the collision 
they determined based on interviews with other crew members 
that hazelwood had turned over the bridge to his third mate 
gregory cousins 
but they have not been able to tell whether hazelwoods blood 
alcohol level was due to drinking before or after the accident if 
the test result stemmed from drinking prior to the accident he 
would have had a higher count if tested within minutes after the 
ship ran aground 
on thursday exxon fired hazelwood citing violation of company 
rules that prohibit alcohol on board company ships 
but ms andersen in a telephone interview from valdez said 
investigators had been unable to determine whether hazelwood or 
anyone actually had alcohol on board 
by the time we got there sunday morning exxon officials had 
moved into the captains cabin to set up a crisis command and any 
evidence that was there would have been of no use she said 
both hazelwood and cousins have refused to talk on the advice of 
lawyers she said the coast guard and civilian authorities have 
said they are considering action against them 
ms andersen said the board could subpoena the men but 
investigators could not provide them with any immunity without 
approval of the full fivemember safety board and the justice 
department 
she said both men had tried to make a deal that would protect 
them from prosecution early in the investigation 
the safety board has no power to bring charges or compel actions 
but only determines the probable cause of an accident and 
recommends steps to prevent future accidents involving shipping 
aviation or ground transportation 
ms andersen said the board expected to complete its field 
investigation early this week after several more interviews and an 
examination of ship personnel records to determine the competence 
of its officers and crew 
in addition to cause of the accident the board also is looking 
at initial response to the spill and will assess the coast guards 
monitoring of traffic in the port to make the passage of vessels 
to and from port as safe from human error as possible 
ms andersen said the tanker had received coast guard permission 
to go around the ice but there was no indication of coast guard 
error in directives given to the ship 
a civilian worker in a coast guard radar room in valdez where 
the tanker was being monitored had a bloodalcohol level of 020 
when he was tested 15 hours after the accident but ms andersen 
said the worker bruce blandford had come on duty only a few 
minutes before the accident and said he drank only after getting 
off work 12 hours later

for two weeks and when he returned home it wasnt there 
bailey arrived thursday just moments after a city contractors 
bulldozer had leveled his house only rich dark soil remains 
it appears the city made a mistake said mayor patrick henry 
hays who apologized and asked bailey to itemize his losses 
counting the house furniture clothes and appliances bailey 
figures he lost 50000 
i aint got nothing now he said 
the right house had been razed but the city notified the wrong 
person of the impending demolition hays said 
city inspector elmo smith condemned the home last year and the 
city council authorized the razing if the owner failed to bring it 
up to building standards bailey found the condemned sign and 
bought a permit to put his house in shape he had planned to spend 
5000 on a new roof and other repairs 
when the city sent out condemnation notices it obtained the 
wrong name for the owner of the house and bailey never received 
notice that the city planned to tear it down 
so he was surprised when he returned home 
i thought the mayor or somebody had gone loco bailey said 
i got nowhere to stay i got to rent me a house

with former president reagan ruled out as a 
witness oliver norths lawyers must look for other ways to show 
that his superiors authorized his actions in the irancontra affair 
the defense begins presenting its case monday at norths trial 
on charges ranging from lying to congress to receiving an illegal 
gratuity 
while prosecutors were presenting their side over the last six 
weeks norths lawyers brought out a number of secret actions taken 
by reagan while in the white house on behalf of the contra rebels 
fighting to overthrow nicaraguas sandinista government 
but that failed to persuade us district judge gerhard a 
gesell that reagan should be called to the stand as requested by 
norths lawyers 
on friday gesell declared that the trial record presently 
contains no proof that defendant north ever received any 
authorization from president reaan to engage in the illegal conduct 
alleged either directly or indirectly orally or in writing 
that represented a blow to norths strategy but is not expected 
to deter his lawyers from focusing on reagan 
they still may draw on secrets contained in a 44page admission 
by the government outlining the administrations inducements to 
other countries in exchange for help to the contras 
in addition they are expected to zero in on exhibits already 
presented at the trial suggesting authorization 
for example after north denied in an aug 6 1986 meeting with 
the house intelligence committee that he was aiding the contras 
thennational security adviser john poindexter wrote his 
subordinate well done north now is accused of obstructing 
congress in connection with the meeting 
the defense subpoenaed poindexter a codefendant in the 
irancontra case who will be tried separately from north later this 
year asserting his constitutional rights poindexter is declining 
to appear 
in his absence norths lawyers want to show several hours of 
televised testimony poindexter gave on capitol hill in 1987 during 
the congressional irancontra hearings 
poindexter testified that his one regret was that he didnt 
follow up personally after north reported a threat on his life by 
terrorist abu nidal part of norths defense to the charge of 
accepting an illegal gratuity a home security system is that he 
feared for his familys safety and that the government wouldnt pay 
for a security system 
the office of independent counsel lawrence walsh opposes 
introducing the poindexter videotape 
the problem with focusing on reagan is that norths lawyers have 
been unable to place him at the scene of any of the alleged crimes 
the closest brush to date involving the president came in the 
testimony of former national security adviser robert mcfarlane 
mcfarlane said he had talked with reagan in the oval office 
about congressional inquiries before sending letters to congress in 
september 1985 which denied north was assisting the contras 
mcfarlane later pleaded guilty to misdemeanors in connection with 
the letters which north is accused of preparing and for which he 
is now charged with felonies 
mcfarlane testified that he got no guidance from reagan on what 
to say in the letters but norths lawyers said they needed to 
question the president about the matter 
norths lawyers also tried to show a pattern of concealment from 
congress 
it was disclosed that reagan who told the tower commission in 
1987 he didnt know about national security council involvement 
with the contras followed through on recommendations from the nsc 
staff to help the rebels 
during a twoyear congressional ban on contra aid reagan signed 
off on a secret plan to provide 110 million in extra aid to entice 
honduras to support the contras 
in response to a memo from mcfarlane reagan also telephoned the 
president of honduras to get a military shipment destined for the 
contras released it had been seized earlier in the day by the 
honduran military 
testimony at norths trial also shows that reagan also 
apparently approved a secret airdrop of recoilless rifles and other 
items to the contras the rifles were to be used to destroy two 
armsbearing ships headed for nicaragua 
mcfarlane testified that when he told reagan of a saudi arabian 
government contribution to the contras he made clear to me that 
no one should know and lets keep it that way

moslem countries are building up 
longrange missile arsenals in the middle east including systems 
capable of carrying nuclear and chemical warheads to israel 
military analysts say 
four arab countries iraq syria egypt and saudi arabia now 
possess missiles capable of hitting targets in israel all except 
saudi arabia are capable of producing their own chemical weapons 
analysts and diplomats say 
janes defense weekly said last week the middle east missile 
race is eroding israels traditional aerial supremacy and could 
dramatically change the balance of power in the region 
janes said that in addition to the four arab countries that 
have missiles libya is rushing to catch up 
at a time of eastwest detente and arms reductions military 
developments in the middle east have rung alarm bells in washington 
and moscow 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze warned recently 
of a middle east arms race that sooner or later would degenerate 
into a nuclear faceoff 
arab states in the region are pressing ahead with major arms 
programs costing billions of dollars but analysts do not believe 
the missile spread has reached a critical stage yet 
the real question is what kind of warheads these missiles are 
going to carry high explosive and chemical warheads basically 
cause very localized damage said don kerr of the londonbased 
international institute for strategic studies 
kerr said the countries do not have enough missiles to ensure 
that they could hit all targets and prevent retaliation 
saudi arabia disclosed last year it has acquired chinesemade 
df3a ballistic missiles they have a range of 1600 miles and can 
carry a 13megaton nuclear weapon or a warhead containing 4500 
pounds of high explosive 
the saudis insist the missiles the most powerful in the region 
will only carry conventional warheads intended primarily as 
defense against iran the missiles can also easily reach israeli 
targets 
missile warfare in the region started during the 1973 
arabisraeli conflict 
the iraniraq war spurred the spread of missile acquisition the 
use of outlawed chemical weapons in the iraniraq conflict made the 
israelis more aware than ever of the nightmare they faced in any 
new middle east conflict 
iran iraq syria jordan and libya have soviet scudb 
surfacetosurface missiles with a range of 180 miles 
syria israels main arab foe has more than 100 scudbs it 
also has an estimated 36 of the more accurate and powerful soviet 
ss21 scarab tactical missiles which have a range of 120 miles and 
are capable of carrying chemical warheads these can reach key 
israeli targets 
the syrians also have sovietbuilt ssc1 sepal and ssc3 
antiship missiles 
iran has some chinesemade silkworm surfacetoship missiles and 
appears determined to build a missile arsenal to match iraqs 
efforts 
israel has long held the offensive edge in the volatile middle 
east through its vaunted air force and it is widely believed to 
have built up a stock of nuclear weapons 
the superpowers influence in restricting access to missile 
technology has been undercut by the emergence of sophisticated arms 
industries in south america and the middle east 
argentina brazil and china have become major arms exporters 
egypt and israel are the main producers in the middle east but 
iraq and iran are building up their own defense industries even 
though their technological capabilities are still limited 
iraq and egypt are working with argentina to develop the 
badr2000 missile with a 620mile range and a warhead that can 
contain explosives a nuclear device or poison gas 
libya is reported to be negotiating with brazil to buy oteiba 
mbee600 missiles with a range of 375 miles enough to hit israeli 
targets 
the israelis are believed to be seeking to counter the growing 
threat by developing missile systems to either knock out arab and 
iranian missile sites in preemptive strikes or destroy incoming 
missiles in the air 
the washington post reported friday that some israeli sources 
believe iraq has a program to build nuclear warheads for use with 
missiles 
analysts say that so far the arsenal is limited both in 
quantity and quality although they noted that any largescale 
acquisitions particularly by libya iraq and iran would cause 
alarm 
kerr said for the time being these weapons are being sought 
by people for essentially defensive purposes these states want to 
be listened to 
the key question is whether arab states or iran ever achieve 
nuclear weapons status most analysts believe that prospect is 
still distant 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi has called for an arab nuclear 
capability and iraq and iran have nuclear reactors or are building 
them 
the arabs worry about israel as an advanced and dangerous 
outsider in the region kerr said 
but he said they are wary of missile encounters with israel 
which has its own nuclearcapable jericho1 weapon with an 
estimated range of up to 370 miles and has tested an advanced 
version with a reputed range of more than 1000 miles 
arab states know that if they started firing missiles at 
israel they run the risk of nuclear retaliation he said

state authorities filed criminal charges 
against a tanker captain accusing him of operating his ship under 
the influence of alcohol while the nations worst oil spill spread 
into the gulf of alaska 
exxon fired exxon valdez capt joseph hazelwood on thursday the 
same day the national transportation safety board revealed blood 
and urine tests taken about nine hours after the accident showed he 
had been drinking 
on friday the state charged hazelwood with three misdemeanors 
and issued a warrant for his arrest alaska attorney general doug 
baily said today 
hazelwood 42 was charged with operating a motorcraft while 
under the influence reckless endangerment and the negligent 
discharge of oil 
the three offenses carry combined maximum sentences of two years 
and three months and fines totaling up to 10000 if convicted 
hazelwood would have to spend at least 30 days in jail because he 
has two prior drunken driving convictions in the past five years 
baily said 
magistrate tracee schnell signed the arrest warrant for 
hazelwood and set bond at 50000 authorities believe hazelwood 
left the state several days ago but baily said the state would 
seek his extradition 
in washington the fbi said friday it is looking at possible 
felony violations of the clean water act which prohibits the 
negligent discharge of a pollutant into navigable waters the 
state is also investigating 
the 240000 barrels of oil that spewed into prince william sound 
a week ago from the exxon valdez has now tainted more than 1000 
square miles of water norwegian environmental specialists were en 
route to advise cleanup crews and wildlife officials feared taht 
the number of oilslicked birds and sea animals would overwhelm a 
local recovery center 
the iridescent slick began seeping into the gulf of alaska 
friday threatening additional fishing communities and a 600mile 
stretch of coastline that includes a national park 
workers at the kenai fjords national park hustled to protect 
fertile salmon streams draining alaskas rocky underbelly 
we expect the windward side of our boundary to be 
slimed said park superintendent anne costellina theres not a 
lot we can do about it 
ten sea otters and 27 oiled birds were taken to valdez for 
cleaning and federal wildlife experts said more than 1000 tainted 
birds some alive some dead had been spotted on a single island 
workers in valdez hurried to build cages for an expected flood 
of oilsoaked otters at a wildlife recovery and rehabilitation 
center set up at prince william sound community college but 
officials expressed concerned that the center couldnt handle a 
burgeoning number of oilsoaked animals 
a thousand oiled live and dead birds in the whole scheme of 
things probably is not that significant said everett 
robinsonwilson of the us fish and wildlife service but thats 
only one place in the sound there may be many other places in the 
sound that bad that people havent gotten to yet 
the alaska department of fish and game estimated the sounds 
otter population at 4000 to 5000 and said the otter is the areas 
most plentiful marine mammal other marine mammals found in the 
sound yearround include sea lions harbor seals porpoises and 
killer whales 
meanwhile the mayor of this picturesque coastal community said 
friday the ruptured tanker should be repaired elsewhere to prevent 
further contamination 
also friday angry residents many of them fishermen who depend 
on the sea for their livelihoods disrupted exxons daily news 
briefing demanding to know why the company that owns the tanker is 
not hiring them for the cleanup work 
a sablefish harvest set to open today was canceled because of 
the spill 
gov steve cowpers office announced that the soviet union is 
planning to send a skimming ship next week to help in the cleanup 
the coast guard said the disabled exxon valdez no longer was 
leaking oil but it could do so again when the vessel is moved 
although about twothirds of the 1 million barrels of oil that 
remained aboard have been removed the ship could be carrying up to 
50000 barrels of oil and up to 600000 barrels of oily bilge water 
when refloating is tried possibly wednesday exxon officials said 
valdez has the areas only port capable of handling the 987foot 
ship that has been impaled on a reef 25 miles away since march 24 
if they bring that tanker in here leaking oil then were 
going to have oil in valdez bay mayor john devens said adding 
that ducks geese wetlands and a fish hatchery could be threatened 
devens criticized exxon for not hiring townspeople to help in 
the cleanup and accused the company of pressuring residents to 
settle their claims hurriedly 
the company said that it had established an emergency assistance 
fund and that users were not precluded from making future claims 
the outburst at fridays news conference broke up the briefing 
as security guards struggled with environmentalists trying to force 
their way in 
the audience kept interrupting the proceedings with shouted 
questions and accusations 
before the session disintegrated into chaos exxon spokesman don 
cornett denied a reporters suggestion that the spill has gotten 
out of control and the cleanup has been a failure 
absolutely not it has not gotten away from us cornett 
insisted we are making good progress on this cleanup 
but he said later that only 300000 of the more than 10 million 
gallons of oil spilled have been recovered 
exxon shipping president frank iarossi said that most skimming 
equipment is inefficient because of the changing consistency of 
the oil which he likened to black mayonnaise

president bush urged the president of 
venezuela today to press ahead with his nations economic reforms 
as the administration pushed its new plan to curb social and 
economic tensions over the third world debt crisis 
bushs white house breakfast session with carlos andres perez 
was very productive said white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
they were joined in their 1hour meeting by secretary of state 
james a baker iii treasury secretary nicholas brady national 
security adviser brent scowcroft white house chief of staff john 
sununu vice president dan quayle national security council aide 
bob pastorino and bernie aronson assistant secretary of 
statedesignate 
the group dicussed the debt crisis plaguing venezuela and other 
third world countries and perez described the economic reforms 
underway in his coiuntry said fitzwater bush encouraged them to 
continue with the reform effort he added 
they also talked about the administrations new plan to aid the 
contras in the efforts to bring about peace in nicaragua 
bush told perez that he wants to keep diplomatic pressure on 
nicaraguas ruling sandinistas to implement democratic reforms and 
he asked perezs support for that effort fitzwater said the 
spokesman said he had no further details of the meeting 
the meeting came as the administration was looking to the spring 
meetings of the international monetary fund and the world bank 
starting this weekend here for approval of its new plan to help 
third world nations ease their crushing 13 trillion debt burden 
perez has come to washington for the sessions which are 
attended by the finance ministers and other influential officials 
of the twin international lending organizations 151 member nations 
in the 7yearold crisis the burden of paying interest on 13 
trillion that developing nations owe has sapped their economies 
lowered living standards and led to growing political and economic 
unrest 
perez venezuelas new president blamed riots in his country 
last month that claimed 270 lives on intolerable and obscene 
debt repayment terms imposed by creditors he called on wealthier 
nations to do more to relieve the debt burden 
critics have complained that the administration plan named for 
brady has raised unreasonable expectations for debt relief in 
latin america and may end up fomenting political instability 
instead of helping relieve tensions 
a senior treasury official who asked not to be named said the 
administration saw perez as vital to selling the debtreduction 
process 
he views himself as a leader in latin america the official 
said here is a president with the blood of nearly 300 people to 
deal with and hes pretty courageous to stand by his economic 
reforms 
a second treasury official said if we get support on the debt 
program from perez i think it will be a success 
preliminary discussions began on friday with a meeting of 
finance officials representing debtor countries on sunday brady 
is hosting daylong discussions with the finance ministers and 
central bank presidents of the worlds largest industrial 
countries the us debt plan is expected to be the principal topic 
on the agenda 
these talks involving the united states japan west germany 
britain france canada and italy will take place at river farm 
an estate along the potomac river which once belonged to george 
washington 
the administration is looking for an endorsement of the new 
strategy so that the major creditor countries will present a united 
front when the brady plan is taken up at the monday and tuesday 
sessions of the imf and world bank 
under the brady plan commercial banks would be asked to forgive 
voluntarily a portion of the loans they have made to poor nations 
in return the imf and world bank would provide assurances that the 
remaining debt would be repaid 
the administration has estimated that over the next three years 
its proposals could result in wiping out about 70 billion of the 
340 billion in debt owed by 39 developing nations a group which 
includes all of the largest debtors and many of the smaller ones 
the imf and world bank would be expected to contribute about 12 
billion each over three years to spur the debt reduction effort 
the united states is also looking to japan and other countries 
which are running large trade surpluses to recycle some of that 
money into debt relief japan is expected to contribute between 5 
billion and 10 billion

iran resumed partial operations saturday 
at its warbattered abadan oil refinery after an eightyear 
shutdown during the war with iraq the official islamic republic 
news agency reported 
since the aug 20 ceasefire 7000 technicians and specialists 
have worked roundtheclock to rebuild the 3200acre complex irna 
said 
abadan only a few miles from the iraqi border and within sight 
of iraqi artillery throughout the war was knocked out early in the 
conflict that began in september 1980 
it was shelled almost daily and 158 refinery personnel were 
killed in the fighting the cost of the damage and lost production 
was estimated at more than 9 billion 
president ali khamenei inaugurated the newly built abadan plant 
in southwest khuzestan province irna said in a dispatch monitored 
in nicosia 
he told the technicians who rebuilt a 20megawatt power plant 
distillation towers storage tanks and other facilities from the 
twisted ruins you have proved that the iranian nation by 
relying on itself can emerge as a wonderful power 
the 70yearold refinery will start with a daily production 
capacity of 130000 barrels a day onefifth of its prewar 
capacity irna said 
but oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh who accompanied khamenei 
was quoted as saying production will be boosted over the next two 
to three years to 360000 barrels daily 
the reopening of the abadan complex came amid a major effort by 
the iranians to rebuild their battered oil industry and their 
refineries which were heavily bombed by iraqs powerful air force 
throughout the war 
abadans output will boost irans refinery capacity to an 
estimated 850000 barrels a day six other refineries have been 
repaired since the ceasefire 
most are operating 25 percent above their designated capacities 
to boost production of refined products such as fuel oil and 
kerosene 
oil industry experts consider the speed with which the iranians 
have restored their oil installations since the ceasefire to be a 
major development 
ian seymour editor of the respected nicosiabased middle east 
economic survey who visited iranian oil installations a few weeks 
ago noted that the reconstruction was a considerable 
achievement 
irans crude oil exports are the mainstay of its economy and 
account for some 90 percent of its foreign currency earnings

thai pirates massacred 45 
vietnamese refugees sailing in the south china sea and kidnapped 
about 11 women on the boat officials on saturday quoted two 
survivors as saying 
the pirates slashed the passengers with knives and threw them 
overboard before running their boat over the floating bodies to 
make sure no one was alive they said 
an old man and young boy were the only survivors of the attack 
that occurred within the past week said the officials who work 
with refugees and who spoke to the associated press on condition of 
anonymity 
the two hid under planks floating in the water and their boat 
later drifted to an esso oil co rig in the south china sea off the 
trengganu coast of malaysia the officials said the company is a 
subsidiary of exxon 
workers picked up the two monday and sent them to the malaysian 
government hospital in kuala trengganu 180 miles northeast of 
kuala lumpur 
this is one of the worst cases of piracy reported in recent 
years and the pirates nowadays kill the people after plundering 
the boats so that there would be no witnesses said a senior 
refugee official 
the refugee officials said the two survivors did not give a full 
account of their experience they did not say exactly when the 
attack took place or how many pirates took part there was no word 
on the fate of the kidnapped women 
the women are normally raped and either killed and dumped into 
the sea or abandoned in remote islands said another refugee 
official 
in january refugee officials said two vietnamese women were 
raped and dumped on a remote thai island before arriving at the 
camp the women reported that 26 people in their boat were killed 
by thai pirates late last year 
the government reported that in march about 2000 vietnamese 
refugees landed on malaysian shores almost double the average for 
the past few months there are now about 16500 vienamese boat 
people in malaysia 
malaysia and the nations of the region accept the refugees only

sikh religious minority who arrived in kabul on saturday said 22 
people were killed thursday in a sikh gurdwara or temple in 
jalalabad 
they said hundreds of people had taken refuge in the gurdwara as 
rocket and shell fire intensified and they said few people were 
venturing outside 
amani said 12000 to 14000 opposition fighters including what 
he said were pakistani militiamen in afghan costume were 
attacking jalalabad early in the week and an additional 3500 men 
had joined them by saturday he said the new fighters came from 
paktia and paktika provinces which are southwest of nangarhar 
province where jalalabad is located 
he did not say how many government soldiers were defending the 
city 
the government spokesman said the opposition on thursday fired 
16000 shells and rockets at jalalabad and that 2500 of them fell 
in residential areas and destroyed 13 houses 
on friday he said 900 more rockets and shells hit residential 
aras destroying 43 houses he did not give a total number of 
rounds fired on all targets friday 
amani also read a foreign ministry statement accusing the 
british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe of trying to reimpose 
british colonialism on afghanistan through its support for the 
moslem insurgency 
howe met moslem guerrilla leaders in pakistan last week 
in india on friday he said only a broadbased afghan government 
will bring peace he said he found the guerrilla leaders were 
willing to work for a government that will command a wide 
acceptance inside the country but he said such a government must 
not be imposed on the afghan people 
on feb 23 the guerrillas met in rawalpindi pakistan and 
elected a provisional government they hope will replace president 
najib and his sovietstyle peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
thousands of people have fled jalalabad since the fighting 
started and the kabul government says it does not know how many 
remain in the city 
jalalabad had a population of 200000 a decade ago but it 
generally was thought to have shrunk to less than half that number 
before the guerrilla offensive started the city is key for the 
insurgents for it would give them a base on afghan soil to set up 
their provisional government

congress is under mounting pressure to swiftly 
pass president bushs proposal to rescue the savings and loan 
industry but a dispute over accounting artistry threatens to knock 
the plan off the fast track 
the house and senate banking committees after six weeks of 
hearings begin writing their own versions of sampl legislation this 
week 
democrats on the house panel are meeting privately tuesday in 
preparation for public drafting sessions beginning two days later 
senators are also gathering behind closed doors this week before 
starting open meetings april 13 
i expect to see the bush proposal adopted without major 
surgery and on the presidents desk by may said consultant 
william issac a former chairman of the federal deposit insurance 
corp 
quick movement is nearly unprecedented for a major piece of 
legislation dealing with the financial system and the host of 
special interest groups representing its segments but this time 
fear is a driving force 
sampl depositors are withdrawing their funds in record amounts 
35 billion from november through february and members of 
congress are afraid to risk further deterioration 
sampl regulators at the federal home loan bank board say the huge 
withdrawals are not abnormal when interest rates rise and mutual 
funds and other competitors offer investors a better return 
however treasury secretary nicholas f brady and the white 
house budget director richard darman are telling congress that 
depositors are nervous because the presidents plan isnt in place 
brady used several speeches last week in dallas new york and 
washington to press the administration claim that we will 
continue to see withdrawals as long as our plan is not enacted into 
law 
some in congress even those with reservations about the plan 
are inclined to give bush what he wants and try to sidestep 
political blame if things go wrong if the plan works then it was 
congress that passed it if it doesnt then its the bush plan 
but other members of congress are looking to put their mark on 
the bill administration officials fear the most likely target will 
be bushs complex scheme to keep 50 billion in bailout money out 
of the budget deficit by creating a new government corporation to 
sell bonds 
sen donald w riegle jr dmich senate banking committee 
chairman and rep charles schumer dny say they can save more 
than 4 billion in interest costs by borrowing the 50 billion 
through regular treasury bonds they would carry a lower interest 
rate than the special offbudget bonds which also would be backed 
by the treasury but in a less direct fashion 
the riegleschumer plan would balloon the budget deficit for the 
current fiscal year ending sept 30 but it would avoid the 
automatic spending cuts under the grammrudman law because all of 
the 1989 deficit target deadlines have expired 
administration officials view this as a thinly disguised 
democratic attempt to bust grammrudman creating a precedent for 
big spending increases for other programs and ruining bushs 
chances of keeping his nonewtaxes pledge they argue that their 
own offbudget evasion of grammrudman is harder to duplicate 
another dispute this one an intrarepublican squabble between 
the administration and sen jake garn of utah the senior gop 
member of the banking panel had loomed as a potential roadblock 
garn whose former top aide m danny wall is chairman of the 
federal home loan bank board has enjoyed great influence at the 
bank board an independent agency 
the administration wants to transfer the bank boards deposit 
insurance fund to the fdic which already insures accounts at 
commercial banks and wrap the remainder of the agency into the 
treasury department 
garn is adamantly opposed to allowing what he calls the gnomes 
of treasury perceived to be more sympathetic to the interests of 
big banks and wall street than to sampls to get their clutches on 
the sampl agency 
bush advisers arent budging they say that if taxpayers are 
asked to bail out the industry then an executive branch 
department directly responsible to elected officials must control 
the regulators 
a potential compromise would put the regulatory functions of the 
bank board into the treasury department but leave its financing 
aspects independent the boards 12 regional banks borrow money on 
wall street at low interest rates funneling it to small and 
mediumsized sampls that dont have the clout to get the low rates on 
their own 
congressional aides predict garn will take the deal because he 
doesnt want to hold up the legislation and he faces several 
notsosubtle threats if he doesnt go along 
the administration if it was inclined could go along with a 
push by rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house 
banking committee to force wall to undergo reconfirmation by the 
senate 
the other big battle will be over the administrations proposal 
to force sampls to meet tougher capital standards 6 percent instead 
of 3 percent by june 1991 
capital represents the money an sampls owners have invested 
owners required to risk more of their own money before federal 
deposit insurance kicks in are likely to manage more carefully

the curious the devout and the doubting 
thomases are flocking by the hundreds to a roman catholic church to 
gaze upon a lifesize crucifix whose onceopen eyes reportedly 
closed during a good friday service 
i brought everyone who could fit in my car said evelyn 
borrelli 44 of glassport who drove about 40 miles with two 
children and five other adults to this ohio river mill town on 
friday 
i wanted to be as close as i could be and i wanted my 
children to experience it too i truly believe it was a miracle 
she said 
since easter when the good friday occurrence was reported in 
the media more than 1000 people from several states have been 
visiting the holy trinity church each day according to the rev 
vincent cvitkovic the church pastor 
the parking lot has been continually full and theres a 
constant stream of traffic on the narrow brick street in front of 
the white church 15 miles northwest of pittsburgh 
a spokesman for bishop donald wuerl head the roman catholic 
diocese of pittsburgh said church officials are withholding 
judgment on the event until they can complete an investigation 
but many of the worshipers say that miracle or not they feel 
better after gazing at the luminescent statue suspended on a cross 
15 feet above the altar 
its touching you feel cleansed said joanne smallwood 66 
of nearby aliquippa 
i feel a little bit calmer within myself said louise 
zbihley 51 also of aliquippa it just made my faith a little 
bit stronger 
the downcast eyes which now appear as small slits that conceal 
the pupils were about onethird open when the plaster crucifix was 
moved in january from a corner of the church where it hung at 
eyelevel it was suspended in a more prominent position in front 
of a modern stainedglass window depicting a resurrected christ 
cvitkovic said he often pointed out the crucifix to his 
congregation of 300 families saying it was unusual in that it 
depicted a stillliving christ with open eyes and mouth 
domenic leo of beaver an artist who helped restore the 
58yearold statue in january and had touched up the eyes with 
acrylic paint confirmed the eyes were open when the crucifix was 
hung 
but during a threehour prayer meeting on good friday 
worshipers noticed the eyes had almost closed 
cvitkovic said it would be nearly impossible for someone to have 
tampered with the crucifix because the church is locked when 
services are not held 
i dont know how to explain it said don otto of coraopolis 
who attended the good friday prayer meeting it was like 
electricity running through you it was an overwhelming experience 
tears came to me 
a member of the queen of peace prayer group which studies the 
virgin marys reported manifestations in the small yugoslavian 
village of medjugorje claimed he then received a spiritual message 
while on his knees praying following the service 
those who have come to holy trinity since the good friday event 
sit quietly hands folded and eyes transfixed on the crucifix 
some like clare paonessa who brought her 4yearold deaf 
daughter seek religious healing 
she can use all the help she can get through the blessed 
mother said mrs paonessa of sharpsburg 
some people are clearly moved breaking into tears while others 
come only out of curiosity 
im kind of skeptical said betsy odonnell 50 of 
pittsburgh people want miracles because of all the unhappiness 
in the world

the makers of a south african 
antiwar film have decided not to release it in this country after 
censors ordered 48 cuts 
the film the stick is based loosely on the undeclared 
border war fought by south african forces in recent years in 
northern namibia and southern angola it has been shown at several 
international film festivals and is scheduled to open commercially 
in the united states in may 
its director darrell roodt and producer anant singh said in 
a statement friday they had decided not to release it in south 
africa even though government censors lifted a ban imposed last 
year 
the film makers said the censors ordered 48 cuts barred anyone 
under 21 fron seeing the movie and ruled that it could only be 
shown in theaters with fewer than 200 seats 
the stick is a film that should be seen by south africans 
singh said however the number of excisions ordered would reduce 
the film to a simple exploitation picture and destroy the impact 
and power that it has now

a dispute between the international monetary 
fund and the world bank over setting conditions for third world 
loans has been settled a bank spokesman said saturday 
frank vogel a spokesman for the bank said the dispute was 
settled friday when bank president barber conable won approval for 
a new agreement from his board of executive directors 
the board represents the 151 governments that own the bank 
including the united states 
conables agreement was with michel camdessus the frenchman who 
is managing director of the international monetary fund which is 
owned by the same 151member nations 
vogel said the accord provides the fund with authority over 
aggregate macroeconomic policy which gives the imf the leading 
role in deciding how loans may affect the economy of a borrowing 
country the agreement also leaves a loophole for the bank to 
continue to make certain nondevelopment project loans 
the agreement seeks to end problems such as the one that cropped 
up last october when the two international lending organizations 
clashed heads over a loan to argentina

a man has confessed to killing his wife 
12 years ago in what authorities at the time thought was a traffic 
accident 
a confession by dennis potter 55 of humptulips was contained 
in sworn statements unsealed friday in grays harbor county superior 
court 
according to the documents potter said he was driven by guilt 
to approach county authorities two weeks ago and admit that he 
killed his wife in a fight i had no right to take her life he 
said 
she was making my life so miserable that i had to get rid of 
her potter told sheriffs deputies in his confession i 
decided i was going to enjoy my life a little bit and just lay her 
in the ground where she belonged 
potter was arrested friday for investigation of murder he was 
being held in the county jail pending a decision by county 
prosecutor steward menefree on whether to file charges 
earlier this week the county sheriffs office exhumed the body 
of norma l potter who was 40 when she died in 1976 an autopsy 
was conducted by the king county medical examiner and results have 
been sent to grays harbor authorities 
in statements to police potter described himself as driven by a 
rage because my wife would do nothing for me but she expected 
everything from me 
he said he has now realized his anger wasnt a sane way of 
thinking 
potter said that on the evening of nov 28 1976 he asked his 
wife to accompany him to a tavern in humptulips 80 miles southwest 
of seattle for a drink 
they went and each had a drink but she wouldnt talk to 
me he said 
the couple returned home but potter said his wife refused to 
come inside so i started after her 
i grabbed her by the coat front and hit her he said as 
far as i know it broke her jaw and knocked her unconscious she 
fell and i was still in such a rage that i got down alongside of 
her i guess i straddled her and started strangling her 
as his wifes breathing became fainter potter said he got to 
feeling sorry for her and tried to revive her with 
mouthtomouth resuscitation 
he decided to take her to a hospital but changed his mind on 
the way 
i thought if i took her to the hospital she could take me to a 
court of law to have me put away for being violent he said 
instead he drove down an isolated road where he decided to 
wreck the car to either kill us both or to see if one of us was 
worth saving 
he floored the accelerator and crashed the car into a bank of 
the twisting road when potter came to he was slumped over the 
wheel he noticed a cut on his forehead he told deputies 
his wife had been thrown 10 feet from the car potter said he 
approached where she lay and heard a rasping breath and she quit 
breathing 
had she not died at the scene potter later told police he 
would have taken a tire iron and beat her to death 
a court affidavit said investigating officers at the time 
accepted potters explanation of the accident and no autopsy was 
conducted even though his wife had indicated to a minister she 
feared for her life 
menefree the county prosecutor said the autopsy confirmed 
potters description of the fight he declined to give specifics 
but said autopsy results fit into the whole puzzle were piercing 
together

elbows saturday with critics actors and film makers in a 
comingout celebration of independent culture seven years after 
the icy chill of martial law

auditorium reflected the thaw taking place in poland this spring 
during talks between the solidarityled opposition and the 
communist authorities 
i never dreamed that an official meeting would be held for 
the outstanding creators of polish culture and activists of the 
second circulation publishers journalists editors printers 
distributors and workers in the conspiracy said publisher 
grzegorz boguta in a letter to the meeting 
has the moment finally arrived in which it is not necessary to 
fight with the secret police censorship and state administration

months ago that he was the director of nowa polands largest and 
oldest underground publishing house 
the independent culture forum was organized by the culture 
commission of the citizens committee an advisory group set up last 
year by solidarity leader lech walesa that functions as a sort of

state attorney general robert stephan filed 
for bankruptcy in federal court saying he couldnt pay a 200000 
judgment awarded to a former employee who sued him for sexual 
harassment 
he said friday that garnishment of onefourth of his 63000 
state salary combined with interest payments due on the award 
wouldnt leave him enough to live on while he appeals the case 
a lawsuit filed in 1982 by marcia tomson stingley was settled 
out of court but she later filed another lawsuit for breach of 
contract alleging that stephan had broken an agreement not to 
reveal terms of the settlement 
a federal court jury ruled in her favor last november and 
awarded her 200000 garnishment of stephans paycheck to begin 
paying off the judgment was to begin this month 
since action has been taken to garnish my wages declaring 
bankruptcy is my only alternative said stephan 56 
don krueger one of ms stingleys attorneys said he was angry 
at stephans action 
i think he ought to resign krueger said he used taxpayer 
dollars to defend his lawsuit and if he had the guts he would 
walk out and resign 
ms stingley was fired in 1982 after working three years in the 
attorney generals office as a file clerk 
in her 1982 lawsuit ms stingley accused stephan of making 
sexual advances on the job in a sworn deposition she also accused 
him of propositioning her daughter and friends of her daughter 
stephan and one of his supporters held a news conference in 
october 1985 and disclosed that ms stinley was paid 24000 to 
settle that lawsuit 
at the time stephan a republican was preparing for a bid for 
governor in 1986 but in november 1985 he dropped those plans 
saying the criticism and publicity surrounding the harassment case 
were unbearable he also said he regretted having settled the 
unfounded and ridiculous lawsuit 
by filing the chapter 7 bankruptcy petition friday stephan 
stops the garnishment starting with his next paycheck 
in the petition stephan listed his debts as unknown and gave 
his assets at 70401 all of which he said are protected from 
creditors under chapter 7 
despite his financial troubles stephan said i am proud of my 
record as attorney general and will continue to carry out my duties 
to the very best of my ability 
stephan is serving his third fouryear term as attorney general 
he has not indicated whether he intends to seek a fourth term next 
year

waters of monterey bay 
behind the scenes researchers prepare projects for months and 
years before the public gets a look yet less than five years after 
it opened on oct 20 1984 the 50 million monterey bay aquarium 
is far from a secret place 
it ranks with disneyland the san diego zoo and knotts berry 
farm as one of californias most popular attractions according to 
tourism figures the aquarium drew 17 million visitors last year 
the nonprofit aquarium located about 100 miles south of san 
francisco and built with a gift from david and lucile packard of 
computer giant hewlettpackard fame enjoys a reputation as one of 
the finest in the world 
i think ive always known about the monterey bay aquarium 
said visitor judy gray of atlanta on a recent weekday its like 
the golden gate bridge in san francisco 
sea otters remain the most popular attraction but visitors rave 
about the threestoryhigh 335000gallon kelp forest 
centerpiece display 
a dimly lit corridor snaking along the main 90footlong 
monterey bay habitat display gives visitors the impression they are 
viewing the sea from the ocean floor 
fresh sea water is pumped into the tanks to nourish animals and 
plants because rocks are too heavy for most of the displays 
artificial boulders made of fiberglass were placed on the ocean 
floor two years before opening day to create a weathered look and 
attract specimens 
then there are touch pools in which children and adults can 
stick their hands and feel sea life 
it was really neat because theyre really smooth 
10yearold isaac pierce said after stroking a bat ray as it swam 
by they are kinda slimy but really smooth silky smooth 
for the first time the aquarium has mounted a temporary exhibit 
devoted to marine life from beyond the monterey bay area 
mexicos secret sea displays spectacular tropical fish and 
other creatures native to the sea of cortez located between baja 
california and the mexican mainland 
by choosing the sea of cortez administrators took advantage of 
novelist john steinbecks historical link to monterey steinbeck 
and good friend ed doc ricketts a noted marine biologist and 
monterey resident ventured to the gulf area in 1940 for a sixweek 
expedition during which they collected thousands of specimens and 
cataloged 60 species new to science 
a team of aquarium researchers made a similar expedition to 
collect the animals for the 6000squarefoot exhibit which closes 
sept 4 
in one tank toothy moray eels peek from behind rocks evoking 
squeals of delight and disgust from passing schoolchildren 
i dont like them declared 8yearold lora kihorany of 
nearby soquel they can bite you he is long i mean long 
but the aquarium has caused some ill feelings in the community 
the crush of visitors has caused traffic problems and has changed 
the historically funky cannery row into more of a place for 
tourists a few nearby merchants complain about unwanted 
competition from the aquariums gift shop and restaurant 
but a new 1000space municipal parking lot has helped alleviate 
crowding and most merchants say the aquarium has ushered in a 
welcome business boom 
nobody likes to see the row change said kristan soboleski 
general manager of sly mcflys bar and grille which has had a 25 
percent increase in business since the aquarium opened yet she 
cringes at the memory of past slow winters 
aquarium officials are mum regarding future expansion although 
lucas confirmed some plans are under consideration 
officials would rather talk about the aquariums pioneering 
research like the breeding in captivity of the purplestriped 
jellyfish 
nobody has ever seen the young of this species before said 
dave powell director of animal husbandry only adults 
the team of about 20 aquarists all of whom are scuba divers who 
help gather animals for display are clearly proud of their work 
the aquarium is sort of like an onion said aquarist bruce 
upton the more you look the deeper you can go people spend two 
hours here but they could spend their lives

foreign creditors must cut latin 
nations high monthly payments on the regions 400 billion foreign 
debt before developing countries can stop environmental 
destruction latin officials said saturday 
a twoday un environmental meeting attended by cabinet 
ministers and ecologists from 32 countries ended saturday with the 
signing of a collective statement 
the debt cannot be paid under the present conditions without 
increasing the hunger and misery of our people or the 
degradation of our environment the document said 
according to the declaration the region must reverse the 
negative transfer of resources that has turned developing countries 
into capital exporters to industrialized countries 
latin nations last year paid 29 billion in interest to foreign 
creditors the ministers said brazil the developing worlds 
largest creditor pays 1 billion monthly in interest on its 115 
billion foreign debt 
the ministers called for new aid from international agencies 
such as the world bank to help fund environmental protection 
projects 
industrialized nations have an obligation to use financial and 
technological resources to reverse deterioration of the worlds 
environment the declaration said 
the serious environmental problem the world faces today 
derives mainly from the industrialization consumption and wasteful 
models adopted by developed nations the statement said 
latin nations have come under fire recently for not adopting 
appropriate environmental controls to protect wilderness areas in 
brazil where researchers estimate an area the size of belgium has 
already been slashed and burned from the vast amazon jungle the 
government has said it wont implement ecological programs at the 
expense of development

endangered sea turtles and humpback whales have 
been sighted off hawaii beaches soiled by at least 10000 gallons 
of oil from a mystery spill and officials were concerned about the 
longterm effects of oil on the animals 
crews saturday continued to clean bunker fuel oil from more than 
20 miles of beach on the islands of lanai and molokai two of the 
most undeveloped in the main hawaiian chain 
john naughton a biologist with the national marine fisheries 
service said he saw whales surfacing through an oil slick and 
witnessed green sea turtles feeding just off a tarred beach 
humpback whales and green sea turtles are both listed as endangered 
species 
although no marine animals had been harmed by the oil yet 
there may be some longterm effects he said 
naughton was particularly concerned about the sea turtles which 
feed on algae that may have been tainted by toxic substances in the 
oil 
oil was first spotted between molokai and lanai last sunday 
authorities said at the time the spill appeared minor and most of 
the oil would likely drift out to sea 
however the oil sullied a ninemile stretch of molokais south 
coast and about 10 miles of lanais shore in the form of tar balls 
and small puddles 
beachgoers have been warned said state health director john 
lewin 
the source of the spill has yet to be determined 
officials friday upgraded the spill from minor to 
medium although the precise amount of oil spilled had not been 
determined 
a medium spill means that at least 10000 gallons but less 
than 100000 gallons has spilled we cant be certain because we 
dont know the size of the tank that it came from and thats the 
best way to tell said coast guard spokesman keith spangler 
its definitely on the low side of the scale 
bunker fuel oil is less toxic than crude oil which comes 
straight from the ground and has more petroleum and other gases 
spangler said 
the incident was hawaiis second oil spill in less than a month 
on march 2 the tanker exxon houston broke loose from a mooring and 
ran aground off oahu spilling more than 30000 gallons of oil and 
polluting two miles of shoreline

a honolulu family is giving state lawmakers 
until the end of april to decide whether to buy picturesque palmyra 
island an uninhabited coral atoll 960 miles south of here the 
asking price 33 million 
otherwise the 600 acres of land within the 8000acre 
reefprotected atoll will go to the highest bidder preferably one 
who is willing to preserve the islands natural beauty said 
ainsley fullardleo the youngest of three brothers who own the 
island 
weve had it for a number of years now and were not in a 
position to develop it were getting on in years and feel it is 
time to sell it and move on said fullardleo 57 were giving 
the state the first chance at it 
i view the purchase with a manifest destiny mentality said 
sen russell blair who introduced the bill to buy the island it 
is something that could be tremendously important for hawaiis 
future generations 
people laughed at the louisiana purchase and sewards folly 
the 1867 purchase of alaska from russia for 7 million blair said 
gov john waihee said he is willing to give the purchase real 
consideration if the legislature decides to buy it the bill has 
been approved by the state senate and is pending before the house 
what makes palmyra especially attractive is its deep draft 
harbor an airstrip left over from world war ii and frequent 
rainfall said peter savio a realtor representing the family 
in recent years the island 200 miles north of the equator has 
served primarily as a stoppingoff place for yachtsmen he said 
university of hawaii scientists view it as ideal for a variety 
of oceanographic and marine life research and a possible site for 
equatorial space launches state administration officials say it 
could be a vaulable commercial and recreational fishing center 
most of the attention from private interests however appears 
to focus on building an exclusive resort on the flat ushaped 
string of islets that ring two deep lagoons with white sand beaches 
the family has in recent months had 10 offers in the range of 
30 million from a variety of us and japanese companies and one 
pacific nation but most have asked that they not be identified 
savio said 
we would like to see someone who is ecologically minded take 
over and preserve the wildlife and the birds there he said 
the island acquired by the fullardleos parents in 1922 from a 
business partner after a fishing enterprise fell on hard times has 
been a financial albatross for the family 
the family had to sell property in hawaii to pay for legal 
expenses during a sevenyear court fight with the us navy which 
contested the familys title to palmyra fullardleo said 
the family finally won clear title in a 1947 ruling by the us 
supreme court he said

a sweeping overhaul of the tax system took effect 
saturday befuddling consumers and shopkeepers and increasing 
opposition leaders calls for the resignation of japans already 
beleaguered prime minister 
the centerpiece of the reform is a new 3 percent consumption 
tax on everything from taxi rides to apartment rents at the same 
time the reform cuts corporate inheritance higherlevel income 
and residential taxes by 446 billion in fiscal 1989 
part of those cuts will be offset by the sales tax which the 
finance ministry has said will bring in 248 billion its first 
year 
it was japans first major tax overhaul since world war ii and 
shoppers found themselves confronting long lines as shopkeepers 
tried to adjust to the new system 
customers must wait longer at the register since were not 
used to calculating this tax yet said tokiko sekitake a clerk 
at a drugstore in downtown tokyo but they arent complaining 
most blame the government and sympathize with us 
dozens of city councils across japan criticized the tax and 
some have reportedly pledged not to implement it in certain sectors 
because of adjustments in a variety of taxes the reform 
affected goods unevenly some prices rose while others fell and 
others remained unchanged 
it lowered taxes on expensive imported liquor but increased the 
price of milk vending machine soft drink prices stayed the same 
television sets were cheaper but newspapers raised their 
prices the cost of a big mac hamburger at mcdonalds went from 
284 to 293 but because of altered service charges meals at 
posh restaurants became more affordable 
prices of foreign luxury cars and domestic autos dropped while 
taxi and subway fares increased taxes on automobiles will be cut 
from the present 15 percent to just 3 percent in three years 
the government granted a special exemption to small businesses 
meaning twothirds of japanese enterprises wont have to hand over 
the tax to the federal government small business and the 
agricultural sector are the mainstay of support for the governing 
liberal democratic party 
but many small enterprises such as independent taxis and 
discount stores raised their prices anyway to offset increased 
operating costs 
the government says the sales tax will fit the needs of japans 
current economy better than an income tax it claims the main goal 
of the reform plan is to distribute the tax burden more equitably 
by lightening the burden on middleincome workers 
but several groups including the 1 millionmember japan 
housewives association claim ambiguities in the reforms will lead 
to unfair price increases and even formation of pricefixing 
cartels 
soon after taking office in october 1987 prime minister noboru 
takeshita made tax reform a major goal last december his party 
which commands comfortable majorities in both houses of parliament 
voted the package into law despite the first noconfidence motion 
by opposition parties in five years 
but the tax reform and a stocktrading scandal involving 
takeshita and many of his partys elite have led to support ratings 
as low as 9 percent in recent opinion polls 
opposition party leaders repeated their calls for abolition of 
the tax and for takeshita to resign 
prime minister takeshita has said there will come a day when 
people will be glad the sales tax was implemented socialist 
party secretary general tsuruo yamaguchi said in a speech today 
that is the lie of the century

in a rare admission for a society that long 
claimed to have eliminated poverty a communist party researcher 
said saturday that most soviet citizens lack the cash for a 
rational consumer budget 
the researcher g zhuravlyov of the academy of social sciences 
of the partys central committee didnt quite admit poverty exists 
in the soviet union but he came very close in his article in 
vechernyaa moskva evening moscow 
for a long time no one talked about poverty zhuravlyov 
wrote 
despite claims that poverty does not exist in socialist 
countries at least 40 million soviets can be described as poorly 
supplied he said 
going further zhuravlyov said that if it is assumed that a 
rational consumer budget is 250300 rubles 400480 per person 
if the low purchasing ability of the ruble and growth of prices is 
taken into account then more than half of the countrys 
population with per capita incomes of less than 125 rubles 200 
per month cannot be called rich 
the average industrial salary in the soviet union is 347 a 
month most families live in tight quarters with rents of 40 to 
65 a month but a pair of boots costs about a months pay 
zhuravlyov also pointed to new research showing families with 
the lowest cash incomes also have some of the smallest living 
spaces typically allocated by government authorities 
the poorest families with per capita incomes under 112 per 
month have just 27 to 45 square feet of living space per person 
he wrote 
many of the poorest are simply lowincome families with three 
and four children zhuravlyov wrote such large families are a 
rarity in russia though not in the central asian republics of the 
soviet union

four women who began a hunger strike march 20 to 
demand the return of a provincial church to religious use were 
hauled off the church steps saturday by police and ambulance 
personnel a human rights activist said 
alexander ogorodnikov editor of the bulletin and chronicle 
newspaper in moscow said the four women have refused even water in 
their fast in ivanovo 150 miles northeast of moscow 
before dawn saturday six carloads of police and ambulance 
personnel took the women to a local hospital after taking them away 
from the church where they have been since last month their 
relatives have been denied access to them ogorodnikov said 
the women want the church built in 1914 and known as the 
vedenskaya or krasni church returned to religious use since 1938 
it has housed the city archives which are soon to be moved to a 
new building 
most churches in the soviet union are closed or used for 
nonreligious purposes however a few most notably the cathedral 
in vilnius lithuania have been returned to use as churches in the 
past year as president mikhail gorbachev eases restrictions on the 
practice of religion 
ogorodnikov quoted the local communist party chief identified 
only as knyazuk as saying the hunger strikers could continue for a 
year but the church would never be returned for worship 
the women were identified as valeria savchenko 41 a cleaning 
woman larissa kholina 53 a dentist her daughter margarita 
spelenkova 28 and galina yeshukovskaya 43 a lawyer 
the hunger strike began march 20 at an ivanovo movie theater 
with eight people but two men and two women dropped out the 
strikers were forcibly removed tossed in trucks and taken to the 
steps of the church where a wooden fence was erected and a 
policeman stationed to prevent them from talking to the the public 
the activist said 
ivanova with a population of 500000 currently has one active 
church large enough for 300 people ogorodnikov said

iraqis crowded polling stations nationwide 
saturday to elect a new 250member national assembly in what was 
seen as the first step toward democracy after 20 years of oneparty 
rule 
twelve hours of voting ended at 8 pm and election committee 
officials began counting votes in more than 900 polling stations 
around the country 
officials said the turnout was relatively high but exact 
figures were not immediately available 
they said the first returns would be announced sunday with final 
results not expected until monday 
about 2 million of the estimated 8 million voters live in the 
capital baghdad which had 59 polling stations 
the governmentcontrolled media called the election the first 
since the aug 20 ceasefire in the war with iran a celebration 
of democracy and called on iraqis to cast ballots as a national 
duty 
columnist daoud alfarhan wrote in the alqaddissiya newspaper 
that voters should elect people who would work for a permanent 
constitution general freedoms a multiparty system reasonable 
prices housing for all improved social services comprehensive 
health insurance defense of human rights and battling embezzlers 
and thieves 
the assembly is expected to endorse a new constitution and a new 
law establishing a multiparty system after 20 years of rule by the 
arab baath socialst party 
polling day was declared a national holiday to ensure a big 
voter turnout and stores and offices were closed 
nearly 700 independent candidates more than in two previous 
assembly elections ran for the parttime legislature 
in addition there were 260 candidates from the ruling party 
although authorities have stressed they are not members of an 
official ticket 
fortytwo candidates were dropped at the last minute when it was 
discovered in snap tests they could not read or write the 
revolutionary command council announced friday night 
the assembly elected to a fouryear term shares legislative 
power with the council which must ratify draft laws and also has 
veto power 
diplomats and political analysts say the election outcome may 
influence future policymaking by enabling independents to play a 
bigger role in decision making 
but no timetable has been set for the political reforms and 
they are not expected to reduce president saddam husseins personal 
power 
a referendum will be held on the new constitution which will 
replace an interim charter approved in 1969 one year after the 
baath party seized power in a bloodless coup 
the elections originally were set for last aug30 but were 
postponed until march 3 after the unsponsored ceasefire in the 
gulf war took effect the second delay was to allow more 
independents to run the government said 
the candidates including 62 women and many gulf war veterans 
staged lowkey campaigns confined under government rules to making 
brief speeches to organized gatherings and answering a few 
questions 
their campaigns were funded by the government and candidates 
were banned from using any of their own financial resources

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev arrives in 
havana sunday for talks that focus attention on the contrast 
between president fidel castros doctrinaire marxism and the 
pragamatic reforms of his communist sponsor 
it will be the soviet leaders first visit to a latin american 
country and only his third meeting with castro who traveled to 
moscow for the 27th communist party congress after gorbachev took 
power and participated in the november 1987 kremlin ceremonies 
marking the 70th anniversary of the bolshevik revolution 
in addition to the formal talks beginning monday gorbachev will 
participate in ceremonial wreath layings and visit a health clinic 
a genetic engineering center and a crew of people who build 
housing on a voluntary basis 
he is expected to address the national assembly in a nationally 
broadcast speech tuesday and leaves the next day for london and 
meetings with prime minister margaret thatcher and queen elizabeth 
ii 
gorbachev will be accompanied by his wife raisa 
both nations have stressed in recent public statements the 
friendly nature of the visit and the healthy relations between the 
two communist countries 
but castro in the past has been openly critical of 
perestroika gorbachevs ambitious modernization program for 
borrowing freemarket concepts from capitalism there are 
indications the soviets have substantially reduced their aid to the 
island nation 90 miles off the florida coast 
the soviets highlighted another difference in the two systems 
when they held a news conference in havana on friday to trumpet the 
soviet unions march 26 parliamentary elections 
in cuba most forms of dissent are still banned as 
counterrevolutionary and can carry long prison terms 
at a time when gorbachev is searching for new ideas and 
proposing experiments to spur economic development castro has 
warned that financial incentives for individuals and decentralizing 
the economy are dangerous 
we must watch over the ideological purity of the revolution 
castro told his nation on the 30th anniversary of his victory on 
july 26 that is why we cannot use any methods that reek of 
capitalism 
soviet officials and western observers agree gorbachev is 
unlikely to lecture the cuban leader in public or respond directly 
to his charges that soviet reforms take too much from capitalism 
that would be seen as a direct contradiction of gorbachevs 
oftenstated view that there is no one correct route to socialist 
development 
diplomats in havana and moscow said it is unlikely gorbachev is 
willing to continue subsidizing the cuban economy at present levels 
while faced with widespread shortages deficit spending and 
increasingly difficult economic problems at home 
according to us estimates the kremlin provides cuba from 4 
billion to 6 billion annually in economic and military assistance 
and the aid programs and subsidies account for as much as 20 
percent of the cuban gross national product 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonynmity said the 
soviets already appear to have reduced their purchases of cuban 
sugar which they buy at higherthanmarket prices as a way of 
providing cuban foreign aid 
some diplomats said they expect gorbachev to tell castro bluntly 
but in private that cuban must put its economic house in order 
but they suggest gorbachev may make a public show of superpower 
support by announcing the soviet unions willingness to forgive all 
or part of cubas ruble debt which has accumulated in the 30 years 
since the cuban revolution 
to forgive a debt that is unlikely ever to be repaid actually 
would cost gorbachev very little one diplomat said while raising 
the ante for western industrialized countries that hold most of the 
third world debt 
gorbachev told the united nations in december the soviet union 
was prepared to offer the leastdeveloped countries a moratorium on 
debt service and in quite a few cases to write off the debt 
altogether if the west would go along with a program to solve the 
debt problems of poorer countries

three us mine sweepers and a support 
vessel steamed out of the persian gulf on saturday in the biggest 
pullout of american warships from the region since the iraniraq 
ceasefire 7 months ago 
the tank landing ship uss peoria sailed through the strait of 
hormuz as escort for the mine sweepers fearless inflict and 
illusive bound for us east coast ports 
their departure left 10 navy ships in the gulf including three 
mine sweepers with a nineship carrier battle group in the north 
arabian sea the us fleet was reduced to fewer than 20 ships for 
the first time since the massive western naval buildup of mid1987 
a navy official said the withdrawal of the three mine sweepers 
was decided after consultations with our friends in the gulf 
and is consistent with the reduced threat to shipping since the 
aug 20 ceasefire 
the truce ended eight years of hostilities that had spread to 
the oilrich gulf the fighting damaged or sank about 540 
commercial ships and killed 300 sailors 
the united states sharply expanded its force in the gulf to 
protect usflag shipping and to escort 11 kuwaitowned oil 
tankers that were reregistered under the stars and stripes 
kuwaits shipping was being targeted by iranian gunboats because of 
its support for iraq 
five western european governments also sent extra warships and 
at one time the foreign navies in the region had a combined 
strength of nearly 80 ships the others have largely withdrawn 
since the ceasefire 
us military sources said that apart from the three remaining 
us mine sweepers whose future is uncertain the latest 
withdrawal may be the last by the united states 
navy sources said the 8450ton peoria will escort the three 
departing sweeps back to the east coast and return to its port 
in san diego 
the fearless and illusive are based in charleston sc and the 
inflict in little creek va 
the 720ton woodenhulled mine sweepers were built just after 
the korean war in the early 1950s and are the oldest us navy 
ships on active duty 
derided by critics as too old and outmoded the us mine 
sweepers outstripped the more modern european mine sweepers in 
disposing of mines laid by iran in the gulf 
the sources said the three departing vessels were credited with 
about half of more than 50 mines found and destroyed by the us 
antimine ships since they arrived in november 1987 
us officers have said that despite the ceasefire a threat 
from undiscovered mines laid by both iran and iraq will persist in 
the gulf especially in its northern waters 
four previous cutbacks of the us force since the ceasefire 
had involved only one warship at a time 
the united states also has approved the deflagging of six of 
the 11 kuwaiti tankers but the process has been stalled for over a 
month reportedly over legal details

air force col steve canyon a comic strip 
character who perhaps has done as much for the morale of his 
service as anyone is retiring after a career full of military 
honors 
a service is planned monday in columbus on the ohio state 
university campus to honor the comics page hero created by dayton 
native and ohio state graduate milton caniff 
caniff died april 3 1988 at age 81 and the last steve canyon 
strip appeared in sunday newspapers june 5 
air force personnel prepared a biography and list of canyons 
exploits and will present it to the university an exhibit will be 
set up in the journalism schools library recently dedicated to 
caniffs memory 
through steve canyon milt caniff did a lot to keep up the 
spirits of fliers and the air force said 1st lt lynn ellen 
bryant he really became a part of air force lore and people 
remember 
ohio state spokesman leon rubin said the presentation was the 
air forces idea canyon is said to have attended ohio state before 
joining the army air corps the predecessor of the air force in 
1947 
ms bryant said the air force went through all the old canyon 
comic strips compiling a personnel record for the character 
through his 1988 retirement 
people here at mcguire air force base in new jersey and in 
new york have dedicated a lot of time energy and imagination to 
the project ms bryant said we are very happy and honored to 
do something that will be seen by others and is going to last 
canyons service record includes decorations citations 
movement orders for each base family data all sorts of good 
stuff she said the air force decided that since his record was 
so varied the character should be assigned to the office of 
special investigations 
that also allowed us to say certain things were classified 
and we coudnt discuss them ms bryant said 
the air force will present a modern uniform with canyons

thirteen trucks flying the blue flag of 
the united nations rolled out of the capital saturday one of the 
first shipments of a 132million relief operation aimed at feeding 
25 million people in the south 
before the rainy season begins in early may operation lifeline 
aims to position at depots more than 100000 tons of food 
blankets tents and medical supplies to keep alive those displaced 
by famine and civil war 
trucks airplanes trains and nile river barges are being 
pressed into duty in the project which for the first time includes 
deliveries to villages and areas under control of christian and 
animist rebels fighting the moslemdominated government 
for the first time both the government and the rebel sudan 
peoples liberation army have promised not to attack or otherwise 
hinder the relief shipments previous efforts were hampered by one 
side or the other for political or military reasons 
in nairobi vincent oreilly the un media spokesman for 
operation lifeline said a convoy of five trucks under un 
sponsorship carrying 30 tons of food left kenya on friday on 
monday a 60truck convoy is scheduled to leave with 1000 tons of 
food and 10 tons of medical supplies tarpaulins and pallets 
the drivers who left khartoum were on a risky 450mile journey 
to the western village of muglad just north of the war zone 
already 12000 southerners were sheltered in muglad in midmarch 
and hundreds more have been arriving daily 
the drivers were to to take their vehicles over roads that 
hardly deserve the name and nervously close to kadugli capital of 
southern kordofan region where heavy fighting has been reported in 
recent weeks 
if we dont do this the disaster will be roughly equal to the 
disaster of hiroshima said james a grant the un official 
coordinating operation lifeline sudan or in recent history it 
will be four times larger a disaster than armenia last fall 
soviet officials estimated 25000 people died in the massive 
earthquake that struck armenia in december an estimated 78000 
people died when the united states dropped the atomic bomb on 
hiroshima on aug 6 1945 in its war against japan and up to 
140000 died within a few months 
nobody knows how many people already have died in sudans 
6yearold civil war western relief experts put the figure from 
1988 alone at 250000 to 500000 or more some think as many as 2 
million have died since the war began in 1983 mostly civilians 
driven from their homes who either perished while seeking shelter 
or left to starve in refugee camps or besieged towns 
grant special representative of un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar described the sudanese operation as a race 
against time and a mission impossible that could be possible with 
the cooperation of everybody 
prime minister sadek mahdis government previously refused to 
allow relief agencies to deal with the rebels 
rebel gunners have shot down at least two civilian passenger 
planes and one relief plane and have fired on several others 
claiming the government uses civilian and relief aircraft to 
transport troops and military supplies the rebels also have been 
blamed for attacks on relief trucks barges and trains that have 
killed dozens of people

backtoback visits by egyptian president 
hosni mubarak and israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir during the 
coming week will force the bush administration to come to grips 
with problems in the middle east but there will be no rush to 
judgment 
it would be nice if we could see concrete progress so far as 
the peace process is concerned a wellplaced us official said 
friday but we ought not to set markers up out there that may or 
may not be realized 
mubarak and shamir will focus on the palestinian uprising on the 
west bank and in gaza but in vastly different ways 
the egyptian leader whose country signed a peace treaty with 
israel in 1979 is lobbying for a middle east peace conference and 
a seat at the table for the palestine liberation organization 
mubarak arrived by helicopter from andrews air force base about 
430 pm est at a spot between the washington monument and lincoln 
memorial and was met by secretary of state james a baker iii and a 
military honor guard neither of them talked with reporters before 
leaving by motorcade 
he plans a quiet weekend before talks open on monday with 
defense secretary dick cheney 
shamir who accuses the plo of unrelenting terrorism despite 
public renunciation last december by chairman yasser arafat will 
propose to president bush and to baker that elections be held on 
the west bank and in gaza 
the idea said avi pazner his media adviser is to designate 
palestinian leaders to negotiate with israel shamir is not a man 
who can be pressured pazner said so this does not come from a 
sense of pressure he wants to move the peace process forward 
the us official who barred use of his name and title said 
bush and baker were hoping shamir would bring some new ideas and 
some new proposals 
he begged off evaluating shamirs elections proposal on the 
grounds it is vague but the official pointed out that israel had 
been trying to talk to palestinians on the west bank and in gaza 
without success 
bush and baker now in the midst of reviewing us foreign 
policy in the middle east and other regions as well are reluctant 
to outline a us plan for arabisraeli negotiations 
if we move too fast or at too high a level it could preempt 
more promising possibilities that might present themselves the 
official said we would like to see the israelis come with new 
ideas and new proposals 
baker in testifying last month before a congressional 
subcommittee said his goal was direct negotiations between 
israelis and palestinians he also said israel might have to deal 
with the plo in order to have a meaningful dialogue 
another shamir idea was shot down even before mubaraks arrival 
two weeks ago shamir proposed that the egyptian leader meet 
with him on us soil to try to find ways to resolve the 
palestinian problem but mubarak turned him down pazner said 
the proposal apparently had the approval of the bush 
administration in a way it would have recreated the meetings 
former president carter held at camp david md in 1978 with the 
late egyptian president anwar sadat and former israeli prime 
minister menachem begin 
the agreements reached at the presidential retreat produced a 
peace treaty in 1979 between egypt and israel and called for 
palestinian autonomy on the west bank and in gaza 
but mubarak through the egyptian embassy in tel aviv rejected 
the proposal pazner said 
another us official said meanwhile we would support any 
meeting that would advance prospects for peace but the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity declined to discuss the 
substance of shamirs overture 
a diplomatic source also insisting on anonymity said mubarak 
had concluded shamir would neither agree to negotiate with the plo 
nor approve an international peace conference on the arabisraeli 
conflict 
apparently mubarak suspected shamir was seeking egypts 
blessing for the elections that the israeli leader will propose to 
bush and baker be held among palestinian arabs on the west bank and 
in gaza so the source said mubarak turned shamir down 
egypt has been trying to use the leverage of its relations with 
israel to promote talks with the plo but pazner said we want to 
find an alternative to the plo and the best way to find a 
palestinian leadership is to hold elections the prime minister 
wants to find a solution to the problem 
mubarak will meet with bush and baker on monday the president 
will take him to baltimore monday afternoon to see the baltimore 
orioles and boston red sox open the baseball season mubarak then 
will meet with baker again on tuesday 
shamir will hold his talks with the president and secretary of 
state on wednesday and thursday 
israel blames the plo for instigating the violence on the west 
bank and in gaza in which 415 palestinians and 18 israelis have 
died since the uprising began in december 1987 pazner said israeli 
intelligence had intercepted orders from the plo which has its 
headquarters in tunisia calling for increased disorder while 
shamir is in washington

reinforced mexican antidrug units 
began stopping and searching cars at roadblocks along the us 
border saturday in a major operation expected to last at least 
several weeks officials reported 
an operation was established along all of the border said 
jose silva arroyo narcotics supervisor for the federal judicial 
police in matamoros across the border from brownsville texas 
judicial police the army and federal highway police backed by 
planes and helicopters are taking part in the operation according 
to silva arroyo and other antinarcotics officials in northern 
cities 
felipe flores spokesman for the attorney generals office said 
friday the campaign was possibly the largest of its kind he 
said the united states and mexico were sharing intelligence 
information in the effort 
in washington bill alden of the us drug enforcement 
administration said he had no information about a major operation 
there are checkponts on the major highways to detect weapons 
and drugs luis esteban garcia villalon a police official in 
ciudad juarez said by telephone 
he said among the personnel added for the campaign were 1000 
federal police and more agents of the federal attorney generals 
office 
when there is someone who seems suspicious they are making 
detailed checks garcia villalon said 
he said the operation would last indefinitely depending on the 
results we think its going to be a considerable length of 
time he said 
the operation extends along a broad swath of the northern border 
and at least as far south as near the city of chihuahua a police 
commander said 
flores said the program was patterned after operation alliance 
a usmexican project started in august 1986 that involved 
hundreds of us agents and millions of dollars in surveillance 
equipment to detect flights ferrying drugs across the border 
edwin meese iii us attorney general at the time called that 
operation the most widespread interdiction program on our land 
borders in law enforcement history 
narcotics smuggling has been one of the most sensitive issues 
between the united states and mexico some us officials have 
called for a greater effort by mexico to stop the flow of drugs 
into the united states 
mexico regularly cites its antinarcotic efforts and says the 
united states should attack the widespread demand for drugs at home 
on saturday the government newspaper el nacional said federal 
highway police seized more than 20000 pounds of marijuana and 
1879 pounds of cocaine in the first three months of the year

austria on saturday buried its last 
empress zita with all the pomp and pageantry of a vanished 
monarchy that for centuries ruled territory from poland to the 
mediterranean 
the nations biggest funeral since emperor franz joseph was 
buried in 1916 in the waning days of the hapsburg empire seemed 
like an act of reconciliation with the family that brought austria 
greatness but was driven into exile after world war i 
an elaborate requiem mass in viennas towering st stephens 
cathedral climaxed a week of ceremonies honoring zita who died in 
switzerland two weeks ago at 96 when she and her husband left the 
country in 1918 she was denounced as a spy for her role in a plot 
to end the war 
police estimated the number of spectators at 40000 including 
hundreds from hungary italy yugoslavia and other parts of what 
was once the hapsburg empire 
state television broadcast the ceremony live and the nations 
largestcirculation daily neue kronen zeitung bore the headline 
farewell to zita printed against a background of imperial 
hapsburg yellow 
zitas son otto von hapsburg who fled viennas sprawling 
schoenbrunn palace with his parents led mourners who included 
president kurt waldheim 
all europes roman catholic royal houses sent representatives 
but no crowned heads attended the fourhour ceremony which drew 
curious sometimes bemused spectators in an outpouring of nostalgia 
for the glory of the empire 
the austrohungarian monarchy was the best state for central 
europe said abel paizs a 21yearold hungarian who called 
himself a monarchist and came from budapest for the occasion the 
small countries dont function as well separately 
an austrian woman who refused to identify herself said she had 
always been a monarchist adding nothing better has come after 
the monarchy 
between passages from the soaring requiem of viennas most 
beloved composer wolfgang amadeus mozart the mass was laced with 
tributes to the huge hapsburg empire that stretched north to 
poland south to northern italy and east to what is now the soviet 
union 
intercessions were read in each language of the polyglot empire 
german italian hungarian croat slovene czech and polish 
at the end of the twohour mass the old imperial hymn that was 
replaced with a republican anthem in 1918 rang through the vaulted 
naves of the gothic cathedral 
cardinal hans hermann groer in a brief address said the 
singing of the hymn is not nostalgia or flirting with a 
different state or political system 
he recalled that zita who always refused to abdicate formally 
had before her death expressed confidence that the peoples of the 
former empire would live well 
zita who was also queen of hungary will be honored at a 
separate mass in budapest on monday hungarys cardinal laszlo 
pasksai attended saturdays ceremony 
an isolated crowd of protesters held aloft a banner that said 
the empress is dead long live the republic police detained 
at least two people when they tried to unfurl another banner 
outside the imperial vault where zita was buried 
at the vaults doors an ancient ceremony was reenacted in 
which a monk asked who wants to enter and allowed the coffin 
in only when zita was identified not by her string of imperial 
royal and aristocratic titles but as a mortal and a sinner 
following an ancient family custom zitas heart was buried in 
the swiss village of muri with that of her husband muri is a 
traditional resting place for the hearts of some hapsburgs 
zitas hearse was the same as that used for franz josephs last 
journey to the capuchin vault where all the hapsburg emperors 
except zitas husband charles i are buried charles i franz 
josephs nephew was buried on the portuguese island of madeira 
where he died in exile at age 34 67 years to the day before the 
elaborate funeral accorded his widow 
charles became emperor of austria and king of hungary after the 
death of franz joseph who reigned 68 years 
when charles and zita were crowned they believed only a rapid 
truce could save the crumbling dual monarchy then allied with the 
reich of the german kaiser zita had a key role in arranging secret 
contacts with the allies in search of a peace treaty 
after charles death zita and the couples eight children lived 
on the sufferance of other european royal families the outbreak of 
world war ii found them in belgium but they managed to flee the 
advancing nazi troops and eventually landed in the united states 
after the war zita eventually settled in a modest tworoom 
apartment in a swiss convent close to the austrian border austria 
allowed her to return in 1982

a judge faced growing criticism saturday for 
deciding that cultural considerations warranted a light sentence 
for a chinese immigrant who beat his wife to death because she was 
unfaithful 
the new york city chapter of the national organization for women 
announced that it would complain to the state commission on 
judicial conduct in the next two weeks to protest the sentence of 
five years probation 
i think the judge has shown both prejudice and bias by giving 
the husband probation said francoise jacobsohn the chapter 
president it is not acceptable for a man to kill his wife for 
any reason 
judge edward pincus cited cultural aspects thursday in 
sentencing dong lu chen 51 to probation in the slaying of his 
wife jian wan chen 40 
the judge noted the effect of his wifes behavior on someone 
who is essentially born in china raised in china and took all his 
chinese customs with him to the united states 
attempts to reach pincus by telephone saturday were unsuccessful 
chen a garment factory worker was convicted of seconddegree 
manslaughter for fatally striking his 99pound wife in the head 
eight times with a hammer on sept 7 1987 
pincus in a fiveday nonjury trial in december acquitted him 
of seconddegree murder and firstdegree manslaughter 
chens lawyer stewart orden said chen was unable to form the 
intent necessary for seconddegree murder or firstdegree 
manslaughter partly because of the overwhelming shame and 
humiliation his wifes adultery caused him 
brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman denounced the 
ruling saying there should be one standard of justice not one 
that depends on the cultural background of a defendant 
orden said he didnt argue at trial that it was acceptable in 
china to act violently towards an act of indiscretion or 
infidelity but referred to his clients cultural background to 
show his state of mind at the time of the slaying 
trial testimony showed that chen emigrated from canton china in 
1986 he left his wife 16yearold son and 18yearold daughter in 
brooklyn when he moved to maryland to find work as a dishwasher 
shortly after he returned to brooklyn he confronted his wife in 
their bedroom about her infidelity and beat her when she said they 
couldnt resume sexual relations according to andrea bernstein a 
spokeswoman for holtzman

franklin a korn a bell telephone 
laboratories researcher who helped create touchtone telephones and

a rogue computer program designed at cornell 
university that crippled a nationwide computer network last fall 
was neither the creation of a genius nor the act of a criminal a 
university commission has concluded 
cornell graduate student robert morris alone created the program 
that infected thousands of military and university computers on 
nov 2 1988 says the panels 45page report obtained saturday by 
the associated press 
morris 23 who is on a leave of absence from cornells doctoral 
program in computer science declined to be interviewed by the 
commission which was left to speculate as to the reasons morris 
created the worm 
it may simply have been the unfocused intellectual meanderings 
of a hacker completely absorbed with his creation and unharnessed 
by considerations of explicit purpose or potential effect the 
panel wrote 
technically the program was not a virus which inserts 
itself into a host program to propagate it was actually a 
worm or an independent program that endlessly duplicates 
itself once placed in a computer system 
cornell officials and members of the special panel were 
scheduled to discuss their findings at a news conference at 10 am 
monday 
morris of arnold md remains under investigation by a federal 
grand jury in syracuse and by the us justice department in 
washington dc 
the panel rejected the idea that morris created the worm to 
point out the need for greater computer security 
this was an accidental byproduct of the event and the 
resulting display of media interest the commission wrote 
society does not condone burglary on the grounds that it 
heightens concern about safety and security 
the program could have been created by many students graduate 
or undergraduate particularly if they were aware of the cornell 
systems wellknown security flaws 
it is no act of genius or heroism to exploit such 
weaknesses the commission said 
morris a firstyear student should have reported the flaws he 
discovered which would have been the most responsible course of 
action and one that was supported by his colleagues the panel 
wrote 
the commission found that morris probably wanted to spread the 
worm without detection but did not want to clog the computers it 
said he clearly should have known the worm would replicate 
uncontrollably and accused morris of reckless disregard for the 
consequences 
once the worm was unleashed morris made only minimal 
efforts to stop its spread and did not inform any person in a 
position of responsibility about the existence of the program the 
commission reported 
the panel disputed industry claims that the worm caused about 
96 million in damage especially considering no work or data 
were irretrievably lost 
the episodes greatest impact may be a loss of trust among 
scholars who use the network which links research centers and 
universities that exchange nonclassified information 
the report said computer science professionals seem to favor 
strong disciplinary measures but the commissison said they 
should not be so stern as to damage permanently the perpetrators 
career 
the panel also recommended cornell develop a universitywide 
policy on computer abuse

friday a federal magistrate in charlotte gave him permission to 
move there 
dawsey would not say whether bakkers wife tammy faye or other 
family members were staying at the retreat 
its a place for ministers to come and rest and recuperate 
dawsey said in a telephone interview most pastors that come here 
have been hurt or devastated or have emotional problems or 
distress

george to live and to broadcast the jim and tammy show at 
least temporarily

of their home outside pineville nc near charlotte but they 
were told the operation violated mecklenburg countys zoning 
ordinance and must cease by may 7 
bakker resigned from the ptl ministry in march 1987 after a 1980 
tryst with a church secretary jessica hahn and subsequent 
payments to her were revealed the assemblies of god later stripped 
him of his ministerial credentials and the ptl ministry filed for 
protection under the bankruptcy laws 
in december bakker and his former top ptl aide richard dortch 
were indicted on mail fraud wire fraud and conspiracy charges 
stemming from a 16month federal grand jury probe into ptl and its 
fundraising practices 
bakker who is free on 50000 bond must agree to conditions 
outlined by taylor according to court documents obtained by the 
charlotte observer 
bakker cannot leave florida without permission from court 
officials and he must maintain weekly and monthly contact by 
telephone and in person with court officials in jacksonville

couldnt comment on where bakker planned to tape his show 
neither bakker nor his attorney could be reached for comment 
saturday dawsey said bakker would not take telephone calls at the 
retreat there was no answer saturday at the charlotte home of

two cubans who gained asylum in the peruvian 
embassy nine years ago have returned home after receiving 
government assurances they will be allowed to leave the country 
diplomatic sources said saturday 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said felino 
ramirez batista 58 and eduardo herrera dia 39 left the embassy 
friday after accepting a promise by the cuban government that they 
will be permitted to emigrate within six months 
their departure brought to an end a series of events that began 
in the spring of 1980 and culminated in the mariel boat lift when 
125000 cubans fled to the united states between april and 
september 
the two were among some 10000 cubans who entered the peruvian 
embassy in early april 1980 hoping to leave their island homeland 
and its communist government 
the people packed into the embassy after cuba removed its 
security guards from outside the complex because of a dispute with 
peru 
virtually all of the cubans in the peruvian embassy were allowed 
to leave the country president fidel castros government opened 
the port of mariel to cubans wishing to emigrate to the united 
states and the massive exodus began 
but ramirez and herrera refused to leave the embassy fearing 
they would be arrested 
a companion pedro betancourt 30 left the embassy last october 
and departed for canada two weeks ago and that apparently gave the 
two holdouts confidence they could leave the grounds safely and 
then emigrate a peruvian consular official said 
in an effort to break the deadlock over ramirez and herrera the 
cuban and peruvian governments signed an agreement last may under 
which cuba promised to allow them to emigrate within six months of 
their departure from the embassy 
but the two questioned cubas assurances and they staged a 
hunger strike during a visit in september by officials of the un 
human rights commission 
the peruvian embassy provided the two cubans with food and 
clothing during their stay the two spent much of their time in the 
embassy working on a vegetable garden

a police officer who fatally shot three 
suspects in six months was fired over two notches found etched into 
his pistol 
bryan farrell who was cleared of any criminal wrongdoing in 
each of the shootings was fired by arlington police chief david 
kunkle on friday after investigators probing the third killing 
found the notches on the gun 
farrell 25 who insisted that he knew nothing about the nicks 
discovered on the trigger guard of his 9mm pistol was fired 
because the police chief didnt believe him police spokesman dee 
anderson said 
anderson stopped short of saying whether investigators believed 
the marks represented a death tally he refused to describe the 
markings except to say they were similar 
farrells attorney jim lane told the dallas morning news that 
he would meet with kunkle on monday to urge him to reconsider 
the markings were discovered by dallas police investigators 
probing the killing of michael robinson 21 who was fatally shot 
by farrell while being served a warrant feb 1 in university park 
near downtown dallas 
robinson was wanted on a forgery charge 
farrell also killed ray soto jr 32 of arlington as the man 
sat in his pickup truck and raised a handgun toward farrell and a 
fellow officer on aug 2 1988 
less than three weeks later farrell shot 33yearold martin 
williams during a struggle that occurred along interstate 30 in 
fort worth 
the same gun a browning 9mm semiautomatic pistol was used in 
all three shootings anderson said 
the gun was recovered by investigators after each shooting but 
the marks werent discovered until dallas police probed the third 
shooting he said 
these markings and their possible inference were obviously 
very troublesome to us anderson said at a news conference to 
announce the officers dismissal 
in september a tarrant county grand jury declined to indict 
farrell in the first two shootings in march a dallas county grand 
jury which knew about the markings on the pistol cleared him of 
any wrongdoing in the latest shooting 
according to police records farrell has said that the pistol 
had been at a gunsmith shop on several occasions and that he had 
let friends shoot it 
anderson said the investigation would continue until police 
learned who put the marks on the gun what they signify and how 
they were made

three more bodies were found saturday 
on an abandoned ranch about 1000 yards south of the us border 
bringing to 12 the number of dead in a suspected drug ring 
reprisal officials said 
also saturday a spokesman for the sonoran attorney generals 
office said authorities believe an american is behind the killings 
spokesman jose luis peraza also said two people have been detained 
for questioning 
the three bodies were found in a well where five other victims 
were found earlier in the week said tom petropoulos a homicide 
detective with the pima county ariz sheriffs office four other 
bodies were found in a nearby septic tank 
petropoulos said the three bodies found saturday were all 
mexican men believed to be in their 20s and all showed signs of 
being strangled 
petropoulos who has been assisting mexican officials in the 
investigation said earlier he had never seen anything like a 
bathroom in an abandoned house on the ranch where some of the 
victims were believed to have been tortured 
theres a strong smell of death in the air its a very 
terrible thing a very gruesome scene blood was splattered and 
strewn you can tell there was a lot of suffering here 
petropoulos said 
this mexican border city of about 75000 residents has emerged 
over the past two years as the center of cocaine alley because 
of the increased drug trafficking through the area 
mexican officials say they believe the slayings are drug 
related but stopped short of connecting the slayings here with the 
mass murder of five men in tucson last weekend 
two of the tucson victims were from nogales mexico one from 
hermosillo and two from tucson 
tucson police said they are still trying to determine if the 
slayings in the two cities about 130 miles apart are linked 
mexican officials have said two of those arrested told state 
judicial police that the killings were related to the disappearance 
of more than 220 pounds of drugs in recent weeks

us military helicopters delivered food medical supplies and 
doctors to guatemalans living in an isolated mountain area 
embassy spokesman john treacy told the associated press that the 
guatemalan military asked for the helicopters to transport supplies 
to more than 1500 people in an area in quiche province 160 miles 
north of guatemala city 
thousands of people remain in the isolated area where they fled 
in the early 1980s to avoid fighting between security forces and 
rebels the guatemalan military says leftist guerrillas still 
operate in the area 
treacy said the helicopters based in honduras arrived in 
guatamala march 26 and returned to honduras three days later after 
carrying food medicine construction material and medical 
personnel to quiche 
the united states agreed to the guatemalan request because there 
are no roads to the area and the guatemalan army did not have the 
helicopters to move the needed supplies he said

a government study recommends a new penalty 
structure for doctors who provide poor quality care to medicare 
patients 
the general accounting office said the current system of 
limiting penalties to the amount of the cost to medicaid sometimes 
results in penalties that are disproportionately low compared with 
the nature of the offense 
for example in one case the report said a doctor endangered a 
cardiac patient by releasing her from the hospital although she 
showed symptoms of a second heart attack because there was no 
additional cost to the medicare program stemming from the doctors 
negligence no financial penalty could be imposed gao said 
gao the investigative arm of congress recommended that the 
costbased limit be replaced by a fixed upper limit on the size of 
monetary penalties it did not recommend where the limit should be 
set 
the gao said that in july 1987 the inspector general of the 
department of health and human services advised peer review 
organizations not to recommend financial penalties unless the 
medicare provider had displayed a pattern of poor care and a 
significant amount of medicare payment to the doctor was involved 
the inspector general has since decided to drop that criteria 
the gao said but as of february there had been no formal 
notification to halt the july 1987 criteria

how do you erect a 19story building in new york 
city 
start with a 31story structure discover zoning prohibits a 
building that big lose a threeyear court battle and receive an 
order to lop 12 stories off 
welcome to 108 e 96th st the multimilliondollar highrise 
set to shrink this month in the final act of a showdown between 
local activists and its developer parkview associates david 
defeated goliath last week when the city ruled the 31story edifice 
must lose its top dozen floors 
the decision will cost the developer about 10 million in 
addition to the foughtover floors leaving the building owners a 
little queasy as they ponder continuing their fight to save those 
stories 
were going to take a while to digest this decision said 
jay a segal attorney for parkview associates we wont make any 
decision for a week or two 
the city last week also dealt with a second manhattan building 
found to be too tall the 811foot cityspire project on west 54th 
street was erected 14 feet above what zoning ordinances allow 
but officials spared the building a steel haircut developer ian 
bruce eichner won a compromise agreement in which he will build a 
25 million dance studio in return for a variance 
parkviews 10 million loss includes the cost of chopping off 
the illegal floors the income from the lost apartments and the 
cost of the buildings extended vacancy the building remains 
uninhabited it would have been ready to open in late 1986 
the odds dont look good for parkview which has unsuccessfully 
taken its battle to preserve the highrise to the city local 
court state court and us supreme court 
the city rejected a parkview proposal to build about 40 
lowincome senior citizen apartments in east harlem in return for a 
zoning variance leaving the building intact 
parkview has until april 27 to appeal its most recent loss the 
developers last option is a lawsuit against the city charging that 
the tootall ruling was arbitrary and capricious segal said 
should parkview decide not to appeal the demolition will begin 
posthaste after that date said city buildings department spokesman 
vahe tiryakian 
they have 30 days to appeal and were obliged to give em 
that tiryakian said well have to wait and see what happens 
while the developers worry about the cost of destroying 12 
floors many residents of the welltodo area couldnt be happier 
about tuesdays unanimous decision by the city board of standards 
and appeals 
were really very very pleased we feel that after this 
almost threeyear battle this was the right result said genie 
rice president of the local community group civitas 
it was ms rice who first noticed the 31story building violated 
a 1973 regulation putting a 19floor cap on the areas skyline 
developer albert ginsburg in getting a permit for the structure 
used an incorrect zoning map 
when the error was discovered in 1986 workers had already 
completed the buildings concrete superstructure installed 
elevator shafts to the 27th floor and finished wiring and plumbing 
for the first 24 stories 
all that is due to come down now workers would attack the top 
12 floors as if taking down an old building starting at the top 
floor and dismantling things one story at a time 
when the work is completed ms rice said residents of the new 
building will be greeted by some very happy neighbors 
as far as were concerned were ready to celebrate the 
opening of a new 19story building ms rice said after the 
boards decision that would be wonderful

a white house official said saturday it 
would be highly inappropriate for the united states to hold 
discussions with the soviet union on a framework for change in 
eastern europe 
i am not enthusiastic about that approach robert m gates 
deputy assistant to president bush for national security affairs 
told an international conference 
manfred woerner secretarygeneral of the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization expressed reservations about trying 
to control the course of events in sovietdominated eastern 
europe 
they spoke at the quadrangular forum sponsored by the 
brusselsbased center for european policy studies and the center 
for strategic and international studies in washington 
their remarks were in response to recent reports that the bush 
administration is studying a proposal by former secretary of state 
henry kissinger on eastern europe 
according to those reports the proposal would be for the kremlin 
to ease its political and military grip on eastern europe in 
exchange for western assuances not to take advantage of the 
situation to threaten soviet security 
gates asked about the proposal said the bush administration is 
still conducting foreign policy reviews 
he added he believed that any discussion with the soviet union 
over eastern europe in a bilateral context would be highly 
inappropriate 
it also would not be appropriate from the standpoint of 
americas allies or eastern europeans he said 
woerner said the west should discuss the future of eastern 
europe with soviet officials and added 
we will continue to respect legitimate soviet security 
interests but we cannot and should not try to patronize 
developments in the east 
gates urged a cautious approach in dealing with the changes 
under way in the soviet union under president mikhail s gorbachev 
we cannot and should not close our eyes to momentous 
developments in the ussr but we should not make concessions 
based on hope and popular enthusiasms in the west or attractive 
personalities in the ussr he said

the 1 billion sale of united artists to an 
australian company was the biggest in a series of moves by foreign 
companies to gobble up successful american entertainment firms 
united artists which produced the oscarwinning rain man 
joined the legion of foreignowned companies that now includes cbs 
records mtm enterprises atlantic entertainment cannon group and 
new world pictures 
in another reported hollywood dealinthemaking mca president 
sidney sheinberg declined to comment saturday on a report that 
japans sony corp was negotiating to acquire his entertainment 
conglomerate which owns universal studios 
im not talking about anything to do with sony sheinberg 
said saturday night at the american cinamatheques annual benefit 
the moving picture ball were not commenting 
knxam news radio a cbs affiliate reported that executives of 
mca and sony met friday at the new otani hotel in los angeles to 
wrap up a deal in which the japanese electronics firm would acquire 
mca 
the station without revealing its source reported that no 
dollar amount was disclosed but that mca is worth an estimated 
25 billion the station said the deal would be formally announced 
monday 
under the united artists deal announced friday australias 
qintex group has agreed to purchase all outstanding stock of uas 
parent company metrogoldwynmayerunited artists 
qintex best known in the united states as one of the makers of 
the cbs miniseries lonesome dove also would get the united 
artists moviemaking group and its film library 
but mgmuas major stockholder kirk kerkorian would retain 
control of the mgm name and tv and movie studios as well as 34 mgm 
movies including moonstruck and a fish called wanda 
the mgmua deal if approved would mark the first time a major 
hollywood studio passed into predominantly foreign ownership 
australian rupert murdoch became a us citizen before buying a 
controlling interest in 20th century fox in 1985 
but mgmua would not be the only entertainment company to be 
bought by a foreign company 
mtm enterprises was acquired for 310 million in july by british 
broadcaster television south plc and atlantic entertainment went to 
australian businessman alan saffron in december 
italian producers giancarlo parretti and florio fiorini also 
have been picking up some of hollywood including the small studios 
cannon group and new world pictures 
the uamgm deal and the foreign invasion in general have 
sparked the concern of at least one american network official who 
questioned the fairness of federal regulations that forbid the 
networks from making the same kind of deals open to overseas firms 
rules drafted in the early 1970s when the networks were the 
only television game in town and cable and payforview were still 
about a decade away prohibit the networks from going into the 
production business 
our view is that it is increasingly ironic and shortsighted to 
have policies on the books which allow foreign interests to 
dominate entertainment production while americas most logical 
competitors the networks continue to be shut out said joe 
rutledge director of corporate communications for nbc

vietnams communist party leadership 
has reaffirmed a need for reform but declared it will not tolerate 
any challenges to its authority or basic principles 
comprehensive reform requires efforts to broaden socialist 
democracy but the party must tread carefully party chief nguyen 
van linh told a march 2029 conference of the central committee 
radio hanoi in a report saturday on the plenum quoted linh as 
saying 
all attempts aimed at weakening or nullifying the partys 
leadership and creating political counterweights to the party in 
society must definitely be checked 
we do not allow those who take advantage of democracy and 
openness to attack the party and its leadership he said it is 
necessary to clearly distinguish constructive criticism from 
mudslinging and instigating attempts aimed at lowering the 
prestige of the party and state 
the broadcast monitored in bangkok reported linh said the 
leadership advocates enhancing the roles of statesupervised mass 
organizations and of elected organs like the national assembly 
we advocate broadening democracy and reaching a consensus 
through debate but we do not tolerate pluralism he declared 
linhs speech closed the central committees sixth plenum held 
to review reforms endorsed at the national party congress in 1986 
linh became party chief at the congress and three leaders 
identified with old policies retired 
but western analysts said party conservatives remain concerned 
that reforms may erode the dominant position of the party that 
achieved power after decades of fighting the french japanese and 
americans and south vietnamese anticommunists 
radio hanoi reported linh told the central committee that the 
party must avoid prejudice against private enterprises but also 
must not favor them without realizing their limits and 
spontaneity which leads to lack of close management control 
without giving details the broadcast reported linh said the 
state will promulgate laws stipulating which industries cannot be 
run by private individuals 
linh said vietnams development requires increased commercial 
ties with nonsocialist nations but that while ties were being 
expanded the party must watch out for negative influences 
once our door is open not only will the pure and healthy air 
come in but dust flies and mosquitos also will follow he said 
a central committee communique also carried by radio hanoi 
said reforms were designed not to change the goal of socialism but 
to achieve it more quickly 
it said the reform of the political system is meant to 
strengthen the partys role of leadership and the states 
managerial efficacy and the peoples right to mastery 
the communique blamed the uneven pace of reform on the many 
shortcomings of the party leadership and the state with 
authorities slow to implement party resolutions and to make needed 
changes in the party and state structures 
in his comments on the economy linh blamed inflation on the low 
output of staterun enterprises and the governments policy of 
subsidizing key areas of the economy 
he said results of the reforms began to become visible in the 
third quarter of 1988 with more consumer goods and foodstuffs 
available less strain in the grain supply and a slowing of the 
rate of price increases

washingtons journalistic establishment 
lampooned president bush at a whitetie dinner saturday night as a 
pistolpackin poppy whose idea of a kinder gentler nation is 
a cop on evry corner and a gun in evry hand 
bushs wife barbara nearly stole the show with a grand entrance 
her snowy white hair was covered with a golden brown wig making the 
woman known as the silver fox almost unrecognizable 
bush and vice president dan quayle were prime targets of the 
104yearold gridiron club whose annual dinner is one of the 
biggest social events in the capital the main business of the 
evening was to spoof the president and other prominent figures with 
humor designed to singe but never burn 
by tradition the responses by bush and quayle to the club 
members satirical barbs were off the record 
yet just as traditionally that rule is ignored 
bush cracked people say im undecisive i dont know about 
that belittling his own skill at humor bush said that if he had 
been funnier than ronald reagan in 1980 when the two men competed 
for the republican presidential nomination it would have been 
reagan who was up here tonight trying to laugh off the bush 
deficit 
quayle was the target of many jokes about his inexperience 
however he said that bush recently praised his maturity and sense 
of responsibility by saying would you like a puppy from the 
brood delivered by first dog millie 
more than 600 invited guests included the journalists bosses 
and a crosssection of the washington power elite including 
supreme court justices cabinet members members of congress 
governors and foreign ambassadors and their wives 
gridiron president lawrence m orourke of the st louis 
postdispatch set the irreverent tone for the evening commenting 
goodnaturedly on accomplishments of the bush presidency he asked 
in a prepared speech what previous administration could say 
after 100 days that it had a new horseshoe pit 
then club members portraying their victims in a series of 
satirical skits roasted bush quayle and other prominent figures 
including massachusetts gov michael dukakis former texas john 
tower house speaker jim wright white house chief of staff john 
sununu billionaire developer donald trump and palestinian leader 
yasser arafat 
a highlight of the prepared script was barbara bush played by 
cheryl arvidson of the dallas times herald who chided her husband 
for his initial opposition to controls on semiautomatic assault 
weapons 
lay that uzi down george lay that uzi down sang the 
onstage mrs bush pistolpackin poppy lay that uzi down 
later a journalist posing as a white house speechwriter sang 
the bush battle hymn with these words 
mine eyes have seen the glory of a kinder gentler land 
with a cop on evry corner and a gun in evry hand 
tiny tots in public schools will pledge allegiance on command 
george bush is in command 
then the gridiron chorus sang sisboombah and hallelujah 
eli yale will boolaboo ya read my lips so i can rule ya you 
gotta read them right 
quayle played by richard cooper of the los angeles times took 
his lumps in a duet with former president nixon portrayed by john 
hall of media general 
to the tune of i believe in you the nixon standin sang 
youre not the dim bulb i had been led to believe i would see 
are you an airhead dilettante lightweight you sure could fool 
me 
cause i believe in you i believe in you 
i think youre perfectly qualified 
as the veep youre swell 
all my concerns have been mollified 
if bush stays well 
to which the chorus responds george stay well 
dukakis the democratic presidential candidate who lost the 
november election to bush was portrayed as elvis presley arriving 
at st no where hospital for a personality transplant 
joined by dancers in prison stripes dukakis sang a hipswinging 
version of jailhouse rock in which he lamented the day he gave 
inmate willie horton a weekend furlough bush made the 
massachusetts prison furlough program a major campaign issue 
against dukakis 
two new active members james m perry of the wall street 
journal and robert adams of the st louis postdispatch were 
initiated into the 60member club at saturdays dinner held in the

eastern airlines is mostly mothballed and 
northwest airlines is flying but both are attracting bids from 
billionaire business celebrities ranging from hoteliers to 
hollywood investors 
people who saw wall street may have thought they were 
watching reallife variants of the backroom maneuvering for the 
movies fictional bluestar airlines if they followed accounts of 
eastern and northwest this past week 
the cast of contenders included baseball commissioner peter v 
ueberroth hyatt hotel chain owner jay pritzker propertycasino 
centurion donald trump and energyentertainment investor marvin 
davis 
others said to be involved either as buyers or their lenders 
included takeover strategist carl icahn who also is chairman of 
trans world airlines reclusive west coast financier kirk 
kerkorian and david batchelder the former adviser to the dean of 
the corporate stalkers oilman t boone pickens 
miamibased eastern remained comatose its fate unclear planes 
mostly grounded and assets increasingly mired in bankruptcy court 
proceedings with little sign from parent texas air corp that a 
sale was close 
a group led by ueberroth had offered 464 million offer for the 
airline which prior to the march 4 strike flew 100000 passengers 
daily to 118 cities with 250 jetliners since then it has barely 
managed a skeleton schedule 
pritzker reportedly offered a higher price value unknown but 
ueberroths offer told a story in itself about the perceived worth 
of eastern one of the nations most unprofitable airlines 
the ueberroth deal was 200 million below the price texas air 
paid three years ago and barely 100 million over what trump had 
offered for easterns northeast shuttle which flies to only three 
cities with about 20 planes 
at minneapolisbased northwest meanwhile management was facing 
a 27 billion 90ashare takeover offer from davis a second 
offer of undisclosed value from a group the airline wouldnt 
identify and rumors that at least one other investor group was 
preparing to make a bid 
not coincidentally northwests parent company nwa inc erected 
an antitakeover poison pill shield to thwart unfriendly 
acquirers by making it prohibitively expensive for them to sell any 
of the airlines assets 
the defense was designed to foil what many analysts have called 
the airlines biggest weakness lucrative operations in the 
economically booming asian pacific region and a lagging domestic 
business 
as the 1980s takeover era has shown that kind of unwieldy 
inefficient performance invites unsolicited offers from investors 
who see profit in selling a company in pieces 
a takeover of northwest therefore raised the prospect of the 
biggest airline bustup since deregulation only three years after 
nwa acquired hometown rival republic airlines for 884 million 
in other business and economic developments this past week 
after months of rumor a federal grand jury indicted drexel 
burnham lambert inc junkbond pioneer michael milken and two 
others in the biggest fraud and racketeering case in wall street 
history the defendants asserted innocence in a case that reflected 
the radical use of racketeering laws to prosecute whitecollar 
suspects it also created a forum for a courtroom fight between 
milken and his main accuser imprisoned speculator ivan f boesky 
more evidence emerged of a slowing economy the commerce 
department said the index of leading indicators fell 03 percent in 
february largely because of a drop in factory orders and

its called event risk a euphemism for 
things that can damage the value of an investment 
corporate takeovers restructurings and other such risks are 
prompting big life insurance companies to dump corporate bonds from 
their portfolios 
the trend could spell trouble for the corporate bond market 
since life insurance companies own about half the industrial bonds 
outstanding according to the american council of life insurance 
a recent survey by the trade group found that 66 of its member 
companies had curtailed their purchase of certain highgrade 
corporate bonds the reason is the fear of takeovers and 
restructurings of bond issuers that may damage the value of the the 
bonds 
such corporate makeovers typically result in a company taking on 
more debt the increased debt load often prompts the bondrating 
companies such as moodys investors service and standard amp poors 
corp to lower the ratings for the bonds because the increased 
debt raises questions about the companies ability to make good on 
the bonds 
and when a bonds rating is lowered its price usually falls 
when asked whether they experienced any investment losses due to 
corporate restructurings since january 1986 81 of the 108 life 
insurance companies that responded to the february survey said yes 
during the threeyear period covered by the survey the 
insurance companies said the value of their corporate bonds dropped 
126 percent because of corporate restructurings 
life insurers have a need for a good market and a good supply 
of investmentgrade corporate bonds said paul reardon director 
of investment research for the council he said the companies need 
to ensure a steady stream of income from longterm investments such 
as bonds in order to pay off their policy claims 
but for a number of years life insurance companies have 
quietly been avoiding industrial bonds because of the problem of 
event risk which is something that is difficult to assess in 
advance he said in an interview last week 
reardon said life insurers had believed they could avoid 
exposing their investments to these risks by buying only the 
investmentgrade bonds of the largest industrial companies with 
the hope that they would be too big to be the target of a takeover 
attack 
but the leveraged buyout of tobacco and food giant rjr nabisco 
inc earlier this year blew that belief out of the water 
the rjr buyout was the event which brought it to a head 
because it was so huge and it did result in large losses or 
reduction in market value of bonds to some insurance companies 
he said 
some life insurers did more than just fume about their losses 
they sued 
the hartford insurance group the insurance unit of itt corp 
filed suit in november against rjr nabisco over its buyout plans 
the suit which is pending alleges the insurer lost about 225 
million in the value of its 25 million worth of rjr nabisco bonds 
after the buyout was announced 
we bought investmentgrade securities in the spring and by 
the fall they were trading as junk bonds said edward n bennett 
the hartfords chief investment officer 
for some time before the rjr nabisco buyout the hartford had 
been shifting out of corporate bonds bennett said but that deal 
accelerated the trend he said 
in place of corporate bonds life insurers are turning to other 
longterm investments bennett and reardon said these include the 
mortgagebacked securities issued by several government agencies 
bonds issued by foreign governments and utility company bonds 
none of which is at risk for takeover 
reardon said the corporate bond market may not yet be feeling 
the pinch from the changed investment stragegy of insurance 
companies because few longterm industrial bonds have been issued 
in recent months 
but he said industrial companies will have to improve the 
terms of their bonds when they come to the market in the future 
when they market significantly larger quantities of debt 
one way companies can improve their bonds is to include 
guarantees that they will not take on additional debt without 
bondholder approval such guarantees called covenants are 
becoming more common in corporate debt instruments as investors 
grow more wary of takeover aftershock 
but bennett said he believed companies could find a way around 
these covenants and so they may not be worth all that much the 
lasting effect of the takeover craze he said may be the virtual 
demise of longterm corporate debt financing

the stock market overcame a welter of worries to 
post some respectable gains in the first quarter of 1989 
but misgivings about the financial and economic outlook are 
still very much in evidence as wall streeters look ahead to the 
remaining nine months of tho 10 percent range if that kind of pace 
could be sustained over a year or two it would qualify as a robust 
bull market 
yet little rejoicing has been heard in the investment community 
which still evidently hasnt quite gotten over the shock of the 
crash that occurred a year and a half ago 
since the great crash there has been no consistent theme or 
trend said edward nicoski at piper jaffray amp hopwood inc he 
describes the current mood of investors as one of pessimistic 
hope 
the pessimism calls for a slowing economy and rising 
unemployment whereas the hope is embedded in the belief this will 
cool inflation diminish our trade imbalance and lower interest 
rates 
the unlikelihood of all the preceding happening without a 
meaningful recession and sharply lower corporate profits has not 
gone unnoticed however 
increased recession worries were evident from the behavior of 
diversified manufacturing auto and machinery stocks all of which 
ranked among the 10 worst performing industry groups for the 
quarter 
in a compilation through march 29 standard amp poors corp said 
the manufacturing group was down 38 percent the auto stocks 
dropped 26 percent and the machinery group lost 15 percent 
over the same period sampps 500stock composite index rose 53 
percent not counting dividends 
earnings worries meanwhile weighed heavily on technology 
stocks the computer systems electronic instrument communications 
equipment and semiconductor groups all finished in the minus column 
some of the big winners such as the airlines up 178 percent 
and hospital management up 202 percent got a lift from the 
continuing boom in takeover and buyout bids 
for its part the dow jones average of 30 industrials with a 
5058 rise to 229362 in the past week closed out the quarter 
sporting a gain of 12505 points or 577 percent 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 299 at 16563 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 579 at 40673 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 344 at 32831 
volume on the big board averaged 14691 million shares a day 
against 14840 million the week before 
the crux of the markets problems right now many analysts 
agree is persistently high interest rates 
the current environment in any historical perspective is 
unattractive for equities said edward kerschner at painewebber 
inc 
first the relative safety of a guaranteed 10 percent oneyear 
return stacks up well against the returns the equity market might 
deliver even in the most benign environment 
second the impact that these higher interest rates have in 
both depressing the corporate revenue line and increasing the 
corporate expense line suggests that the profit environment over 
the next few quarters might be far from benign 
high interest rates have historically been a harbinger of a 
risky stock market because they have been lead indicators of 
earnings disappointments

shed no tears for michael milken or his firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc which has agreed to plead guilty to fraud rather than 
face racketeering charges under the federal racketeer influenced 
and corrupt organizations law 
these prosecutions have provoked misplaced criticism of the rico 
law 
rico critics argue that drexel was unfairly induced to 
capitulate supposedly any other decision would have meant instant 
ruin since rico allows assets to be frozen pretrial and forfeited 
after conviction 
no doubt drexel felt pressured but stress is inherent in the 
plea negotiation process thus street criminals often plead guilty 
to avoid habitual offender charges a more important issue is 
whether drexel is guilty the answer must be yes for no judge may 
accept a baseless guilty plea as the defense of good faith was 
readily available drexels megabuck legal team would not have 
advised a groundless plea michael milken now has the same defense 
and others as well under rico 
nor was drexel abused by a pretrial asset freeze this 
procedure incidentally is not unique to rico other laws provide 
similar remedies comparable to bail bonds used to secure personal 
appearances at trial no evidence suggests forfeiture was 
maliciously threatened moreover prosecutors may not impose 
forfeiture unilaterally rico requires proof of probable success at 
trial and the risk of asset dissipation moreover the court must 
consider various equitable factors and not all assets may be 
frozen only those needed to ensure funds for payoff upon 
conviction 
the government is also justified in seeking forfeiture 
forfeiture takes the profit out of crime a penalty that works well 
against corporations which cannot be jailed in milkens case the 
alleged profits would make successful drug dealers envious surely 
the narcotics crisis is not to be solved by encouraging drug 
dealers to turn to securities fraud 
congress reserved rico for criminals who engage in a pattern of 
racketeering a requirement courts take seriously violators 
therefore merit special sanctions white collar defendants claim 
to be unfairly stigmatized by the term racketeer perhaps 
swindler is more apt but congress properly considered white 
collar crimes to be racketeering the legislative record is replete 
with references to corrupt businesses including brokerage firms 
critics want to limit rico to the mafia but white collar crime 
exacts equally serious social costs and constitutionally we 
ought not tolerate efforts to confine racketeering laws to any 
ethnic group 
thus though the case against milken remains to be proven if 
guilt is established the rico penalty would fit the crime

the red queen from alices adventures in wonderland might 
feel right at home in todays us justice department sentence 
first verdict afterward was her theory of jurisprudence an 
approach being adopted by overzealous federal prosecutors with 
regard to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization rico 
law 
the rico law enacted in 1970 contains two provisions to help 
prosecutors fight the kind of organized crime i used to cover as a 
young reporter at the elizabeth nj daily journal congress 
intended the rico law to prosecute drug dealers and mob overlords 
whose entire business is a crime it was not drafted to be used 
against legitimate businesses and individuals who face irreparable 
damage to their reputation and assets and the stigma of being 
compared with al capone as a racketeer even before they are 
accused much less convicted of any wrongdoing 
rico works like this 
firstly after an indictment it enables the government to seize 
a defendants assets so that the illgotten gains cannot be spent 
laundered or siphoned into foreign bank accounts in the period 
between indictment and a trial secondly after a conviction rico 
allows the seizure not only of the assets gained in the specific 
crime but all those associated with the nowproven racketeering 
enterprise 
to a legitimate business enterprise or individual who is 
presumed innocent and ultimately may be shown to have committed no 
crime at all the prospect of rico prosecution is staggering 
prosecutors know this of course and have used rico as a bludgeon 
to coerce guilty pleas from the unindicted and exact tremendous 
penalties on the unconvicted 
drexel burnham lambert may well have been able to win on the 
merits of the governments case against the firm a case the us 
attorney has been notably loathe to bring to court but because a 
rico charge would shut off drexels overnight bank credit and put 
it out of business in a single day drexel faced ruination from 
even a rico charge so drexel agreed to plead guilty to six 
felonies rather than risk rico indictment certain bankruptcy and 
putting its 10000 employees out of work in other words the 
guilty plea was extorted 
the latest victim of rico abuse is michael milken a visionary 
investment banker who inspired a wave of entrepreneurial activity 
in the us in the past decade and helped create jobs for hundreds 
of thousands of americans notwithstanding the intent of congress 
he is being treated like a drug dealer mobster and the us 
attorney is trying to seize his entire salary for the years 1983 
1984 1985 1986 and 1987 
even though milken resolutely denies any wrongdoing and 
unlike drexel is going to fight the charges in court and even 
though the alleged actions with which he is charged accounted for 
only a small fraction of his earnings during this period the 
government wants to take every penny he has earned during this time 
and jail him for hundreds of years in the meantime the 
government has used rico to force milken out of his job freeze his 
personal assets and effectively put him out of business and still 
no trial much less a conviction 
rico then seems to have turned the american judicial 
presumption of innocence on its head the milken case has developed 
into a civil rights issue in which rico is used to coerce 
settlements the government evidently feels it cannot win in court 
on the evidence confessed felon ivan boesky traded for a lenient 
sentence milken is being presumed guilty and severely punished 
without trial under a law written to prevent drug dealers from 
hiding their loot
