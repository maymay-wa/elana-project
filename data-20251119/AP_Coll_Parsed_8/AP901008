world chess champion garry kasparov and his 
blood rival anatoly karpov played to a draw monday in the opening 
game of their grudge match 
kasparov playing the black pieces offered the draw after 
making his 30th move and karpov accepted 
for the first game of the match at the hudson theatre in 
manhattan about 700 black and grey tweed seats were sold out at 
25 50 and 100 karpov made his first move at about 540 pm 
edt and the game ended shortly before 1030 edt the second game of 
the bestof24game match is scheduled for wednesday 
kasparov 27 ended karpovs 10year world chess reign in 1985 
now karpov 39 is trying to wrest the title back as the nemeses 
meet for the first time in three years 
as the play began the crowd was hushed except for the click of 
journalists cameras the audience let out a shhhh in unison 
when someone spoke in the back of the theater 
five minutes into the game karpov left the stage two officials 
came out carried away his chair then brought it back 
karpov was outwardly calm with an expression that looked like 
he had just awakened he hugged his hands to his chest with his 
fingers laced together a few times he stared vacantly beyond the 
bright stage lights toward the audience 
kasparov pressed his chest against the table and fidgeted 
bouncing one foot puffing out his cheeks scowling wincing 
pursing his lips he often assumed his most famous pose cheeks or 
forehead enveloped in both hands 
each player occasionally strode into the wings while his 
opponent contemplated 
american grand master yasser seirawan of seattle said karpov 
seemed to have a good chance in the opening game 
seirawan said he thought karpovs strong play indicated to 
kasparov that yes youre the world champion but im a worthy 
challenger 
one of karpovs aides us grand master ron henley of new 
jersey said that during the early part of the game kasparov 
was positioned slightly more comfortably on the board 
it is the first world championship in the united states since 
1907 after the first 12 games are played in new york 12 more will 
be played in lyon france beginning nov 24 
for the new york showdown the theater is hung with the flags of 
the united states france and the soviet union home country of 
both players 
above the stage is a 10foot screen bearing the image of a chess 
board when kasparov or karpov makes a move the pieces on the 
screen move too for the audiences benefit 
two video screens show closeups of the players the 
computerized chess board will record every move they make 
the board is atop a stark black table with two name tags 
pasted on the front 
one labeled a karpov depicts the soviet flag next to the 
table is karpovs black highbacked easy chair which swivels and 
rolls 
on the opposite side is a black lowbacked officestyle chair 
that side is labeled g kasparov with a depiction of the flag 
of the russian republic 
kasparov founder of a soviet democratic party declared last 
week he was playing under the flag of the republic rather than the 
soviet union as a political statement karpov often has been quoted 
as saying i have two loves communism and chess 
normally chess is a battle between two individuals a brutal 
intellectual battle kasparov said earlier but in my case 
with karpov its a fight between two different mentalities in 
russia i identify him with the system ive been fighting 
years ago a chess analyst likened kasparovs agile bold style 
to the dancer mikhail baryshnikov and karpovs methodical rigid 
style to former soviet premier leonid brezhnev 
the two are as different in personality as they are in political 
leanings 
kasparov who beat deep thought a chessplaying computer 
in new york last january is confident flamboyant and fluent in 
english a media darling who tirelessly publicizes chess 
the media have often described karpov as cool or even cold an 
introvert who plays with surgical precision and tunes out the 
audience but he was personable at a news conference last tuesday 
hamming it up and presenting a copy of his book to kasparov 
the first championship between the two in 1984 was abruptly 
helted by the world chess federation president after karpov lost 
two games in a row in a controversial move the world chess 
federation permitted karpov to retain the title although the match 
wasnt completed 
kasparov won their 1985 rematch becoming the youngest champion 
ever he successfully defended the title against karpov in 1986 in 
1987 their championship match ended in a tie and kasparov retained 
his title under the match rules 
this time the winner will receive 17 million and the loser 
will get 13 million kasparov said his earnings will fund my 
private interests and the political interests of the world 
karpov has talked about helping chernobyl victims and promoting 
chess in schools

a freight train derailed monday in an crash 
of splintered railroad ties and twisted steel and a flatcar 
slammed into an apartment building stopping just short of a woman 
and her children 
nobody was injured in the 1010 am derailment of the santa fe 
railway train the third time in a month a train jumped the tracks 
in southern california and the second close call between residents 
and a derailed train 
the cause of mondays derailment was under investigation 
i was very afraid said irma quintanar who was sweeping her 
secondstory balcony as er two children played nearby when the 
flatcar smashed into the side of her building just a few feet away 
nine cars of the los angelesbound 53car santa fe railway train 
derailed about 40 yards east of the building tearing up 600 yards 
of track smashing telephone poles and splintering railroad ties 
most of the cars tumbled to their sides against the side of the 
lowered railway bed but a flatcar carrying white truck trailers 
buckled at a right angle smashed into three parked cars and hit 
the apartment building 
the train demolished a stairwell knocked out an 
8footby8foot hole in the downstairs unit and crumbled and 
cracked part of the living room wall of quintanars upstairs unit 
large chunks of drywall littered quintanars living room and a 
piece of the ceiling fell onto the couch 
i feel very lucky quintanar said in spanish through an 
interpreter if my children were inside it would have been very 
bad 
francisco covarrubias who lives at the other end of the 
complex said children were playing in the complex on the warm 
columbus day holiday when he heard what seemed like an explosion 
and felt the ground shaking 
its confusion you really dont know whats coming you feel 
the danger coming but you dont know from where he said i 
first looked up at the sky to see if something was coming down 
authorities evacuated the apartment building 
though no injuries were reported one pregnant woman was taken 
to a hospital for observation said assistant chief bob ramirez of 
the los angeles fire department 
santa fe railway assistant superintendent neal leaverton said 
the cause of the derailment was unknown he also did not know how 
fast the train was traveling when it derailed on a wide downhill 
curve 
the derailment was the third in the los angeles area in the last 
month 
fourteen runaway railroad cars collided with a locomotive in 
pico rivera on sept 9 and nine cars derailed one of them landing 
just inches from a home 
about two weeks later a boxcar loaded with navy munitions jumped 
the tracks in westminster no one was injured in either derailment

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
switching back to cold warera language in an effort to defeat a 
house move to cut off us aid to anticommunist rebels in angola 
in a private memo he sent recently to house minority leader 
robert michel rill baker said ending aid to the angolan rebels 
would derail peace negotiations and would be a vote for more 
killing more stalemate and more suffering 
this is the absolutely worst time to halt the aid baker 
said 
the united states has been providing covert aid to the unita 
rebels in the southwest african country since 1986 but 
congressional sentiment against continued assistance seems to be 
increasing 
at stake is a reported 60 million for the rebels in the fiscal 
year that began oct 1 the issue could go to the house floor this 
week 
critics of administration policy contend that more aid to the 
rebels will only prolong a conflict that has lasted 15 years and 
caused immense human suffering they also point out that well over 
half the 50000 cuban troops in angola have gone home the rest 
will be out in less than nine months 
one amendment before the house would cut off all us aid to 
unita unless president bush declares that vital national security 
interests are at stake 
another would require an aid cutoff unless bush certifies that 
the soviet union or third parties are continuing to send weapons to 
the leftist government in luanda us aid also could be restored 
if angola refused to continue peace negotiations with unita in good 
faith 
angolan president jose eduardo dos santos has said his 
government will halt all weapons imports if unita does the same he 
also has said he is committed to instituting a multiparty 
democratic system in angola 
the angola issue features a curious mixture of sovietamerican 
competition and cooperation 
on one hand moscow and washington have been arming opposite 
sides on the other soviet and american representatives were 
present for the first time at the most recent negotiating session 
between angolan officials and unita envoys four rounds of peace 
talks have been held in lisbon and a fifth is scheduled there for 
later this month 
another anomaly is that the united states although it does not 
recognize the angolan government is that countrys largest trading 
partner because of oil purchases 
unita leader jonas savimbi was in washington last week making 
his case for continued us aid he agrees with the administration 
that us aid has forced the angolan government to the bargaining 
table and that a cutoff could put his goal of a ceasefire and free 
elections beyond reach 
baker concurs in his memo to michel a copy of which was made 
available to the associated press baker said an aid suspension 
would undercut those in the angolan government who want to 
negotiate and strengthen the hand of hardliners who want to 
continue the bloodshed 
angolas united nations ambassador manuel pedro pacavira 
counters by saying that continued aid to unita can no longer be 
justified because of the toll of 15 years of warfare 
our people have suffered enough pacavira has said more 
than 50000 people are amputees most of them women and children 
and more than 800000 civilians face starvation resulting from the 
combination of war and drought this is the legacy of war a legacy 
we can change now

debtor countries that cant get new loans from 
banks have found a new way to accumulate some of the hard cash they 
need they just dont pay interest on their loans 
some countries stopped payments on their loan principals in 
1982 but interest is how banks get their money and the cutoff is a 
new blow to international lenders 
in effect if you dont pay interest on an old loan youve 
got yourself the equivalent of a new one said john underwood 
who specializes in international debt at world bank headquarters 
the failure to pay interest has dramatically increased third 
world debt in the 18 months since the united states launched a new 
attack on indebtedness 
countries in the third world and eastern europe owe 13 
trillion and 90 billion to 95 billion a year in interest on that 
debt underwood estimated 
there is no estimate available of how much of that interest is 
in arrears but the 16 most heavily indebted countries are 22 
billion behind in interest payments they were 7 billion behind in 
march 1989 when us treasury secretary nicholas brady launched his 
debt reduction plan 
the calculations come from the institute of international 
finance headed by horst schulmann once adviser to former west 
german chancellor helmut schmidt and now a spokesman for major 
banks worldwide 
it is hard to avoid the conclusion that some of these 
countries are pursuing a policy of willfully accruing arrears 
schulmann said at a recent news conference 
willful or not theres not much the lenders can do about it 
as borrowers countries arent like their citizens if a 
homeowner or a small business fails to keep up loan payments the 
lender takes over the house or car or whatever collateral was put 
up for the loan 
banks dont ask a sovereign government to put up collateral 
they can do little about one that turns out to be a deadbeat there 
is no such thing as a bankruptcy court for governments 
schulmann has asked the 154nation international monetary fund 
to pressure the debtors by refusing to lend its money to countries 
that are behind in interest payments to banks 
the debt problem first surfaced in 1982 when mexico announced 
it was unable to keep up its debt payments because of high interest 
rates and the collapse of its income from oil exports many other 
debtor countries stopped payments on the principal of their debt 
but continued to pay interest 
now some have added to their stock of cash by slowing down their 
interest payments too 
brazil for example was 343 billion behind in 1987 banks and 
the imf worked out a deal that brought brazil up to date in 1988 
early in 1989 brazil stopped paying interest again and now is 
about 10 billion behind on about 67 billion worth of debt it owes 
to banks its total debt about 117 billion is the largest in the 
third world 
in 1985 thentreasury secretary james a baker iii now 
secretary of state proposed to help them with new loans but 
banks unwilling to throw good money after bad reduced their 
lending instead of increasing it 
bakers successor brady then proposed his plan urging a 
reduction in the debt burden and more new lending but that hasnt 
brought much new lending either 
third world debtors still need new money for the goods they want 
to buy from industrial countries which want to be paid in us 
dollars and other hard currencies the goods are needed to build 
plants that will provide jobs and things to buy for rapidly growing 
third world populations 
underwood of the world bank suggested that the arrears to the 
banks may be just a negotiating phase governments may be 
holding back interest payments on the old loans in the hope of 
pressing the banks to give them new loans 
john cavanagh who follows the issue at the private 
leftofcenter institute for policy studies has a different 
explanation 
some small countries like costa rica have been getting away 
with not paying much interest for years he said the banks 
didnt fuss as long as the countries didnt trumpet it now some of 
the bigger debtor countries have found they can get away with it 
too as long as they pay a few key creditors

professor philippe rushton has been confined to 
lecturing into a video camera at western ontario university where 
his theories on race and intelligence have made him a discomforting 
presence 
since the academic year began students taking rushtons 
undergraduate course theories of personality have been obliged 
to pick up his 90minute taped lectures view each one alone and in 
seclusion and telephone the psychology professor with any 
questions 
rushton gained notoriety throughout north america by announcing 
that his research showed whites were more intelligent than blacks 
orientals were more intelligent that whites and the reasons were 
genetic and evolutionary 
university officials say the special treatment of rushtons 
lectures is necessary to avoid disturbances even violence by some 
elements on the campus at london ontario 
rushton responded in an interview in my view its an 
infringement of my academic freedom because i cannot discuss my 
views with the students and the students are not allowed to 
challenge me the whole normal studentteacher relationship is 
gone 
his performance evaluation also has been dropped from a 
consistent very good or excellent to unsatisfactory 
that could have been the first step in an administration attempt to 
fire him but the university senate grievance committee overturned 
the psychology department evaluation on oct 2 
that means i get a pay increase rushton said and most 
importantly it removes any possibility of the university 
initiating dismissal proceedings against me on those grounds 
administration officials deny the university is trying to muzzle 
or harass rushton or interfere with his academic freedom 
no one involved thinks videotaping lectures is the best 
solution to the problem but its the only one we could come up 
with that we think is viable said dr tom collins vice 
president for academics a lot of people are critical of that 
situation 
rushton 46 has been at western ontario for 13 years and until 
january 1989 labored in relative obscurity 
he was known in academia as coauthor of the bestselling 
textbook introduction to psychology and won a guggenheim 
research fellowship in 1988 
then came his 20minute speech to the american association for 
the advancement of science 
many scientists stormed out of the hall in san francisco when 
rushton set out his thoughts on genetic and evolutionary 
differences between the races 
my conclusions are totally unpopular he admitted in the 
interview 
i conclude that on 50 or 60 different measures orientals and 
blacks are at opposite ends of a continuum with whites or 
caucasoids falling consistently somewhere in the middle these 
measures include intelligence sexual behavior brain size law 
abidingness social organization skills personality and 
temperament and speed of physical maturation 
rushton also teaches a graduate course called human life 
history covering the evolutionary basis of personality 
only two students are enrolled and he teaches it more or less 
normally he said we meet once a week in a location that is 
kept secret from everybody but me and the two students 
for the 12 undergraduates in his theories of personality course 
he goes to a different classroom each week to tape a lecture 
normally there would be up to 50 students in this class he 
said 
the students are allowed to telephone him during one hour a week 
to ask questions or make appointments an appeal of the ruling that 
he must teach by videotape is still before the university senate 
this is consuming an enormous amount of my time rushton 
complained 
collins the university vice president said when asked whether 
the university was embarrassed by the professor in the 
university in general some people are embarrassed by his work the 
official stance is he has academic freedom and will be judged by 
his peers 
rushton says racial difference is a fascinating question on 
which he has worked since 1981 and published since 1984 even 
getting ratings of excellent from the university for my race work 
it was when it began to be public that the ax began to come down on 
my head 
race is a taboo he said but that only goes back to the 
second world war as a result of hilters socalled racial policy 
in the aftermath of world war ii there has been a virtual 
selfimposed taboo on the scientific study of race differences from 
a genetic perspective 
no known environmental cause explains the differences between 
races according to rushton 
things like white racism and poverty just dont do it he 
said 
if i had said either that the differences do not exist or if 
i had said they do exist and its all due to white racism then i 
would not have run into trouble but once you suggest genetics or 
evolution in the context of race youre in for trouble and i knew 
i would be 
rushton says he does not like being unpopular and that he wants 
to make a contribution to science and be rewarded with approval for 
doing so 
i do not like to have my views totally unpopular as they 
are he said but i do believe im right i feel that this is 
something that is going to be recognized

oleg kalugin made good just like his us 
classmates knew he would 
we elected him president of the class of 59 at columbia 
universitys graduate school of journalism and picked him as the 
student most likely to succeed in the soviet union 
unknown to us the kgb also had oleg pegged as a winner and was 
using the student exchange program to groom him as an undercover 
agent the soviet agency ultimately promoted him to the rank of 
major general in recognition of 30 years of outstanding service in 
the spy business 
kalugins class ties became tenuous after graduation although 
he spent much of the next decade in the united states during that 
time he assumed various roles including those of soviet radio and 
tv correspondent at the united nations in new york and press 
attache at the soviet embassy in washington 
after being compromised by a jack anderson column oleg left the 
united states in 1970 the columnist described him as a russian 
romeo who attempted to seduce an fbi office secretary to gain 
access to classified information 
now kalugin has come in from the cold in a very big and 
surprising way he even has won a seat in the soviet parliament 
at age 55 oleg danilovich kalugin seems to have taken to heart 
the old columbia fight song roar lion roar the former kgb 
officer is suing the soviet government to win back the rank 
pension and honors he lost in retribution for publicly criticizing 
his spy masters 
he accused the long dreaded kgb of a continuing abuse of power 
despite its new image 
kalugin won a round in court on oct 2 when a soviet judge 
ordered the government to provide a fuller explanation for its 
decision to degrade him 
in hailing the court decision oleg sounded like he had been 
taking notes during columbia lectures on freedom of the press 
soviet society was being pushed toward the stage where all secret 
acts illegal acts will slowly and gradually be done away with 
he said 
we had a different impression of him at columbia as a student 
he was convincing in the role of a dedicated communist he had an 
easy smile but tended to be stiff and guarded in conversation at 
the time the 24yearold leningrad native was a member of the 
young communist league 
basically he wasnt that friendly a classmate and i dont 
think he made any close friends at the school recalled robert 
resnick now a public issues consultant and speech writer 
while the rest of us were in journalism school of our own 
volition kalugin clearly was not 
once when i asked him if he expected to work as a reporter after 
graduation he replied i imagine so why else would they have 
sent me here 
some had their suspicions even then classmate john palmer 
until recently news anchor of nbcs the today show and now in 
syndication with the program instant recall remembers a 
columbia professor remarking of kalugin hes a colonel in the 
kgb didnt you know 
i gave him such an incredulous look and thought what are 
you some kind of a rightwinger palmer said adding that he now 
owed the professor an apology 
we elected oleg class president more in jest than in tribute to 
his popularity his classmates included korean war veterans whose 
irreverence foreshadowed the 60s generation 
we did it as a joke resnick said 
the election prompted the new york times to select the new class 
president as a man in the news describing him as a real 
personality kid who loved movies and big band jazz but abhorred 
the new sounds of rock n roll 
classmate john cunniff now an ap business columnist remembers 
kalugin first appearing at the school in a shabby suit and 
gradually becoming a nattier dresser showing off a new dress shirt 
to cunniff one day oleg boasted the arrow shirt it is the 
best 
all that time he spent in columbia and the states must have 
had an impact on him cunniff remarked 
in may of 1959 kalugin and 17 other members of the class 
traveled to upstate new york to spend a day putting out an edition 
of the middletown times herald olegs story ran on the front page 
under the headline soviet visitor likes city 
he found middletown typically american with its 
supermarkets and good roads he encountered no open hostility but 
reported finding much misunderstanding about the intentions and 
the policies of the soviet union under nikita khrushchev 
when oleg steered his conversation with one town official toward 
the subject of ussoviet relations the official asked are you 
russian or something 
three decades later this same russian for whatever motives he 
may have is openly challenging the intentions and policies of his 
own government and the secret police he served with distinction for 
three decades 
i hope to achieve one thing that other people based on this 
precedent will act more bodly and courageously in their attempts 
to restore justice and their human rights the former spy told 
reporters in moscow after his latest court appearance 
oleg we hardly knew you

the collapse of a military revolt on 
mindanao island offers no guarantee that unrest in the ranks will 
stop unless president corazon aquino solves major problems facing 
the nation analysts believe 
more importantly there is a growing feeling that the system 
mrs aquino installed after the 1986 people power revolution 
toppled the late ferdinand marcos is cumbersome and unresponsive 
the latest uprising ended saturday renegade col alexander 
noble surrendered two days after seizing military garrisons in two 
cities and proclaiming independence for the countrys 
secondlargest island 
some government officials feared noble aimed to trigger 
uprisings elsewhere in the archipelago culminating in yet another 
coup attempt 
mrs aquino and her staunchest supporters dismiss the seven 
military revolts that have broken out during her 4 years in office 
as simply attempts to grab power and crush democracy 
but many prominent politicians commentators and business 
leaders feel the conspirators have raised valid issues although 
there is widespread suspicion of their motives and methods 
these include favoritism in military promotions government 
corruption poverty and the failure to deliver basic services in 
this land of 60 million people 
there is no guarantee that some other disaffected disgusted 
and idealistic officers and men will not follow the way of the 
rebel because the root causes of the coups and mutinies have not 
been addressed or eradicated wrote commentator luis beltran in 
the manila standard 
until those root causes are removed the aquino administration 
will continue as an accident ready to happen and happen it 
will he added 
following the december coup attempt the bloodiest yet with 
more than 100 people killed mrs aquino appointed a commission to 
determine why the rebellions have occurred ironically the 
commission released its report on thursday the day noble launched 
his rebellion 
in an interview with the philippines news and features 
syndicate commission member delfin lazaro said procoup sentiment 
existed in at least 12 major units within the 160000member armed 
forces 
it appears that coups are still likely to happen lazaro 
said 
another commission member dr carolina hernandez said the 
government must demonstrate to disaffected military groups that 
it is concerned about the issues being raised 
the reason why they troops are involved is because they are 
involved in peace and order and the delivery of basic services 
so they feel they should have a say in all these things that go 
on 
critics claim the aquino government rarely shows interest in 
demands of special interest groups including moslems workers 
teachers or soldiers unless they pose a threat 
the coup investigating commission also pointedly faulted mrs 
aquino for poor leadership and lack of vision 
while there is understandably a reluctance by president aquino 
to exercise power in the manner that might be compared with former 
president marcos a democracy in a crisis of transition calls for a 
firmer and more direct hand at the helm the report said 
moreover the system mrs aquino restored four years ago has 
itself proven inadequate for decisive action 
apart from a bloated bureaucracy the new constitution restored 
a legislature whose two chambers often have vastly different 
agendas 
the 23 senators are elected by voters nationwide and many 
appear to be trying to use the chamber as a springboard to the 
presidency house members elected by district tend to reflect 
local views 
without established wellorganized political parties to 
discipline members legislation often takes months to enact 
usually with numerous amendments backroom deals and compromises 
several prominent politicians including house speaker ramon 
mitra have suggested shifting to a unicameral parliamentarystyle 
government in which the administration could be changed 
constitutionally if it were to lose its mandate 
former labor minister blas ople an opposition member of the 
aquinoappointed commission that drafted the 1987 constitution has 
said that its framers biggest mistake was to reestablish a 
bicameral system 
critics also say the system is too highly centralized 
politicians in cebu mindanao and other provincial centers 
complain that manila exerts far too much control than is workable 
in an archipelago of 7100 islands with more than 80 languages and 
dialects 
nobles allies claimed their goal was to establish an 
independent state on mindanao and then to reunite the southern 
island with other parts of the country in a federal system 
there is little sign that the coup attempts have generated any 
significant broadbased civilian support although the december 
putsch nearly toppled the government few believed noble would 
succeed in ousting mrs aquino 
but each revolt tarnishes the reputation of the government 
frightens foreign investors and demoralizes the public 
during a speech friday herman montenegro chairman of the 
annual conference of the chamber of commerce warned the government 
must dispel the fear that a military coup is a distinct 
possibility at any time

the most liberal marijuana law in the 
country may go up in smoke on election day 
amid rising nationwide intolerance of drugs alaskan voters who 
have been able to legally possess small amounts of marijuana for 15 
years appear ready to trade in their right to puff a poll showed 
adults in alaska can possess less than four ounces of marijuana 
legally in their homes or other private places but an initiative 
on the nov 6 ballot would make possession of pot illegal anywhere 
if passed the measure would make possession a misdemeanor 
punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a 1000 fine 
the bill is the latest and most ambitious effort to erode the 
gains of the marijuanareform movement of the 1970s when 11 states 
relaxed pot penalties it has attracted strong interest and big 
money from outside the state 
president bushs drug czar william bennett has endorsed the 
measure and plans to visit alaska later in the month to campaign 
for it federal agencies have been involved too 
the drug enforcement administration and fbi recently helped 
sponsor a symposium in anchorage titled marijuana myths and 
misconceptions 
the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws has 
made defeat of the measure a top priority by late september norml 
had contributed nearly 16000 to campaign efforts to defeat the 
measure according to the alaska public offices commission 
not defeating this initiative means that we will be facing 
trouble in dozens of other states in 1992 norml director donald 
b fiedler said in a recent fundraising letter we must preserve 
the status quo in alaska 
high times a new yorkbased magazine that advocates legalizing 
marijuana is urging readers to travel to alaska this month to 
counter bennett and defeat the measure 
the magazine calls the initiative the years gravest challenge 
to the marijuanalegalization movement 
dont risk bringing pot we have the best up here its 
october issue advises 
a statewide survey in august showed voters supported the measure 
by a nearly 2to1 margin anchorage pollster dave dittman said 
opponents say theyll gain ground in the next few weeks when their 
campaign goes into full swing 
there have been repeated efforts to toughen laws in most of the 
11 states that decriminalized marijuana in the 70s 
lawmakers in oregon the first state to decriminalized 
possession of small amounts in 1973 raised the 100 maximum fine 
for possession to 1000 last year with a 500 minimum 
legislative attempts to restore criminal penalties in alaska 
stalled in the democraticcontrolled house frustration over 
lawmakers resistance prompted a grassroots effort to take the 
issue to voters 
alaskans for the recriminalization of marijuana gathered more 
than 40000 petition signatures twice the number needed to get 
the measure on the ballot 
the issue may also figure in the tight threeway governors 
race 
democrat tony knowles who has admitted smoking marijuana in the 
early 1970s said he favors restoring criminal penalties but 
opposes sending firsttime offenders to jail 
he faces republican arliss sturgulewski and walter hickel of the 
alaskan independence party in the general election both have 
endorsed the antimarijuana measure 
if the measure passes the change will be largely symbolic 
police say catching adults using pot in their homes would be a low 
priority 
state law bans possession of marijuana in public as well as 
cultivation transport and sale possession by juveniles also is 
illegal 
nevertheless proponents say the measure is needed to send a 
clear message to alaskas youth about the perils of drug abuse 
the whole point is that our young people truly understand that 
this is an illicit drug throughout the united states said marie 
majewske chairwoman of alaskans for the recriminalization of 
marijuana it doesnt change when it hits alaska

the italian readytowear designers are 
predicting a hot and sexy season for the springsummer 1991 
the opening show of the fiveday fashion parade dolce and 
gabbana looked more a scene from a redlight district than a 
runway 
sequined bras bandanas and bustiers black thigh stockings 
ultrashort skirts and shorts long strings of pearls and gold 
beads all combined to make the streetwalker a fashion plate 
the two sicilians domenico dolce and stefano gabbana make no 
bones about their body baring passion is what the collection is 
all about boast the two young and emerging designers 
what we did was undress the body to emphasize the best points 
of the mediterranean beauty breasts waist and hips 
the designers however were careful not to make the look too 
aggressive interspersing black negligee wear with ethereal white 
chiffon tunics and demure poof skirts white thigh stockings and 
opera sleeves combined to place the dolce and gabbana woman 
somewhere between the ballet school and the brothel 
in any case there is no place for her in the office a series of 
white pant suits with ultra high waists and long duster jackets 
were the only acceptable office apparel in the entire show 
giorgio armani the most popular italian readytowear designer 
who made his fame by making the mannish look fashionable also 
succumbs to passion for the springsummer 1991 
in his emporio collection for the younger set shown here 
sunday he emphasizes long legs in thighhigh mini skirts and 
thighbaring shorts both worn with highheeled sandals 
but the armani sex appeal is less blatant than the flamboyant 
dolce and gabbana look with lots of youthful and sporty 
windbreakers for day and night to soften the message 
complice who also showed sunday opted for a more citified look 
in neat pant suits trim skirts and classic jackets however bras 
are not a big item in the complice collection with bare breasts 
under almost every blouse and jacket seen down the runway 
even staid and demure laura biagiotti could not resist the 
temptations of the flesh baring the body in her new collection 
presented sunday with silk thread faggoting on long linen evening 
gowns in ivory white 
thus the biagiotti women used to hiding her figure in ample 
bambola doll dresses finds herself showing off her navel hips 
and thighs 
gianni versace whose sexy styles make him the golden boy of 
rodeo drive was also to present his version of the 1991 italian 
sex appeal if other designers are predicting a hot summer 
giannis is sure to be torrid

president bush says america is making progress 
in the war against drugs but cops on the nations streets say its 
still pretty bad out there and not getting any better 
its getting worse by leaps and bounds said police lt josh 
landers of yonkers ny one of more than two dozen law 
enforcement officials nationwide surveyed by the associated press 
its crazy 
were dying out here said narcotics detective margaret 
gagnon in willimantic conn a town of about 15000 were 
inundated with drug dealers our neighborhoods are totally 
destroyed 
anyone who tells you weve turned the corner and were winning 
the war thats hogwash said a miamibased drug enforcement 
administration agent who spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush and national drug control policy director william j 
bennett emphasized the positive during a sept 5 white house 
session marking the first anniversary of the administrations drug 
strategy 
they pointed to a slight decrease in hospital emergency room 
admissions for cocaine and heroin attitudinal surveys showing 
growing opposition to drug use and signs that the supply of the 
nations most disruptive drug cocaine had been reduced 
reflected in higher prices and lower purity 
the ap survey of cities from miami to yakima wash found that 
cocaine has indeed become more expensive and less pure in most 
areas when the dea found similar changes during the summer it 
concluded there was a cocaine shortage that may be partly caused by 
suppliers rigging the market to increase profits 
what were hearing on the streets is they say its just dry 
out there said police detective daryl higgins of tacoma wash 
they cant get nothing a year ago that was almost a 
nonexistent statement 
one city that exemplifies the changes is brownsville texas on 
the mexican border last september a kilogram of cocaine cost 
14000 to 15000 and was 90 percent to 95 percent pure this 
fall a kilo 22 pounds costs about 20000 and the purity has 
dropped to 60 percent to 65 percent said armando ramirez the dea 
agent in charge of the local office 
elsewhere in the country the average price of a kilo of cocaine 
shot up by more than 85 percent in boston and monroe la it rose 
75 percent in new york city and 70 percent in los angeles while 
cities from seattle to concord nh had less dramatic increases 
the average wholesale price dropped in only three cities it 
plummeted 56 percent in shreveport la and 17 percent in denver 
and des moines iowa 
on the street a gram of cocaine powder cost around 93 this 
september about 19 percent higher than last year the survey 
found 
despite such encouraging signs many law enforcement officials 
contacted said their cities were still ravaged by drugs and the 
violence that attends the illicit dealing 
it cuts across all demographic factors said glenn levant 
deputy chief of police in los angeles who heads the bureau of 
special investigations it cuts across all walks of life 
landers who heads the narcotics unit in yonkers a city of 
190000 just north of new york city agreed it cuts through all 
ethnic lines and is literally the basis for most crimes in the 
city 
cocaine and its smokeable derivative crack remain the primary 
drug of concern to law enforcement officials in part because of 
the violence among dealers but other drugs are gaining in 
popularity officers said 
heroin appears to be on the increase in such diverse areas as 
new york city dallas denver kansas city mo and lowell mass 
police say 
methamphetamine known also as crank or speed is 
growing dramatically in iowa montana missouri colorado and 
washington lt rodney burk of springfield mo described 
methamphetamine as kind of a poor mans cocaine that provides a 
longerlasting high and is readily available because it is made in 
america 
marijuana still the nations most widely used illicit drug 
despite the attention to paid to cocaine and crack is showing up 
in greater quantities in dallas and minneapolis police say 
and the psychedelic lsd so popular in the late 1960s is 
gaining popularity in such places as kansas city brockton mass 
and tacoma wash 
nevertheless some officers are trying to look on the bright 
side 
as an optimist id say it wasnt getting any worse said 
fort lauderdale fla police detective barry margolis 
detective arthur mcclaren in brockton mass said its past 
the epidemic stage 
i think were making inroads said ramirez of the deas 
brownsville texas office i think were hurting some people 
weve been able to catch people that before were untouchable weve 
been taking their property their cash their luxury items

david dukes strong showing in louisianas 
weekend senate primary election brought instant repudiation from 
national gop leaders who shunned the exku klux klan leaders 
candidacy throughout his campaign 
we have taken the unusual step of censuring mr duke and as 
far as the republican party is concerned he does not exist 
republican national committee chairman lee atwater said in a 
telephone interview late saturday 
this is the first political action ive taken in many many 
moons said atwater hospitalized in recent months for treatment 
of a brain tumor i cant think of a better way to spend my 
political energy than denouncing david duke and everything he 
stands for 
hes a charlatan and a phony and hes looking to hang his 
views on any mantle of legitimacy that he can find national 
committee spokeswoman leslie goodman said sunday from washington 
duke a former klan grand wizard made it clear he has no 
intention of disappearing from gop politics at a news conference 
sunday he laughed off suggestions that he might again run for 
president as he did in 1988 as a democrat and a populist 
the republican state legislator said a run for governor of 
louisiana is more likely and he predicted he will become a force 
in national gop policy 
i want all my supporters who are democrats or independent to 
join in the republican party because the republican party is the 
only choice we have in this country right now for the will of the 
majority he said 
duke drew 44 percent of the vote in saturdays election despite 
opponents constant campaign focus on his past as a kkk leader with 
ties to nazi groups and his sale of nazi literature even after 
taking state legislative office last year 
goodman said dukes unexpectedly high share of the vote could 
have been a form of mass complaint from voters to the threeterm 
incumbent democrat j bennett johnston 
all republicans hope the defeat was the end of dukes 
political career goodman said 
johnston who won the election with 54 percent of ballots cast 
told consituents that he got the message from the more than 
600000 people who voted for duke 
louisiana state sen ben bagert a republican who dropped out of 
the race to help johnston avoid a runoff with duke said dukes 
strong showing may only be the beginning of the mischief he can 
make in gop politics 
bagert accepted some of the blame for failing to get his message 
across to voters but said national party officials were slow to 
react 
now because of their error timidness the republican party 
has in david duke the same destructive force that jesse jackson 
has brought to the democrats said bagert 
television ads by president bush werent broadcast until late in 
the campaign because of bagerts poor finances he dropped out of 
the race thursday saying his internal polls showed he was drawing 
just enough late support from johnston to risk putting duke in a 
runoff 
by the time he got out the party was already abandoning bagert 
on wednesday eight republican senators endorsed johnston 
bagert said the gop abandoned the battlefield to duke 
on sunday duke accused washington republicans of betraying the 
party by endorsing johnston he repeated major campaign themes 
calling for an end to racebased affirmative action programs no 
new taxes and welfare reform 
i think its time that we make sure the republican party does 
not continue its drift to the left he said

democratic gubernatorial candidate ann 
richards is struggling to gain ground on folksy gop rancheroilman 
clayton williams and analysts blame her fuzzy campaign theme and 
early neglect of core democratic values 
in a campaign notable for the candidates negative attacks on 
each other richards seems to be trying to outrepublican williams 
on issues such as crime analysts say 
i think she wasted too much time trying to emphasize campaign 
issues that are really his agenda said jerry polinard a 
university of texaspan american political scientist 
if he was managing her campaign he couldnt do any better 
hes had her running on his issues and shes not been talking 
about anything that makes him uncomfortable said polinard 
most opinion polls put williams ahead by eight to 12 percentage 
points williams promises to double the number of prison cells and 
introduce youthful offenders to the joys of bustin rocks he 
opposes gun control and objects to abortion except in cases of 
rape incest and danger to a mothers life 
richards new texas campaign theme is too vague analysts 
say but in recent days she has turned her attention to more 
traditional democratic issues such as soaring health insurance 
costs 
richards must emphasize environment education insurance reform 
and hit on the simple point that shes on our side and hes 
this rich guy whos on their side said east texas state 
university political scientist charles elliott 
williams is a multimillionaire who has been able and more 
willing to try to identify himself with some traditional texas 
myths says elliott 
he is never without his cowboy hat and often appears on 
horseback in his television commercials which have cost his 
campaign a fortune his biggest problem seems to be that he keeps 
putting his foot in his mouth 
williams recently said he hoped richards a 10year recovering 
alcoholic wasnt drinking again when she said new polls would 
show her gaining ground fast 
in march williams was forced to apologize for likening bad 
weather to rape and advising that if it were inevitable relax 
and enjoy it 
he then admitted visiting prostitutes as a youth saying that 
was how young men got serviced 
he said he was uncomfortable running against a woman he said he 
opposed gun control laws because citizens might have to march on 
the government someday and he said he would head and hoof 
richards like a calf and drag her through the dirt 
people think this guys a hoofinmouth millionaire said ed 
martin executive director of the state democratic party its 
making a lot of people have second thoughts 
williams spent more than 8 million in the gop primary and has 
spent 2 million on tv commercials since the primary election 
clearly hes got more tv exposure hes got more money to 
work with hes been on the tube more and longer than shes been 
elliott said 
richards has a chance if the next round of polls show williams 
lead slipping to less than 10 points says polinard but shell 
have to change her tactics 
it seems that every democratic candidate has a chapter in 
their campaign books right at the end that says if in a panic 
open this chapter and there it says populism said polinard 
elliott said richards recent commercial on health insurance 
costs has hit home 
she also needs to highlight her support for abortion he said 
williams has made his antiabortion stance very clear and richards 
needs to pound on that said elliott 
its an issue that will allow her to penetrate those yuppie 
suburbs in dallas and houston more than almost any single issue 
elliott said

to help ease the pain soldiers children 
in liberty county have covered school bulletin boards with 
snapshots of their parents usually mom or dad is pictured in 
armyissue desert tan 
the children are afraid wondering what life is like for the 
fathers and mothers who make up the desert shield in saudi 
arabia and about who will shield the families they left behind in 
eastern georgia 
the upheaval caused by the deployment of 14000 soldiers from 
nearby fort stewart to the middle east prompted hinesville middle 
school to form support groups for students 
theyre awfully worried theyre worried they might not come 
back theyre worried theyre not getting enough water said 
debbie clifton a counselor who supervises one of the peer support 
groups her husband william is an army captain in saudi arabia 
students at a recent session said the deployment disrupted their 
lives 
it gets lonely in the house sometimes said melissa rowan 
14 daughter of sgt 1st class john rowan it gets scary at night 
because theres no one to protect us i just want to let him know 
that i love him and we want him home 
elizabeth tezza 12 said her family put new locks on the doors 
after her father maj robert j tezza shipped out 
we write him letters almost every night she said its 
real hot over there he might get sunstroke or he might get hurt 
christina spankel 13 daughter of sgt 1st class william t 
spankel said she hopes the crisis can be settled peacefully 
my mom worries a lot she said its really scary at 
night 
counselors said some children resent the departure of their 
parents some misbehave and neglect their studies and some worry 
about family finances poison gas and the availability of water in 
the desert 
mrs clifton said teachers and counselors try to dispel rumors 
and give the children a realistic view of the situation they try 
to help students understand the grief process and reassure them 
that the sadness will pass 
she and another counselor marjory varnedoe began meeting with 
the two support groups last month during lunch breaks similar 
programs are being considered at other schools serving military 
children in the hinesville area 
about 8000 students many of them military dependents are 
enrolled in the liberty county school system an additional 1655 
attend two federally financed elementary schools at fort stewart 
virginia schubert a counselor at lyman hall elementary school 
said some army spouses visit the school to discuss their children 
and find it a safe place to talk about their own anxieties 
mrs schubert whose husband is a chemical warfare officer in 
saudi arabia said teachers encourage children to write their 
missing parents and tack their photos on bulletin boards 
gena churchwell a special education teacher at diamond 
elementary school said some children have responded to the 
deployment by misbehaving and others have become withdrawn 
linda flora a fourth grade teacher at brittin elementary 
school said teachers discuss operation desert shield the persian 
gulf region and encourage students to talk about their feelings 
she said one boy fearing he would become a poison gas victim 
stared at an open window at night and could not sleep another was 
thrilled when his father sent him a plastic bag of sand 
many of the teachers wear red white and blue ribbons to show 
their support for the soldiers each class has adopted an army unit 
and students are encouraged to write the soldiers in that unit 
school helps children stay occupied as they deal with their 
fears and loneliness flora said 
i think a lot of them are realizing that even if dad is away 
they still have school work the teacher said mom or dad might 
be gone but the school is still here

stalwart congressional defenders of the 
strategic defense initiative are relying on the menace of iraqs 
arsenal to renew interest in the beleaguered spacebased defense 
program 
nuclear and chemical warheads are with us yesterday they 
might have been used by the soviet union today they might be used 
by iraq rep jon kyl rariz said during house debate on sdi 
and the 1991 military bill 
as the cold war thawed and defense budgets shrank congress 
began to snip away at the program popularly known as star wars 
the socalled missile shield was six years old when congress 
first trimmed its budget last year this summer the senate again 
dropped an ax on the program cleaving 1 billion from the 47 
billion that president bush had sought for the fiscal year that 
began oct 1 
the same week the house armed services committee slashed 18 
billion from bushs sdi budget proposal and last month the full 
house further reduced the sdi budget approving 23 billion for 
the program in fiscal 1991 
with members of the house and senate meeting in a closeddoor 
conference to craft a final version of the defense budget a 
compromise sdi total of about 3 billion or less appears likely 
these reductions are being discussed and approved as us troops 
and equipment continue to pour into saudi arabia following iraqs 
aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
campaigning to save the program from deeper cuts sdi backers 
contend the soviet union still poses a theat they argue that sdi 
is key to future arms control agreements 
the overriding rationale presented during congressional debate 
and recent interviews is the weapons capability being developed by 
iraq and other third world nations 
the pace of weapons of mass destruction proliferation is truly 
a frightening process sen john mccain rariz a member of the 
senate armed services committee said in an interview 
lawmakers point to statements by cia director william webster 
earlier this year in which he told congress that by the end of the 
decade more than 15 third world countries will be capable of 
launching ballistic missiles and about six will have nuclear 
missiles 
in testimony on wednesday paul wolfowitz under secretary of 
defense for policy said iraqs capability of deploying its current 
missiles including its improved scud the alhussein is well 
over the 500kilometer range 
the range steadily increases its only a matter of time 
until they develop an intercontinental ballistic missile wolfowitz 
said 
sen malcolm wallop a member of the senate armed services 
committee noted that iraq has sent some type of missile into space 
while china continues to experiment 
its naive to suppose that neither ourselves nor our allies 
will be threatened in relatively short order the wyoming 
republican said in an interview wednesday why should we expose 
our people to terrorists when we have the ability to stop them 
wallop believes the major reason for the program is the soviet 
union which still possesses about 30000 nuclear weapons and last 
year produced 140 new icbms for a total of 1400 
in addition the soviet union made more than 40 strategic 
bombers last year while the united states manufactured one b2 
stealth bomber 
they continue to build these things said wallop who 
wonders what will happen if soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
is ousted mortals change their minds or are replaced by mortals 
of a different mind

the population of state and federal prisons 
rose by 80000 from june 1989 to june 1990 the largest growth in 
65 years of record keeping the justice department says 
the nations prisoner population reached a record 755425 as the 
numberoof inmates jumped 42862 during the first half of 1990 said 
a bureau of justice statistics study of state and federal prison 
populations 
the 6 percent increase during the sixmonth period was only 
slightly less than the record 46000 jump during the first half of 
1989 said the study released sunday 
it helped pace a record annual increase of 80000 prisoners from 
june 1989 to june of this year that stephen d dillingham the 
bureaus director called the largest growth in 65 years of 
prison population statistics 
the already overcrowded federal prison population grew by 8 
percent during the first six months of the year while the number of 
state prison inmates increased 58 percent the study said 
federal prisons hold nearly 60000 inmates the enactment of 
mandatory minimum sentences particularly for drug crimes and 
repeat offenders have helped swell the ranks of federal prisons 
the prison population growth created a weekly demand of 1650 
new beds for inmates the study found 
the growth in the number of women prisoners continued to out 
pace the increase in male inmates the study said 
the number of women prisoners jumped 71 percent during the 
sixmonth period compared to a 59 percent increase in the male 
inmates 
at midyear there were 43541 women and 711884 men in state or 
federal prisons 
illinois posted a 105 percent increase in its prison 
population the largest percentage increase of the 50 states 
followed by new hampshires increase of 103 percent 
prison populations declined in seven states alaska colorado 
new mexico rhode island oregon tennessee and west virginia the 
study said 
nationwide the incarceration rate was 289 people held in state 
and federal prisons per 100000 us residents 
the south had the highest rate 310 prisoners per 100000 
residents in the west it was 271 prisoners per 100000 residents 
followed by rates of 238 per 100000 in the midwest and 231 per

president roh taewoo fired his 
defense minister and the powerful chief of military intelligence 
today blaming them in a scandal involving charges the government 
spied on more than 1300 civilians 
opposition leader kim daejung one alleged target of the 
espionage joined student protesters in calling for the 
intelligence units dissolution 
dissidents said the scandal proves the undemocratic nature 
of rohs government 
charges in the past week of military surveillance of civilians 
including leading politicians have eroded government claims that 
the military is politically neutral and no longer a figure in 
politics 
presidential spokesman lee soojung said roh was holding the two 
fired officials responsible in the scandal he said the government 
would enact reforms to meet with circumstances befitting the new 
era but did not elaborate 
roh moved quickly in an effort to diminish the impact of the 
scandal it threatened to seriously jolt his government just as 
opposition politicians have boycotted the national assembly 
demanding broader democratic reforms 
in august all 78 opposition members of parliament resigned en 
masse accusing roh of railroading bills and ignoring demands for 
reforms 
defense minister lee sanghoon was being replaced immediately by 
former army chief of staff lee jongkoo 57 lt gen koo changhoe 
is new commander of the defense security command the military 
intelligence unit replacing lt gen cho nampung the presidents 
office said 
the new defense minister once headed the defense security 
command under disgraced former president chun doohwan chun has 
been in selfimposed rural exile to take responsibility for 
corruption during his sevenyear rule which ended in 1988 after 
massive studentled street protests 
kim daejung who heads the opposition party for peace and 
democracy and had been imprisoned for political activity during 
chuns rule said today that he would go on a hunger strike until 
the command is dissolved 
the militarys meddling in politics aims at wiping out the 
democratic forces he told a news conference 
about 25 students shouting antigovernment slogans staged a 
sitdown protest today at the defense security command headquarters 
near the us 8th army base in central seoul all were taken away 
by riot police 
about 50 students staged a onehour protest outside seoul 
national university to demand the command be disbanded wallposters 
demanding an end to political surveillance appeared on the campuses 
of at least six universities 
newspapers published reports saying military intelligence agents 
had in the past received passes to drive onto some campuses and 
operated offcampus coffee houses masquerading as waiters 
about 100 dissidents representing 20 leading antigovernment 
groups issued a joint statement today saying the political 
surveillance proves the immorality and undemocratic nature of the 
present regime 
the fired defense minister appeared to try to shed blame for the 
scandal by suggesting he had been powerless to control the 
intelligence unit he told reporters the system should be changed 
to give the minister complete control over military intelligence 
politicians citizens groups lawyers and dissidents reacted in 
outrage last week after a deserter 24yearold army pvt yoon 
sukyang disclosed the alleged surveillance of civilians in this 
nation of 425 million people 
rohs political foes demanded that he apologize publicly that 
the command be dissolved and that measures be spelled out to 
prevent further surveillance 
yoon deserted from the military intelligence operation on sept 
23 taking with him confidential papers computer discs and data he 
said were evidence of massive and organized illegal spying on 
civilians 
he provided data that included the names and personal records of 
governing party chairman kim youngsam kim daejung and 89 other 
lawmakers as well as hundreds of dissidents clergy and 
journalists 
the defense ministry said saturday it kept the information not 
for political surveillance but to protect or cut off those listed 
from enemies or impure elements 
roh promised to maintain the militarys political neutrality 
after taking office in 1988 
he took control of two thirds of the 299 national assembly seats 
in january by merging his party with two conservative opposition 
groups

the first world chess championship to be held in 
the united states in more than 80 years starts today with two 
highly different soviets competing in a battle of youthful daring 
against mature surgical precision 
the twomonth tourney of mental fireworks pits defending world 
champion garry kasparov against challenger and former champion 
anatoly karpov 
kasparov and karpov played their first match six years ago 
about 130 games later the two chess wizards remain arch rivals who 
command the board with expertise bordering on genius 
kasparov 27 the highestrated player in the history of chess 
is known for a gambling attacking style karpov 39 counters with 
methodical precise strategies 
kasparov is only two points ahead of his challenger and the 
difference in their temperaments looks politics and playing 
styles has heightened interest in the competition between the 
worlds two best chess players 
and its no secret that they dont get along 
when asked recently how they felt about each other kasparov 
replied do the yankees like the red sox 
kasparov is talkative flamboyant and fluent in english a 
media darling who tirelessly promotes chess fans in europe squeal 
at the mere sight of the darkhaired champion 
he has launched an anticommunist newspaper democratic russia 
in moscow and is the founder of a democratic political party 
during the match kasparov says he will play under the flag of 
the russian republic not the soviet union which he has said 
represents oppression and tyranny 
the fairhaired karpov is introverted and uses an interpreter 
but he has been known to interject english words at news 
conferences 
the older chessman a member of the communist party says he 
will play this match under the soviet flag he has been quoted as 
saying i have two loves communism and chess 
their chess styles match their temperaments kasparov gambles 
and goes for the jugular at the slightest hint of weakness from his 
opponent he doesnt worry about sacrificing pieces in the attack 
karpov plays with surgical precision resembling the style of a 
baseline tennis player he wins by making fewer mistakes 
kasparov wrested the world championship from karpov in 1985 
ending his 10year reign the younger man defended his title 
against karpov in 1986 in 1987 their championship match ended in 
a tie under the rules kasparov retained his title 
this years match will comprise 12 games in new york three 
times a week through nov 10 and 12 games in lyons france 
starting nov 24 
the 3 million championship is being staged in the theater of a 
midtown manhattan hotel it is the first world championship in the 
united states since 1907 
the winner will receive 17 million and the loser 13 million 
kasparov has said his earnings will fund my private interests 
and the political interest of the world karpov has said he will 
help victims of the chernobyl nuclear plant fire and promote chess 
in schools 
since world war ii seven of the world chess champions have come 
from the soviet union the only champion to break the soviet 
winning streak was american bobby fischer

the war on drugs

or get fat lets let them said richard c tolbert after all 
isnt this still america

was part of the national hemp tour 90 staged to spread 
information on the possible benefits of legalization and commercial 
harvest of marijuana 
tolbert told the crowd society has learned to live in relative 
peace with one of the most harmful drugs of all alcohol 
why not regulate all of these drugs the same way we do alcohol 
and allow them to be sold in liquor stores he said yes of 
course we should keep them out of the hands of minor children we 
should not sell beer or crack cocaine in vending machines and we 
probably should not sell tobacco that way either 
whether your drug of choice is alcohol crack cocaine 
tobacco marijuana valium heroin chocolate designer drugs or my 
personal favorite sugar we should be willing to live and let 
live the former kansas city councilman said 
tolbert called the war on drugs a waste of time and said society 
instead should fight crimes where there is a suffering victim such 
as theft and rape

at a time when many residents are rallying 
against housing prisoners in their neighborhoods a houston church 
congregation opened its homes to four federal prisoners armed with 
hammers and nails 
i was scared to death said matthew criswell construction 
manager for houston habitat for humanity which helps provide homes 
for poor people 
when i got the word they were sending us four prisoners i 
automatically started asking questions are we going to have to 
keep an armed guard here are they going to do what i say am i 
going to have to keep them away from telephones 
now i just wish they were back doing more work he said 
last week three convicted drug dealers and an income tax evader 
all members of a christian prison program helped build a 
fourbedroom house for a needy family in an impoverished houston 
neighborhood 
the prisoners didnt get special privilges or time off their 
sentences for the work but it didnt matter to inmate calvin 
edwards 33 who said he was working for the lord 
its been a blessing for me to be out helping people he 
said 
the effort was cosponsored by houston habitat humanity and 
prison fellowshiphouston 
the latter is a part of prison fellowship usa founded in 1976 
by charles colson a nixon administration aide sentenced to prison 
for his role in the watergate scandal 
under the program volunteers approved by their prisons warden 
and chaplain are allowed to take hammers and saws into the 
community to help others 
this is the third year the program has operated in houston 
they do construction or renovation for needy families that 
couldnt be met through conventional financing said don beard of 
crossroads baptist church which found homes for the inmates during 
their week of construction work in houston other churches provided 
lunches 
they stayed with these families showed up every night for 
bible study and then they went to the job site between 830 am 
and nightfall said beard himself a former inmate convicted of 
embezzlement 
they were just an inspiration to me criswell said just 
the fact that they have decided to turn their lives around and do 
whats right and help other people 
thats why were doing this said bruce daniel 49 a 
federal prisoner serving time in texarkana were helping others 
while serving the lord

a newly arrived kuwaiti refugee says 
resistance to iraqi forces virtually ended in his homeland after 
the occupiers began executing suspected resistance members 
sometimes in front of their families 
the former health ministry employee issa elnasrallah said the 
iraqis are forcing out kuwaitis to isolate the resistance 
his charges came as several hundred more kuwaiti refugees 
arrived sunday at the khafji border crossing in neighboring saudi 
arabia iraq had again relaxed restrictions on departing kuwaitis 
exiled kuwaiti officials say iraq is trying to chase away 
kuwaitis and repopulate the oilrich land with palestinians and 
iraqis 
nasrallah who fled with his wife and four children said many 
people in occupied kuwait believe iraq is preparing for combat 
there soon presumably expecting to do battle with the usled 
multinational force massed against it in saudi arabia 
they also want to isolate the resistance to have everyone but 
them leave theyre trying to force people out said nasrallah 
he said acts of resistance had stopped in kuwait city since the 
iraqis began killing anyone suspected of belonging to the 
resistance many in front of their families 
everybodys scared there they dont know when the iraqis will 
come in the house and kill them said yusuf alali 25 a kuwaiti 
airways pilot who also arrived during the weekend 
several hundred westerners are still believed to be hiding in 
kuwait fearful of being taken to iraq for use as human shields at 
military and other strategic installations 
iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 in a dispute over land and oil 
annexed the emirate and declared it an iraqi province 
later in august kuwaiti refugees reported that resistance 
fighters were staging desperate and daring attacks including 
suicide bombings at that time they said iraq had been unable to 
wipe them out 
exiled kuwaitis have directed the resistance from a forward 
command post in khafji three miles south of the border they had 
been smuggling in ammunition and communications equipment to help 
fighters inside kuwait 
in early september a senior guerrilla leader said the 
resistance had recruited thousands of volunteers from among kuwaiti 
refugees in saudi arabia at that time a senior saudi official 
said the resistance was growing in strength and stepping up attacks 
on the iraqi occupiers the latest opening of the border came 
friday after iraqi authorities intensified night searches in kuwait 
city refugees said the searches prompted many of them to leave 
out of fear 
iraqi troops were confiscating all identification papers in 
kuwait the refugees reported 
they said iraqi authorities had announced that everyone must 
hold identification cards issued in baghdad effectively making 
them all into iraqi citizens 
those arriving said iraqi troops at the border were seizing some 
men under age 40 and taking bribes to allow others to cross 
refugees claim young men are being sent back for iraqi military 
service 
the new opening of the border raised saudi fears the iraqis are 
planning attempts to infiltrate agents into the kingdom 
the new refugee influx is the largest since midseptember when 
7000 kuwaitis poured through over three days in the new crush 
more than 1000 refugees have arrived since friday 
an estimated 300000 kuwaiti refugees are in saudi arabia and 
neighboring persian gulf states before the invasion kuwait had a 
native population of about 600000

oklahoma city police chief dave mcbride says 
coddling juvenile offenders just leads to more adult criminals 
mcbride speaking at the 97th international association of 
chiefs of police convention criticized some parents and said the 
courts handling of juveniles is the biggest failure of the 
justice system 
theres almost no such thing as a firsttime adult 
offender mcbride said most of the adults in prison were 
handled a halfdozen times as juveniles 
mcbride and more than 7000 other police chiefs from around the 
world have gathered in tulsa for the convention chiefs from japan 
the philippines and germany also are scheduled to attend the 
sixday meeting which began sunday 
mcbride said he doesnt have all the solutions to juvenile 
crime but believes a starting point is at home 
there are more parental delinquents than there are juvenile 
delinquents he said too many parents send their kids to 
school to learn morality they dont have any guidance at home 
kansas city kan police chief tom dailey said more and more 
juveniles are getting into trouble in his city especially young 
car thieves and youth gang members he said vehicle thefts jumped 
by 1000 this year in his city compared to 1989 
weve got the same thing here said perry anderson chief of 
police in miami fla theyre active in auto thefts and burglary 
we arrest them then theyre right back on the streets again 
we just dont have the space to house them 
juvenile thieves are the least of chicagos worries with more 
serious offenders occupying officers time said police detective 
lt howard allen of chicagos youth section 
they probably wouldnt even get into a secure facility he 
said maybe if they had eight to 10 charges against them and the 
facility wasnt full but usually not 
most of the youths who go to jail or prison are charged with 
violent crimes like robbery arson and rape allen said 
chuck gruber president of the police chiefs group said the 
conference is the best chance for police from around the world to 
compare notes and share techniques 
its a learning process for police chiefs sharing information 
and hopefully coming away better prepared to do our jobs said 
gruber who is chief in elgin ill

more than 50 people shot by los angeles 
county sheriffs deputies since 1985 may have been unarmed and 
most of the victims were members of minority groups a newspaper 
reported 
sheriffs deputies have been involved in 56 questionable 
shootings in the last five years in which 26 people were killed 
none of the victims fired a weapon the los angeles daily news 
reported sunday 
just four of the shootings involved undisputed evidence that the 
victim had some type of weapon in hand when deputies fired the 
weapons were a knife a push broom brush head a sauce pan and a 
metal pipe according to the report 
in the other cases there was conflicting evidence over whether 
the victims possessed any weapon the newspaper said 
the newspaper study which examined the departments 202 
shootings since 1985 relied on the sheriffs own investigation 
reports called shooting books eightypercent of the 56 
disputed cases involved members of minority groups department 
records showed 
sheriff sherman block defended his departments record saying 
deputies are faced with rising crime in minority neighborhoods 
where the perception of danger often leads them into situations 
where shooting is justified 
there is bound to be a higher level of violent confrontation 
between law enforcement and those people block said 
the department has refused to disclose how many deputies were 
disciplined in the shootings or identify them the newspaper said 
last month a civil rights lawsuit was filed against the 
sheriffs department on behalf of 75 people who allegedly were 
victims of brutality or racial harassment by deputies at a 
sheriffs station in the city of lynwood block said the department 
is conducting an internal investigation into brutality questions

the soldiers of britains 7th 
armored brigade the desert rats of north africa fame have 
been assigned to us marine control in an unusual pairing in the 
persian gulf multinational forces 
officials say that in the event of war the 7000 british troops 
would fight as an integral unit of the 4th marine expeditionary 
brigade relying on marine air support and using natotype 
communications gear 
both sides appear to welcome the teaming despite their 
contrasting skills 
the 33000 marines trained primarily as an amphibious assault 
force using helicopters and landing craft have been in the saudi 
sand for six weeks 
the 7th brigade despite its desert legacy has spent much of 
the last 40 years in the green fields of western europe 
the british brigades two regiments recently spent some time 
training in hot dry terrain in canada but conditions there hardly 
compare with what the british will find in the saudi desert with 
its extreme heat and equipmentravaging sand 
advance parties of the brigade are already in saudi arabia and 
royal engineers are building a tent city located close to the 
marine base to be ready when the main force begins to arrive by 
air on oct 16 
the units equipment including 120 advanceddesign challenger 
tanks will be sent aboard 31 chartered ships british officials 
say 
the challengers fitted with 120mm main guns and what british 
experts call the worlds best armor are superior to anything the 
iraqis have british armed forces minister archibald hamilton 
said during a vist on saturday 
hamilton the secondranking official in britains defense 
ministry told reporters that the idea of putting the 7th brigade 
under marine operational control originated with the americans as a 
way of enhancing the capability of the marines 
we welcome it agreed a marine officer who asked not to be 
named everybody will keep their national identity but 
tactically the brits will be just another maneuver element in our 
force 
us officers say the marines will furnish the air cover for the 
7th brigade as well as their own troops the british will be 
responsible for their own logistics resupply and transportation

city efforts to improve race relations by 
increasing the number of black police officers instead have 
generated illfeelings among whites and blacks alike 
whites are angry that black candidates for police training 
didnt have to score as high as white applicants on the entrance 
exam also vexed were members of the denver black police officers 
association 
blacks as much as any others want to make sure that standards 
are not lowered said kirk l dunham president of the black 
officers association our lives are on the line because we do the 
same jobs as white and hispanic officers we want competent 
qualified black officers 
the complaints arose after all 96 black applicants who passed an 
entrance test in july were accepted for further testing while only 
89 of 636 whites were accepted and 15 of 160 hispanics advanced 
although all those accepted scored passing grades some of the 
blacks accepted scored lower than some of the rejected whites the 
200 people who passed the first hurdle are competing for only 40 
slots in the police academy class that begins nov 1 
the citys civil service commission is operating under a court 
decree that requires 45 percent of three upcoming police academy 
classes to be black the quota resulted from an agreement between 
the city and the police union 
blacks make up only 6 percent of the 1331member police force 
seventyseven percent of the officers are white the rest are 
hispanic or other minorities blacks account for 12 percent of the 
citys population 
city officials also were concerned by the high failure rate of 
blacks on the written physical and psychological portions of the 
july test of the 194 blacks who took the test 495 percent 
passed while 795 percent of the whites passed and 588 percent of 
the hispanics passed 
the city hired dr david morris president of the morris and 
mcdaniel consulting firm of washington dc to review the tests 
for any cultural biases 
morris said he found none but he did cite problems with the 
citys minority recruiting program 
in one instance recruiters pursued randm candidates at a 
shopping mall he said in another instance they recruited blacks 
who couldnt read and tried to teach them to read 
thats like sending a baseball coach or a football coach to a 
mall to recruit athletes just because theyre black morris 
said it was a waste of their time and the taxpayers money 
he said the city needs to begin recruiting minorities in high 
school find the ones with an aptitude for police work and support 
them through school and the academy financially and academically 
if the city would do that it wouldnt need an affirmative 
action program he said in three or four years the problem 
would take care of itself 
white candidates also were angered because the city set up a 
tutoring program to help blacks pass the test morris said whites 
also received tutoring but not as much as blacks 
jim belknap clerical services supervisor for the civil service 
commission stressed that the city did not lower its standards for 
black applicants and that all who were accepted made a passing 
grade 
youre still talking about bminus or cplus students he 
said 
john wyckoff a spokesman for the police department said he 
received just five complaints from citizens concerned the city was 
hiring less than qualified police officers 
were not compromising our position he said they still 
have to pass the test an individual who is not qualified is not 
hired

singled out for praise from the white 
house as the year began the city police department will close 1990 
struggling to restore its image after a rash of brutality and 
racism allegations 
police brass are developing a behavior modification program 
for offending officers after rising use of force complaints and the 
killing of more suspected criminals in 1990 than in the three 
previous years combined 
i think everybody is certainly not at the top of their game 
weve had an awful lot of incidents just in the last five months 
police chief steven bishop said i think it has hurt the 
relations greatly between this police department and the 
community 
only a few of his 1200 officers violate citizens rights but 
the bad apples are threatening to impair neighborhood confidence in 
police bishop said 
the trouble comes after president bush visited in january to 
praise cooperation between police and local anticrime groups 
calling the city a model for the war on drugs 
the simmering image crisis reached a fever pitch in late 
september when local television station kmbctv broadcast 
videotape of officers beating a white man 
news footage showed officers yanking the man through the open 
window of his van and onto the ground where one officer kicked him 
several times and another officer hit him with a small club 
most officers are just as ashamed and disgusted by what these 
officers did as i am and i think the community at large is said 
bishop a 20year veteran of the force who became chief in june 
the man had led officers on an hourlong chase through three 
counties he was charged with trying to run a police officer off 
the road 
the two officers resigned after the incident and bishop banned 
the weighted leather clubs called slappers that one of the 
officers used 
clay county prosecuting attorney mike reardon said a grand jury 
would look into the case 
last spring several white officers surrounded and bloodied a 
black priest with nightsticks after stopping his car because they 
said a passenger matched the description of an armed robber 
neither the priest nor his companion were charged 
in another incident a white officer hit a black minister in the 
head with a shotgun officers mistakenly thought the man a native 
of nigeria was drunk because of his thick accent he also was not 
charged 
both clergymen claimed the attacks were racially motivated 
officers have shot and killed six suspects so far in 1990 
compared to five over the previous three years four of the people 
killed were black and two were white 
in one case four officers fired 19 times at a black man 
brandishing a barbecue fork 
black community leaders said the death was racially motivated 
but a grand jury and bishop cleared the four officers two white 
and two black of wrongdoing 
bishop suspended the officers who beat the ministers and he 
suspended three undercover officers involved in the shooting of a 
black man who remains crippled 
the chief appointed a task force to develop ways to identify 
officers with rough tendencies the department plans a behavior 
modification program to teach problem officers how to better deal 
with citizens 
alvin brooks the citys human relations director is a founder 
of the ad hoc group against crime a liaison between the department 
and the black community 
he said the recent cases reinforced a perception in black 
neighborhoods that officers want to harass and brutalize blacks 
it becomes a selffulfilling prophesy said brooks a former 
police officer and prominent black leader 
despite the prevailing negative perceptions brooks said most 
officers enforce the law fairly 
overall i dont think you can say its racism he said i 
think its unfortunate that a few folks like in any other 
profession lose sight of their mission

camp david is open as usual for president bush and his guests 
but the closed sign is hung at the visitors center in the 
surrounding catoctin national park 
it was a scene repeated at national parks from new york to 
hawaii after the federal government ran out of money at midnight 
friday 
the shutdown ruined some vacations and inconvenienced countless 
americans over the weekend but its full impact will not be felt 
until tuesday when federal offices are scheduled to reopen after 
the threeday columbus day weekend 
most of the 24 million federal workers were being told to 
report to work on tuesday but without a budget agreement most 
would likely be sent home soon afterward 
richard darman the white house budget director said only 
workers performing services needed to protect life and property 
would stay on the job 
that includes weather service meteorologists air traffic 
controllers prison guards meat and poultry inspectors and the 
military mail delivery would continue since the postal office is 
not dependent on government appropriations and the national 
hurricane center in miami was continuing to track tropical storm 
klaus 
congress and bush administration officials continued wrangling 
over a budget into the night sunday bush meanwhile spent most of 
the weekend at the presidential retreat at camp david md the 
president opted to travel by motorcade rather than take a 
helicopter it was cheaper that way a white house aide said 
camp david is located in the catoctin mountain park and the 
adjacent cunningham falls state park however the retreat is a 
navy installation staffed permanently by navy personnel and marine 
guards its recreational facilities were not subject to the 
shutdown 
in the nations capital the washington monument the white 
house and the smithsonian museums were closed the grounds of the 
national zoo were open but the animal buildings were not 
sightseers could walk around the lincoln memorial or the vietnam 
veterans memorial but there were no park service officials to 
answer questions and no cleanup crews to pick up trash leaders of 
the national committee for american war veterans a volunteer group 
that maintains a vigil near the vietnam memorial said they would 
begin picking up trash on the mall 
this ones closed too dad was a refrain repeated time 
after time around the capital 
a roanoke rapids nc boy scout troop had this reaction to the 
locked doors at the national air and space museum it stinks 
troop leader bill johnson said the boys wont forget this and 
i expect theyll go home and tell their parents about what happened 
to them 
ironically the capitol was one of the few tourist sites open in 
washington unfortunately we are the only game in town so our 
tour guides are really busy said tom keating executive 
assistant to the house sergeant at arms 
still the action in the capitol was limited at best when the 
house came into session at 4 pm only to recess again moments 
later loud booing erupted from the galleries packed with 
tourists 
they should have settled the budget instead of going on 
vacation said 20yearold kara dimugno of southington conn 
referring to the long recess members of congress took in august 
while the national parks were not closed services were 
virtually nil for the most part restrooms were closed first aid 
assistance was not available and guided tours were canceled 
at the saratoga national park in new york park rangers turned 
away a man who annually reenacts gen horatio gates defeat of 
british soldiers sunday was the 213th anniversary of the 
revolutionary war battle 
the annual historic fair was canceled at georgias andersonville 
national historic site the confederate prison camp where 123000 
union soldiers died during the civil war 
an awful lot of people were angry that we were closing the 
gates but when congress said close it down we closed it down 
said park ranger mark ragan 
john diehl of chicago was vacationing in hawaii and had hoped to 
see the arizona memorial before heading to the island of kauai 
instead he and his friends were greeted by a closed sign 
its time to elect some new representatives and senators 
since they cant get the budget passed he said joining other 
tourists peering through locked glass doors of the visitor center 
staring out over pearl harbor at the memorial 
at yosemite national park in california visitors were forced to 
leave the campgrounds after nonessential rangers were sent home 
but some hikers parked vehicles outside gates and went back in on 
foot 
we ought to lay off the people at the top said richard 
chaboya of san jose why attack the pleasures of the average 
people 
judy laymon a clerk at the private lake amistad resort and 
marina in south texas on the rio grande river said what i want 
to know is are they going to shut down the borders id hate to go 
over to mexico to eat and not be able to get back

once again the government finds itself on the 
financial precipice because of the inability of a republican white 
house and a democratic congress to agree to a solution to the 
worsening deficit problem 
here are answers to some frequently asked questions about the 
impact of budget stalemate on americans 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q why is the federal government forced to shut down 
a because the budget dispute prevented enactment of any of the 
13 regular appropriations bills for fiscal 1991 the federal budget 
year that began oct 1 the constitution states that no money 
shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of 
appropriations made by law while some appropriations are in 
permanent law most daytoday government operations are renewed 
annually in one of the 13 spending bills 
what that means is that government agencies are not allowed to 
spend money including for salaries or purchases unless there is a 
law authorizing them to do so since there wasnt even a stopgap 
law in place saturday the agencies were legally required to send 
people home and close down 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q has this ever happened before 
a yes similar squabbles have forced the government to shut 
down temporarily three times in the past decade 
it happened briefly in november 1981 when an estimated 400000 
employees were dismissed at midday after president reagan vetoed an 
emergency money bill on oct 4 1984 about 500000 government 
workers were sent home by congress failure to approve an 
appropriations bill 
and on oct 16 1986 the government sent 500000 
nonessential employees home but congress later in the day 
passed an appropriations bill acceptable to reagan and workers were 
ordered to report on their next shift 
congress as it had done in 1981 and 1984 passed a resolution 
ordering that employees furloughed get their regular salaries 
anyway

q what is this grammrudman act i keep hearing so much 
about and why was it passed 
a congress enacted the law named for sens phil gramm 
rtexas and warren rudman rnh in 1985 and revised it in 1987 
in passing the law congress in effect admitted that it could 
not make the tough choices needed to halt deficit spending without 
some outside pressure to force them into it 
the law requires congress and the president to reduce the 
deficit to predetermined annual targets leading eventually to a 
balanced budget if the targets are missed the law requires 
acrosstheboard spending cuts to do the job congress could not 
the target for fiscal 1991 is 64 billion but the presidents 
estimates are so far above that number that bush and congress agree 
it is impossible to reach they will change it to a much higher 
number if they agree on an overall budget package the result 
will be to delay the goal of a balanced budget probably until 1996 
or beyond 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q what events prompted the current shutdown 
a on sept 30 the last day of fiscal 1990 bush and the 
bipartisan congressional leadership announced agreement on a 
fiveyear 500 billion deficitreduction package that included 
approximately 134 billion in new taxes congress passed and bush 
signed a oneweek temporary appropriations bill to keep the 
government operating while congress passed the plan bush went on 
national television tuesday night to appeal for congressional 
support of the package but it was decisively voted down thursday 
night 
members of the house and senate approved another stopgap 
spending measure known as a continuing resolution on friday 
that would have kept the government running until friday oct 12 
and would have given lawmakers another weeks time to arrive at a 
budget consensus but bush vetoed that bill saturday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q how will the shutdown affect me can i still catch my flight 
for example 
a the government began closing socalled nonessential 
facilities saturday including parks and tourist attractions but 
air traffic controllers are among those considered essential 
however if the deadlock persisted there would be a reduction in 
the number of controllers allowed to work 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q what is meant by essential and nonessential 
a each agency decides what is an essential service but 
generally staying on the job will be workers dealing with national 
security health emergency and similar things the military air 
traffic controllers border guards medical institution personnel 
and prison guards will be unaffected federal meat and poultry 
inspection will continue during a general shutdown

the states welfare providers are going 
to have to bite the bullet this year but not as hard as once 
feared thanks to a lastminute infusion of 932 million in 
newfound revenue 
this is going to ease the pain a lot said baldwin 
bunkley budget chairman for a coalition of nearly 100 advocacy 
organizations for floridas economically disadvantaged including 
the poor homeless and disabled 
florida like other states is still strapped for cash for 
social service programs but an 11thhour surge in lottery ticket 
sales coupled with an early loan repayment and money found in 
various trustfund accounts has helped ease the financial burden 
this year 
as a result gov bob martinez and the state cabinet are to vote 
tuesday on a proposed 541 million cut in state department of 
health and rehabilitative services programs the figure 
recommended by state budget officials friday is down from an 
earlier proposed cutback of 1473 million 
officials say the 541 million shortfall will still add up to 
substantial reductions in programs however 
private day care centers in south and central florida may have 
to stop serving hundreds of poor children whose single mothers are 
trying to find work and break the cycle of welfare dependency said 
jack levine executive director of the florida center for youth amp 
children 
several new programs designed to keep juvenile delinquents out 
of detention centers and adult prisons also will be slashed levine 
said 
these juvenile slots are pure and simple prison 
prevention he said 
also anyone seriously hurt in an accident could be affected if 
the state reduces its support of emergency room equipment and 
personnel at hospitals bunkley said 
the need for budget cuts became evident last month when state 
economists discovered tax collections would fall 540 million short 
of projections under the state constitution florida must adopt a 
balanced budget but in the past few weeks the state found 2152 
million to offset the reduced revenues 
about 80 million came from a loan to the department of 
transportation from the general revenue fund that wasnt due to be 
paid back until 1996 the rest came from trust funds where money is 
kept for specific state programs and a windfall of lottery revenues 
when sales soared for last months 1065 million lotto jackpot 
chris schuh executive director of the state association for 
retarded citizens said she was thankful the extra money was found 
but she noted the proposed cuts also come in a year when 
lawmakers are not appropriating costofliving increases to private 
groups that contract with the state to provide welfare services 
its a ridiculous situation to be in that you are thankful 
that your programs are not going to be cut she said

the spinning drill bit bites into soft pine 
an inch from ed beherns left index finger finding its mark safely 
over and over 
his skill in creating wooden toys would be remarkable for 
anyone but beherns accomplishes his work without seeing what hes 
doing the 80yearold craftsman is blind 
there is no hint that he cant see his work in the finished 
wooden tractortrailer trucks the small railroad steam engines 
the pickup trucks wheelbarrows and wooden animals he builds in his 
basement shop 
i know just about where everything is unless somebody moves 
it said beherns who moves gracefully through the narrow and 
twisted passages in his workshop where the musty smell of cedar and 
the spicy aroma of freshly worked pine fill the air 
he says he finds joy building toys childrens rocking chairs 
tables and doll cradles he sells his work but only for enough to 
cover his expenses 
and he looks ahead to new challenges 
in his mind lives the blueprint for a working steam threshing 
machine a scale model of the one his brother harry used to own 
it will be 18 inches long and an alcohol burner will make the 
steam 
the thresher will be metal and beherns will use the 
metalworking skills he developed during a 31year career at a 
kankakee factory 
he started working with wood 10 years ago shortly after he 
began losing his sight to glaucoma a blind craftsman from 
champaign visited him and suggested he try building bird houses 
now beherns has a long waiting list of people who want his 
custombuilt bird houses to give as holiday gifts 
his interest in toys originated a bit earlier when he was 
growing up on a farm in illinois 
when i was a kid you know there wasnt too much money in 
those days i used to make my own toys he said i made trucks 
a whole construction outfit even a crane and i made a 
caterpillar tractor and put an alarm clock mechanism in it to 
drive the thing 
his blindness makes him an even better toymaker because now he 
feels the contours and tests the smoothness of finished surfaces 
with hands made extra sensitive by his lack of sight 
before he says id only look at the pieces

it took 46 years but the us air 
force finally honored a world war ii hero with its most prestigious 
medal for airborne bravery 
as family and friends gathered saturday around his bed at the 
hallmark nursing center a us air force colonel pinned the 
longawaited distinguished flying cross on the chest of jack ward 
as copilot of a b24 bomber an injured ward continued to fly 
his plane over austria and hungary after it had been hit allowing 
crew members to parachute to the ground the pilot had died 
instantly 
there are five of us living today because of him said 
gilbert fisher the planes nose gunner from bethesda md 
a military oversight kept ward from receiving his medal 
his wife beverly wrote to politicians and military officials 
her efforts were futile until a newspaper article caught the 
attention of rep dana rohrabacher 
rohrabachers staff gathered accounts of the mission from those 
who flew with ward and eventually the air force relented 
ward 67 a former los angeles teacher who suffered a stroke 
eight years ago stared at the ceiling with brimming eyes as he was 
praised during saturdays ceremony 
ward was only able to respond with a stick clenched in his 
teeth pointing to a board with letters on it he spelled out 
thanks for coming 
i thought frankly he was going to be dead before this 
happened mrs ward said this is like being able to hear your 
own eulogy

a capitalist empire brought a glittering road show to los angeles 
this weekend with an emphasis on the colonys most glamorous 
product fashion

council played down the impending return of the british crown 
colony to china in 1997 and staged a fiveday cultural celebration 
called festival of the lantern 
its aim is to show off hong kongs best and opening night was 
a hollywoodstyle extravaganza with a dazzling fashion show 
colorful lion dances and fireworks lighting up the sky over the

the full moon shone brightly on this replica ff the traditional 
hong kong moon festival 
we want the public to be aware of hong kong said 
christopher cheng a garment manufacturer and member of the htdc 
board who helped stage the event the los angeles promotion is one 
of 10 being held in cities around the world 
chengs californiabased pacific coast highway sportswear firm

manufacturers 20 percent of its products in hong kong 
cheng a native of hong kong educated in the united states has 
vowed to keep doing business in hong kong long after the 1997

creations by its own designers 
to raise the status of hong kong we have to encourage young

the rate of alcoholism and drug abuse among 
homosexuals may be three times as high as for people in societys 
mainstream it was reported today 
three out of every 10 homosexuals have a drinking or drug abuse 
problem according to figures from the national lesbian and gay 
health foundation 
about one out of 10 people in mainstream society have the same 
types of problems according to the boston globe which cited the 
gay health groups figures 
fraelean curtis a boston clinical social worker and president 
of the national association of lesbian and gay alcoholism 
professionals said lesbians are at even greater risk of substance 
abuse than gay men because they also must deal with sexism in a 
society that tends to devalue women 
many homosexuals may turn to alcohol or drugs because they 
suffer from diminished selfesteem and impaired sense of 
selfworth said don wert executive director of the pride 
institute in minnesota an inpatient substance abuse center 
specifically for homosexuals 
thats not unlike other marginalized social groups wert 
said among native americans and in black and hispanic 
communities you tend to see the same overrepresentation of 
addiction 
in the case of homosexuals finding a cure for substance abuse 
can be more difficult wert said 
ordinarily clients who are recovering from alcohol and 
drugs tend to feel better about themselves he said 
but for lesbian and gay clients youre taking away their 
anesthesia and they are feeling more strongly than ever their 
sense of not being ok of being alien in their own communities 
schools churches and homes 
the difference in treatment for lesbians and gay people is 
that part of their recovery means examining understanding 
affirming and ultimately celebrating their sexuality also wert 
said

armed kgb border guards boarded a greenpeace 
vessel in the arctic early today after it defied a soviet ban and 
sent four activists ashore to a soviet nuclear test site 
environmentalists aboard the ship said 
the dutchregistered ship mv greenpeace stopped in the barents 
sea off novaya zemlya island after the soviet icebreaker threatened 
to open fire and allowed the 15 soviets aboard 
radio contact with the greenpeace was lost about 20 minutes 
later shannon fagan of greenpeace in norway said 
in a radio report from the ship activist steve shallhorn said 
the soviets who boarded told the greenpeace crew that their ship 
had violated soviet territory 
a few hours earlier the protesters sent four activists ashore 
in rubber raft shallhorn said 
we dont know if they are aware that our party went ashore we 
are going to try to stay in the area until we get our landing party 
back which could take a couple days he said he said the ship 
was four miles from the island 
in moscow kgb spokesman viktor pressman said the agency had no 
information on the greenpeace ship the kgb supervises border 
guards who would be involvced in such an action 
the mv greenpeace with about 35 western activists and five 
soviets aboard had permission to tour the soviet arctic but has 
been told by the soviets to steer clear of novaya zemlya where the 
antinuclear organization had planned a protest 
the island was a primary soviet nuclear test site until the 
early 1960s greenpeace claims it was used as recently as 1988 
the group claims new tests are planned there stirring 
opposition in nordic government circles and among other 
environmental groups 
shallhorn said the icebreaker armed with deck guns had pursued 
the mv greenpeace since wednesday and had threatened to fire so 
we decided to stop

an infant diagnosed with a usually 
fatal heart defect healed by himself amazing doctors who thought a 
transplant was the only way to save his life 
the parents of 9weekold weston wells kilpatrick will be able 
to bring him home this week officials at loma linda university 
medical center said 
dr steven gundry a pioneer in infant heart transplant surgery 
said it is unlikely the child will ever need a transplant 
its the first time weve seen it gundry said saturday 
adding that he believed the healed birth defect was unprecedented 
in medical history 
weston who was born july 27 was brought to loma linda 
university medical center when he was 4 days old after doctors 
concluded he had hypoplastic left heart syndrome 
the boys damaged heart grew stronger as he waited for a heart 
transplant donor gundry said 
theoretically we knew the left ventricle might be able to 
grow because we know the right ventricle can grow if you keep the 
blood flowing but to our knowledge it has never been reported for 
the left ventricle the doctor said 
parents layne and janet kilpatrick both 31 had moved from 
lompoc to redlands to be near the medical center known for advances 
in child heart transplants 
doctors determined westons heart had three abnormalities that 
would normally have killed a baby within two weeks if left 
untreated gundry said 
he had an abnormal mitral valve which regulates the flow of 
blood through the heart an abnormally small left ventricle the 
pumping chamber of the left side of the heart and a constricted 
aorta the main artery that carries blood through the body 
as the family waited for a heart donor doctors treated weston 
with a drug that kept open a heart blood vessel that normally shuts 
down after birth 
a few weeks ago doctors noticed that the babys left ventricle 
had grown considerably and was gradually becoming functional 
a surgical team successfully performed an operation friday to 
enlarge westons narrowed artery and to close the artery that was 
no longer needed 
gundry said weston may need minor surgery in the future but 
will probably not need a heart transplant

a beirut newspaper today quoted diplomats 
as saying final arrangements were being made for the release of 
british hostages believed held by shiite moslem extremists i 
lebanon 
it was the latest in a series of reports predicting some would 
be freed this week 
in related development a british newspaper quoted a shiite 
leader in lebanon as saying the future of western hostages should 
no longer be linked to that of arab prisoners 
the paper the independent said the statement could herald a 
breakthrough in efforts to secure the release of the 13 westerners 
missing and believed held hostage in lebanon by proiranian shiite 
fundamentalists 
a series of news reports have predicted the release of foreign 
hostages following the restoration of british and iranian 
diplomatic ties in late september after an interruption of 19 
months 
the ties were broken during the dispute over iranian death 
threats against british novelist salman rushdie 
president hashemi rafsanjani of iran apparently has been seeking 
to free the hostages to help improve relations with the west 
following the june 1989 death of his countrys fundamentalist 
patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini rafsanjani has been opposed 
by radicals in his own government 
the leftist beirut newspaper assafir today quoted 
unidentified diplomats as saying the release of the british 
captives awaits the proper time but it said arrangements for 
freeing them have been put on a hot burner 
it was impossible to verify the report the paper is known to 
maintain close links with leftist and fundamentalist shiite 
factions 
the beirut paper said the fate of the foreign hostages also 
depends on the lebanese government extending its authority to 
greater beirut which includes the southern slums 
those slums where most of the westerners are believed held are 
a stronghold for the proiranian hezbollah or party of god the 
umbrella group for the captors 
the syrianbacked government of president elias hrawi has 
pledged to spread its authority over all of beirut as a step toward 
ending the 15year civil war 
in another report the conservative newspaper addiyar said 
sunday that an unidentified iranian envoy had arrived in beirut to 
complete preparations for freeing anglican church envoy terry waite 
in the next few days 
arab sources in syria said sunday that syrian officials were 
making strenuous efforts to free some westerners missing in 
lebanon 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said syrian 
foreign minister farouk alsharaa was trying hard to resolve the 
issue but was encountering unexpected obstacles 
he did not elaborate but he noted that sharaa was expected to 
meet soon with iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati to 
discuss the issue 
addiyar said waites release was expected to be the preface 
to releasing all british hostages in lebanon 
waite 51 the envoy of the archbishop of canterbury 
disappeared in west beirut on jan 20 1987 he had left his hotel 
for a meeting with islamic jihad or islamic holy war the group 
that claims to hold american captives terry anderson and thomas 
sutherland 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld foreign captive he was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
the other missing britons are journalist john mccarthy retired 
pilot jack mann and writer alec collett 
the revolutionary organization of socialist moslems claimed in 
1986 that it hanged collett in retaliation for britains support of 
us air raids on libya no body was produced but british 
officials believe collett is dead 
in its report today the independent quoted sheikh mohamed 
hussein fadlallah as saying the hostage issue can be settled in 
such a way that no party feels he has been blackmailed 
the sheikh as described as the most important spiritual adviser 
to hezbollah 
in the past kidnappers have said the western hostages wont all 
be freed until the release of lebanese and palestinian prisoners in 
israeli jails and of shiite extremists held in kuwait 
fadlallah said he believed as earlier reports have indicated 
that the 15 moslems imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the french and 
us embassies there in 1983 had escaped after the iraqi aug 2 
invasion 
he said he believes they are no longer in kuwait 
we call on every side that could do something about this 
humanitarian issue to dissociate these two problems from each 
other the sheikh said 
the sheikh was also quoted as saying he had been interviewed by 
anderson two days before the american reporter was abducted 
i tried very hard to help him on several occasions and i was 
unable to do so but the change in the political atmosphere in the 
region and in the world could bring about a happy result the 
sheikh was quoted as saying

links european currencies to one another to avoid huge swings in 
exchange rates with british membership 10 of the currencies of 
the 12nation european community are linked in the system 
under the rules of erm membership the british government is 
obliged to halt any rise in the pound outside its upper band of 
313 german marks to the pound sterling is allowed to range within 
6 percent of its central rate of 296 so its lowest exchange rate

the end of the week

international economist at james capel amp co

japanese yen closing at 13005 yen later in london it was

hepatitis b an inflammation of the liver kills 
about 14 americans every day but a gallup survey to be released 
today indicates most people know almost nothing about the disease 
the survey shows that 69 percent of all us adults from 
1855 do not know that a vaccine exists to prevent people from 
becoming infected with hepatitis b said dr david l hoff 
medical director of the akron ohio city health system 
eightythree percent of those surveyed also acknowledged they 
knew little or nothing about the disease hoff said 
the results were to be discussed by hoff during the annual 
meeting of the american academy of family physicians today 
some 1000 people were surveyed nationwide by telephone sept 
1017 as part of a patient and physician education program for 
smithkline beecham 
hoff said of the adults questioned nearly twothirds were 
married 40 percent were high school graduates or had taken 
technical courses and 40 percent had taken college courses or had 
college degrees 
the real cause of concern of the data from this survey is the 
lack of awareness of the seriousness of the disease and the 
availability of a preventive vaccine hoff said this is 
particularly worrisome when you think of those in our society who 
are presumably less in touch with such issues and could be at high 
risk for contracting the disease 
officials say that about 300000 persons are afflicted annually 
by the disease in the united states and about 5000 people 
including 300 health care workers die of the disease or its 
complications 
the virus spread by blood or other body fluids is many times 
more contagious than human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause 
of aids officials say 
the us centers for disease control says that persons with 
multiple sexual partners and people who use injectable illicit 
drugs are at risk of contracting the virus and should get the 
vaccine

here is the text of todays citation by 
the nobel assembly for the nobel prize in medicine and the summary 
of the winners achievements as released in an english language 
statement 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the nobel assembly at the karolinska institute has today decided 
to award the nobel prize in physiology or medicine for 1990 jointly 
to joseph e murray and e donnall thomas for their discoveries 
concerning organ and cell transplantation in the treatment of 
human disease 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this years nobel prize in physiology or medicine is given for 
discoveries that have enabled the development of organ and cell 
transplantation into a method for the treatment of human disease 
joseph e murray discovered how rejection following organ 
transplantation in man could be mastered e donnall thomas managed 
to diminish the severe reaction that the graft can cause in the 
recipient ie the socalled graftversushost reaction gvh 
in addition thomas could show that intravenously infused bone 
marrow cells were able to repopulate the bone marrow and produce 
new blood cells 
murray successfully transplanted a kidney between homozygous 
twins for the first time he pioneered transplantation of kidneys 
obtained from deceased persons and could show that patients with 
terminal renal insufficiency could be cured the field was then 
open for transplantation of other organs such as liver pancreas 
and heart 
thomas was successful in transplanting bone marrow cells from 
one individual to another bone marrow transplantation can cure 
severe inherited disorders such as thalassemia and disorders of the 
immune system as well as leukemia and aplastic anemia 
murrays and thomas discoveries are crucial for those tens of 
thousands of severely ill patients who either can be cured or given 
a decent life when other treatment methods are without success

dianne feinstein and pete wilson traded 
sharp jabs and barbed oneliners over abortion campaign 
fundraising and leadership qualities in the first of two scheduled 
debates in the california governors race 
feinstein attacked wilsons absenteeism from the us senate 
and he criticized her record on taxes sundays televised debate 
produced no knockouts but drew political blood from both 
candidates 
although both are seasoned politicians each postured as the 
political outsider while criticizing the other as the establishment 
candidate feinstein the democratic former mayor of san francisco 
has 20 years in public office wilson californias republican us 
senator has held various elective offices for 24 years 
feinstein repeatedly keyed on wilsons political ties to the 
policies of retiring republican gov george deukmejian describing 
wilson as the candidate for the status quo 
wilson endorsed proposition 140 which limits the number of 
terms in political office and is bitterly opposed by most state 
legislators he also stressed feinsteins political alliance with 
assembly speaker willie brown and senate president pro tem david 
roberti 
i am not beholden said wilson i do not owe willie i do 
not owe david 
feinstein sharply responded well senator if you really feel 
you cant handle willie brown or david roberti then stay in 
washington ill handle them 
each candidate tried to outdo the other in appealing to voters 
who are prochoice on abortion 
ive been prochoice longer than dianne feinstein wilson 
said 
feinstein fired back with a recitation of alleged contradictions 
between wilsons prochoice statements and senate votes against 
abortion funds 
pete wilson isnt prochoice she said i think hes 
multiple choice 
wilson also mocked the tough and caring slogan of 
feinsteins television commercials saying that as mayor she 
supported a utility tax that fell hardest on the elderly and poor 
i dont think that was very caring tough but not caring 
wilson said 
he also criticized feinstein for taking large campaign donations 
in the wake of a judges overturning of proposition 73 which had 
limited individual donations to 1000 
feinstein accused wilson of having the worst attendance record 
in the congress missing votes on the death penalty supreme 
court confirmation middle east resolutions and the budget 
some observers gave feinstein a slight edge in delivery and 
wilson a slight edge in content but nearly all agreed that both 
candidates probably did a better job of pleasing voters already 
committed to them than winning new supporters 
a second debate is scheduled next week in san francisco recent 
polls have found the race to be a tossup

pengun the musk ox has already learned to 
maneuver a ceiling sling at point defiance zoo since her left 
foreleg was amputated in september 
a veterinarian now hopes infections heal enough to allow her to 
become perhaps the first musk ox in the world to receive an 
artificial leg but fitting a 300pound animal with a prosthesis 
can be tricky 
this is a unique special animal at a unique special zoo 
said veterinarian rick williams this probably wont happen again 
for 100 years 
the 10yearold musk ox fell one night in august and hurt her 
left leg zoo authorities said after the leg became infected 
veterinarians were forced to amputate 
williams is waiting for the infection to heal before he tries 
fitting pengun with an artificial leg 
pengun which means little hill in aleut was brought to the 
tacoma zoo with five other musk oxen from nunivak island alaska

a pod of killer whales in prince 
william sound is declining in number according to researchers 
studying whether the whales were affected by the 1989 exxon valdez 
oil spill 
the study sponsored by the national marine fisheries service 
is finding that the number of whales in the ab pod a family group 
that lives much of the year in the western part of the sound has 
dropped from 35 animals to as few as 22 during the past two 
summers 
nothing like this has been documented before said craig 
matkin a marine zoologist conducting the prince william sound 
study 
theyre all missing out of one pod he said its a pod 
thats been very stable the mortality rate for mature females 
especially has been just almost nil 
yet researchers in the sound last summer could not find seven 
whales including several females and another five or six whales 
appeared to be missing when scientists returned to the sound this 
summer matkin said 
killer whales in resident pods like the ab pod travel in 
femaledominated packs matkin said several of the ab pod mothers 
and offspring are apparently missing and some young whales have 
been seen accompanying older females other than their mothers 
the whole social structure seems to be breaking down as we 
lose more females matkin said were worried about the future 
of the pod he said 
as many as a dozen other killer whale pods along the gulf of 
alaska also are being studied but apparently have not experienced 
unusual population drops he said 
speculation about the causes of the population changes in the ab 
pod are being kept confidential as are most publicly funded 
scientific data from spillrelated studies lawyers for the federal 
and state governments have said releasing information now could 
hurt them years from now in court when they try to recover money 
from exxon for the damage caused by the spill

japanese officials responded cautiously today to 
reports that the soviet union may be willing to return some of the 
disputed islands that have been the main barrier to better ties 
between the two nations 
japanese newspapers said on sunday that soviet officials offered 
the compromise over the southern kuril islands to a group of 
japanese lawmakers who visited moscow late last month 
the proposal shows a desire to improve japansoviet 
relations foreign minister taro nakayama said in a statement 
but he added that japan has demanded the return of all the islands 
which were seized by the soviets at the end of world war ii 
prime minister toshiki kaifu talking to reporters on his trip 
to saudi arabia said he would carefully consider the proposal if 
it were delivered through formal channels 
however the soviet news agency tass said the soviet foreign 
ministry had not made any new proposals to japan concerning the 
islands 
tass quoted a senior soviet diplomat as saying reports that the 
soviet union had expressed readiness to transfer a portion of the 
island chain to japan did not reflect the facts he said the soviet 
foreign ministry was preparing a refutation of the reports 
both sides recently have seemed eager to resolve the 45yearold 
dispute 
for the soviet union improved ties could mean a muchneeded 
infusion of capital from japans financial reserves 
for japan an agreement could open the way to joint development 
of the soviet unions plentiful natural resources particularly 
siberian oil 
the disputed territory consists of three islands and a cluster 
of islets off northern japan totaling only 2000 square miles 
the soviets claim them as historically russian territory while 
tokyo insists they were ceded to japan in 19thcentury agreements 
japans kyodo news service quoted governing party officials as 
saying that soviet officials had proposed a new bilateral agreement 
that would confirm a 1956 japansoviet joint declaration in that 
declaration moscow agreed to return one island and a group of 
smaller islands 
but when japan signed a mutual security treaty with the united 
states in 1960 the soviet union declared it would return the 
islands only after all foreign troops were withdrawn from japan 
kyodo said the soviet compromise proposal also called for a 
peace treaty within three to five years after the two countries 
sign the agreement because of the dispute the nations have never 
officially ended their war hostilities

after two years in captivity echo and 
misha spent a second day in freedom today with scientists looking 
over their shoulders to see how captive dolphins adapt in the wild 
the two dolphins will be under scrutiny of the mote marine 
laboratory for the next year the scientists watched anxiously 
saturday when the duos flight to freedom got off to a somewhat 
rocky start 
seconds after being lowered into the water echo and misha sped 
away and promptly beached themselves on a sandbar researchers 
swam to the animals and gave them a second shove to liberty 
it will take them a while to get their bearings said 
conservation biologist randy wells when they start swimming 
along the coast and socializing with other dolphins then well 
call it a success 
within an hour the two were spotted swimming with a pod of 
about three dolphins 
wells affiliated with the chicago zoological society took the 
dolphins from the same harbor off ruskin in the summer of 1988 for 
a project at the university of californiasanta cruz to study the 
sophisticated system of sounds dolphins use to gather information 
about their watery environment 
last month the two 300pound dolphins were transported to mote 
on central floridas gulf coast to prepare for their return home 
while other captive dolphins have been released in the wild 
wells said this is the first project involving electronic 
monitoring and tracking to find out how captive dolphins readjust 
and socialize 
successful reintroduction into tampa bay could open up new 
vistas it could mean that in the future dolphins might only need 
to be taken from the wild long enough to breed with captive 
dolphins to replenish the gene pool 
already a perth australia oceanarium that closed down has 
inquired about the project amid plans to free its nine dolphins 
controversy about dolphins in captivity seems to grow every 
day ms dieffenwierth said if we find they can be 
reassimilated putting them back in the wild may be a solution

doonesbury creator garry trudeau says he urged 
wife jane pauley to walk away from nbc altogether when she was 
edged off the today show in favor of deborah norville 
trudeau wanted to satirize the morning program in his irreverent 
comic strip because it had a formal kabukilike quality that 
would have been a natural for me he said in a rare interview in 
the oct 15 issue of newsweek magazine 
but pauleys broadcast career appears in retrospect to have 
benefited from her move and trudeau says writing about his own 
family in his comic strip would be a violation as well as 
infinitely banal 
pauley has wrestled with the same conflict between public and 
private lives she told people magazine last week that shed love 
to interview her husband but a he would never do it and b i 
would not ultimately do it but i know its a neat story 
trudeau said he decided to talk with newsweek to commemorate the 
20th anniversary of the strips syndication he wisely chose a 
magazine pauley had told people shed be really irritated if 
he did an interview with a rival television network

in this town overlooking the plain of 
armageddon israeli civilians have begun picking up the gas masks 
their government is distributing to counter a feared iraqi chemical 
attack 
government officials launched the program sunday in yoqneam 
where the bible says the battle of judgment day will be waged and 
in two other small towns they say they will provide the free masks 
to all 47 million israelis which is expected to take several 
weeks 
officials tried to promote calm as residents trickled into 
instruction centers in school classrooms where soldiers showed how 
to use gas masks and poison antidotes 
the classrooms were festooned with the handiwork of pupils and 
children received colored gas masks to help ease their fears 
its colorful and pretty so the child should not get afraid 
said a female instructor holding up a redandyellow gas mask for 
infants 
its troubling said aliza artzi after putting her 
2yearold daughter through a plastic antigas tent for infants 
her daughter tali seemed unphased 
ms artzi said she hoped the kit would never be needed but 
believed otherwise asked whether she believes war is likely she 
said i think so 
officials said that within days they will have handed out masks 
to the 30000 people of ofakim kfar yona and yoqneam 
israelis have already paid for their gas masks through their 
obligatory national insurance premiums 
the army says most palestinians in the occupied territories will 
not be given the protection kits since they do not pay national 
insurance however they will however be able to purchase the kits 
bought by the army in europe at cutrate prices of about 20 each 
the government announced the program a week ago during an 
escalation of tensions in the 2monthold persian gulf crisis 
iraqi president saddam hussein has threatened to draw israel into a 
war if his country is attacked and he has threatened to use 
chemical weapons 
yoqneam a hilltop town of 7000 about 40 miles north of tel 
aviv has problems that extend far beyond fears of chemical attack 
indeed it is a microcosm of israels setbacks as well as its 
successes 
an immigrant town it was a showcase of the jewish melting pot 
a thriving community of moroccans russians kurds romanians 
iraqis bulgarians and nativeborn sabras but this summer its 
biggest employer the soltam munitions plant went under and the 
work force has fallen from 4500 to 150 
sacked workers who occupied the building were ousted by guards 
with attack dogs leaving yoqneam deeply embittered 
now with unemployment at 15 percent russian immigrants are 
pouring in 400 so far this year 
some of them were shopping in the supermarket on sunday before 
heading up the hill to the oranim school to pick up gas masks 
they dont really understand what its all about said eva 
maman a saleswoman they have other problems 
at the school sat a crosssection of israel an elderly man in a 
skullcup a young woman in a designer tshirt and sunglasses a 
middleage couple perspiring from the exhausting uphill hike to the 
school and the artzi family their little girl sucking furiously 
at her pacifier as the instructor described symptoms of gas 
poisoning trembling bodily secretions inflamed eyes 
this is the injection orange up green down barked the 
toughlooking instructor in olivegreen uniform 
how do you remember easy orange the sun up green the 
grass down 
the army instructors also handed out leaflets in hebrew arabic 
russian and english hebrew and russian placards decorated the 
walls 
there was no hint of panic the schools were empty for the 
jewish festival of sukkot so no classes were disrupted yoqneam 
snoozed away the hot afternoon hours 
men played backgammon in a coffee shop a car driven by hassidic 
jews passed by with music blaring from loudspeakers towing a 
mobile sukkah the traditional hut in which the observant spend the 
eightday holiday

charge both he and the grandmother deny 
retired judge theron a yawn visiting from alachua county to 
preside over the misdemeanor case summoned 20 prospective jurors

the assault charge aug 29 shortly afterward investigators 
publicly named him as a suspect in the deaths of the five students 
whose bodies were discovered the three preceding days

dr e donnall thomas who blazed a new path for 
the treatment of leukemia when he performed the first human bone 
marrow transplant in 1956 said today he always considered the 
nobel prize a long shot at best 
thomas 70 of bellevue wash and joseph e murray 71 were 
awarded the nobel prize in medicine today officials in stockhom 
sweden announced 
murray affiliated with brigham and womens hospital in boston 
was recognized for his discovery of a method to prevent tissue 
rejection when organs are transplanted in people 
thomas with the fred hutchinson cancer research center in 
seattle said he learned of the good news when awakened by a 
reporters telephone call early this morning 
i really thought this work was too clinical to ever win the 
prize thomas said there are many scientistresearchers out 
there who are eligible for this prize 
its a long shot at best and it would be a mistake to waste 
time thinking about winning it 
the prize shared by murray and thomas worth 695000 is 
endowed by the will of dynamite inventor alfred nobel who died in 
1896 
thomas said he hasnt had time yet to think of what he will do 
with the money 
thomas who took after his father and fulfilled his childhood 
desire to become a doctor performed the first human bone marrow 
transplant in cooperstown ny in 1956 
the surgical procedure has become standard treatment for many 
sufferers of leukemia and lymphoma which are types of cancer 
thomas joined the university of washington faculty in 1963 and 
went to the hutchinson center when it opened in 1975 the center is 
now one of the worldsleading cancer treatment and research 
institutions 
i think its a recognition of a lot of work by a lot of people 
who have worked on the problems over the years i have a medical 
team here of some 50 physicians and phds who now work with me on 
this its been very gratifying to see the procedure become 
accepted as the primary form of treatment for leukemia thomas 
said 
in a bone marrow transplant the patients diseased marrow is 
destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation diseasefree marrow is 
removed by needle from the hip bone of a donor often a relative 
and dripped intravenously into the patient in time the 
transplanted cells begin to grow in the patients marrow and 
produce new white and red blood cells and platelets

dr joseph e murray who won the nobel prize in 
medicine today was chief surgeon of a team whose pioneering 
transplant operation 35 years ago began the nowroutine business of 
shifting organs from person to person 
that operation the first success after 15 failures at last 
showed that transplants were possible but several more years 
passed before doctors found ways to reliably outsmart the bodys 
natural defenses against alien organs 
the nobel assembly of the karolinska institute in stockholm gave 
the prestigious medical prize jointly to murray 71 and dr e 
donnall thomas 70 whose work helped diminish the severe reaction 
that bone marrow grafts can cause in recipients 
although the two physicians did not collaborate on their 
prizewinning work murray recalled today that they began their 
careers together at peter bent brigham hospital in boston where 
murray still practices 
he was a resident in medicine and i was a resident in 
surgery murray recalled this was after world war ii we both 
started working in transplants together but from different angles 
its marvelous to share it with him 
murray spoke by telephone from his daughters house in the san 
francisco suburb of lafayette he was in the bay area for an 
american college of surgeons conference 
i was sound asleep and my daughter came in and woke me up and 
said daddy i have good news for you murray said i 
couldnt believe it obviously 
he gave credit to his chief of surgery dr francis d moore 
and said he had been thinking about all of his colleagues although 
he had not spoken to them yet 
i just talked to my family that of course is most 
important he said we have six children and they called from 
all over the country 
murrays groundbreaking operation was performed dec 23 1954 at 
brigham hospital doctors removed a healthy kidney from 23yearold 
ronald herrick and gave it to his identical brother richard 
richard lived for seven more years he died of heart disease 
that was a complication of his underlying kidney disorder 
the herrick brothers were genetically identical their operation 
did not answer the problem of shifting organs between people whose 
tissues are not exactly the same 
the brigham team showed that such operations might be possible 
in 1959 when they transplanted kidneys between brothers who were 
fraternal not identical twins 
the doctors gave the recipient cortisone and low weekly doses of 
radiation in an effort to suppress his immune defenses but they 
did not believe the treatment was powerful enough to stop rejection 
and were unsure why the operation succeeded 
in 1962 murray performed the first successful kidney transplant 
from an unrelated donor the key to this operation was the drug 
azathioprine which suppresses the bodys immune system and keeps 
it from fighting off the new organ 
dr george hitchings a codeveloper of the drug won the nobel 
prize in medicine two years ago 
americans have now won or shared the prize in medicine 32 times 
in the past 21 years compared with 19 winners from all other 
countries combined 
the prize shared by murray and thomas worth 695000 is 
endowed by the will of dynamite inventor alfred nobel who died in 
1896

mayor david dinkins said today that whatever his 
new beds headboard cost and it reportedly cost 11500 the 
city will not pay a penny of it 
the mayor said he has instructed city officials to find out by 
tuesday whether it really took 11500 for a city carpenter to 
duplicate a headboard that would have cost 1600 in a store 
whatever the explanation the city will not pay a single penny 
of the cost dinkins said in a statement issued by his press 
secretary albert scardino it will all be covered by private 
donations from friends of the city many of whom have contacted me 
this morning to offer their contributions 
dinkins was stung by a newsweek magazine story about the 
headboard which came days after the citys money woes prompted the 
mayor to freeze hiring propose new taxes and raise the possibility 
of laying off 15000 city employees 
dinkins said the headboard was delivered to gracie mansion the 
mayors official residence on friday it was built to match other 
pieces of a bedroom set that dinkins said he paid for himself 
i wish somebody would ask me why dont i seek reimbursement 
for the 8000 or 9000 i spent on the bedroom suite no questions 
have come to me in that regard i contributed that he said 
sunday at the pulaski day parae 
dinkins statement said the city had received contributions of 
1400 toward the cost of the bed 
earlier scardino said materials for the headboard cost 1400 
and that it was paid for by the gracie mansion conservancy a 
private nonprofit organization labor cost should have added up to 
an additional few hundred dollars at most scardino said 
the headboard was built by anthony russo a carpenter on the 
staff of the citys human resources administration newsweek said 
he has submitted bills for 266 hours of labor at a cost to date 
of 648412 according to a work order obtained by newsweek two 
hra sources told newsweek the complete job is expected to total 500 
hours at a cost of 23 an hour or 11500 
the dinkinses chose a cherrywood set and bought nightstands and 
bureaus from a private company with their own money for 8000 
officials said the matching headboard had been discontinued by the 
company so the conservancy agreed to buy the materials to build 
one 
scardino speculated the bill that newsweek obtained might 
actually have been for a series of jobs 
its possible this bill represents many jobs thats the only 
way to explain it because theres no possible way the labor cost 
of the headboard could be more than the rest of the furniture 
bought for the room he said

for the past several years the us commerce 
department approved export licenses for american companies to ship 
technology to iraq that could be used against us troops a 
newspaper reported 
the commerce department was largely unhindered in its drive to 
promote trade with south africa libya iraq and iran the 
cleveland plain dealer reported in articles sunday and today 
pentagon and other government officials with expertise about 
weapons and national security interests were routinely kept in the 
dark about many usmade exports they say now threaten american 
troops the newspaper reported 
if the exports are in the gray area of dual use chances are 
we dont even know about it said william n rudman the 
pentagons deputy undersecretary for trade security policy 
if the pentagon has suspicions about a deal it has no legal 
authority to stop the shipment it would be up to the state 
department to do so he said 
they commerce department wanted to push as much stuff out 
the door as they could said stephen bryen a former pentagon 
trade security official 
the newspaper said that from 1984 until just months before 
saddam husseins invasion of kuwait the commerce department 
approved at least 15 licenses to export tens of millions of dollars 
in equipment and technology that intelligence specialists believe 
could be used to help pack iraqs arsenals 
among the licenses were ones allowing us businesses to sell 
iraq mainframe computers useful in designing and plotting the 
course of missiles and to sell furnaces that could melt and cast 
nuclear materials 
the newspaper said that in 1987 the commerce department agreed 
to allow a new jersey company electronics associates inc to sell 
a halfmilliondollar analog computer system to iraq it was 
similar to one at the white sands missile range in new mexico the 
companys brochure had a photo of a missile on the cover 
the pentagons office of national trade security protested the 
sale but the computer was shipped anyway the newspaper said 
at least twice executives at another new jersey company 
consarc corp themselves raised the possibility that iraq intended 
to buy the companys furnaces and computers for nuclear purposes 
instead of for their stated purposes of making knee joints and 
artificial hips 
in july just as the furnace was about to be loaded onto a ship 
in philadelphia president bush blocked the shipment 
paul freedenberg former head of export controls for the 
commerce department defended the departments decisions saying 
that toozealous blocking of exports would erode the united states 
competitive edge and that iran south africa or others would get 
the product from another country such as germany 
i dont have any regrets said freedenberg i dont 
remember any particular export i have second thoughts about 
still he conceded that if it turns out iraqs an enemy 
obviously the pentagon will have been proven right in its 
objections but at the time there was no legal justification to 
deny the export licenses freedenberg said

the communist party central committee today opened 
its first meeting since julys party congress with the nations 
worsening economy a major topic tass reported 
the committees meeting comes as the party is losing its 
authority and membership 
earlier this year the party surrendered its constitutional 
monopoly on power prominent members such as russian federation 
boris n yeltsin and the mayors of moscow and leningrad have quit 
the republics are exercising more independence from the kremlin 
and the soviet president and party leader mikhail s gorbachev is 
transferring much of his power to the government 
tass said that participants in todays meeting included the more 
than 400 members of the central committee the partys central 
control commission party leaders from the 15 soviet republics 
territorial regional and district party officials academics and 
national legislators 
in july the 28th party congress expanded the central committee 
from 249 to 412 members most of them centrists like gorbachev 
todays session was likely to provide clues as to what role the 
central committee will play in the changing soviet union 
tass also said the move to a market economy was expected to 
dominate todays meeting 
the communist party newspaper pravda carried an article by ruben 
safarov a participant in julys congress who suggested that the 
party may have to leave the political arena if it keeps its old 
methods of operation 
the party also has been openly criticized by radical groups 
seeking their share of power on sunday in the western siberian 
city of krasnoyarsk hundreds of people gathered and shouted 
anticommunist slogans such as god rid us of the communist 
party according to local activist anatoly popov 
the supreme soviet legislature has set up a committee to combine 
several programs on rescuing the soviet economy and report back by 
oct 15 
the most radical reform proposal written by economist stanislav 
shatalin calls for junking the central planning system and moving 
to a market economy within 500 days by selling factories to private 
owners and breaking up collective farms 
the most conservative proposal backed by prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov would leave the government in control of most of the 
economy while moving gradually to allow free enterprise 
gorbachev has backed a compromise that contains many elements of 
the 500day plan but would not move as fast he also wants a 
national referendum to decide whether to return land to private 
farmers 
on sunday grbachev met with leading economists to discuss the 
economic plans under consideration tass reported 
gorbachev opened todays plenum with a speech and his deputy 
vladimir ivashko also gave a report tass said it did not provide 
details 
the communist party has lost more than 765000 members this 
year leaving it with about 18 million members party personnel 
chief boris pugo has reported 
some 375000 members have followed yeltsin and other reformers 
in quitting the party another 125000 members were expelled 
120000 died and 150000 stopped paying their membership dues or 
participating in party activities

chancellor franz vranitzky remained in a 
position today to rebuild his broad coalition government but a 
charismatic populist campaigning on a nationalist platform scored 
big gains in national elections 
vranitzky defied predictions of large losses for his socialist 
party in sundays vote but his conservative partner the peoples 
party suffered the worst electoral setback of its 45year history 
joerg haiders populist freedom party nearly doubled its 
parliamentary representation on the strength of his appeals to 
nationalist sentiments warnings of rising crime and complaints 
over austrias relatively liberal immigration policies for eastern 
europeans 
the socialists consider haiders party too far to the right to 
be considered a governing partner and the 53yearold vranitzky 
offered to join with the peoples party in another governing 
coalition 
voters seemed to prefer personalities to parties reflecting 
widespread dissatisfaction with bureaucracy corruption and party 
privileges 
it was a vote for the chancellor said the socialist party 
chief secretary josef cap in assessing the result 
vranitzky led a campaign largely focused on his continuing role 
as head of government his popularity appeared responsible for his 
success despite a series of scandals involving socialist officials 
tampering with public funds 
according to final results the socialists won 43 percent of the 
popular vote and 81 seats in the 183seat parliament one more than 
in the last elections in 1986 
the peoples party led by vice chancellor josef riegler 
suffered losses in each of the countrys nine provinces dropping 
to 60 seats from 77 
haiders freedom party nearly doubled its seats from 18 to 33 
winning almost 17 percent of the popular vote 
the environmental green alternative party won an additional seat 
for a total of nine 
vranitzkys government was to submit its resignation tuesday 
after the regular cabinet session according to longstanding 
tradition president kurt waldheim will ask vranitzky as leader of 
the strongest party to form a new government 
the chancellor met with waldheim today as did peoples party 
leader josef riegler to discuss the outcome of the elections 
the socialists showing amounted to a victory for their party 
after ollsters predicted heavy losses for both governing parties 
but the relatively low turnout of 83 percent of the 5628912 
registered voters suggested that many austrians are unhappy with 
the status quo turnout in 1986 was 90 percent 
haider 40 appealed to voters seeking change after 45 years of 
governing by either the socialists or the peoples party he lashed 
into government bureaucracy special advantages for party members 
corruption and sometimes other political leaders 
green leader johannes voggenhuber attributed some of the 
socialists success to vranitzkys clear no to governing with 
haider and to his conservative partners failure to clearly rule 
out that possibility 
he said the peoples party had thus committed political 
suicide on an open stage 
haider said his party intended to remain in the political 
opposition saying it would be good for austria to have a 
mediumsized party opposing the government 
he attributed his partys strong gains in this country of 76 
million people to its role as a successful opposition in the 
past legislative period 
helmut kukacka the peoples party general secretary called it 
a heavy depressing defeat he acknowledged we are certainly 
the big losers 
the conservatives still bear the burden of their support four 
years ago for waldheim who is accused of concealing his world war 
ii past waldheim was not considered a major issue in this 
campaign however

an italian artist has claimed in his will 
that he was the author of a painting previously attributed to 
leonardo da vinci and estimated to be worth millions of dollars 
the claim was made by cesare tubino who died in this northern 
city last week at the age of 91 the turin daily stampa sera 
reported monday 
if the painting is ever sold it must carry my name 
tubinos will read according to stampa sera a relative of tubino 
elio pretolani confirmed the newspaper story 
the madonna with cat first surfaced in the 1930s and was 
shown at a prestigious milan exhibition in 1939 after several 
experts attributed it to the 15th century master 
but it disappeared soon after and was believed to have been 
stolen or lost it was found in tubinos apartment after his death 
stampa sera wrote that tubino used the style and the original 
colors of leonardo and succeeded in creating the conditions of 
aging to trick the experts

when a slum in the nations secondlargest 
city burst into violence last week a raw sore was exposed in this 
country proud of its social order and growing affluence 
during the nearly weeklong street violence in the airin district 
that eased sunday the face of a largely hidden underclass finally 
emerged it is a group of outcasts who feel abused by the rest of 
society particularly the police and gangsters who so closely 
monitor their lives 
you can never understand this feeling a 50yearold laborer 
lying on a park bench shouted at a visitor during the height of the 
rioting how do you know what it is like to be treated like the 
dregs of society everyone treats us as if we are less than human 
so go away 
airin which means love your neighbor is considered 
japans largest slum more than 90 percent of its 25000 residents 
are day laborers 
at first glance the district looks like an ordinary 
neighborhood but on closer examination one quickly discovers 
airin is a world apart from the rest of japan 
drunken men sleep on the dirty streets the stench of urine and 
garbage is pervasive barracks made of cardboard boxes fill the 
local park shabby hotels that charge 770 a night do a booming 
business 
airins day laborers are among the poorest people in this 
economic superpower supplying the manpower for local construction 
jobs they are japans unfortunates farmers and businessmen who 
went bust minorities facing discrimination family outcasts and 
exconvicts 
reports that a police official was suspected of taking 84600 
in bribes from gangsters who control the labor market touched off 
the riot 
angered workers who see themselves as victims of both police 
and the gangsters quickly massed in front of the local police 
station and were soon stoning police 
in following days the crowds set fire to automobiles looted 
stores and waged pitched street battles with the 2500 riot police 
in violence rarely seen in japan nearly 200 people mostly police 
were injured more than 50 were arrested airin was quiet for a 
second day monday 
allegations of police corruption in osaka are not unusual but 
the airin residents are particularly angered by allegations of 
police collusion with the gangsters known as yakuza who control 
the daily recruiting of laborers for construction companies 
sen arimura who works at the districts job placement center 
says part of the money construction companys allot for workers 
salary which is usually no more than minimum wage eventually 
winds up in the pockets of recruiters many of whom belong to the 
mob 
for example laborers often spend much of their earnings on 
gambling a stronghold of the yakuza and end up with huge debts 
many of the popular cheap bars and pachinko parlors the 
japanese version of pinball halls in the area are also run by 
gangsters 
police report that with about 40 offices run by gangsters airin 
is considered a highcrime district 
in response police have set up 24hour crime prevention 
surveillance cameras at 16 locations the system infuriates airin 
residents who say the close surveillance invades their privacy 
people in this town are extremely sensitive about their 
privacy because most of them have hidden pasts that they do not 
want to be revealed said a coffee shop owner who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
do you know the feeling when you are consistently watched 
arimura asked here police seem to assume that everyone is a 
potential criminal what can be more discouraging 
laborers also complain that police do not investigate complaints 
that gangsters are taking advantage of the workers 
its as if we are lower than gangsters one laborer said 
when i heard about the bribery case i felt like shouting that it 
was our money the cop was getting from gangs and he was helping 
those gangs exploit us 
said another middleaged worker we are outcasts of society 
who got kicked out of the ordinary world and ended up here we are 
being sandwiched between police and gangsters but where else can 
we go now

hearthrobs but we appreciate it anyway 
we know we werent competing with anybody but thats the best 
we can do richards replied 
ulysses meanwhile raced across the solar system on its 
fiveyear roundabout journey to explore the suns poles the 
plutoniumpowered craft was traveling at a recordbreaking speed of 
34130 mph 
achieving a polar orbit around the sun will let scientists study 
the sun from a previously unexplored vantage point 
its deployment and discoverys spectacular blastoff this weekend 
renewed the space agencys spirits shaken in recent months by 
failed launch attempts nagging hydrogen leaks and the flawed 
hubble space telescope 
the crew of five astronauts were awakened early today with the 
us coast guard hymn radioed to them from mission control the 
wakeup call came at about 145 am edt 
it was played in honor of this years 200th anniversary of the 
coast guard and because mission specialist bruce melnick is the 
first coast guard officer to fly in space 
good morning houston richards said 
the crew then went about their early morning duties which 
included an hour of exercise they are scheduled to stay in orbit 
until a wednesday morning landing at edwards air force base calif 
the saturday morning blastoff from cape canaveral fla was the 
first shuttle launch in nearly six months the columbia and 
atlantis shuttles have been grounded since early summer by the 
hydrogen leaks 
at kennedy space center nasa started preparing for the next 
shuttle launch the crippled columbia was being moved from one 
launch pad to the other today so atlantis can be transported from 
the hangar to the vacated pad 
nasa was embarrassed when workers left a 70pound beam inside 
the engine compartment of atlantis last week the beam had caused 
minor damage when it banged around as the shuttle was lifted into 
an upright position 
but nasa officials did not expect it to delay atlantis 
earlynovember liftoff by more than or so when the shuttle is set 
to embark on a secret military mission 
six hours after discoverys launch and without a hitch the five 
crew members dispatched ulysses into space 
with the missions primary goal behind them on the first day 
astronauts have since turned their attention to various scientific 
and medical experiments aboard the orbiter 
its going real well weve accomplished the main objective 
that is to deploy ulysses and the other objectives are going 
smoothly flight director gary coen said today were all happy 
weve gotten back into the air in this fashion 
later this morning mission specialist bill shepherd began 
another test of an experimental system using voice commands to 
control television cameras the astronauts met with little success 
when they first tested it in space sunday 
nasa television showed pictures of shepherd working with the 
experiment which is designed to give astronauts the opportunity to 
do more than one thing at a time by freeing them from manually 
operating the cameras 
prior to launch melnick and shepherd recorded simple commands 
onto computer chips to control the cameras before blastoff melnick 
had better luck sunday than shepherd who even reprogrammed the 
system with the sound of his voice in space 
shepherd had problems today and decided to reprogram the system 
once more 
its going a little better than yesterday but its still not 
optimum for controlling the cameras with this kind of 
recognition he told mission control 
but the system still failed to recognize about nine of his 
commands and so shepherd turned the test over to melnick who only 
had trouble with two words 
the system will be tested again monday mission control 
suggested that next time shepherd speak a litte louder and closer 
to the microphone used in the experiment 
in another shuttle first the astronauts sunday started a small 
fire aboard the orbiter as part of an experiment to study the 
spread of flames in space 
as cameras recorded the experiment the fire burned about 70 
seconds within a sealed aluminum container shuttle safety managers 
wanted to observe how fire acts in the absence of earths gravity 
the astronauts sunday also extended discoverys 50footlong 
robot arm for another experiment two patches of material identical 
to that on solar panels of a communications satellite are attached 
to the arm 
the 157million satellite has been stranded in a low earth 
orbit since march when it failed to separate properly from an 
unmanned titan rocket 
intelsat an organization of countries that owns the satellite 
wants to measure how much the same kind of material on the 
satellite will decay in space before nasa sends up astronauts in 
early 1992 to repair the craft 
provided the results from this experiment are not wildly 
different from what we expect it will be the final piece of data 
that gives us the confidence to go ahead and rescue the 
spacecraft said intelsat scientist andrew dunnet

for many cuban commuters getting to work 
these days means riding a bicycle instead of a bus one of many 
hardships resulting from declining soviet oil deliveries to the 
island 
with economic ties shrinking and their respective ideologies no 
longer in harmony sovietcuban relations are facing greater 
uncertainty now than at any time in more than two decades 
according to us and cuban experts 
although official relations remain cordial there has been a 
sharp reduction in economic ties particularly soviet fuel exports 
to the island forcing president fidel castro to impose 
increasingly draconian austerity measures 
the economic hard times in cuba have prompted widespread 
speculation among diplomats that the cuban revolutions days may be 
numbered but cuban officials point out that despite the 
difficulties there has been no serious challenge to castros 
legitimacy 
when soviet president mikhail gorbachev began implementing 
radical changes several years ago many experts wondered whether 
the soviets would decide to cut assistance to cuba estimated by 
the us government to be 5 billion annually in economic aid alone 
during much of the previous decade 
now with the soviet economy itself facing a crisis the 
question has shifted 
the issue is more one of soviet capacities than of soviet 
intentions says cole blasier chief of the hispanic division at 
the library of congress 
curiously castro seems to agree has the ussr wanted to harm 
us castro asked in a speech late last month no the soviet 
government has made every effort and i say this with all honesty 
to fulfill the supplies we agreed on 
the sovietcuban relationship has changed dramatically from the 
pregorbachev era when the friendship of the two countries seemed 
unshakable 
starting about two decades ago cuba willingly lent itself to 
soviet strategic objectives sending troops by the tens of 
thousands to support prosoviet governments in africa and 
elsewhere in return the soviets lavished more aid on cuba than 
any other country shelling out premium prices for imports of cuban 
sugar citrus and nickel according to the soviet media cubas 
debt to moscow is about 24 billion 
in the past economic agreements were reached well in advance of 
target dates leaving both countries ample time to gear up for 
their implementation in his speech last month castro commented on 
how much things have changed lately 
to date we do not know what the basis of our trade with the 
ussr will be next year castro said no one knows how much they 
are going to pay for our sugar for our products what price are we 
going to be charged for the products supplied by the ussr what 
amount of fuel are we going to receive no one knows at this time 
although practically only three months remain before the end of the 
year 
the soviet deficit in fuel deliveries to cuba is more than 2 
million metric tons this year prompting castro to impose severe 
energy saving measures among the economic projects which have been 
sacrificed for lack of fuel are a nickel plant a thermoelectric 
power plant and an oil refinery 
the government has asked citizens to cut monthly household 
electricity use by 10 per cent supplies of gasoline for private 
motorists have been reduced by 30 per cent 
fuel shortages have forced the cancellation of many bus routes 
cuban authorities have responded by importing thousands of bicycles 
and distributing them to workers throughout havana 
adding to the uncertainty is the soviets stated intention to 
shift foreign economic relations from an ideological to an economic 
basis starting in january some in the kremlin however argue that 
cuba deserves special consideration because of castros long years 
of loyalty to the soviets 
sen bob graham dfla said last month after a visit to the 
soviet union that he envisions no reversal of the decline in 
sovietcuban relations 
the soviets have clearly concluded that fidel castro is no 
longer a luxury that they can afford graham said particularly 
as he grows further and further away from their objectives of 
glasnost and perestroika

us sen j bennett johnston won a fourth 
term but former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke says his 
strong showing may translat into the beginning of a national 
political agenda 
or maybe a run at the louisiana governorship 
duke claimed 44 percent of the vote in saturdays race against 
johnston a democrat who had always been easily reelected 
im very committed to making political changes in this state 
and in this country ive got to be very encouraged by this 
election duke said at a news conference sunday i want to move 
forward i want to make an impact i want to make a difference 
johnston who got 54 percent of the vote said he got the 
message from the more than 600000 people who voted for duke but 
he added that he would not become more conservative claiming much 
of dukes showing was the result of rocky economic times in 
louisiana 
during the bitter campaign duke attacked affirmative action 
forced busing and welfare abuse he also attacked johnston for 
playing a key role in the senate campaign to reject conservative 
supreme court nominee robert bork and for backing the 1990 civil 
rights act 
i knew david duke had a tremendous appeal theres frustration 
out there when people are unemployed and underemployed its easy 
to blame it on someone else johnston said its easy to blame 
on affirmative action 
complete but unofficial returns gave johnston 749552 votes or 
54 percent and duke 605681 votes or 44 percent two minor 
democratic candidates split the remainder nick accardo had 21709 
votes and larry crowe had 14472 votes 
ed renwick of loyola universitys institute of politics said 
duke a member of the state legislature may have lost the 
election but gained national attention 
you dont win elections with 44 percent but it makes a lot of 
politicians sit up and take notice he said 
on sunday duke backed off of his announced plan to go to court 
over absentee ballots cast but not counted for state sen ben 
bagert the official republican nominee 
bagert dropped out two days before saturdays primary amid 
pressure from national gop leaders who feared that his candidacy 
would force a runoff between johnston and the maverick republican 
duke 
under louisianas open primary system all candidates run 
against each other in the primary regardless of party if no one 
gets more than 50 percent those finishing first and second face 
each other in a runoff 
bagert withdrew too late to get his name off the ballot under a 
1981 law his votes could not be counted but some were because it 
was too late to change computer programs or courthouse operations 
those reported to the associated press gave bagert 10536 votes 
less than 1 percent of the 14 million cast 
although bagert said dropping out was his idea duke called the 
withdrawal a political deal and a dirty trick johnston got the 
unprecedented crossparty endorsement of eight republican senators 
and jack kemp secretary of the department of housing and urban 
development 
duke said he was studying a possible run for louisiana governor 
in 1991 such a race would require him to give up his state house 
seat which he won in a special election in 1989 
i think that gov buddy roemer better be sobered up to the 
fact that we received well over 100000 more votes than he received 
for the governorship duke said 
roemer said today he wasnt worried about duke 
time takes care of a lot of things the governor said my 
job is to take care of this state 
there also has been speculation that duke might seek a us 
house seat in 1992 probably from one of the north louisiana 
districts where he polled heavily on saturday 
in other races new orleans was assured of having its first 
black congressman since reconstruction when state sen william 
jefferson and marc morial both democrats qualified for a nov 6 
runoff 
by a 21 margin voters also approved louisianas first lottery 
since a corrupt private lottery was shut down by congress in the 
late 1890s 
new orleans district attorney harry connick who was acquitted 
earlier this year of federal charges stemming from the return of a 
bookmakers records easily won reelection over two opponents 
connick is the father of harry connick jr a grammy awardwinning

prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative party opens its annual conference tuesday ringed by a 
spiked fence and sharpshooters while police warned she faces a 
grave risk of an assassination attempt 
the unprecedented security for her arrival monday evening in 
this south england seaside resort followed a spate of irish 
republican army attacks this year including the july 30 car bomb 
killing of a close political aide 
this year i see it the threat to mrs thatcher personally as 
extremely high said dorset county deputy police chief alan 
rose who headed the 394million security operation 
the fourday conference which may be the last time mrs 
thatcher rallies her trailing conservatives before she calls a 
general election was buoyed by a booming pound and 
governmentinspired hopes of lower interest rates 
the jaunty mood which many warned may not last was sparked by 
britains entry monday of the pound into the mechanism which links 
other major european currencies 
mrs thatcher made the surprise announcement late friday shortly 
before early arrivals among the some 10000 people including 
delegates journalists and police reinforcements began assembling 
in bournemouth 
many commentators regarded the move by mrs thatcher as playing 
her last ace to try to pull the economy back from the edge of 
recession and damp both interest rates and inflation to give her a 
betterthaneven chance of winning again 
it has been a very difficult year for us tory party 
chairman kenneth baker acknowledged monday referring to the 
partys 18month lag in opinion poll ratings behind the socialist 
labor party 
gallup and market opinion and research international polls 
published over the weekend and on monday showed the tories 12 to 
145 points behind labor which had its conference last week 
earlier polls showed the labor lead down to around nine points 
mrs thatcher whose ratings appear to be benefiting from her 
robust response to the persian gulf crisis must call an election 
by june 1992 but she may do so at any time when she thinks she has 
the best chance of winning 
mrs thatcher linked sterling to the exchange rate mechanism of 
the european monetary system although british inflation at 106 
percent is nearly twice the average of the 12nation european 
community she said among other things that it was an 
antiinflationary measure 
britains interest rates fell one point to 14 percent monday 
and government officials predicted drops in both interest rates and 
inflation early next year 
the sixfeet high fence the first ever put up at a british 
political party conference snaked three miles around the seafront 
convention center and the highcliff hotel where leading party 
members were staying 
some 1500 police including nearly 1000 drafted in from forces 
in a dozen other counties and unspecified military units guarded 
this sedate resort 108 miles southwest of london 
sharpshooters were posted on roof tops a 5500foot air 
exclusion zone was imposed from dawn saturday and naval vessels 
were due to patrol offshore during the conference 
security at the governing partys annual conferences has been 
stepped up since the outlawed ira detonated a bomb at the hotel 
where mrs thatcher was staying during the 1984 conference in 
nearby brighton she escaped but five party members were killed 
and 31 injured and the ira vowed to try again 
the ira a mainly roman catholic organization is fighting to 
end british rule in protestantdominated northern ireland and unite 
the province with the irish republic under a leftist 
administration 
the spate of ira attacks in england this year has roused new 
fears 
attacks include the july 30 killing of conservative lawmaker ian 
gow and a foiled attempt sept 27 to assassinate foreign office 
minister william waldegrave by taping a bomb to the speakers 
lectern at a london conference 
police said monday they were looking for a 21yearold belfast 
man who worked as a kitchen porter at the royal overseas league 
club where the bomb was planted but has not been seen since sept

attorney in the trial before a black judge ancer haggerty of 
multnomah county circuit court

advocate violence against blacks shortly before the november 1988 
beating death of mulugeta seraw 27 
three skinheads were convicted in seraws slaying 
the trial is the focus of a weeks worth of activities planned 
by national civil rights organizations and it has drawn threats 
from white supremacists hundreds of whom reportedly were coming to 
town for the proceedings 
this morning however only a handful of skinheads with shaved 
heads and heavy boots were at the multnomah county courthouse 
they were searched and interrogated by police 
we got nothin to say to you one of them told a reporter 
security was tight around the courthouse an estimated 50 
police many in riot gear and some on horseback were posted 
outside a police helicopter hovered overhead 
the street behind the courthouse was closed to traffic and an 
intersection was cleared for metzgers arrival he was whisked into 
a 6foothigh metal elevator that rose from the sidewalk and 
descended into the courthouse 
the trial got under way at 10 am half an hour late 
the lawsuit was filed by engedaw berhanu seraws uncle berhanu

ethiopian was being dropped off by friends 
they deliberately went up there for the purpose of starting a 
fight police detective tom nelson said seraw was defending 
himself against brewster when mieske came up and blindsided seraw 
with a baseball bat 
the blow to the head knocked seraw to the pavement mieske

by violence and stealth saddam 
hussein is rapidly transforming kuwait from a glittering emirate to 
an iraqi backwater diplomats exiled officials and refugees say 
the iraqis are doing their best to obliterate kuwaits 
identity and seal it off from the outside said one senior 
western diplomat displaced by iraqs aug 2 invasion the world 
doesnt realize how successful they are 
while noting that no accurate count was possible he estimated 
that hundreds if not thousands of kuwaitis had been put to death 
some were shot in front of their families many others were 
deported to iraq 
diplomats and kuwaiti officials in exile endorsed a recent 
amnesty international report of a horrifying picture of 
widespread arrests torture under interrogation summary executions 
and mass extrajudicial killings 
beyond that the diplomats and officials said iraq was carting 
off everything from blood supplies in hospitals to traffic lights 
and forcing citizens to exchange kuwaiti papers for iraqi identity 
cards 
they described a harrowing climate of fear and repression which 
in recent days has triggered another exodus of kuwaitis into saudi 
arabia 
in one incident a western diplomat said iraqi soldiers shot to 
death five hospital workers when doctors told them that a wounded 
comrade they brought in was already dead on arrival 
saddam has entrusted the dismantling of kuwait to a relative 
ali hassan al majid who two years ago commanded a brutal military 
campaign that crushed a kurdish uprising with the help of poison 
gas diplomats said 
that gives some idea of saddams thinking one western 
specialist observed 
as a result of the pressure kuwaiti government sources said 
they were not encouraging armed resistance which might provoke even 
more violence 
some 430000 iraqi troops reported to be deployed in occupied 
kuwait and southern iraq outnumber kuwaitis left in the emirate 
few sources were prepared to be named since the iraqis have 
acted on published information from refugees and exiles to target 
reprisals diplomats reported 
increased checkpoints and housetohouse search teams are 
rooting out suspected dissidents and westerners on the run 
intelligence units search bank records and private papers to hunt 
down members of the emirs family and former officials 
iraq has closed kuwait not only to journalists but also to the 
red cross and humanitarian workers 
deputy prime minister taha yassim ramadan a close aide of 
saddams recently denied human rights abuses then said iraq would 
cut off the legs of anyone trying to enter kuwait without 
permission 
accounts by refugees fit together to draw a clear picture of 
iraqi intent 
theyve taken almost everything to iraq said yusuf alali 
a 25yearold kuwaiti airways pilot who crossed into saudi arabia 
on sunday 
you see trucks in front of the big houses they strip them 
carpets videos anything 
on a larger scale technicians have dismantled medical equipment 
and research facilities burned public buildings and looted grain 
stocks 
they dont need a lot of the things theyre taking said ali 
abuasi an aide to kuwaits crown prince sheik saad interviewed 
in taif saudi arabia its to dominate kuwait to humiliate it 
and make it just another province of iraq 
iraqi forces are especailly brutal with anyone representing 
authority or anyone suspected of armed resistance the sources 
agreed 
they said nearly every captured kuwaiti military and police 
officer was either shot on the spot or taken off for days and then 
returned to be executed in front of relatives 
over the past few weeks large numbers of iraqis have settled in 
the conquered emirate either encouraged by baghdad or drawn by the 
chance to grab unprotected property 
holdout western embassies have maintained a defiant if 
symbolic presence despite iraqi orders that since kuwait has been 
declared iraqs 19th province foreign embassies are no longer 
permitted 
but the diplomats resources are dwindling fast 
at the us embassy ambassador nathaniel howell and a 
halfdozen other americans survive by boiling water from the 
swimming pool and eating up their last cans of food 
not one of thems going to look at a tunafish sandwich again 
for the rest of his life said one us official in touch with 
the embassy 
hundreds of thousands of asian workers remain in kuwait 
desperately short of food and in many cases afraid for their 
lives hundreds of thousands have left taking their chances on a 
grim odyssey across the desert to jordan or iran 
several thousand westerners are still hiding in suburban homes 
in kuwait waiting for the fateful knock of iraqi patrols trying to 
round them up for saddams human shield 
us officials estimate that americans now number about 1000 
onethird of the number who were in kuwait when iraq attacked 
the amnesty international report said iraqi forces have 
arrested not only people suspected of armed attacks against them 
but men women and children found with opposition literature the 
kuwaiti flag or photographs of the emir 
it said men were seized at the border and sent to iraq for 
secret detention or military service the possession of kuwaiti 
flags opposition literature or even the emirs photo is a capital 
offense 
the amnesty report squares absolutely with what we have and 
what the kuwaitis here have a veteran diplomat said in fact 
things are even worse than that but no one can get in to reveal 
the details

a few women customers at the pick kwik noticed the sign and 
commented that it was unique but that was it 
the men scoff at it they say things like what are you 
crazy ive got one you can have he said

he doesnt like singles bars too artificial and noisy he said 
personal advertisements in magazines have drawn responses from 
older seemingly desperate women not what he has in mind

a member of a visiting cambodian dance 
troupe has requested political asylum the fourth member of the 
company to do so in its monthlong us tour 
the 22yearold woman dancer whose name was not released 
stayed behind after a performance while the remainder of the troupe 
continued to its next stop new york city on sunday 
she was waiting at an undisclosed location to speak with 
officials from the immigration and naturalization service who said 
the meeting would be held on tuesday at the earliest 
three other dancers from the troupe the cambodian classical 
dance company sought asylum while on a stop in st paul minn 
last week 
angry organizers of the dance tour charged that cambodians in 
the united states including members of lowells large 
cambodianamerican community coerced the dancers into leaving to 
score political points 
what has clearly happened is some of the political groups that 
are against the government in phnom penh have done the one thing 
they can do pressure the dancers to defect said john mcauliff 
director of the sponsoring usindochina reconciliation project 
in philadelphia 
cambodianamerican activists were all over us mcauliff 
said its been clear that they have been trying very hard to 
undermine the tour 
cambodians in lowell and st paul acknowledged they encouraged 
the defections to protest the government in phnom penh 
they call it a cultural performance but this dance tour is 
to convince the american people to support the cambodian 
government said bunthan eang editor of the cambodian press in 
lowell and a leader of the citys 25000member cambodian 
community he said the woman who defected in lowell made her own 
decision without anybody interfering 
many cambodians in the united states believe that vietnam 
controls their country vietnamese troops withdrew in 1989 after 10 
years of occupation 
the dance company now touring the us is part of the 
governmentcontrolled university of fine arts in phnom penh 
it performed before a sellout crowd of 3000 in the lowell 
auditorium on saturday said ruth meehan cultural events 
coordinator of the lowell historic preservation commission which 
cosponsored the event

at least six students committed suicide 
monday to protest a job quota program that reserves half of the 
governments jobs for lowercaste hindus news reports said 
press trust and united news of india both news agencies said 
five students poisoned themselves and one set himself ablaze the 
incidents took place in the states of haryana punjab and andhra 
pradesh 
students from higher castes angered by a government refusal to 
review the plan attacked a passenger train in the central indian 
city of allahabad and set two train cars on fire there were no 
reports of casualties 
in new delhi three students attempted suicide press trust 
said 
students from the citys schools which opened monday after 
nearly a month of forced closure attacked buses and damaged30 
the news agency said 
mondays deaths brought to at least 90 the number of people who 
have killed themselves or died in violence since prime minister 
vp singh announced aug 7 that nearly half of all government jobs 
would be reserved for lowercaste hindus 
public opposition to the government has been widespread in the 
politically influential cities of northern india the army was 
called out and curfews clamped on several towns to control rioting 
students joined sometimes by housewives and government employees 
two members of singhs governing party have resigned from 
parliament and some colleagues have demanded his ouster because of 
the quotas 
but singh has refused to abandon the policy saying it is an 
affirmative action program that would give social justice to the 
lower castes 
critics say he fears alienating the lower castes which form a 
majority of the eligible voters among indias 880 million people 
uppercaste students say reverse discrimination will deprive 
them of jobs for which they are better qualified 
the plan reserves 27 percent of federal jobs for lowcaste 
hindus an additional 22 percent already are set aside for the 
lowest strata in the rigid hierarchy of indian society

police opened fire on stonethrowing 
palestinians at the temple mount in jerusalems old city today and 
israeli police said 19 people were killed and 140 were injured 
arab hospital officials first said 22 were killed however they 
later gave a lower casualty toll than the one provided by israeli 
police minister roni milo saying 18 palestinians were killed and 
125 wounded 
the incident was the bloodiest in the holy city since israel 
captured its arab sector from jordan in the 1967 mideast war 
the death toll also was the highest in a single day since the 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation began in december 
1987 
in disturbances following todays rioting two palestinians were 
killed in the occupied gaza strip hospital officials said 
the jerusalem clash erupted after palestinians threw stones from 
the mount at jews worshiping below at the wailing wall judaisms 
holiest site witnesses said thousands of jews were at the wall 
celebrating the sukkot festival 
milo said 20 jews were injured he said 120 arabs were arrested 
including faisal husseini a prominent palestinian nationalist 
involved in unofficial peace contacts with israeli moderates he 
said husseini was arrested on the temple mount 
a senior paramilitary border police officer yossi tobias told 
israel radio some 3000 arabs were involved in the rioting 
the palestinians apparently were angered by rumors that jews 
were trying to establish a presence on the temple mount which is 
holy to both jews and moslems but is under moslem control 
the arabs burned down a police station in the temple mount 
compound and hurled hundreds of rocks at jewish worshipers 
as thousands of jews fled from the wailing wall police riot 
squads fired tear gas to disperse arab rioters on the mount above 
witnesses said the palestinians regrouped and charged the police 
police opened fire with rubber and plastic bullets and then live 
ammunition the witnesses said 
police commissioner yaacov terner said 
they burned the police station there was no policeman who 
wasnt stoned their lives were in real danger they had no other 
way but to respond the way they did the toll was very heavy but 
the israel police had to defend themselves and to protect the 
thousands of worshipers 
terner told reporters that authorities had repeatedly assured 
moslem leaders that no jewish demonstrations on the temple mount 
would be permitted 
at the same news conference milo said caches of rocks and 
flammable materials were found on the temple mount this he said 
showed that the riot was a planned provocation aimed partly at 
distracting the worlds attention from the persian gulf crisis 
the palestinians have largely sided with iraqi president saddam 
hussein in the confrontation over iraqs invasion of kuwait 
calm returned to the temple mount about two hours after the 
incident but throughout the day scattered incidents occurred in 
the old city israel radio said it had reports of jewish civilians 
shooting at arabs 
until today the worst toll in the uprising was 17 dead on april 
16 1988 when rioting swept the west bank and gaza strip after plo 
military leader khalil wazir was killed in tunis in a commando 
raid 
the raid was blamed on israel 
the palestine liberation organization issued a statement from 
its headquarters in tunisia accusing the israelis of a massacre 
bassam abu sharif a top aide to plo leader yasser arafat said 
the un security council should take urgent steps to protect 
palestinians and force an israeli withdrawal from the occupied 
territories 
after todays rioting broke out police closed off the area 
around the wailing wall the last remnant of the ancient jewish 
temple destroyed by the romans in the year 70 
on the temple mount pools of blood stained the ground around 
the al aqsa mosque palestinians said thousands of moslems 
including some wounded remained in the mosque apparently afraid 
to come out with the heavily armed border police still around 
at augusta victoria hospital 26yearold khaled shlatef of 
ramallah in the west bank said the arabs had rushed to defend the 
mount after hearing that jews were going to enter 
we are moslems and we came here to defend our mosque said 
shlatef who was wounded in the head with rubber bullets 
the rumors followed the distribution of leaflets by a jewish 
extremist group called the temple mount faithful saying it planned 
to go up to the mount the group wants to build a new jewish temple 
on the mount to replace the ancient one however the groups 
members did not arrive in the area until after the rioting was 
under way 
the trouble began shortly before 11 am 5 am edt when arabs 
burned the police station and at the same time threw hundreds of 
stones at the jews below police said 
mel rosen a witness watching from his balcony 300 yards away 
said he saw a barrage of stones pour onto worshipers at the wall 
rosen an american photographer said riot squads then entered 
the temple mount compound and scattered the crowd with tear gas 
the arabs regrouped and threw more stones over the wall prompting 
the police to open fire he said 
he said the torrent of rocks was so thick that onlookers at 
first thought they were seeing flocks of birds flying out of the 
crannies of the wall where they nest 
women praying in their section of the gendersegregated plaza 
ran for shelter in the tunnels alongside part of the wall 
there was a shower of stones and that is when people started 
to panic people started shouting where is my child and 
running said oded wiener who was at the wall

president fw de klerk announced 
monday that political exiles can begin applying to return to south 
africa addressing a key demand of the african national congress 
his statement followed a threehour meeting with anc leader 
nelson mandela at which they apparently differed on causes of black 
factional fighting that has killed about 800 people in eight weeks 
de klerk said that exiles many based in zambia and other 
southern african nations could immediately begin applying for 
amnesty for political offenses 
but he cautioned no indemnity for anyone or for any event or 
offense is granted automatically he said any possible indemnity 
would only apply to acts committed before mondays meeting 
the move could help resolve one of the major stumbling blocks of 
peace talks between the whiteled government and mandelas anc the 
largest black opposition movement 
the anc has demanded the return of its estimated 20000 exiles 
before beginning fullscale negotiations on blackwhite power 
sharing and ending apartheid 
until monday the government had agreed in principle but never 
announced a mechanism 
de klerks statement said full details of the process would be 
announced later it also said exiles from other organizations may 
be included smaller black opposition groups also have members who 
fled south africa after committing politically motivated acts 
the government also agreed to release 15 more political 
prisoners this week the statement said dozens have been freed in 
recent months but up to 3000 remain imprisoned according to the 
anc 
a working group on the return of exiles was set up as part of 
the governmentanc talks launched in may de klerks statement said 
activation of the exile return process followed anc acceptance of 
the working groups report 
the anc requested mondays meeting to discuss the peace process 
which has been strained by the factional fighting that erupted aug 
12 in black townships around johannesburg 
a separate joint statement read by mandela after the meeting 
said note was taken of the different current perceptions 
concerning the causes and handling of the violence 
all sides must do their utmost to bring this violence to an 
end it said both sides reaffirmed the need to keep the 
negotiating process on course 
mandela who has accused security forces of orchestrating the 
violence was expected to hand de klerk information about his 
accusations monday after the meeting he refused to answer 
questions 
de klerk and government officials have denied security force 
involvement in the fighting 
the main combatants in the township battles have been supporters 
of the anc and zulus loyal to the conservative inkatha movement 
both groups oppose apartheid but differ over plans for a future 
south africa 
the fighting has slowed in recent weeks but there are still 
sporadic incidents

house republicans capitol hills forgotten 
minority are suffering from a deep ideological split that has left 
them on the sidelines of americas budget crisis 
the division which dates to the election a year ago of rep 
newt gingrich to the partys no 2 leadership post pits oldline 
pragmatists against rebellious activists who are tired of more than 
three decades of minority status 
its a very difficult time around here said rep william 
broomfield rmich who was first elected in 1956 the same year 
as minority leader robert michel rill ive never seen it quite 
like this the bitterness and rancor that exists 
when he was elected to the leadership last year gingrich 
promised colleagues that he would assume the team player 
responsibilities that go with the job but last week he abandoned 
michel and president bush and led rebels who killed the first 
attempt at a bipartisan budget package 
then on sunday as gop leaders sought to take a role in drawing 
up a new version of the budget gingrichs demands in a closeddoor 
republican meeting hampered the efforts and the package was 
assembled and passed without them 
the rebels apparently have calculated that the budget issue can 
be a good political weapon leading to the election of more 
republicans on nov 6 
but rep pat roberts rkan countered one gingrich supporter 
making that argument at the private meeting saying gop candidates 
were the ones who would be hurt 
one of gingrichs top allies rep vin weber rminn said 
republicans are slowly getting themselves back on a united 
positive footing a key to that he said is that the 
bipartisan budget will be transformed over the next 10 days into 
the democratic tax increase 
frustration with gingrichs actions broke into the open late 
sunday as each party sought to blame the other for the partial 
shutdown of the government over the weekend gingrich contended 
that democrats after failing to override bushs veto of a stopgap 
spending bill now have an obligation to respond to that failure 
by cooperating with the president 
that was too much for house speaker thomas s foley who 
thundered back of all the people in this house of all the 
people in this country who has little claim to cooperation with his 
president it is the gentleman from georgia 
the jab was particularly effective because it hit gingrich 
where he is weakest within his own party on the issue of loyalty 
and trustworthiness the georgian had no comeback but just smiled 
and then strode off the house floor 
during a closeddoor republican conference earlier in the day 
rep rod chandler of washington said those who do not support 
the president and the leadership should be silent or resign 
according to one lawmaker present in a clear reference to 
gingrich 
gingrich is out on a limb some colleagues say but thats not 
an unusual position for the whitehaired 47yearold conservative 
and he is hardly alone 
he picked fights with a former house speaker thomas p oneill 
and was instrumental in forcing another former speaker jim wright 
to resign 
this guy has no agenda except to create chaos and to destroy 
democrats said rep tim penny dminn 
but that brand of firebrand partisanship was attracting support 
from republicans who are tired of more than three decades of 
minority status in the house a frustration amplified by budget 
summits that left the rank and file out of decisions 
with 176 members united house republicans have the power to 
sustain president bushs vetoes of legislation but they often are 
ignored by the white house which prefers to deal with republicans 
in the senate where the playing field is less tilted against them 
some house gop members have taken to calling themselves the 
potted plant caucus a selfdeprecating sign of their feelings of 
irrelevance members are hungering for a leader who will stand up 
for the conference and not simply follow orders from the white 
house said one gop lawmaker 
but others pointed to an irony that gingrichs opposition to 
the original budget package meant the failure of the best proposal 
republicans could hope for the longer the process takes the 
more liberal the package becomes said rep jim leach riowa 
the outcome means gingrich likely will face a challenge when the 
party convenes to elect its leaders next year said several 
republicans

like giant sand beetles the 
eightwheeled reconnaissance vehicles scuttled across the dry lake 
bed pausing periodically behind dunes then darting ahead in a 
leapfrog pattern 
at each stop turret commanders scanned the terrain for signs of 
activity a dust cloud or the dark specks of armored vehicles on 
the horizon 
for nearly an hour there was nothing then monitoring the 
radio lance cpl shannon whitehead 20 of baytown texas 
reported second platoon has spotted enemy tracks some kind of 
mechanized threat the tanks are moving up 
the marine corps lav25s too lightly armed to tangle with enemy 
armor withdrew swiftly to the rear a platoon of m60 tanks 
churned forward deploying into the line of battle and hoping the 
element of surprise vital in desert warfare had not been lost 
it was only a war game in real battle heavy artillery and 
aircraft would be hurled in the first minutes of fighting to 
disrupt and destroy the enemy 
the scenario played out by the 3rd battalion 9th marines is as 
old as war itself 
alexander owed his greatness in part to the horsemen scouting 
ahead of his marching legions so did gen robert e lee who 
called jeb stuarts cavalry the eyes of the army 
if war comes to the saudi desert us officers say it will be a 
classic battle of armor not unlike those between gen erwin 
rommels afrika korps and the british in north africa or the arabs 
and israelis in sinai 
the technology is new but the tactics really havent changed 
since world war ii a marine officer said after a day of chasing 
the simulated enemy across the ands 
the reconnaissance teams like these speedy marine corps 
vehicles may largely determine where and when a battle would 
begin then officers say the edge would go to whoever makes the 
best use of supporting arms air power and artillery 
some officers believe the key to stopping an iraqi armored 
thrust rests mainly with tankkiller aircraft the armys ah64 
apache and ah1 cobra helicopters and the air force a10 warthogs 
the iraqis have built heavily fortified positions with tanks 
dug in behind earthen berms along the potential battle line between 
kuwait and saudi arabia 
but us officers say they dont expect a static battle 
gen h norman schwarzkopf iii the us commander in saudi 
arabia called desert warfare a war of attrition based on high 
mobility and lethality 
its not a war of straight lines drawn in the sand where you 
dig in and say ill defend here or die schwarzkopf said in a 
recent interview most people who do that die 
lack of protective cover in the desert makes deception 
difficult and speed and surprise paramount field officers said 
they talk of fastmoving armored forces vying for position that 
gives them the flank shot that hits an enemy tank in its most 
vulnerable spot anywhere but the heavily protected nose 
even if the other guys tank is supposedly better than yours 
if you get the first shot and make it count you win said one 
marine officer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
army lt col rick sanchez of rio grande city texas who 
commands a battalion of m1 tanks in the 19th armored brigade 
likens tank warfare to the way the navy would fight a battle in 
the ocean vector in on him and try to outmanuever him in the vast 
expanse 
the allied side and the iraqis are doing roughly the same thing 
putting lighter forces farthest forward backed up by heavy forces 
that could defend by launching a counterattack 
the saudis and other arab forces are farthest north where they 
would be the first to make contact with a southward iraqi thrust 
out of kuwait or iraq 
the americans with their greater mobility airpower and 
firepower are to the rear a political positioning that also 
leaves them in the role of counterstrike force 
the united states also has some 10600 marines aboard amphibious 
ships to join any offensive

the seasons most popular novelty is a 
pocketsize electronic voice box that at the push of a button 
spews profane insults suitable for use in locker rooms saloons and 
stockbrokers offices 
this adult toy is called the final word and it delivers 
prerecorded obscenities in a shrill voice that sounds like an 
angry chipmunk from brooklyn 
theyre flying out the door said joan geisler owner of 
postermat in greenwich village as she waited for a broker to pick 
up his order of 60 people are calling up and reserving them by 
the dozens uptown dapys on columbus avenue reported selling 
more than 250 in two days 
the final word which sells for 1695 is a batterypowered 
preprogrammed voice synthesizer that looks something like a beeper 
and sounds something like andrew dice clay it is designed to 
appeal to people who like the sound of dirty words but may be 
reluctant to actually speak them 
the final word according to its manufacturer allows people to 
talk back to all those obnoxious people in life such as nagging 
inlaws pushy sales people and knowitallbosses all of whom 
no doubt have already purchased their own final word 
the device comes in two versions one rated g the other 
x the former repeats these phrases youre an idiot 
drop dead youre a dope and stupid jerk 
the content of the other version cannot be repeated here care 
to guess which of the two sells better 
once buyers hear the stronger version theyve got to have 
it chortled geisler who has taken to using the xrated version 
extensively over the telephone 
a few years ago no one would have bought something like this 
but now everything goes she mused 
terri boyle spokeswoman for the manufacturer said the device 
has proved popular in elevators restaurants and cocktail parties 
one example a man shopping for a car was offered one by a 
dealer for an exorbitant price the shopper told the dealer hed 
punch the figure into his pocket calculator under the calculator 
he held the final word which at the push of a button produced a 
scatological response to the inflated price much to the dealers 
surprise 
in six weeks more than a half million units of the final word 
have been sold and banning enterprises ltd of farmingdale plans 
to ship out another million by christmas 
business is very bad in gifts and everybodys looking for a 
winner said geisler who described the final word as one of the 
most popular novelties in her 30 years in the gift business 
displaying the xrated version presents retailers with a 
problem one store in cleveland demonstrates it in a back room out 
of earshot of most customers geisler plays it for selected 
customers asking have you heard the final word 
the final word is the creation of budd goldman he geisler 
claims is a novelty genius who also gave the world shower heads 
with peoples faces on them and miniature desktop replicas of 
refrigerators and lockers 
the final word is particularly popular on wall street where 
these days people are eager for a laugh of any sort one firm 
ordered several hundred perhaps to sum up the feelings of bulls 
trapped in a bear market

the federal governments partial shutdown is 
hitting uncle sam directly in the pocketbook with the loss of at 
least several million dollars in revenue from frustrated tourists 
and campers 
from the campgrounds at cape hatteras national seashore to 
yosemite national park in california hundreds of thousands of 
dollars were lost this threeday weekend in camping fees entry 
fees to parks tolls along scenic highways and sales in museums and 
shops officials said 
in many places private concessionaires continued to operate but 
parks were without guides toll collectors or supervisors forcing 
the grounds to be closed and campers to be directed away 
the shutdowns and lost revenue stemmed from attempts by 
lawmakers and the bush administration to reach an agreement on how 
best to cut the federal budget deficit 
thats the irony of it remarked interior department 
spokesman steve goldstein we dont have personnel to man the 
parks so we lose two ways we cant open our resources to the 
public and we didnt gain any revenue 
he said the park personnel would have had to be classified as 
essential to safety and health to be exempt from the shutdown 
directive 
spokesmen for the national park service said the revenue losses 
are likely to be substantial because the columbus day weekend 
traditionally is a busy period for many of the parks 
the service said very preliminary figures indicated a loss for 
the weekend of more than 16 million officials acknowledged the 
amount could be higher 
usually youre looking at this weekend through veterans day as 
the peak fall visitor period said duncan morrow a service 
spokesman he estimated that 750000 visitors normally can be 
expected to visit the scores of parks known for their autumn 
colors 
along skyline drive in virginias blue ridge mountains 
motorists out to see the fall foliage at its peak did not have to 
pay the usual 5 fee as federal toll stations were closed 
officials said as many as 75000 people enter shenendoah national 
park along the drive on a typical columbus day weekend but this 
weekend nobody counted 
at yosemite rangers cleared 6000 campers from the park losing 
camping fees ranging from 350 to 12 a night officials said 
at the grand canyon losses in revenue were estimated at more 
than 25000 a day during the weekend roads were blocked and 
campgrounds closed at other parks such as olympic national park 
its rather sad that they picked the parks to close down 
its like they kind of cut their nose to spite their face said 
garner hansen president of national park concessions inc a 
company operating at five parks including mammoth cave national 
park in kentucky 
hansen said mammoth cave remained open but all tours costing 
175 to 450 were cancelled the visitors are very unhappy 
they traveled long distances for the cave trips were the only 
ones here and theyre giving us an earful he said in a telephone 
interview 
not far from capitol hill where the budget drama has been 
unfolding angry and disappointed tourists couldnt get into the 
white house climb the washington monument or visit the complex of 
museums belonging to the smithsonian institution tourists could 
still walk among the animals of the national zoo although indoor 
zoo facilities including the famous panda house were closed 
almost all of the tourist attractions in the capital including 
museums are free 
union officials meanwhile bemoaned the shutdown 
it doesnt save any money said john sturdivant president 
of the 700000member american federation of government employees 
when they shut down in 1981 it ended up costing them 5 million 
in lost revenue it just creates problems hassles and severe 
dislocation

gov buddy roemer said monday that he is 
not worried about a reelection challenge from exku klux klan 
leader david duke and suggested that duke might learn something 
from his us senate bid 
he lost as he does most races maybe he can change roemer 
said during an impromptu news conference 
roemer said that the race by duke a firstterm member of the 
louisiana house against us sen j bennett johnston did show 
that voters have a lot of anger and anxiety against the 
federal government 
i was pleased that bennett won and im proud of the people of 
louisiana for making that decision the governor said but 
there are a number of people who think the federal government is 
not responsive on energy policy on balancing the budget 
i think to ignore that anger is to ignore the fact its 
time for the federal government to wake up put up and get this 
country right again i think thats what that vote shows 
running as a maverick republican duke picked up 44 percent of 
the vote in saturdays primary against johnston a democrat 
despite his opponents constant focus on his past as grand wizard 
of the kkk with ties to nazi groups 
duke disavows his klan past but says government policies need to 
be changed to give equal rights to whites he advocates stricter 
limits on welfare and a flatrate income tax along with opposition 
to forced busing of schoolchildren and affirmative action programs 
duke who said he will decide in the coming weeks on a 1991 
governors race noted that he received a larger percentage of the 
vote than roemer did in 1987 
johnston and duke were the only major candidates running in 
saturdays senate election after state sen ben bagert dropped out 
bagert the republican candidate who had his partys endorsement 
quit the race last week after running a poor third in opinion 
polls 
bagert said he wanted to throw his support to the democrat 
johnston in order to lessen the chances that duke would force 
johnston into a runoff under the states open primary system 
candidates compete in one primary regardless of party and a runoff 
is held between the top two finishers only if no one receives 50 
percent of the vote 
in the 1987 gubernatorial election roemer led a field of five 
major candidates with slightly more than a third of the vote he 
won the governors race by default when incumbent edwin edwards 
conceded the runoff 
duke won a special election for a louisiana house seat in 1989 
he previously ran for the state senate and as the populist party 
candidate for president in 1988 
hes been a very ineffective member of the legislature and i 
say that with as much kindness as my honesty would permit me 
roemer said very ineffective i would expect that to continue

spectators are expected to watch the shuttle discovery land in the 
mojave desert this week nasa said monday 
discovery is scheduled to touch down on concrete runway 22 on 
rogers dry lake at 658 am pdt wednesday said don haley 
national aeronautics and space administration spokesman good 
weather wa the main purpose of the fourday flight was to launch the 
sunexploring ulysses spacecraft the probe was successfully 
deployed on saturday 
a record 500000 spectatorss expected 
watched columbia land at this desert 
military base on july 4 1982 not counting the tightly restricted 
crowds allowed to watch landings of secret military flights the 
smallest crowd to show up for a landing was last jan 10 when 
2200 people watched columbia touch down haley said 
i think flights with the shuttle are becoming a little more 
routine with the american public he added 
haley said discovery will land on a 15000foot paved runway 
instead of an unpaved strip because nasa wants to test how well the 
shuttles brakes work on concrete such tests are a prelude to 
eventual landings at the shuttles launch site at cape canaveral

lithuanias deputy prime minister romualdas 
ozolas predicted monday that soviet officials will recognize 
lithuanian independence by mid1991 following negotiations that 
began at the kremlin last week tass reported 
lithuanian declared independence from the soviet union on march 
11 
the official news agency quoted ozolas as describing the talks 
as productive and saying that if the negotiations continue as 
planned they will end with the signing of a treaty recognizing 
the lithuanian republic 
i believe this will happen no later than in the first half of 
1991 
lithuanian and soviet officials agreed after their initial 
meetings to conduct their economic and trade relations for 1991 as 
equal partners 
a communique issued later also mentioned preparations for future 
negotiations that is a significant concession by the soviet 
side because president mikhail s gorbachev has maintained that 
bilateral negotiations can occur only between two nations and 
not between the kremlin and a republic 
the talks were the first at such a high level since lithuania 
suspended its declaration of independence following the kremlins 
economic embargo against the republic 
tass also said a joint sovietlithuanian working group would 
begin meeting wednesday at the kremlin to set a date and lay the 
foundation for future negotiations ozolas and soviet deputy prime 
minister vitaly doguzhiyev will head the group

grimfaced relatives one in tears 
saw photographs monday of the muddy humanshaped indentations made 
in grassy fields by bodies plummeting from the wreckage of bombed 
pan am flight 103 
police photographs showed wreckage from the boeing 747 imbedded 
in homes and strewn across fields and forests over 845 square miles 
of southern scotland and northern england 
there were pictures of bodies but scotlands senior law 
officer lord fraser the lord advocate barred them from being 
shown to the first public inquiry into the crash because they would 
distress the reatives the pictures were briefly described instead 
for betty thomas of wales who lost her daughter and 
granddaughter one glimpse of a leg or an arm shown by mistake 
for a moment was enough she said she didnt look at the rest 
tears streamed down the cheeks of marina de larracoechea sister 
of pan am flight attendant maria nieves larrachoechea of spain her 
sister was one of the 270 people who died when a terrorist bomb 
blew the new yorkbound plane apart over lockerbie on dec 21 
1988 
it got me upset ms larracoechea said later it was the 
most thorough runthrough of lockerbie to realize how the ground 
was covered with debris the tremendous waste of lives 
she said she was grateful pictures of the bodies werent shown 
just looking at the wreckage she said i know how maimed they 
were how blown to pieces 
the bodies of 17 victims were never found and two bodies and 658 
bags of human remains were never identified said john boyd chief 
constable of dumfries and galloway region at the time of the crash 
and now inspector of constabulary for scotland 
aerial photos showed indentations of bodies in fields one 
closeup showed the outlines of a victim his torso and outspread 
legs etched in mud 
the photographs showed the huge crater on sherwood crescent at 
the edge of the main a74 highway from england to scotland the 
fuelladen wing section exploded there damaging or destroying 20 
houses and vaporizing some victims 
there were also photos of parts of the plane of debris hanging 
in trees and lines of searchers looking for victims 
boyd read large sections of his report on the police emergency 
response into the record and was questioned by fraser 
the inquiry expected to last three months is focusing on the 
causes of death and ways to prevent a similar disaster not on 
criminal responsibility 
boyd said scottish police investigators went to helsinki 
finland in january 1989 to investigate a warning telephoned to the 
us embassy there dec 5 that a bomb would be carried on a pan 
american world airways flight from frankfurt in the following two 
weeks 
there was no evidence to connect the helsinki warning with the 
lockerbie incident he said 
under crossexamination boyd said the warning mentioned a 
particular person who was investigated and said he still believed 
no connection existed 
he agreed that other unspecified warnings were made to 
embassies in helsinki in 1988 in what appeared to be a personal 
vendetta against a named individual 
new york attorney stephen pounian representing the families of 
american victims tried to ask boyd if police had information on a 
warning to pan am about a toshiba radio 
fraser leaped to his feet and protested saying that went to 
the core of the criminal investigation 
police have said the bomb hidden in a toshiba radiocassette 
recorder in a suitcase probably was put aboard flight 103 in 
frankfurt the flight changed from a boeing 727 to a boeing 747 at 
londons heathrow airport 
scottish officials have said they were investigating several 
radical palestinian groups fraser has said he was convinced the 
bombers would be caught

iranian security forces monday watched 
for possible election disruptions by antiwestern fundamentalists 
blocked from running for a panel that picks the countrys spiritual 
leader diplomatic sources said 
ayatollah ali khamenei was among the first to cast ballots in an 
election some fundamentalists allege was rigged to keep them off 
the 83member assembly of experts and preserve khameneis power 
khamenei who favors improved relations with the west was named 
in june 1989 to succeed ayatollah ruhollah khomeini a few days 
after the revolutionary patriarch died of cancer 
sources said the hardliners sought enough seats to depose 
khamenei in favor of a council a rule change by khamenei however 
forced many of the fundamentalists out of the race 
there were no incidents of violence reported in the election 
but there were conflicting observations on voter turnout 
diplomatic sources in tehran said there was a light turnout but 
the state islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia said 
voting was extended up to three hours in 20 of irans 24 provinces 
because of heavy turnout 
there was no immediate word on when the results of the voting 
for 100 candidates would be announced but initial results are 
likely to be known tuesday 
among those voting were former prisonersofwar recently 
released by iraq which waged an eightyear war against iran the 
news agency reported anyone over 15 years old can vote in iran 
which has an estimated electorate of 25 million 
prior to the election khamenei ordered his allies on the 
council of guardians a constitutional watchdog body to require 
all candidates to pass an examination on islamic jurisprudence 
of 169 wouldbe candidates who sat for the exam 60 flunked 
including parliament speaker mehdi karrubi and many other 
hardliners sources said 
some radicals refused to submit to the examination others who 
passed withdrew their names in protest 
khamenei and president hashemi rafsanjani are leaders of irans 
socalled pragmatists which favor better ties with the west and 
seek foreign investment to revive irans economy following the 
198088 war with iraq 
the assembly of experts sits for an eightyear term 
the conflict over the balloting has strained relations between 
the rival factions and exposed the longrunning power struggle in 
tehrans hierarchy 
fistfights took place in the radicaldominated 270member 
majlis or parliament during a debate on the elections last week 
sources in tehran reported 
the official media has not reported the brawl but in a speech 
broadcast by tehran radio on monday khamenei admitted there had 
been sharp differences in parliament 
two brothers in the islamic republic have a verbal exchange 
over an issue which is a normal thing and see what a ruckus 
the foreign media raises 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said radicals 
attempted to meet twice last week at tehran university apparently 
to organize protests but both gatherings were broken up by 
security forces 
irans largest opposition group the iraqbased mujahedeen 
khalq or peoples holy warriors said two divisions of the 
revolutionary guards corps were deployed in tehran to prevent any 
radical backlash 
that report could not be independently confirmed but an asian 
diplomat speaking by telephone from tehran said security forces 
were watching for any demonstrations 
the radicals led by former interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi have been on the defensive since khomeinis death and 
fear a purge by rafsanjani rafsanjani has replaced many 
hardliners in ministry posts with westerneducated officials he 
has also gained a tighter grip on the judiciary 
radicals suffered a further blow last month when tehran resumed 
relations with britain after a 19month break

charge of battery of a person over 65 years old humphrey faces a 
minimum of 3 years in prison

circuit judge theron a yawn jr after commenting on the assault 
charges

world chess champion garry kasparovs defense of 
his title against blood rival anatoly karpov is a 3 million war of 
personalities politics and playing styles 
the two went head to head monday night at the hudson theatre in 
manhattan where some 700 seats for the opening match were sold out 
at 25 50 and 100 each the first match of the championship 
began at 530 pm 
kasparov 27 ended karpovs 10year world chess reign in 1985 
now karpov 39 is trying to wrest the title back as the nemeses 
meet for the first time in three years 
it is the first world championship in the united states since 
1907 after the first 12 games are played in new york 12 more will 
be played in lyon france beginning nov 24 
for the new york showdown the theater is hung with the flags of 
the united states france and the soviet union home country of 
both players 
above the stage is a 10foot screen bearing the image of a chess 
board when kasparov or karpov makes a move the pieces on the 
screen move too for the audiences benefit 
two video screens show closeups of the players the 
computerized chess board will record every move they make 
the board is atop a stark black table with two name tags 
pasted on the front 
one labeled a karpov depicts the soviet flag next to the 
table is karpovs black highbacked easy chair which swivels and 
rolls 
on the opposite side is a black lowbacked officestyle chair 
that side is labeled g kasparov with a depiction of the flag 
of the russian republic 
kasparov founder of a soviet democratic party declared last 
week he was playing under the flag of the republic rather than the 
soviet union as a political statement karpov often has been quoted 
as saying i have two loves communism and chess 
normally chess is a battle between two individuals a brutal 
intellectual battle kasparov said earlier but in my case 
with karpov its a fight between two different mentalities in 
russia i identify him with the system ive been fighting 
years ago a chess analyst likened kasparovs agile bold style 
to the dancer mikhail baryshnikov and karpovs methodical rigid 
style to former soviet premier leonid brezhnev 
the two are as different in personality as they are in political 
leanings 
kasparov who beat deep thought a chessplaying computer 
in new york last january is confident flamboyant and fluent in 
english a media darling who tirelessly publicizes chess 
the media have often described karpov as cool or even cold an 
introvert who plays with surgical precision and tunes out the 
audience but he was personable at a news conference last tuesday 
hamming it up and presenting a copy of his book to kasparov 
the first championship between the two in 1984 was abruptly 
helted by the world chess federation president after karpov lost 
two games in a row in a controversial move the world chess 
federation permitted karpov to retain the title although the match 
wasnt completed 
kasparov won their 1985 rematch becoming the youngest champion 
ever he successfully defended the title against karpov in 1986 in 
1987 their championship match ended in a tie and kasparov retained 
his title under the match rules 
this time the winner will receive 17 million and the loser 
will get 13 million kasparov aid his earnings will fund my 
private interests and the political interests of the world 
karpov has talked about helping chernobyl victims and promoting 
chess in schools

journalistic coup by interviewing retired us supreme court 
justice william j brennan jr who told them he was not sure he 
could fully agree with the choice of his successor 
after suffering a stroke brennan retired in july under doctors 
orders to reduce his workload and decline all interviews until at 
least next year 
but five reporters and editors from the indianapolis childrens 
express bureau spent 30 minutes last month interviewing the 
84yearold brennan the most powerful liberal voice on an 
increasingly conservative court their interview was published in 
mondays indianapolis star 
the team peppered brennan with questions about childrens 
rights abortion drug testing the death penalty for minors and 
the mentally retarded the equal rights amendment and his 
replacement on the court david h souter who was confirmed last 
week 
they said brennan dodged most questions on the newest justice 
but indicated he wasnt pleased with him 
i could hope that the philosophy of the appointment was 
something with which i could fully agree but im not sure that i 
can say that brennan said 
it wasnt so much like we were scooping anybody we were just 
talking said wendy potasnik 17 
it was more like a conversation than an interview agreed 
lisa schubert 10 i mean id ask him the same questions as if 
id ran into him one day 
the interview was arranged with the help of brennans daughter 
nancy who is a friend of peter sterling president of the 
childrens museum the museum houses the childrens express bureau 
which publishes a onepage weekly report in the indianapolis star 
on issues of interest to youngsters 
the childrens express organization has bureaus in several us 
cities as well as australia and new zealand said lynn sygiel the 
adult who oversees the groups indianapolis bureau 
the new yorkbased organization used to publish a magazine but 
now syndicates its material as well as publishing a newsletter for 
the children involved in the organization she said 
brennan gave the children a warm welcome at his office in the 
supreme court building in washington the sept 28 session ended 
with brennan dressed in a bright red childrens express sweatshirt 
and mugging for a camera 
before interviewing brennan the young reporters carefully 
researched his 34year tenure on the bench ms sygiel said the 
team met twice a week for six weeks reviewing newspaper and 
magazine articles on brennan and some of the more than 1200 
opinions he wrote 
after the interview the express team said brennans diminutive 
stature and informal air surprised them 
kia woodson 11 said she expected to hear long windy answers 
laced with legal jargon instead the group got brief responses 
which they characterized as evasive and talking down to them 
despite the short answers the young journalists felt they 
gained something positive from the experience 
brennan has done so much in the last 34 years seeing him it 
doesnt make me understand the constitution but it makes me 
understand why its the way it is said rob merrill 15

some who held vigils last year in front of the headquarters of the 
former east german secret police known as the stasi 
on oct 9 1989 about 70000 people took part on the first of 
what became known as the monday demonstrations 
civic groups in east germany had demanded only citizens from

stasi just three days after unity on oct 3

the washington redskins arent trying to 
downplay the importance of their first meeting this season with the 
new york gaints 
this is our biggest test of the season a huge game as far as 
confidence for us guard mark schlereth said as the redskins 
returned to practice monday after their oneweek bye 
theyre 40 and weve been on a roll said defensive end 
fred stokes everything the fans and the media say about this 
being a big game is true 
the giants who play at washington this sunday have beaten the 
redskins in seven of the last eight strike games and have won the 
last four by a total of 14 points 
the redskins havent been to the playoffs since the last time 
they beat the giants in 1987 and their 31 record puts them once 
again behind new york in the nfc eastern division standings 
the redskins play the giants twice in the next three weeks 
their two games against philadelphia come up in the next month 
too giving washington four games against the top two division 
contenders in a fiveweek span 
its going to be a challenge said quarterback stan 
humphries who will be starting only his second nfl game sunday at 
rfk stadium its probably going to be the biggest challenge ive 
ever had 
a sign of the importance the redskins place on the game was the 
intensity around their training facility monday in security 
reminiscent of the old george allen era a couple of aides 
patrolled fences next to woods surrounding the practice field and 
one shooed away some families who peeked through holes in the 
fence 
the redskins frustration the last two years have been 
crystalized in their losses to the giants 
last year raul allegre kicked a 52yard field goal as time 
expired to beat them 2724 in washington and phil simms threw a 
couple of fourthquarter touchdown passes to win the second game 
2017 
in these days of runandshoot offenses the redskins and giants 
both play physical defense and preach ball control on offense 
its always a classic said defensive tackle darryl grant 
a knockdown dragout brawl two fighters in the ring going for 
it 
if youre going to win the conference you have to beat the 
giants and the eagles said schlereth we havent beaten them 
in the last two years you dont want to start losing too many in a 
row or it starts to be a jinx 
the redskins success at grinding out 179 yards rushing against 
phoenix after depending on wideopen passing formations in the 
first three games may have been a dress rehearsal for the new 
york game the giants have used their methodical offense to hold 
the ball an average of more than 10 minutes longer than their 
opponents 
were going to have to try to keep our defense off the 
field said humphries who enters the game with only 48 career 
pass attempts its tough against them when you dont control the 
ball 
they try to stop the longer throws and make you pick your way 
down the field if you drive you have to have 11 or 12 good plays 
in a row said humphries 
that could mean 11 or 12 plays in a row against lawrence taylor 
and the strong giant defense 
theres so many things you cant do with him that you would 
normally do with a regular outside linebacker said coach joe 
gibbs they have two great backers and that allows their 
secondary to play soft and not take chances you cant run on them 
and their secondary takes away the big play 
gibbs was preparing his team after a weekend off and only light 
practices last week 
its hard for me to judge the effect of the layoff said 
gibbs i dont think well know until we get in a game

david h souter a day away from becoming 
historys 105th supreme court justice swore monday to uphold the 
constitution and pass it on to future generations in as vigorous 
condition as i have received it 
souter a 51yearold judge from new hampshire took the oath in 
a brief white house ceremony in which president bush praised his 
first nominee to the high court as a very thoughtful and caring 
man 
bush alluding to the budget crisis that has trimmed federal 
services and threatened to shut down the government invited guests 
to attend a barebones reception afterward 
the impasse has caused a shutdown of all but essential 
government services reducing the white house staff to about 
onesixth its normal size 
joking that a spartan gathering might appeal to souters yankee 
upbringing in new hampshire the president said it would be 
reception without a lot of largesse 
souters oathtaking was a preliminary step he will not become 
a justice until he is sworn in tuesday morning in a separate 
ceremony at the supreme court 
the oath administered by chief justice william h rehnquist is 
one all federal employees must take the chief justice will 
administer a second oath taken by all federal judges in tuesdays 
supreme court ceremony 
after receiving a warm standing ovation from those in the white 
house east room souter demonstrated the softspoken humility that 
helped him win easy senate confirmation 
he recounted how 11 weeks ago when bush nominated him he was 
practically in a state of shock the president and mrs bush 
offered him a drink to revive his flagging spirits and then bush 
telephoned souters mother in new hampshire souter said 
the justicetobe recalled how bush told souters motheri 
want you to know hes ok well look after him 
that epitomizes why my sense of gratitude goes beyond anything 
that could be called official souter said 
mondays ceremony was notable for the praise showered on justice 
william j brennan whose retirement in july opened the way for 
souters nomination 
brennan sat in the front row facing bush as the president 
described him as one of the most personally beloved and respected 
members of the court 
brennan often has been reviled by conservatives as a ymbol of 
liberal judicial activism 
but souter said monday he hopes to pass on the constituion in 
as vigorous condition as i have received it this afternoon as it 
were from justice brennan 
in the supreme courts ornate courtroom tuesday souter was to 
pledge to do equal right to the poor and to the rich 
his working career at the court was to start soon thereafter 
when the justices were to begin the 199091 terms second week of 
hearing arguments in cases to be decided by july 
souter is expected to move the court further to the right 
brennan on the court for 34 years was its leading liberal 
souter in a recent interview with the boston globe described 
himself as a moderate conservative 
i wouldnt put myself smack in the middle closer to 
the center than some but still on the right side souter was 
quoted as saying 
he joins a court deeply divided over such contentious issues as 
abortion affirmative action and churchstate relations 
in three days of testimony before the senate judiciary 
committee souter divulged little about his views on such issues 
but the senate confirmed him by a 909 vote anyway 
in an interview with the associated press last week souter said 
the courts members were eager for him to join them to avoid the 
possibility of tied votes in controversial cases 
they very much wanted me to start sitting on tuesday because 
there is always the possibility of a 44 decision if theyre 
sitting without the full complement souter said the 
difficulty with that is if the case has to be reargued everybody 
knows that the whole reargument is going to be addressed to the one 
judge who is sort of there to make the difference 
before being named a federal appeals court judge by bush earlier 
this year souter spent seven years as a member of the new 
hampshire supreme court he previously had served as a trial judge 
and as his states attorney general 
at last report souter had not yet found a place to live in the 
nations capital but sen warren rudman rnh was helping him 
look for a home he could rent 
souter also does not yet have a permanent staff having been 
assigned only a temporary secretary and a temporary messenger each 
justice is allowed four law clerks two secretaries and a 
messenger 
souter said earlier he hoped to select his law clerks by next 
week 
his suite of offices is waiting for him those justice antonin 
scalia recently gave up when he moved into brennans old chambers 
the goldplated name put on the door days ago says justice 
souter but court officials seemingly not willing to rush things 
elected to keep the nameplate covered with adhesive paper until 
tuesday

the state border of the ussr failure to obey border 
authorities landing people at unpermitted places and an attempt to 
enter an area closed to navigation soviet foreign ministry

vessel to a soviet port if it did not leave the area under its own 
power 
we are not planning to leave she said 
shallhorn said from oslo norway the ship was about four miles 
from the island when the rubber rafts were dispatched 
we dont know if they are aware that our party went ashore we 
are going to try to stay in the area until we get our landing party

party 
in an editorial for tuesdays paper obtained by the associated

visitors got in free monday at the grand canyon and some other 
national parks because there was no one at the gates to collect 
fees and some coast guardsmen were told to stay ashore to save 
fuel 
many other national parks and monuments were closed or without 
services however as nonessential federal workers stayed home 
because the government didnt have authority to pay them 
if the impasse on capitol hill werent resolved the full impact 
of the shutdowns would hit tuesday when federal offices reopen 
after the threeday columbus day weekend most of the 24 million 
federal workers were told to report to work tuesday but without a 
budget agreement most would likely be sent home soon afterward 
richard darman the white house budget director said workers 
performing services needed to protect life and property would 
stay on the job but even some of those federal employees saw 
changes 
the coast guard station in michigan city ind on the shore of 
lake michigan reported it was ordered to save fuel by stopping its 
daily training maneuvers 
fbi agents were told late last week that as many as half of the 
400 employees in the chicago office could be furloughed on 
thursday friday and oct 15 
we will have agents available for kidnappings hostage 
situations bank robberies emergency situations said fbi 
spokesman robert long this could hurt some of our longterm 
investigations though 
locked gates at the vicksburg national military park in 
mississippi angered tourists 
im going home to vote against my congressman said bobby 
denton 52 of jena la 
services at grand canyon national park were cut back to the most 
critical and even the switchboard was shut down 
but the main gate remained open monday so visitors got in 
without paying the usual 10 per car or 5 per person fees 
we got a lot of questions asking what was open and what 
services there were but for the people who visited it was a good 
deal because they got in free said william bohannon general 
manager of the privately operated grand canyon national park lodges 
on the canyons south rim 
tourists also got in free at everglades national park in florida 
after ticket takers were sent home 
about 3500 tourists visited the antietam national battlefield 
at sharspburg md during the threeday weekend many attracted by 
the recent public broadcasting service series on the civil war 
only to find it closed 
the crowd estimate was made monday by park superintendent 
richard rambur who was not working but made a brief stop at his 
office somebody is beating on my window now to use the 
bathroom 
tourists were ousted from visitors centers and campgrounds in 
great smoky mountains national park in tennessee 
privte campgrounds and hotels outside the park were jammed but 
the campground and hotel managers and other merchants said they 
were afraid their windfall would be shortlived if the budget 
impasse isnt resolved 
obviously its a disadvantage to us not to have the park 
open said randy fiveash executive director of the gatlinburg 
chamber of commerce 
the eisenhower library and home in abilene kan remained open 
they are run by the national archives and records administration 
said director richard norton smith were taking it one day at a 
time he said 
the harry s truman library in independence mo also wasnt 
immediately affected said acting director george curtis 
our instructions are to still be open to the public through 
monday curtis said 
visitors to the gateway arch in st louis were turned away 
jerry schober superintendent of the jefferson national expansion 
memorial estimated monday that the arch had lost 15000 to 
20000 in admission fees since it was closed saturday 
in the nations capital the mall normally swarming with 
tourists making their way through the smithsonian institutions 
museums and galleries had just joggers pigeons and a few 
outoftown visitors 
trash littered the mall because federal cleanup crews werent 
working 
i dont think its a good representation for our country 
said ken thomas of baltimore who took his motherinlaw visiting 
from germany to washington despite the shutdown he said she was 
disgusted by the litter 
mike podett of san francisco who had hoped to tour the 
smithsonian museums on his vacation said congress and the white 
house were both to blame for his ruined trip 
theyre acting like a bunch of little children saying its 
my way or no way he said

police said monday they were seeking a 21yearold 
employee of a london club who had been absent from work since the 
morning an ira bomb was found at an antiterrorism conference 
scotland yard detectives said they wanted to question gerrard 
mcgarrigle of belfast who worked in the kitchen of the royal 
overseas league club where the bomb was found and defused sept 27 
he had been employed by the club for a year but was last seen 
on sept 27 when he left without giving notice said a scotland 
yard spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he has not returned to his london address and extensive 
inquiries have so far failed to trace him he said 
robert newell general manager of the club said mcgarrigle had 
been thoroughly checked by a senior member of staff and had worked 
up until then without any problems 
a television sound engineer happened to find the bomb under the 
speakers lectern before the start of the oneday conference it 
was timed to explode minutes after the conference opened and would 
probably have killed several people police said 
later the outlawed irish republican army claimed responsibility 
for planting the bomb saying it had been aimed at foreign office 
minister william waldegrave waldegrave had been scheduled to speak 
first at the conference although his speech was switched to the 
afternoon at the last minute 
the ira which has been fighting to end british rule in 
protestantdominated northern ireland has recently escalated its 
attacks on the british mainland

there was still one chef per shift at the 
white house on monday the astronauts aboard discovery were working 
overtime and government lawyers were preparing to argue before the 
supreme court theyre essential unaffected by the government 
shutdown 
in fact many thousands of federal employees ranging from meat 
inspectors to press secretaries to us troops in the middle east 
remained on the job after government authorization to pay them 
expired friday night 
most federal workers were off for the columbus day holiday on 
monday and wouldnt know for sure until tuesday morning whether 
their bosses considered them essential or not agency heads were 
spared hearing that egodeflating or boosting news because they 
were making the decisions 
it really gets to be nebulous said john sturdivant 
president of the 700000member american federation of government 
employees theoretically you might have a person doing 
scheduling or answering the phone for a cabinet secretary who is 
deemed essential but then you could have some undersecretary whos 
doing policy and planning who is not 
in general federal workers were told to report to work tuesday 
morning then use about three hours for phasedown activities 
before going home if they were ruled nonessential and if a budget 
agreement had not been reached to keep normal government operations 
going 
sturdivant said no one had ever pulled together figures on what 
percentage of the 24 million strong federal work force was 
considered essential one official who declined to be identified by 
name or agency said the office of management and budget had 
promulgated guidelines to the effect that normally only 15 percent 
of a civilian agency should be considered essential 
this could not be confirmed immediately spokesmen for omb were 
not in their offices

the rate at which americans died from accidents 
decreased an estimated 21 percent in the last decade according to 
a group that promotes safety experts attributed the improvement to 
seat belt laws smoke alarm requirements and other toughened safety 
regulations 
the national safety council a public service organization with 
headquarters here reports that accidents still rank as the fourth 
leading cause of death as they were at the beginning of the 1980s 
but the combination of new laws and lower public tolerance for 
unsafe behavior at home at work and especially behind the wheel of 
a car has improved americans safety record said alan hoskin 
director of the councils statistics department 
in general people are demonstrating more concern for safety 
in numerous aspects of their lives hoskin said monday 
the number of fatal accidents went from 105312 in 1979 to an 
estimated 94500 in 1989 a decrease of 10 percent according to 
figures the council released in august 
to arrive at the 21 percent decline statisticians used the 
overall number of fatalities calculated a rate per 100000 people 
and adjusted that rate for the fact that there are more elderly now 
a factor which could tend to inflate the rate

police in riot gear stood by as tom metzger 52 and his son 
john 22 jumped from a van and into a sidewalk elevator that took 
them to the courtroom of another black man multnomah county 
circuit judge ancer haggerty 
dozens of helmeted police some on horseback stood guard and a 
patrol helicopter circled overhead as the metzgers arrived 
the violent demonstration police prepared for failed to 
materialize although a few skinheads young white racists 
who affect shaved heads and military garb waited outside the 
courthouse three young men were arrested outside the courthouse 
two for carrying concealed weapons and one in an earlier assault 
case after the victim pointed him out to police as his alleged 
attacker 
metzger of fallbrook calif founded white aryan resistance 
and is a former ku klux klan grand dragon he and his son also 
active in the white supremacy movement are acting as their own 
attorneys 
the wrongfuldeath lawsuit filed by the victims uncle accuses 
the metzgers of sending agents to portland to incite violence 
against blacks shortly before mulugeta seraw 27 was beaten to 
death with a baseball bat in november 1988 two of the ethiopians 
friends were severely beaten 
three skinheads all members of the neonazi group east side 
white pride were convicted in seraws death

by the metzgers to exclude various people from testifying among 
them are police who investigated seraws death the victims family 
and friends and two men metzger allegedly sent to portland as his 
agents 
metzger claimed he has been unable to interview the men dave 
mazzella and michael barrett the lawsuit claims they brought 
metzgers message of violence against jews and blacks to portland 
skinheads 
barrett who said he had since quit the white supremacist 
movement said in a sworn statement filed with the lawsuit that he 
and mazzella spoke to the gang hours before seraw was killed 
we told them to use violence if they got the opportunity and 
to be sure and beat the hell out of the enemy we were telling them 
what tom and john metzger told us to say to skinheads we were 
organizing he said 
the metzgers deny the accusations

played a hideandseek game with mr barrett and mazzella and we 
had no way to depose or crossexamine them 
haggerty reserved judgment on the metzgers motion to exclude 
certain evidence as constitutionally protected free speech 
that evidence includes racist television programs tom metzger 
produces a telephone hotline he records and newspaper columns he 
writes 
the lawsuit was filed by engedaw berhanu seraws uncle berhanu 
is represented by elden rosenthal and attorney morris dees of the 
alabamabased southern poverty law center

united klans of america after two klansmen from mobile ala 
killed a 19yearold black man the suit was filed on behalf of the 
victims mother

the newly united nation 
the bundesrat also gave final approval to a law enabling 
national elections to be held dec 2 
the treaty formally ends special rights in germany of the four 
world war ii victors the united states the soviet union britain 
and france it was ratified without opposition in the bundesrat 
three days after it was approved by the lower house the bundestag 
the document was signed on sept 12 in moscow by the wartime 
allies and the two germanys 
the new election law replaces an earlier agreement ruled 
unconstitutional by the suprem court in effect the law sets up 
two separate election areas in germany one in former west germany 
and one in nowdefunct east germany 
the rejected law would have required parties to win at least 5 
percent across germany for seats in the bundestag under the new 
law parties need to win only 5 percent in either former east 
germany or west germany 
kohl convened a summit of germanys most powerful business 
leaders monday to issue a personal appeal for quick help in 
rebuilding former east germany 
i have a completely personal request to make of you he told 
the assemblage at the chancellery 
think over the contribution you and your workers can offer so 
that rapid improvements can be achieved 
hopes of huge investment in the former communist nation have not 
yet been realized unemployment is soaring as unprofitable 
businesses and factories close 
he appealed to his guests to send experienced workers to eastern 
germany to provide badly needed knowledge and advice 
kohl said a consensus has to be reached on how to remove 
difficulties facing the reconstruction of eastern germany 
the two germanys united last wednesday and kohl made it clear 
he wants to quickly build up what was formerly east germany and 
give its people a standard of living more in line with that of the 
west 
also on monday interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said former 
highranking east german communist party officials should be 
removed from any key posts they may hold now the newspaper die 
welt reported 
it quoted schaeuble as saying that former communists who were 
once high up and are now again swimming like beads of fat on top of 
the soup should lose their jobs 
his comments follow other news reports that some onetime 
members of east germanys secret police now hold official jobs in 
the new united germany 
schaeuble made special mention of the official trusteeship 
overseeing the privatization of businesses in former east germany 
he said former communist party officials found working there 
would be fired according to die welt

mayor david dinkins promised monday that his 
head will not rest at taxpayer expense whatever the final price 
tag on a bed that a magazine said is going to cost 11500 
newsweek noted that the beds arrival at the mayors official 
residence coincided with municipal money woes that led dinkins to 
freeze hiring propose new taxes and talk about 15000 layoffs 
if it costs what newsweek said that will all be covered by 
private donations from friends of the city many of whom have 
contacted me this morning to offer their contributions the mayor 
said in a statement issued by his press secretary albert scardino 
dinkins said 1400 in contributions had been received before 
the bed or more specifically its decorated cherry headboard was 
delivered to gracie mansion on friday 
newsweek said the bill so far for labor which was performed by 
a carpenter on the payroll of the city human resources 
administration has been just under 6500 for 266 hours the 
magazine said the final accounting could be for 500 hours at 23 an 
hour 11500 
calls to hra spokesmen for comment went unanswered monday the 
columbus day holiday 
a new bedroom set was necessary because former mayor edward i 
koch took the bedroom furniture with him when he left office in 
january said jennifer kimball of dinkins press office koch said 
he had brought his own bed with him when he moved in 
kimball said dinkins and his wife joyce bought nightstands and 
bureaus at their own expense but the matching headboard had been 
discontinued and they had to have it built 
arnold biegen chairman of dinkins finance committee and a 
personal friend confirmed that the final cost would be borne by 
contributors 
while the published labor cost on the face of it is ludicrous 
the mayors friends will pay for it through donations to the gracie 
mansion conservancy said biegen a lawyer 
i wish somebody would ask me why dont i seek reimbursement 
for the 8000 or 9000 i spent on the bedroom suite dinkins 
said no questions have come to me in that regard i contributed 
that 
kimball described the headboard as a museum piece that will 
remain the property of the city

president mikhail gorbachev told highranking 
communists on monday they must embrace a market economy or risk 
losing power and causing greater party discord 
speaking at the opening of a twoday central committee meeting 
gorbachev delivered one of his sternest warnings on reform 
all our previous ideology presented socialism as an antipode 
to the market and viewed the recognition of a market as an 
encroachment upon socialism gorbachev said according to the 
state news agency tass 
yes we are encroaching upon socialism but only socialism 
that was built bureaucratically under which the country veered off 
the path it embarked upon in 1917 the year of the bolshevik 
revolution he said 
gorbachev who also serves as the partys general secretary 
said the inertia of old thinking is a real danger to the 
party if it hopes to regain the confidence of the people 
the party should help society shed prejudice and fear of the 
market he said 
the meeting of the 400member central committee was its first 
since julys larger party congress which gorbachev used to bolster 
his power 
but the congress failed to inspire new confidence in the party 
about 375000 of its approximately 18 million members have quit 
this year including russian federation president boris yeltsin and 
the mayors of moscow and leningrad another 275000 people were 
either expelled from the party or stopped paying dues and attending 
party functions 
gorbachev meanwhile has hit a low in public opinion polls as 
some of the 15 republics exercise more independence 
under growing popular pressure the party earlier this year 
surrendered its constitutional monopoly on power 
later monday deputy party leader vladimir ivashko said the 
party does not renounce socialism by encouraging marketoriented 
reforms 
in his speech gorbachev blamed the countrys problems on the 
state monopoly on property and said workers would be given 
reliable guarantees they would benefit from the 
denationalization of staterun businesses 
in a sign of the partys troubles concerning property the 
ternopol city council in the western ukraine voted monday to seize 
all property belonging to the regional party branch it transferred 
buildings and other assets to control of municipal government 
authorities tass reported 
gorbachev said work on an economic reform plan has entered its 
final stage and will incorporate aspects of programs by prime 
minister nikolai ryzkhov and economist stanislav shatlin a member 
of the advisory presidential council 
this will not be some kind of compromise document with rounded 
corners and fuzzy positions but a program able to rally all 
sections of society he promised 
the supreme soviet legislature has set up a committee to combine 
several programs on rescuing the soviet economy and report back by 
back by oct 15 
the most radical reform proposal written by shatalin calls for 
scrapping the central planning system and moving to a market 
economy within 500 days by selling factories to private owners and 
breaking up collective farms 
the ryzhkov plan would leave the government in control of most 
of the economy while gradually allowing some free enterprise 
gorbachev has backed a compromise that contains many elements of 
the 500day plan but at a slower pace he also wants a national 
referendum to decide whether to return land to private farmers 
in his speech gorbachev repeated his proposal to draw up a new 
union treaty that would grant some autonomy to the 15 soviet 
republics while retaining most power in the kremlin 
the soviet communist party resolutely opposes separatism he 
declared warning that unless the republics reverse their 
secessionist drives the soviet union could fall into a fragmented 
land of competing groups which he likened to lebanon

tropical storm klaus which strengthened after 
being downgraded to a depression threatened the bahamas and 
contributed to flooding along floridas atlantic shores monday 
the national hurricane center in suburban coral gables was also 
tracking tropical storm lili which formed in the central atlantic 
but posed no immediate threat to land 
at 6 pm edt klaus had top winds of 40 mph just over the 
threshold of storm strength its center was near 222 degrees north 
latitude and 708 degrees west longitude or about 470 miles 
southeast of nassau in the bahamas 
klaus was moving northwest at 15 mph and was expected to 
continue on that track for the next day or two forecasters said 
tropical storm warnings were in effect for the central bahamas 
in the caribbean the northern bahamas were under a tropical storm 
watch and a coastal flood watch was in effect for floridas east 
coast and keys 
some increase in strength was likely during the next day for 
klaus which at one point was strong enough to be the sixth 
hurricane of the season 
the storm was expected to strengthen but wasnt expected to 
move over florida said bob sheets director of the hurricane 
center we think its going to move on a northwest course and 
most likely will not move over florida particularly south 
florida 
however klausrelated winds were already partly responsible for 
beach erosion rough surf and potentially deadly rip currents along 
floridas eastern coast and heavy winds and rain elsewhere in the 
state the center said 
klaus killed at least six people and left 1500 homeless in the 
northeastern caribbean before being downgraded saturday to a 
typical storm when its top winds dropped below 73 mph 
it was downgraded late sunday to a tropical depression when its 
winds dipped below 39 mph 
meanwhile tropical storm lili at at 6 pm was located near 
327 degrees north latitude and 475 degrees west longitude or 
about 1000 miles westsouthwest of the azores a group of islands 
off portugal 
lili with top winds near 65 mph was expected to strengthen 
during the next day as it moved southwest at 7 mph forecasters

more to blame than the president for the budget impasse 
in the cbsnew york times poll 54 percent blamed the budget 
snarl on congress and the president equally 
the abcwashington post poll interviewed 775 people and the

mcdonalds hamburgers fries and golden 
arches came to china on monday when the fastfood chain opened its 
first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine 
hundreds of chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in 
shenzhen an economic boom town near hong kong for their first 
taste of a mcdonalds hamburger fries or shake 
i travelled for four hours from a village to get here said 
huang rongti 70 who has lost most of her teeth because of age 
you think hamburgers are too challenging for my age 
later after purchasing her first big mac she inspected it 
carefully before taking a bite 
it tastes good i like it she announced before slowly 
eating the rest 
the opening of a us fastfood restaurant in china where 
cooking has long been considered a culinary art may seem odd to 
gourmets it is estimated there are more than 5000 different 
chinese dishes 
in canton 125 miles northwest of shenzhen chefs specialize in 
some of the more exotic chinese dishes such as cat stew bear 
paws chicken feet and a famed snake dish dragon and tiger 
locked in battle made from three kinds of poisonous snakes 
stewed with leopard meat and garnished with 20 spices lemon 
leaves and chrysanthemum petals 
however many chinese who earn an average 32 a month are 
still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants 
in shenzhen a chinese special economic zone where foreign 
investors have built factories salaries are higher and workers 
earn an average of 53 a month 
at the restaurant a big mac costs 114 a bag of fries 48 
cents and a shake 74 cents 
another us fast food outlet kentucky fried chicken opened a 
restaurant in beijing in 1987 and it now has four outlets there 
mcdonalds hopes to open a restaurant in beijing later 
although kentucky fried chicken has become popular the average 
chinese still regards a meal there as a treat rather than a 
convenience and mcdonalds could face the same problems 
the 500seat mcdonalds restaurant in a threestory building is 
operated by mcdonalds restaurant shenzhen ltd a wholly owned 
subsidiary of mcdonalds hong kong mcdonalds hong kong is a 5050 
joint venture with mcdonalds in the united states 
it is managed by a chinese national chen tikang and his son 
chen yin who is the restaurant manager the younger chen returned 
recently from a course at mcdonalds hamburger university in oak 
brook ill 
most of the ingredients used at the restaurant are now imported 
from hong kong but mcdonalds executives hope eventually to get 
their supplies of beef and potatoes from china 
daniel ng chairman of mcdonalds restaurant shenzhen ltd said 
it took two years to prepare for the restaurants opening and his 
ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year 
last month when mcdonalds advertized for 240 staffers for the 
restaurant it received applications from more than 9000 persons 
including college graduates officials said 
i feel i have a better job prospect working here and it pays 
better said henry he 25 who has a masters degree in garment 
and textile he is an assistant manager at the restaurant 
a waiter at the restaurant can earn 53 cents an hour 
a factory worker who waited several hours before she was able 
to purchase her hamburger said she liked it because of its sweet 
taste the result of tomato ketchup which is not commonly used 
in traditional chinese cooking

leaders of austrias two largest parties 
said monday they would open talks on continuing their governing 
coalition despite the drubbing of the main conservative party in 
national elections 
chancellor franz vranitzkys socialist party won 43 percent of 
the vote sunday and added one seat in the 183seat parliament 
where it now controls 81 seats 
vranitzkys coalition partners the conservative peoples party 
suffered its worst defeat in 45 years losing 17 of its 77 seats 
yet remaining in a pivotal position to decide the makeup of the new 
government 
vice chancellor josef riegler leader of the peoples party 
said it would talk to the socialists about rebuilding the coalition 
forged in 1986 rather than turning first to the upstart freedom 
party and its leader joerg haider 
haiders party nearly doubled its parliamentary representation 
to 33 seats on a platform appealing to nationalist sentiments 
warnings of rising crime and complaints over austrias relatively 
liberal immigration policies for eastern europeans 
the freedom party took nearly 17 percent of the popular vote 
some in the peoples party had earlier suggested the possibility 
of a coalition with the freedom party with 93 seats between them 
they would have one more than the majority 
vranitzky reiterated monday that he would not govern in 
partnership with haiders freedom party which he and his party 
consider too far to the right 
the socialists had been expected to lose heavily due to a series 
of internal scandals but vranitzkys extraordinary popularity 
appeared to offset the problems 
vranitzkys government was to submit its resignation tuesday 
after the regular cabinet session president kurt waldheim will ask 
vranitzky as leader of the strongest party to form a new 
government 
vranitzky and riegler met separately with waldheim on monday to 
discuss the outcome of the election 
the environmental green alternative party won an additional seat 
sunday for a total of nine

a federal court on monday 
rejected a request by italy to extradite five former military 
officers accused of human rights violations during the argentine 
dirty war including expresident jorge videla 
the extradition request is inadmisible the court ruled 
because the crimes the italian court wants to prosecute occurred in 
argentina 
the case stems from the 1978 disappearance of four argentine 
citizens of italian descent who were last seen in the atlantic 
resort of mar del plata 250 miles south of buenos aires 
relatives in italy filed the suit the court requested the 
extraditions last tuesday 
videla and former navy admiral emilio massera were convicted by 
a federal court and sentenced to life in prison for human rights 
abuses committed during the 197683 military juntas crackdown on 
suspected leftist subversion 
of the other three former officers cited one was convicted of 
rights abuses one is awaiting trial and one was allowed to retire 
the dirty war the hardline military waged against suspected 
leftist subversives left at least 9000 people missing and presumed 
dead

tamara roberts long ago recognized the value of the bonemarrow 
transplant research by e donnall thomas one of two american 
doctors awarded the nobel prize in medicine it saved her life 
in 1972 roberts was a teenager dying of leukemia today at 
age 34 she has lived longer than any other leukemia victim who 
received a bone marrow transplant 
he is like my dad roberts said a news conference monday 
with thomas 
when youve known someone and theyve brought you back and 
given you another 60 years on a silver platter and said just 
enjoy wouldnt you feel close to that person i know i do 
thomas 70 and joseph e murray 71 who performed the first 
successful human organ transplant a kidney will share the 
704000 prize 
their revolutionary procedures have saved thousands of lives 
over three decades both said monday that they were surprised and 
grateful for the recognition but that their lives would be 
unchanged by the money 
thomas with the fred hutchinson cancer research center in 
seattle credited his research team for much of his 
accomplishments 
its a great honor not only for me but for the team i have 
worked with all these years he said 
thomas performed the first human bone marrow transplant in 1956 
initially the only success came in cases where identical twins 
were involved 
by the early 1970s however the years of research began to pay 
off roberts donor was her brother 
today the procedure is standard treatment for leukemia and 
other diseases 
leukemia once was always fatal thomas procedure now produces a 
cure in 50 percent of all cases and in 80 percent of childhood 
cases in 1987 about 4000 patients received the treatment 
murray in san francisco for a medical conference said monday 
he struggled with moral dilemmas four decades ago as he pioneered 
transplant surgery which is now routine but still ethically 
complex 
we were stuck with the moral problem of removing a healthy 
organ from a healthy person and this was new then murray said 
in 1954 murray and his team of surgeons at brigham and womens 
hospital in boston removed a healthy kidney from 23yearold ronald 
herrick and transplanted it in his identical twin richard in what 
was the first such success after 15 failures 
we felt it was worth risking the health of that normal person 
to prevent the death of his twin brother murray said he 
was very anxious to donate the operation was the light at the 
end of the tunnel 
in 1962 murray performed the first successful kidney transplant 
from an unrelated donor now up to 50000 organ transplants are 
performed each year 75 percent of them involving kidneys 
transplants still present ethical questions he said such as 
the whether it is right to spend millions of dollars on 
hightech medicine when many americans lack basic medical care 
i think the imbalance is horrible but i dont think we should 
deny hightech medical advances he said the lack of health care 
for some is a distribution problem he added comparing it to 
the inability to get surplus food to all the hungry

two american doctors won the nobel 
prize in medicine monday for their work in transplanting human 
organs and bone marrow revolutionary procedures that have saved 
thousands of lives over three decades 
joseph e murray 71 who performed the first successful organ 
transplant a kidney and e donnall thomas 70 who pioneered 
bone marrow transplants to cure leukemia will share the 704000 
4 million kronor prize 
most nobel prizes in medicine have been awarded for basic 
research not for clinical treatment 
i really thought this work was too clinical to ever win the 
prize thomas said from his home in bellevue wash he is 
affiliated with the fred hutchinson cancer research center in 
seattle one of the worlds major bone marrow transplant 
institutions 
but in the case of transplants the clinical treatment was a 
radical advance 
this was astonishing to take one organ and move it to another 
person it was science fiction 30 years ago said dr carlgustav 
groth a member of the nobel assembly at the karolinska institute 
which awarded the prize 
swedish dynamite inventor alfred nobel declared in his 1896 will 
that the prizes should be given to those who have conferred the 
greatest benefit on mankind 
the nobel assembly said murrays and thomas discoveries had met 
the requirement by saving tens of thousands of lives providing 
cures for such fatal diseases as leukemia liver malignancy 
coronary artery disease and aplastic anemia 
the doctors did their groundbreaking research separately during 
the 1950s and 1960s but they began their careers together at 
brigham and womens hospital in boston where murray remains 
affilitated although he stopped performing surgery four years ago 
he was a resident in medicine and i was a resident in 
surgery said murray who was in san francisco on monday for a 
medical conference this was after world war ii 
we both started working in transplants together but from 
different angles its marvelous to share it with him 
murray a native of milford mass mastered the problem of 
organ rejection and in 1954 made the first successful organ 
transplant a kidney from one identical twin to another that 
functioned for seven years in earlier attempts implanted organs 
were rejected within hours or days 
thomas was also able to diminish the severe reaction that bone 
marrow grafts can cause in recipients he performed the first human 
bone marrow transplant in 1956 and his procedure now is the 
standard treatment for leukemia patients 
it also is used to treat a variety of cancers and inherited 
diseases and researchers are investigating its potential use in 
treating aids and other diseases 
the nobel assembly said the idea of transplanting organs has 
been discussed for thousands of years and unsuccessful attempts 
were made at the turn of the century a medieval italian painting 
shows doctors trying to sew a black mans leg onto a white mans 
body 
leading modern scientists including 1960 nobel medicine 
laureate sir peter medawar of great britain had believed organ 
transplant was biologically impossible 
in the late 1940s medawar said a biological force existed that 
forever will inhibit transplantation from one individual to 
another 
groth said now even successful transplants from animals to 
humans are not far away but rejection by the immune system is 
still the main problem 
murrays transplant work opened the field for other organs 
such as liver pancreas and heart said the award statement 
up to 50000 organ transplants are performed each year 75 
percent of them involving kidneys 
leukemia once was always fatal thomas procedure now produces a 
cure in 50 percent of all cases and in 80 percent of childhood 
cases in 1987 about 4000 patients received the treatment 
murrays and thomas discoveries are crucial for those tens of 
thousands of severely ill patients who either can be cured or be 
given a decent life when other treatment methods are without 
success said the 50member nobel assembly at swedens largest 
and oldest medical university 
americans have won or shared 69 of the 142 nobel medicine prizes 
since 1901 great britain is second with 17 winners 
last year the prize also went to americans j michael bishop 
and harold e varmus won it for discovering a family of genes that 
has helped scientists understand how cancer develops 
the medicine or physiology prize is the first of five endowed by 
nobel to be awarded this month 
the nobel peace prize will be announced oct 15 in oslo norway 
prizes for physics and chemistry discoveries will be announced oct 
17 in stockholm the date for the literature prize has not been 
announced 
the nobel memorial prize in economic science created by the 
central bank of sweden in 1969 will be awarded in stockholm on 
oct 16 
the prizes are presented dec 10 the anniversary of nobels

stores in rwandas capital reopened monday 
and people traveled freely around the city for the first time since 
street battles began last week 
a rebel leader denied his forces were involved in the clashes 
that began in kigali on friday blaming loyalist government 
soldiers and others seeking to join the weekold rebellion 
military officials however claim to have arrested rebels in 
the capital as hundreds of foreigners fled amid the fighting 
rebels calling themselves the rwandese patriotic front invaded 
the tiny central african country from its northern neighbor uganda 
on sept 30 the force mostly rwandan refugees from the minority 
tutsi tribe includes many deserters from ugandas army 
they reportedly were concentrated in rwandas northeastern 
corner although a diplomat said a group of rebels was sighted last 
week at a lake 30 miles east of the capital 
nearly 100000 tutsi refugees have lived in uganda since the 
late 1950s and early 1960s after fleeing massacres by the majority 
hutu tribe 
the rebels seek to oust president juvenal habyarimana who they 
accuse of corruption and abuse of power a hutu habyarimana has 
ruled rwanda since a 1973 coup 
the refugees repatriation had been hampered by severe 
overcrowding in rwanda africas most densely populated country an 
average of more than 566 people live on every square mile compared 
with an average in the united states of 63 people per square mile 
since friday nearly 1500 troos from france belgium and zaire 
have arrived to protect their citizens and embassies in kigali and 
help rwandas army maintain control 
the rebels protested the intervention in news releases monday 
and warned foreign governments if their forces strayed from their 
stated mission full responsibility for what happens to them shall 
fall on your shoulders 
although no government had ordered the evacuation of its 
citizens up to 1000 foreigners mostly dependants of aid workers 
left over the weekend on specially scheduled flights 
the flow of foreign citizens leaving the former belgian colony 
slowed monday as relative calm returned to kigali residents 
reported hearing light and sporadic shooting sunday night but said 
the situation overall had quietened 
the defense ministry announced that businesses were to resume 
normal working hours tuesday but a dusktodawn curfew continued 
and public transportation remained suspended 
since the invasion many tutsi and some hutu businessmen and 
intellectuals in kigali have been arrested according to diplomats 
who spoke on condition of anonymity the diplomats could not 
speculate on the number of arrests 
a defense ministry statement monday reported a good number 
of rebels and supporters had been arrested in the capital 
the situation is more and more returning to normal but some 
areas are still infested with the assailants it said 
in an interview behind rebel lines with ugandas stateowned 
newspaper new vision a rebel identified as maj peter baingana 
denied that rebels infiltrated the capital and claimed several 
rwandan soldiers had joined the insurgency but did not say how 
many 
he claimed the rebels controlled the border post of kagitumba 
55 miles north of kigali and said they had captured two armored 
vehicles four mortars several machine guns and an antiaircraft 
gun during battles last week 
the rebel force is led by ugandas former deputy army commander 
maj gen fred rwigyema a rwandan of tutsi origin estimates of 
the rebel troop strength range from several hundred to several 
thousand

in jerusalems worst bloodshed since 1967 
police fired monday on stonethrowing palestinians at the temple 
mount sacred to both jews and moslems and at least 19 arabs died 
the shooting began after about 3000 palestinians hurled a 
barrage of stones from the mount onto jews gathered just below at 
the western wall or wailing wall where up to 20000 jews were 
celebrating the festival of sukkot the wall is judaisms holiest 
site 
the arabs were apparently infuriated by rumors that jewish 
extremists planned to march onto the temple mount which is under 
moslem control 
police fired tear gas then rubber bullets and live ammunition 
helicopters flew overhead 
the bloodbath touched off riots in the occupied territories that 
killed three more palestinians a jewish cab driver also was found 
shot to death 
police minister roni milo said 19 arabs were killed in jerusalem 
and about 140 wounded arab hospital officials at first said 22 
were killed then lowered their count to 18 with 125 wounded 
lower than that given by the israelis 
milo said 120 palestinians were arrested 
prime minister yitzhak shamir expressed regret but insisted 
israeli forces were blameless 
we are greatly sorry about the blood spilled in vain he 
said 
the singleday death toll was the highest since the palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation began in december 1987 and the 
most deaths by violence in jerusalem since israeli soldiers 
captured the holy citys arab sector in the 1967 middle east war 
arab reports said two palestinians were killed and 62 wounded in 
later rioting in the occupied gaza strip 
a 20yearold palestinian was shot to death in the occupied west 
bank when he tried to grab a soldiers rifle arab and israeli 
reports said 
late monday the body of a jewish driver shot in the head was 
discovered in his taxi near the israeli arab village of abu ghosh 
outside jerusalem the national itim news agency said police 
suspected it was a palestinian nationalist killing but were 
checking other motives 
palestinian leaders in the west bank and gaza strip demanded 
un protection and announced a weeklong protest strike starting 
tuesday 
army radio reported a mass israeli troop movement into the 
territories military officials said the entire gaza strip home to 
700000 palestinians would be put under curfew widespread curfews 
already were in place in the west bank 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said in washington 
that israel needs to exercise restraint in handling such 
disturbances 
the un security council asked to condemn the killings met in 
new york un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar expressed 
grave concern over the incident and said israeli authorities 
may have used excessive force 
iraqs governing arab baath socialist party threatened 
retaliation and predicted the crime would lead arabs to the 
liberation of jerusalem and all other holy places a reference 
to mecca and medina saudi arabia 
american photographer mel rosen watched from a balcony about 300 
yards away and said the palestinians let fly such a torrent of 
rocks he first thought flocks of birds had left their nests in the 
crannies of the wailing wall 
oded wiener an israeli witness said thousands of jews fled in 
panic 
people started shouting where is my child and running he 
said suddenly i saw this huge empty plaza it looked like after 
a pogrom 
atop the temple mount moslem cleric sheik jamal alami pointed 
to pools of blood and told an american reporter your country is 
giving the israelis bullets in 1967 there was no shooting like 
today this is a holy mosque and you tell me why are the soldiers 
here 
a 14yearold palestinian boy who gave his name only as safyan 
said he and other moslems ran to protect the holy site after mosque 
loudspeakers warned that jews were coming 
on israel army radio police commissioner yaacov terner said the 
bloodshed was very sad but he insisted arabs started the 
violence 
he said authorities repeatedly assured moslem leaders no jewish 
march would be permitted on the mount a small group of marchers 
were shunted elsewhere and did not figure in the riots as rioting 
eased about 50 of the jewish zealots arrived carrying israeli 
flags and shouting kill the arabs officials said 
terner said authorities later found caches of stones and 
flammable material proving the arabs had mounted a planned 
provocation 
he said their aim was partly to divert world attention from the 
persian gulf crisis in which palestinians have supported iraqi 
leader saddam hussein 
shamir claimed in a speech monday in northern israel that at 
temple mount somebody tried to exploit the atmosphere of 
hysteria and fundamentalist radicalism transmitted from baghdad and 
ignite an alien fire in jerusalem 
terner said five or six police were hurt by stones itim said 22 
civilians most of them worshipers at the wall also suffered minor 
injuries 
scenes of anguish took place outside hospitals as victims poured 
in and relatives hunted for loved ones 
jews revere the wailing wall as the last remnant of the ancient 
temple destroyed by the romans in the year 70 moslems believe the 
prophet mohammed ascended to heaven from the mount site of the 
dome of the rock and al aqsa mosques 
khaled shalatef a 26yearold palestinian hit in the head with 
rubber bullets said at augusta victoria hospital we are moslems 
and we came to defend our mosque 
i did not expect jews to perform such terrible massacres 
against unarmed people 
terner said rioters burned the police station 
there was no policeman who wasnt stoned terner said 
their lives were in real danger they had no other way but to 
respond the way they did the toll was very heavy but the israel 
police had to defend themselves and to protect the thousands of 
worshipers 
mondays deaths raised the toll in the uprising to 758 
palestinians killed by troops or israeli civilians at least 278 
other palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs for allegedly 
collaborating with israel fortyeight israelis have died in the 
violence 
among those arrested monday was faisal husseini a leading 
supporter of the palestine liberation organization who is involved 
in unofficial peace contacts with israeli moderates

two american airmen who volunteered for duty with the 
multinational force facing iraq died in a jet crash monday in saudi 
arabia and the navy searched for two helicopters and eight crew 
members missing in the arabian sea 
the pentagon said search and rescue crews had spotted the 
wreckage of at least one helicopter late monday but no bodies had 
been found 
international forces in the persian gulf crisis showed a new 
measure of teamwork when us british and australian warships 
upholding the un trade embargo forced two iraqi ships to stop and 
submit to searched 
in one case the western ships fired shots the other ship was 
diverted to a port after food and other prohibited cargo was 
discovered 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia cyprus 
said the actions amounted to harassment by sea pirates 
us military officials said a rf4c phantom reconnaisance jet 
crashed in the southern saudi arabian peninsula 
the jet belonged to a unit of the alabama air national guard on 
a training mission said guard spokeswoman toni long 
ms long identified the victims as maj barry k henderson 40 
a senior pilot from tuscumbia ala and maj stephen g schramm 
43 a master navigator from birmingham ala 
both were assigned to the 106th tactical reconnaissance squadron 
of the 117th tactical reconnaissance wing and had volunteered for 
duty in saudi arabia said ms long their unit had not been 
activated 
a military spokesman navy cmdr jd van sickle said the crash 
was under investigation and that he could provide no other details 
the two marine helicopters disappeared about dawn during a 
training flight over the north arabian sea east of the persian 
gulf said van sickle 
naval officers ruled out hostile action and said there was no 
indication that the helicopters might have collided 
pentagon officials in washington said the marines were from camp 
pendleton calif 
the helicopters were operating from the carrier uss okinawa one 
of more than 12 ships deployed in the region after iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
before monday five american service members had been killed in 
the region since the deployment began in addition 13 crew members 
died aug 29 when a giant transport aircraft loaded with supplies 
for us forces in the gulf crashed and burned shortly after 
takeoff in west germany 
the united states leads a multinational force of ships in the 
region and troops in saudi arabia and the united nations has 
imposed a land sea and air embargo to isolate iraq and try to 
force it to withdraw from kuwait 
the warning shots fired at the iraqi freighter alwasitti marked 
the first time a british warship has shot to enforce the embargo 
the british defense ministry said the iraqi freighter had been 
shadowed by the hms battleaxe the uss reasoner and the hmas 
adelaide during the night then called to stop for inspection 
but the alwasitti ignored repeated appeals and at daybreak the 
three vessels fired warning shots across the bow of the freighter 
the ministry said in london 
it said royal marines boarded the 5885ton vessel with a coast 
guard team from the reasoner following them it was empty and was 
allowed to continue on its way presumably to iraq british defense 
officials said 
the second iraqi ship the tadmur was ordered to an undisclosed 
port after boarding teams found rice flour and other prohibited 
cargo in substantial quantities said a statement from the us 
military command in dhahran saudi arabia 
the tanker was first boarded by royal marines from the frigate 
hms brazen followed by teams from the uss goldsborough and the 
australian frigate hmas darwin 
authorities did not disclose where the the tadmur was sent but 
the closest omani ports would be muscat and rasalhadd no shots 
were fired in that incident 
the tadmur which officials said was bound for basra iraq was 
stopped in the red sea on sept 27 after a us warship fired 
across its bow after a boarding party found it empty it was 
allowed to proceed 
us warships had been playing a dominant role in enforcing the 
unordered naval blockade to pressure iraqi president saddam 
hussein into ending the 2monthold occupation of kuwait but in 
recent weeks british canadian australian and spanish warships 
have joined in the interceptions 
in our maritime intercept operations it is truly a 
multinational effort in support of un resolutions 661 and 665 
said vice adm henry h mauz commander of us naval forces in the 
region 
he said that as of monday 2061 ships had been intercepted 
since the embargo began aug 12 
of those ships 207 were searched 37 the past four days he 
said in only a handful of cases have warning shots been fired the 
first by us warships inside the persian gulf on aug 18 
in other developments 
a kuwaiti official said his nations governmentinexile will 
ask the united nations to allow an airlift of medicine into kuwait 
city to help people who are critically ill we are very concerned 
about people who are dying because of a lack of medical supplies 
suleman mutawaa the governments planning minister said in 
london 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu completed a fivenation 
middle east tour with a visit to oman and repeated his countrys 
position that iraqi must pull out of kuwait 
extra production by opec members in september made up for 
threequarters of the 4 millionbarreladay loss caused by the 
iraqkuwait crisis the middle east economic survey reported but 
the respected newsletter said the world still faces a shortfall in 
the fourth quarter of this year 
the german government plans to remove its remaining staff 
members about five from its embassy in kuait in the next few 
days because the mission has run out of supplies a foreign 
ministry spokesman iraqi troops have surrounded embassies that 
remain open and have cut off power and water

a baby born with usually fatal cardiac 
defects survived after his heart improved unexpectedly but his 
parents on monday begged for donor hearts to save the lives of 
other dying infants 
weve been awed by the baby really said dr leonard 
bailey a pioneering heart surgeon at loma linda university medical 
center its been an impressive experience its sort of a 
miracle 
weston kilpatrick born in santa maria on july 27 is alive only 
because of our prayers and the prayers of others and perhaps some 
medical phenomenon his father pharmacist layne kilpatrick said 
during a monday news conference at the university 
i think this child has an incredible will to live its 
miraculous kilpatrick said of his sons spontaneous recovery 
from three of five heart defects it hasnt been seen before 
surgery was performed friday to correct two other defects but 
weston no longer requires a heart transplant to save his life 
bailey said 
its like a ton of bricks being relieved from you said 
dietician janet kilpatrick the infants mother 
the kilpatricks said other newborns with deadly congenital heart 
defects will die unless parents of babies killed in car wrecks or 
other accidents agree to donate their dead childrens hearts 
about 100 babies in the united states die each day because the 
demand for newborn heart donors far outstrips the supply said 
bailey who transplanted a baboons heart into a girl known as baby 
fae in 1984 in a futile and harshly criticized attempt to save that 
newborns life 
since the baby fae transplant loma linda has become a leading 
center for using heart transplants to save babies born with fatal 
cardiac defects of 73 infants who have received transplanted 
hearts there 55 are still alive 
bailey said about 20 hospitals across the nation now perform 
infant heart transplants but the wait for donor hearts has 
increased from three weeks to five weeks as demand for the surgery 
grew 
its such a terrible waste that these children and these 
babies have to die when these gentlemen doctors have proven they 
can save their lives with infanttoinfant transplants layne 
kilpatrick said 
baby fae was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome a fatal 
underdevelopment of the hearts left pumping chamber weston 
kilpatrick was born with a similar but less severe defect along 
with underdeveloped mitral and aortic heart valves a narrowed 
aorta and an open duct between two arteries bailey said 
the mitral valve regulates blood flow from the upper chamber to 
the lower chamber of the left side of the heart the aortic valve 
controls blood flow from the left side of the heart into the aorta 
the main artery carrying blood from the heart to the rest of the 
body 
after being transferred to loma linda weston remained for weeks 
on a waiting list for donor hearts when doctors performed 
ultrasound tests on his heart about 10 days ago they were amazed 
to find spontaneous and unprecedented development of the left side 
of the heart and the two aalves 
we have never seen this phenomenon said dr jorge 
mccormack a pediatric cardiologist 
bailey said westons heart has developed to a nearly normal 
architecture its a fascinating thing 
westons abnormally narrowed aorta the main artery that 
carries blood from the heart to the body was repaired friday by 
dr steven gundry 
the operation also closed the open duct between two key coronary 
arteries the duct normally closes by itself after birth 
weston should be able to go home in another week or so 
bailey said 
mrs kilpatrick said her first priority is to hold the child she 
once thought would die without a transplant 
despite westons improvement bailey said 99 percent or more 
of the babies with such defects are going to require a transplant 
if theyre going to live

an appeals court refused monday to overturn 
an injunction that sent striking temple university professors back 
to their classrooms without a contract last week 
commonwealth judge doris smith said that to reverse the lower 
courts order and allow the 29day strike to resume would cause 
substantial harm 
the ruling upheld an injunction issued wednesday by common pleas 
judge samuel lehrer against the temple association of university 
professionals the union representing 1100 teachers librarians 
and other academic staff 
the union advised its members in a taped message that he 
injunction was upheld but said the taup appeal will continue to 
go forward 
the union scheduled a silent vigil on campus tuesday afternoon 
before a meeting of private universitys board of trustees 
meanwhile the university has extended the fall semester from 
dec 12 through jan 15 thus canceling most vacation time 
the extension angered both students and faculty students wont 
be able to work or travel during the christmas and new year 
holidays teachers claim the semester cannot be extended without 
negotiations 
lehrer ordered last week that negotiations resume but none are 
scheduled 
in winning the injunction temple had argued that the strike 
created a clear and present danger or threat to the health 
safety or welfare of the public 
smith found that lehrer was correct in ruling that the strike 
posed a danger to the public 29000 students if it continued 
smith rejected the unions argument that its members would 
suffer irreparable harm if they were not allowed to continue their 
strike until a new contract is negotiated the old contract expired 
june 30 
professors returned to their classrooms wednesday after the 
longest strike in the universitys history 
union members want 7 percent pay raises and do not want to pay 
for health care the universiy offered a 5 percent salary hike in 
a fouryear contract with a request that teachers contribute 260 
a year toward health insurance

president cesar gaviria offered major 
concessions to drug traffickers on monday including no 
extradition reduced sentences and staying free while awaiting 
trial in colombia 
the property of those who surrender will not be confiscated 
traffickers have vast holdings in colombia 
it was the clearest message yet that the government does not 
want to resume a war against traffickers that began nearly 14 
months ago and led to more than 500 people being killed 
but the medellin drug cartel which has been blamed for the 
deaths of hundreds the last year to try to force colombian leaders 
to end extradition said in communiques in the last month it now 
wants full pardons 
gaviria decreed that drug suspects who surrender will not face 
extraditon and that their sentences would be halved if they 
confess and help police nab other suspects 
it is doubtful the decree will do much toward dismantling the 
powerful drug cartels that sell billions of dollars of cocaine 
worldwide providing us users with most of their supply 
the presidents plan appeared flawed in its assumption that 
traffickers would surrender 
drug dealers who helped authorities arrest others could not 
expect to live long in colombias prisons where murder for hire is 
routine 
in the past traffickers threatened or bribed judges into 
dropping charges 
even if a case is not dropped it could drag on for years under 
colombias muddled court system 
the maximum sentence is 20 years there is no death penalty 
justice minister jaime giraldo angel announced the decree at a 
news conference it was issued under a state of siege that lets the 
president bypass congress 
the decree is not limited to drug traffickers but is clearly 
aimed at them 
giraldo said that if a trafficking suspect surrenders but does 
not confess he would lose the right to a reduced sentence but 
would not be extradited 
if the suspect does not surrender extradition would still be 
possible 
a national police communique said monday that trafficking 
suspect joaquin gallo was extradited last saturday to the united 
states the 25th colombian to be sent there for trial on 
drugrelated charges since the crackdown began 
the communique have no particulars 
seven journalists including diana turbay daughter of former 
president julio cesar turbay were kidnapped by the cartel since 
september apparently to be held as hostages until the cartel gets 
what it wants 
gaviria has said he will not negotiate with traffickers 
the cartel wants traffickers treated the same as leftist 
guerrillas who negotiate with the government guerrillas who 
surrender get pardons

the government on monday denied offering japan 
concessions over the kuril islands and its news agency described 
the japanese reports as disinformation aimed at setting back a 
rapprochment 
japanese newspapers and the kyodo news service reported sunday 
that soviet officials had offered to return two disputed islands to 
japan and sign a new peace treaty within five years officially 
ending sovietjapanese hostilities dating from world war ii 
they quoted japanese sources as saying the offer was made to 
japanese lawmakers last month in moscow 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama and prime minister 
toshiki kaifu cautiously welcomed the reported offer monday with 
kaifu saying he would consider such a proposal if it were made 
through formal channels 
but later monday in moscow the soviet foreign ministry issued a 
statement denying it made any such offer it said the japanese 
lawmakers visiting moscow were handed no draft documents let 
alone documents that would raise in any form the question of the 
kuril islands which belong to the soviet union according to the 
official news agency tass 
tass later carried an analysis ridiculing the kyodo report as 
sensational 
this is one more piece of disinformation not the first and 
possibly not the last wrote political analyst yuri tyssovsky 
it is apparently beneficial for certain japanese circles to 
paint the kurils in japanese national colors on geographical maps 
to keep the problem as an irritant in sovietjapanese relations 
the tass anaylsis said a peace treaty must be signed first it 
would then be possible to return to the northern territorites 
problem without unnecessary prejudice or old stereotypes 
japan however insists the soviet union acknowledge japanese 
ownership of the islands before it will conclude any treaty with 
moscow 
the exchange comes as both sides have been signalling a desire 
to resolve their 45yearold dispute focused on three islands and 
a cluster of islets off northern japan totaling 2000 square miles 
the soviet union claims them as historically russian territory 
while tokyo insists they were ceded to japan in 19thcentury 
treaties

the national football league on oct 5 handed 
cincinnati coach sam wyche the largest fine ever for an nfl coach 
for excluding a woman reporter from the bengals locker room 
the league refused to disclose the amount of the fine 
describing it only as oneseventeenth of wyches annual pay 
reports have placed wyches pay at 500000 which would put the 
fine at just under 30000 
wyche had no comment cincinnati spokesman al heim said there 
is no appeal process available to the coach 
the fine was announced by joe browne the nfls vice president 
for communications who said the commissioner said last year 
that equal media access was a priority and i believe this 
emphasizes that point 
tagliabue had promised a heavy fine after wyche refused to allow 
denise tom a reporter for usa today to enter the bengals locker 
room following a game against seattle 
i will not allow a woman to walk into a room of 50 naked 
men wyche said instead he delivered quarterback boomer esiason 
to tom for an interview outside the locker room 
at midweek wyche offered a solution to the access problem that 
he called plan b saying all media would be allowed in the 
dressing room for 20 minutes after games while the players remained 
in their uniforms then the room would be cleared and media not 
allowed back in until the players had showered and dressed 
tagliabue rejected that idea 
gene policinski managing editor for sports at usa today said 
the quick action by nfl commissioner paul tagliabue and the 
warning that any future violations will mean even more severe 
discipline supports the basic idea that reporters male and female 
have a legitimate professional role in nfl locker rooms 
a year ago tagliabue fined wyche 3000 for closing the 
bengals locker room to all media following a loss to seattle and 
in 1986 thencommissioner pete rozelle fined him 2000 for 
knocking a microphone out of a reporters hand in the dressing 
room 
the largest previous fine for an nfl coach was 5000 levied 
against several coaches for public criticism of officials and for 
onfield conduct

the gannett foundation has rejected a 540 
million bid from gannett co inc to buy its 10 percent block of 
the media giants stock 
martin f birmingham chairman of the foundations finance and 
investment committee said oct 1 that the foundation gannetts 
largest shareholder had authorized the investment firm of salomon 
brothers to seek other offers 
the current depressed market price of gannett stock does not 
represent the true value of the company birmingham said it 
would be irresponsible for the trustees to accept this 
unsatisfactory at the market bid 
the bid dated sept 14 was 3387 per share for a total value 
of about 540 million 
the foundation had told the company that no substantive talks 
with interested third parties would take place as long as serious 
negotiations were going on with the company 
douglas h mccorkindale gannett co incs chief financial 
officer agreed the companys stock was undervalued because of the 
recent downturn in advertising revenue 
despite the foundations rejection gannett co was still a 
ready willing and able buyer of the stock he said 
mccorkindale said gannett was not worried that having such a 
large block of stock up for grabs could make the company a 
potential takeover target because financing a takeover in todays 
market is much much more difficult than it was two three or four 
years ago 
he cited the decline of the junk bond market which financed a 
number of takeovers in the 1980s 
he also noted that gannett has a shareholder rights offering 
plan that would kick in after somebody acquires 15 percent of the 
stock the plan would make it prohibitively expensive for a suitor 
to acquire more shares mccorkindale said 
john morton a newspaper analyst with lynch jones amp ryan in 
washington agreed that gannett was the most likely buyer to pay a 
premium over market price 
if they the foundation couldnt get the price they wanted 
from gannett i think its unlikely theyre going to get it from 
anybody else said morton 
its not as though gannett is a company thats considered a 
prime candidate for a takeover takeoverprone companies normally 
are those that have not satisfied their shareholders with financial 
performance over the years you cannot say that about gannett he 
said 
birmingham said the market value of the stock was about 800 
million at the thirdquarter high a year earlier 
since last year many factors have contributed to the decline 
of gannett stock including the companys first down quarter since 
it went public in 1967 and its gloomy predictions about 1990 
earnings overall he said 
the foundation was established in 1935 as an independent entity 
with controlling ownership of the company

the future ownership of the albany herald and 
its parent company remained uncertain oct 2 after a consultants 
report said an offer from editor james h jimmy gray was too 
low 
the estate of grays deceased father james h gray sr owns 
517 percent of the parent company the younger gray had an 
agreement to buy out his brother and sister but the consultants 
report has at the least postponed that deal 
it also reopened the possibility that someone outside the family 
could buy the company though jimmy gray has said he believes the 
will requires the stock be sold to one of the three heirs at a fair 
price 
besides the newspaper gray communications inc owns three 
television stations a real estate firm a distribution firm and an 
aircraftservicing facility 
the senior gray albanys mayor died in september 1986 the 
will divides his shares among jimmy gray geoffrey gray and 
constance g greene who are also copublishers of the newspaper 
mrs greene and geoffrey gray first wanted to have the stock 
sold and the proceeds distributed among the heirs later they 
agreed to sell to their brother for 16250 per share if a 
committee of the board determined that the offer was fair the 
committee found that the offer was not adequate 
the deadline for taking action on the proposal was oct 1 board 
member neal ray who also serves as the companys attorney said 
the failure to conclude an agreement by the deadline meant that the 
estate could seek an outside buyer for the stock

actress roseanne barr and her husband have 
filed a 35 million federal racketeering lawsuit against the 
national enquirer and star tabloids over their publication of her 
love letters 
the suit was filed oct 2 under federal racketeering statutes 
charging copyright infringement conspiracy invasion of property 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
the suit seeks 10 million compensatory damages and 25 million

publications owner news america publishing inc 
miss barr and husband tom arnold are seeking relief under the 
federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act known 
as rico 
the racketeering activity according to the suit involves the 
enquirers alleged participation in a scheme to obtain the 
private papers and effects of celebrities by inducing and paying 
persons and entities to steal such information and transport it in 
interstate commerce 
the couple also seeks the return of miss barrs private 
written letters and outpourings of love and affection to arnold

defendants 
national enquirer editor iain calder said from his lantana 
fla office that he hadnt seen the suit and so couldnt respond 
to specific allegations 
any legal action against this publication under rico is so 
ridiculous that it is clear this is just another pathetic publicity 
stunt by roseanne calder said 
she is trashing the national enquirer but we are in good 
company a few weeks ago she was trashing the national anthem 
star editor dick kaplan said from tarrytown ny that he would 
have no comment because he hadnt seen the suit

the informer a newspaper that 
prints only arrest reports ran into trouble with its first issue 
when a man falsely linked to a cocaine bust was fired from his job 
publisher ray aden said he still believes the paper will be an 
important crimefighting tool but unfortunately some people 
might be hurt 
he was relying on his people to be accurate and one of them 
messed up said shawn exposito 23 fired from his 500aweek 
job as a carpet installer just a month after the birth of his third 
child it couldnt have come at a worse time 
aden promised a retraction and said he would do everything he 
could to help out exposito but that did not include an offer to 
make up for his lost income 
expositos boss at mampm floor co bert butler has tried to help 
by giving him a lesser job at half the pay until his previous 
position reopens butler already had hired someone else to replace 
his employee of eight years 
the informer correctly printed that exposito was arrested last 
month for driving with a suspended drivers license it also 
printed that he was arrested on a cocaine charge which jail 
records show is inaccurate 
butler saw the drug arrest item sept 28 and fired exposito the 
next day 
aden said he is still trying to determine how the mistake was 
made and is trying to find another job for exposito

a lawyer who disputed a charleston 
gazette editorial about his handling of a workers compensation 
case won a 375000 libel judgment against the newspaper oct 4 
the gazette said it would appeal 
raymond a hinerman claimed the may 20 1983 editorial damaged 
his reputation associated him with dishonest attorneys and held 
him up to ridicule among his peers 
his lawsuit said portions of the editorial were false and were 
published with the intent to injure the plaintiff 
the brooke county circuit court jury awarded hinerman 300000 
in punitive damages and 75000 in compensatory damages 
the newspaper said the editorial was based on reliable wire 
service and newspaper reports of a state supreme court appeal the 
case concerned a default judgment of 12000 that hinerman won 
against a coal miner who had refused to pay him for legal services 
the newspapers lawyer rudolph l ditrapano argued that the 
editorial did not contain errors cited by hinerman and said he was

the supreme court refused to kill a libel 
lawsuit stemming from advertisements comparing blue cross and blue 
shield services to those of a health industry competitor 
the court on oct 1 left intact a ruling that could send us 
healthcares libel allegations against blue cross and blue shield 
to a federal jury in philadelphia 
at issue was whether some libel cases involving commercial 
speech could be held to less stringent standards than others 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in reviving healthcares 
suit last march relaxed the rules for commercialspeech libel 
cases 
since 1964 public figures including most businesses suing 
for libel must prove that the suedover statements are false and 
were made with actual malice knowledge or reckless disregard 
of falsity 
private citizens suing for libel face a far less demanding 
burden having to prove that the statements are false and were made 
negligently 
in ruling on healthcares lawsuit the 3rd circuit court said 
the more stringent actual malice standard need not be used when 
the allegedly libelous statements were advertisements 
the appeals court overturned a ruling by us district judge 
marvin katz who had dismissed the suit

ruling that threw out jeffrey massons suit last year 
the appeals court ruling was criticized by some who said it 
recognized the right to fake quotes 
specifically the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled that 
public figures who sue for libel over allegedly altered quotes must 
show that the quotes are not even rational interpretations of 
what was said 
private citizens who sue for libel must prove only that the 
suedover statements are false and were made negligently but 
public figures who sue for libel must prove the statements are 
false and were made with actual malice knowledge or reckless 
disregard of falsity 
in dismissing massons suit the 9th circuit court said 
malice will not be inferred from evidence showing that the quoted 
language does not contain the exact words used provided that 
the fabricated quotations are either rational interpretations of 
ambiguous remarks made by the public figure or do not alter the 
substantive content of unambiguous remarks actually made by the 
public figure 
the appeals court did not rule on whether ms malcolm actually 
fabricated quotes attributed to masson

the supreme court agreed to resolve a dispute 
from arkansas over the power of states to tax cable television 
companies and subscribers 
the court said oct 1 it will review a ruling that arkansas may 
tax cable tv as long as it also imposes the levy on similar 
communication services such as the unscrambling of satellite 
signals 
with millions of dollars in tax revenue at stake the ruling was 
challenged in separate appeals by both the state and cable 
operators and subscribers 
arkansas in 1987 imposed its sales tax on cable tv service the 
law did not apply to those who own satellite dishes and subscribe 
to services that unscramble satellite signals 
also exempted from the tax were all newspaper sales and magazine 
subscription sales 
the arkansas supreme court ruled in february that the tax 
unlawfully discriminated against cable tv service because satellite 
service was excluded but the state court said it is permissible 
for the state to exclude the newspaper and magazine sales

persistent uncertainty about possible war in 
the persian gulf and fear of crude oil shortages sent retail gas 
prices upward an average 6 cents per gallon over the past two 
weeks an industry analyst says 
since the iraqi invasion of oilrich kuwait in early august the 
average price of gasoline nationwide has jumped 26 cents a gallon 
at the pump since the crisis began an international embargo has 
blocked all iraqi oil exports 
the sale of kuwaiti oil also was banned to prevent iraqi leader 
saddam hussein from making money on appropriated crude oil 
reserves increases in oil market prices were passed on to 
consumers quickly

nobody suggests malaysia is in 
danger of breaking up but the ties that bind its outermost states 
to the federation occasionally seem frayed 
rumbles of discontent from sabah and sarawak the territories 
across the south china sea in northern borneo are nothing new 
they are based on vast geographic economic and ethnic differences 
and on pure politics 
grumbling is usually loudest at election time some state 
politicians seek votes by accusing the central government of 
neglect and advocate more autonomy 
in july elections for the 48member sabah state assembly the 
ruling parti bersatu sabah made states rights its focus and was 
returned to power with 36 seats it demanded a larger share of 
federal revenue for sabah and a review of the agreement under which 
the state became part of malaysia in 1963 
four party supporters were arrested during the campaign for 
alleged involvement in a secessionist plot prime minister mahathir 
mohamad tried to cool antifederal rhetoric with the warning if 
this trend is followed in other states our nation will be split 
more than a month after the election information minister 
mohamed rahmat said sabah and sarawak had requested new talks on 
their status in the federation 
the state of the union is still intact mohamed told 
reporters in fact it is getting better we have survived as a 
nation for 27 years and both sarawak and sabah have progressed 
under one roof 
citing the merger of east and west germany and overtures between 
north and south korea he said the time is for unification not 
secession 
most of the problems are rooted in malaysias creation from 
assorted british territories in postcolonial southeast asia 
the 11 peninsular states of what was then malaya gained 
independence in 1957 six years later malaya merged with 
singapore sabah and sarawak to form malaysia 
brunei the oilrich sultanate nearly surrounded by sarawak 
declined an invitation to join 
singapore predominantly chinese was ousted in 1965 because its 
leaders were viewed as a threat to the political control of 
indigenous malays 
sabah and sarawak were granted concessions including control of 
immigration from the peninsula citizens of what is called 
peninsular malaysia need passports to enter the states 
they also counted on an intergovernmental committee to protect 
their interests in kuala lumpur it was supposed to convene every 
10 years to review progress of the outer states but has not met 
since 1973 
there is support for an igc meeting and maybe it will be 
held soon mohamed said 
officials in sabah and sarawak say their special status as 
cofounders of the federation was chipped away over the years each 
wants to be treated as one of three equal partners not one of 13 
states 
i believe the people in sabah and sarawak do not hate 
peninsular malaysians mohamed said they consider us as all in 
one family it is only the politicians 
the borneo states differ markedly from peninsular malaysia 
together they are larger than all 11 western states but their 
population is much smaller 
sarawak has 16 million people sabah has 14 million in a 
national total of 174 million sabahs population inlcudes more 
than 500000 immigrants from the philippines and indonesia most of 
them illegal 
islam is malaysias official religion but sabahs governing 
political party is led by christians 
most malaysians are ethnic malays and there is a sizable chinese 
minority sabah and sarawak have a variety of indigenous tribes 
many of which maintain traditional animistic beliefs 
sabah is one of the countrys richest states because of timber 
oil and natural gas sarawak prospers from exporting tropical 
hardwoods natural gas and pepper 
the two states keep only 5 percent of the revenue from their oil 
and gas exports as royalties and want an increase 
they retain all income from logging and largely ignore appeals 
from kuala lumpur to ban the export of whole logs in addition to 
conserving the tropical forests the federal government wants more 
domestic timber processing which would earn as much money from a 
lower export volume 
some experts say sabah will be logged out by the end of the 
century a report by the international tropical timber organization 
predicts the annual cutting rate in sarawak of more than 13 million 
cubic yards will deplete its remaining virgin forests within 11 
years

petro zeleniuch a ukrainian catholic 
priest held services in his village hut for 28 years covering the 
windows so the kgb could not see what was going on 
he was ordained secretly in 1961 by the outlawed greekrite 
church and tended to the spiritual needs of ukrainian peasants on 
the border with poland despite warnings beatings and arrests 
now he ministers legally traveling from village to village 
every sunday and performing pastoral duties during the week in 
jarovov and nearby towns grateful believers crowd around for a 
word or a touch after each twohour service 
less than a year since it was made legal again by order of 
president mikhail s gorbachev the ukrainian catholic church is 
trying to reclaim its confiscated property training new priests 
and benefiting from the rising tide of ukrainian nationalism 
the faithful number more than 45 million according to priests 
and catholic activists many of whom see the church as a key 
element in the movement for independence by the rich populous 
republic 
like other faiths in the soviet union it is expected to benefit 
from legislation approved in principle by the soviet parliament 
sept 26 that forbids government interference in religion 
in jarovov the catholic church is a 260yearold jewel made of 
wood painted harvest yellow and protected by a shiny new steel 
roof whose gleaming crosses stretch toward the sky 
sunday prayers are held behind the church not inside 
scaffolding fills the interior which is being restored and 
renovated 
it has been decades since the building was used as a church 
most recently it was a museum of atheism and religion said 
zeleniuchs daughterinlaw olga 
last year she said zeleniuch and some local men went to the 
communist party secretary demanded the keys and got them theirs 
was among the first successes of ukrainian catholics in winning 
back churches seized 44 years ago 
a greater victory was recorded aug 14 when authorities in lvov 
the main city of the western ukraine returned the baroque 18th 
century cathedral of st george after a year of agitation it was 
the seat of the churchs last metropolitan andrei sheptitsky who 
died in 1944 
the goldencolored cathedral complex and adjoining 
metropolitans palace was transferred in 1946 to the 
statecontrolled russian orthodox church which until then had only 
one church in the city of 770000 people 625 miles southeast of 
moscow 
now a catholic metropolitan is back in the cathedral aided by a 
few priests who formerly worked underground 
one of them the rev zenovi pavlish said he was a factory hand 
for 25 years and changed jobs whenever his bosses discovered his 
real vocation he conducted services in forests or private homes 
and is still getting used to wearing his robes in public 
an estimated 100000 faithful attended the cathedrals first 
catholic service aug 19 and in moscow the russian orthodox 
patriarch was not pleased alexei ii accused ukrainian catholics of 
seizing the cathedral violently and demanded it back 
ukrainian catholic priests deny any use of force 
the return of the cathedral has great meaning said the rev 
roman shafran assistant to the new metropolitan volodimir 
sterniuk it is a symbol that our church exists of its moral 
strength and authority 
pavlish said there will be no going back our nation was on 
its knees now it is standing up 
the ukrainian catholic church was the chief religion of the 
western ukraine a region historically under polish or 
austrohungarian rather than russian 
josef stalin who annexed the western ukraine at the beginning 
of world war ii banned the church in 1946 at about the same time 
his generals were liquidating anticommunist ukrainian partisans 
in the dictators eyes ukrainian catholicism was a bastion of 
nationalism all the more suspect because of its ties to the 
vatican 
some catholic churches were given to the tame russian orthodox 
hierarchy based in moscow others were turned into warehouses 
museums libraries or shops 
priests who did not go underground were arrested and deported to 
labor camps where many died 
beginning in 1987 under gorbachev some ukrainian catholic 
priests came into the open but the church was banned until last 
december gorbachev legalized it just before his historic meeting 
in rome with pope john paul ii 
today officially everything is normal zeleniuch said 
but in practice they still make things difficult for us 
the shortage of priests that is our misery said father 
muzychko an exiled ukrainian catholic official now able to visit 
from rome 
he said the church has only about 750 priests some responsible 
for 10 tp 15 villages and is training 500 more but the first 
ordinations are two years away 
ivan gel an activist in the independence movement rukh and 
deputy leader of the regional legislature said catholics have 
retrieved about 200 churches and want more he said catholics make 
up 70 to 80 percent of christians in the ukraine but have only 20 
to 30 percent of the churches 
these churches were built by the hands of catholics he 
said the russian orthodox church does not want to recognize our 
history 
a new ukrainian orthodox church autonomous from moscow 
complicates matters catholics claim it was established in part to 
compete with their faith 
in some cases three congregations catholic russian orthodox 
and ukrainian orthodox fight over the same church

there is an aspirin for the pain and suffering 
the white house and congressional budget negotiators have inflicted 
on themselves and that is to eliminate wasteful spending 
it is an option frequently ignored except by taxpayers who are 
widely accused of wanting lower taxes while simultaneously refusing 
to accept cuts in medicare social security and similar benefits 
but it is probably more accurate to ascribe to voters a logical 
goal that of cutting wasteful spending rather than the 
contradictory policy of which they have been accused that of lower 
taxes and more spending 
there is hardly a family that doesnt understand the need for 
cutting especially today with recession coming if not here and 
with unemployment rising they have been forced to retrench and 
live within their incomes 
industry has been forced to do the same to the extent that 
downsizing has become a fad word in the business lexicon even 
philanthropic groups have felt the pinch and have reluctantly 
limited their goals 
the same has been asked of government but seldom is there an 
answer 
in 1984 the presidents private sector survey on cost control 
popularly called the grace commission after its chairman j peter 
grace recommended 424 billion in cuts over a threeyear period 
last november the general accounting office found 150 billion 
in program waste fraud and financial mismanagement last spring 
the congressional budget office recommended reforms to yield 
savings of 60 billion in the first year 
as recently as last may the heritage foundation a conservative 
think tank offered a list of 130 billion in cuts that its 
researchers said would cause minimal damage 
some idea of why such cuts arent made came from that latest 
analysis by scott hodge federal budget analyst for the 
foundation he would ask congress to break an addiction to 
deceptive often deceitful porkbarrel spending 
to an aid packgge earlier this year for panama and nicaragua 
for example members of congress tacked on their own special 
interest expenditures for local domestic projects that had nothing 
to do with national interests 
hodge and his researchers cite examples of harmless 
expenditures such as financing a study of the causes of rudeness 
lying and cheating on tennis courts and one seeking to determine 
why people fall in love 
harmless in themselves perhaps so but not in the damaging 
lesson they send that spending is in and saving is out and that 
misusing other peoples money is acceptable so long as they remain 
unaware of it 
besides as members of congress themselves concede a little 
spending oft repeated adds up to a lot that lot can be 
especially crucial to the economy in a recession attended by 
unemployment and bankruptcies 
americans have been made especially aware of tax dangers from 
the lips of president bush whose comments have included the 
statement that when the government raises a dollar in revenues 
congress spends a dollar fifty 
perhaps critics of waste are saying voters arent refusing to 
accept the pain of an austerity budget so much as they are trying 
to tell congress that it must use public money wisely honestly and 
with restraint

christopher sinclairstevenson a courteous old 
etonian in the tough world of british publishing broke away to set 
up on his own after 28 years with one company and struck gold with 
his first book 
sinclairstevenson ltd sold 60000 copies of a life of 
everpopular charles dickens in less than two weeks at 1995 pounds 
3770 each the sales sent dickens to second place on the 
sunday times bestseller list behind a book on cricket 
but what shook the book trade was the large sum of 650000 
pounds nearly 13 million offered by the fledgling independent 
publisher to peter ackroyd an admired writer who tackled dickens 
after doing other literary lives some in novel form 
it was an unusually large amount of money but ackroyd has a 
good reputation and track record and the offer also covers a book 
he is writing about william blake the publisher said 
sinclairstevenson 51 talked in the office he set up with a 
staff of 10 in a charming kensington mews 
he launched his company and the dickens book sept 3 just over 
a year after leaving the respected hardback publishing house of 
hamish hamilton his only employer since he left cambridge 
university with a modern languages degree his last 15 years with 
the firm were spent as managing director 
he didnt like the changed atmosphere when the firm which had 
earlier been sold to the canadabased thomson group was sold again 
to penguin the giant paperback publisher 
from friends and contacts he raised 24 million pounds 45 
million to start his own company when authors whose books he 
edited found he was leaving they went with him including ackroyd 
sinclairstevenson is steering clear of paperback publishing 
and a large slice of ackroyds advance came from selling the 
paperback rights in dickens to other companies sales of the 
hardback should comfortably make up the balance he said 
the new publishers first catalog is half fiction and the rest 
mostly travel memoirs and contemporary history wellknown writers 
such as paul theroux an wilson and jk galbraith are on the 
list and of the 27 books 20 are by authors from his old 
employers 
he handled most of the hamish hamilton authors who were 
finalists over the years for the booker prize the literary event 
of the year in britain 
most people thought william boyd who was a finalist in 1982 
with an icecream war should have been nominated again this year 
for brazzaville beach which we submitted we will be in some 
difficulty next year deciding which three of our novelists to put 
in the publisher said 
publishing is big business total book sales in britain were 
worth 22 billion pounds 41 billion last year book exports 
amounted to a further 655 million pounds 12 billion 
the industry is dominated by about a dozen companies among 
them macmillan the oxford and cambridge university presses and 
harpercollins and news international which belong to media magnate 
rupert murdoch 
publishing has changed vastly from the days when it was 
considered a leisurely occupation for gentlemen revered imprints 
have disappeared while others cling to their identities in the 
embrace of multinationals and conglomerates 
i think publishers take over other publishers to stop other 
publishers taking them over when they become big they want to be 
strongly based everywhere sinclairstevenson said 
a big organization has clout in the marketplace it can afford 
expensive authors has more power in dealing with bookshops and a 
bigger presence in the publishing world he said 
corporate life is very different to that of an independent 
publisher i began to feel the imperatives in the penguin group 
were systems rather than books 
editors are concerned with publishing and selling but 
conglomerates keep looking at their internal affairs they work to 
dotted lines call meetings and tell people what to do their 
authors get missed out he said 
when i left in july 1989 a lot of the authors i was handling 
were my personal friends and i suppose they thought i was a good 
publisher and would do their future books well i think they felt 
that once id gone their connection with hamish hamilton ceased 
they wouldnt know anyone there 
writers are important sinclairstevenson said they lead 
rather lonely lives they are not going to an office every day and 
they need encouraging to write and to live as well i like to 
publish authors i know and like i find it difficult to publish 
authors i dont like 
he thinks the spate of mergers isnt good for publishing 
it concentrates too much power in too few hands narrows the 
choice for the author and reduces the contact between the author 
his agent and the publishers he said i think we did dickens 
as well as any conglomerate and possibly better because its our 
lifeblood 
we are hungrier he said we have no fat to live off

the fertile ukraine has fed the russian 
bear for centuries but not by choice and now the seeds of 
independence are sprouting again on its bountiful steppes 
not only did ukrainians remove the statue of lenin in front of 
the lvov opera house last month but they used jackhammers 
sledgehammers chisels and bare hands to erase every sign of its 
pedestal 
tens of thousands demonstrated against the communist party and 
the kremlin two weeks ago in kiev the ukrainian capital 
political leaders in lvov a western city where secessionist 
ferment is strong predict the breakup of the soviet union as early 
as spring then they say the ukraine will claim a place among the 
sovereign nations of europe 
processes are speeding up said physicist orest vloch 
leader in lvov of the independence group rukh which means the 
movement in ukrainian two months ago we could not even imagine 
lenins statue falling 
the ukraine is the second largest of the soviet unions 15 
republics 
it produces onequarter of the countrys food onethird of the 
nucleargenerated electricity and much of the gas oil and coal 
the chernobyl nuclear accident of april 1986 occurred in the 
ukraine 
lvov 625 miles southeast of moscow and just 45 miles from newly 
democratized poland already is firmly in the hands of 
nationalists the ukraines blueandwhite banner has replaced red 
soviet flags on public buildings except for the kgb headquarters 
although the ukrainian legislature declared sovereignty in 
principle july 16 it still must pass specific laws the democratic 
bloc outnumbered 32 by communists wants the ukraine to have its 
own currency military foreign and economic policy and counts on 
public pressure to make it possible 
our task in rukh is to give the declaration real meaning 
vloch said we can arouse people to fight for their rights 
ivan gel deputy speaker of the rukhdominated regional 
legislature in lvov said we want western countries to 
understand that in europe has arisen a country of 610000 square 
kilometers and 53 million people or about the same size as france 
it has a right to be independent 
we are in the center of europe and we were always european 
he said of the ukraine which stretches from poland and 
czechoslovakia in the west to the black sea 
during an interview in his apartment decorated with portraits 
of dead and living ukrainian heroes gel chided the west for 
continuing to support mikhail s gorbachev he described the soviet 
president as a representative of the old totalitarian system 
who was merely trying to save it 
in march elections all of lvov provinces 24 seats in the 
ukrainian legislature were won by rukh candidates it also won 
control of the regional legislature and the city council which 
authorized lenins removal on sept 14 
many in lvov are not eager for independence expecially those of 
polish or russian ancestry employees at the sputnik hotel said the 
lenin monument should have been left standing if only as a 
historical artifact 
valerij kubik leader of the proindependence ukrainian 
republican party in the central city of khmelnitskiy said during a 
visit to lvov that he favors independence but it is not possible 
yet 
he said attitudes change dramatically as one moves east in the 
ukraine 
in khmelnitskiy the political spirit is much weaker than in 
lvov he said in our area the soviet government existed for 
72 years and here only since 1939 a reference to the soviet 
occupation of the western ukraine then polish at the start of 
world war ii 
our most difficult problem is russification he said 
people of ukrainian nationality used to have no right to speak in 
their mother tongue and have not learned it 
even today in khmelnitsky he said there are only four 
schools in ukrainian here in lvov it is another matter with only 
a few in russian 
aside from loosely organized cossack rule three centuries ago 
the ukraine has had little history of independence beginning in 
the 19th century however nationalism flourished in the relatively 
tolerant political atmosphere of lvov then known as lemberg 
capital of austrian galicia 
traditionally lvov is the scientific cultural and 
historical center of the western ukraine and it influences the 
eastern part of the ukraine said maria bocharskaya who is 
active in human rights groups 
she said eastern ukrainians had an increasing feeling of 
historical identity and beamed at the memory of a gathering in 
august for the 500th anniversary of the first encampment of 
cossacks the legendary warriors of the steppes 
what spirit she said there were 50000 people and it 
all started with prayers 
mrs bocharskaya predicts the soviet union will disintegrate 
very soon maybe even by this spring 
there is absolutely the same feeling in the eastern and 
western ukraine she said in the east the people dont know the 
language yet but the spirit is the same as ours they want 
what we want freedom to be ourselves 
vloch agreed that from the economic political and social 
situation the eastern ukraine is ready for independence 
he said rukh was strongly nationalist but not blind to the 
interests of russians jews poles and other minorities 
defending the national interests does not interfere with 
other nationalities he said when we speak of nationalism now 
we mean we must try to obtain an independent state 
he said the ukraine was eager to cooperate with other soviet 
republics but without any imperial structures 
gel said the western countries should begin to think about 
their relations with us according to christian values the strong 
and the rich must help the poor and the helpless

editors note in america the group with the most health 
problems gets the least care these are the children of the poor 
in a corner of virginia has appeared a solution which some are 
likening to a miracle cure 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
everybody knows what an ounce of prevention 
is worth but the people in this ageless valley between the blue 
ridge and allegheny mountains are taking yesterdays adage a step 
further 
in todays vocabulary theyre betting that the bottom line on a 
pound of cure is that its also cost effective 
the result is that this valleys poor children up to age 8 
americas neediest have a medical home as the physicians here 
call it that means the children of parents who cant pay may 
nonetheless have a regular doctor of their own choosing whose 
office they can visit regularly for scheduled shots and checkups 
and for unexpected ailments even in the middle of the night even 
on weekends just like the wealthy kids 
these are the children who live below the poverty line and thus 
qualify for medicaid but also children of the working poor who 
dont qualify but still cant afford doctor bills and have no 
medical insurance 
they include for example gerald and roberta mccraw both in 
their 30s who have 5monthold twins angela and amanda and three 
other children under 7 a third generation of children raised in 
poverty 
life was tough enough when gerald was earning minimum wage for a 
37hour week as a nursing home orderly last winter he came down 
with rheumatoid arthritis he worked when he could through spring 
then not at all now he cant even lift his children for a hug 
when one of the kids came down with something a cough an 
earache they went to a hospital emergency room or the twiceaweek 
free clinic or maybe a public health office though it closes at 5 
pm now they go to a doctors office an experience most american 
children take for granted 
i still dont believe this is happening to us roberta was 
saying the other day jiggling a baby girl in her lap i cant 
believe my children are going to grow up healthy have good 
teeth she turned the baby to face her and held her close the 
mothers eyes moistened 
chip is a miracle she whispered i used to not believe in 
miracles but chip is a miracle 
its baptismal name was the comprehensive health investment 
project at age 2 it is now known throughout the valley simply as 
chip it is a cooperative effort of private doctors working with 
the support and machinery of existing social welfare agencies and 
health departments if affording the same level of health care to 
the needy and affluent alike is not a miracle no one in americas 
medical or social establishments seems to know of any other program 
just like it 
what it is says cabell brand chairman of virginias board 
of health is the result of community action the real question 
is can it work elsewhere the answer is of course it can 
no the real question is who pays 
except for some startup cash from a foundation chip runs on an 
artful blend of money for a whole alphabet of programs already 
funded women infants and children wic aid to families with 
dependent children afdc medicaid and others 
suppose a child has a hearing loss and a speech delay says 
peggy balla a public health nurse who became chips director is 
that a medical problem or an educational problem or both you have 
to cut through these narrow areas of concern 
one program for instance covered new mothers until a year 
after the birth that rule had to be changed to shift money to chip 
during the childs critical first year of development a 
bookkeeping problem the money was there all along 
from its first stages of development chips healthy growth 
appears to be ordained 
were already committed says the health boards brand to 
starting chip in four more areas next year eight more the year 
after that 12 more the following year then it will cover all of 
virginia there is no reason for it to stop at the state line 
indeed delegations from 16 other states have visited roanoke to 
have a look a statewide program says brand is in a better 
position to become a line item in the state budget than is a local 
budget 
the 1990 census reveals that 128 percent of americans have 
incomes below the official poverty level of 12675 for a family of 
four a rate worse than 20 years ago and that the children 
continue to be the poorest of the poor more than one in five 
american children 225 percent live in poverty 
it makes no sense said douglas pierce a roanoke 
pediatrician that the group with the most health problems has 
the least access to health care 
that bitter irony continued to nag pierce after he had 
confronted it for three years as president of the virginia 
pediatric society 
medicaid wasnt getting the job done he said here in 
roanoke 42 percent of the people who qualified for medicaid werent 
using it they didnt know they could or didnt understand how to 
go about it 
for whatever reason it didnt much matter because only about 
one doctor in 10 would accept medicaid patients anyhow they would 
give time at the twiceaweek free clinic and make other 
contributions but they wouldnt put up with the medicaid 
frustrations the paperwork the unkept appointments all that goes 
with it that left nearly half the medicaid money unspent and the 
rest spent inefficiently 
and then there were the working poor not sufficiently indigent 
to qualify for medicaid said pierce what about them 
one day in early 1987 pierce saw in the paper that cabell brand 
of roanoke had been appointed to the state board of health 
i knew cabell i had treated his children pierce said so 
i picked up the phone and said cabell something has to be 
done 
pierce called the right person 
cabell brand is known throughout virginia as just that someone 
who gets things done 
he was an early volunteer in lyndon johnsons war on poverty in 
1964 he organized the roanoke valleys community action program 
total action against poverty tap which grew into 29 agencies 
tailored as he says to turning the needy into productive 
citizens of the roanoke valley 
tap is no patchwork of services as is sometimes the case it is 
a coordinated movement tailored to the needs and ways of the 
225000 people of the roanoke valley after one generation it can 
point to a long list of gains in wresting families and individuals 
from the whirlpool of poverty

tap has become a model for antipoverty efforts across the 
nation three of its programs have been lifted whole to other 
states another which brought safe drinking water and toilets 
first to rural homes in the roanoke valley then all of virginia 
eventually moved to washington as a national program 
chip became taps 30th agency it fit right in 
to get it going brand brought together doctors public health 
professionals lawyers tap veterans state and local officials 
everyone we thought could help he said 
we identified the problem and worked out a plausible solution 
the state health department gave us 118000 and we were on our 
way 
they started the program june 16 1988 with pierce the five 
pediatricians in practice with him and 100 patients it went well 
after a year they grew to 300 patients and more doctors that went 
even better six months later the state upped its ante to 200000 
and the wk kellogg foundation of michigan granted 15 million to 
expand further last august kellogg impressed came up with 
another 23 million to spread chip across virginia 
now chip has more than 900 patients enrolled all six of the 
valleys childrens dentists participate and all but three of its 
19 family doctors and 14 pediatricians chip turned down the three 
because they didnt cover on nights and weekends 
we have a ways to go said peggy balla the chip director 
we have identified 4800 potential patients and hope to get them 
all we get more efficient every day weve worked out a lot of 
bugs our computer programs and all our experience will be helpful 
in the replication of chip in other areas 
one of the bugs was getting prescriptions filled the public 
health office which fills them cutrate closes at 5 pm the 
valleys largest drugstore chain now provides 24hour service at 
even lower prices another bug doctor appointments missed for lack 
of transportation a church donated a van 
thats what community action is all about said cabell brand 
its the key to the whole program 
the chip staff includes six public health nurses and six 
outreach workers they work as teams visiting each patient 
regularly at home case management an essential of the whole 
scheme each team has a caseload of about 150 which they agree is 
too many but will improve with more staff 
the nurse has a copy of the same records the doctor keeps she 
sees that his orders are followedmedication given appointments 
kept the main complaints doctors had about the habits of medicaid 
patients 
just convincing the parents that they really do have a doctor 
they can call any time they have a question and persuading them to 
do it even in the middle of the night may be the hardest job of 
all said one nurse connie willet 
but watching the way they light up when they finally come to 
realize they are included in the health care system which most of 
us take for granted is really satisfying sometimes i think their 
newfound self esteem is the best medicine of all 
willets outreach worker teammate darlene brown was able to 
come up with a second bed when roberta mccraw had twins has helped 
her find diapers in an emergency as well as food and clothes the 
five little mccraws also are regular patrons of chips free lending 
library not books toys 
case workers tend to get personally interested in chip families 
one mccraw child now has a good winter coat that darlene browns 
own daughter outgrew another has a coat formerly worn by a child 
of teammate connie willet 
chips doctors get paid at the medicaid rate if the patient 
doesnt quite qualify for medicaid the same rate applies 
qualification in virginia is the same as the federal minimum of 135 
percent of the poverty level but chip stretches that to 150 percent 
to take in the working poor doctors say it covers about 70 percent 
of their regular fees 
but chip does the billing relieves the doctors of medicaid 
paperwork and further makes life easier by sending along with each 
new chip patient a medicalhistory questionnaire already completed 
by the case nurse not to mention seeing to it that his 
instructions are followed and appointments kept 
in the doctors waiting room or in the treatment room 
theres no way to tell a chip patient from any other when its 
time to pay the parent shows a chip card and thats that 
preventive medicine shots checkups what the doctors call 
well care are like fire prevention obviously beneficial but 
hard to measure in dollars how much in future medical bills will 
chip save by giving children a healthy start the childrens 
defense fund a national group says the annual saving is 10 
percent health insurance companies with one eye on that huge 
group of uninsured is keeping the other eye on chip 
we have a chance to do some blowaway things here it seems to 
me said john berry head of blue crossblue shield in virginia 
blue cross has supported chip from the beginning completely 
outfitting the chip office in roanoke with furniture and equipment 
one major financial effect of chip is apparent right now from a 
recent survey of 10000 childrens visits to the roanoke memorial 
hospital emergency room 
it found that nearly half 46 percent were between 3 pm and 
midnight and that fewer than 15 percent were justifiable 
emergency room visits according to dr preston boggess director 
of pediatric education 
in an emergency room with no records of the patient 
available you have to practice defensive medicine boggess said 
that means extensive tests and lab work to cover all the 
possibilities 
they are mostly unnecessary always costly and take time from 
real emergencies but some people have no place else to take a sick 
child 
roberta mccraw has 
the baby was fussing and running a fever and i was scared to 
death she said 
i had never called my doctor at night and didnt know whether 
i should maybe just go ahead to the emergency room 
but i called and he said bring her in 
it wasnt my doctor but was one in the same building it as 
his turn to work that night 
he examined her and looked at her records and in a minute 
said mrs mccraw amandas teething take her home shell be 
just fine 
and she was

editors note its a temple of knowledge like no other a 
soaring storehouse of information mindboggling in scope a library 
seeking to gather everything known by all cultures the library

no other library in the world can come as close

you can get mad at congress across the street 
or the supreme court next door or the white house down the avenue 
but you can hardly get mad at the library of congress 
it is smaller than almost any arm of government yet mightier 
than the pentagon richer than the treasury and just plain bigger 
than all of us 
here behind the commanding bronze doors along the endless 
whispering stacks in the reverent hush of the reading rooms under 
the ornate statues and soaring mosaics here more than in any other 
single place on earth reside the collective knowledge and wisdom of 
humanity this is the tip of mans reach so far 
an extraordinary place a library a temple a museum a rich 
mans attic 
socrates is a tenant here so is groucho marx so are johannes 
brahms and jelly roll morton george washington and adolf hitler 
albert einstein and donald duck 
browsing you might care to see thomas jeffersons rough draft 
of the declaration of independence or harry houdinis postcard to 
his mother the gutenberg bible or weird tales among the pulp 
magazines maps used by sailors before columbus or maps of the back 
side of the moon or maps of the distribution of blackowned 
businesses in new york city 
a handbill offering a 300 reward for the return of three 
runaway negro boys albert sam and bailey albert being the 
one with whiskers and sam the one with a scar over his left eye 
about 35 years old 
you might also want to see abe lincolns handwritten draft of 
the emancipation proclamation that freed the slaves maybe albert 
sam and bailey too or a summerian tablet written 2040 years 
before christ or the johnny carson show taped last night 
altogether a place of boggling scope unique in the world 
begun 190 years ago by a poor new country that couldnt know what 
it was getting into the hope was that the library would enable 
statesmen to be correct in their investigations and by a becoming 
display of erudition and research give a higher dignity and 
brighter luster to truth 
whether congress has added luster to truth or even a semigloss 
is an open question but the library of congress did its part and 
now is a world capital of superlatives 
the most books 20 million in the most languages 470 the 
most maps 3500000 the largest law library the most complete 
global collection of government documents the most stradivari 
instruments five the most flutes 1600 including frederick 
the greats the most motion pictures 100000 the most 
television programs 80000 including youll be relieved to 
know one of chinese cajun cooking and the complete speeches of 
fidel castro 
more than a library this is a massive multimedia storehouse of 
yesterday and today and tomorrow 
its been said that the only crystal ball man has is a 
rearview mirror says james h billington the librarian of 
congress here in this place we have the widest angle rearview 
mirror in the world 
the mirror grew that wide because this library unlike other 
national libraries belonged to a nation of immigrants to a past 
of many languages cultures and histories and this nation unlike 
others declared the pursuit of happiness an inalienable right 
we must seek the whole experience whatever has filled the 
consciousness of americans past and present said daniel 
boorstin former librarian in the united states the pursuit of 
happiness is everybodys business and any american institution 
which forgets that is failing in its mission 
even at the start with only 3000 volumes down the hall from 
congress for which a member would leave the floor to get proof 
of my assertions this library housed more than the predictable 
volumes of history law and government it also had current english 
plays poetry and novels 
from that beginning it grew to a truly international library 
seeking to gather everything known by all cultures it now has 
5 million books in english and 15 million in foreign languages it 
has more volumes of russian and japanese literature than exist 
anywhere else outside of those countries 
it has charles dickens walking stick and the contents of 
lincolns pockets the day he died including an unexplained 
confederate 5 bill it has hitlers last library in that bunker in 
berlin and the last to console czar nicholas in the winter palace 
in petersburg 
it has the papers of 23 presidents sigmund freud and danny kaye 
and the personal photo album of herman goering it has american 
folk ballads recorded in jails remote mountain villages and indian 
pueblos and franz lizsts manuscript of his first piano concerto 
with his changes pasted in with paper flaps

emboldened by its landlord to acquire all library materials 
currently published throughout the world which are of value to 
scholarship the library of congress has grown to three buildings 
named after jefferson adams and madison the great hall and the 
main reading room of jefferson are closed for restoration work 
that leaves 22 reading rooms 
madison alone is the largest library building in the world and 
among the behemoths in this town ranks third in size behind the 
pentagon and the fbi every room is wired for television and 
computer data transmission billington is pushing a program to make 
this a library without walls and to share its materials 
electronically with libraries around the country 
congress remains its first priority nine hundred specialists 
out of a total staff of 5000 work exclusively for the 
congressional research service which is described as the biggest 
think tank in creation they may not take calls from any other 
branch of government be it the white house or supreme court the 
rest of the libary is open to all even the president 
the specialists supply senators and representatives with cost 
projections pro and con studies legislative analyses and answers 
to a multitude of questions 
who is this saddam hussein how much oil do we import from iraq 
how many americans are buried in flanders field asked during 
debate on the flag amendment answer 368 what is the 
significance of the maltese falcon asked by a member about to meet

the original library of congress was destroyed at the tender age 
of 14 when the british burned the capitol in 1814 school kids are 
rarely told that american troops did the same thing to the canadian 
parliament and library the year before 
in any case congress needed a library and tom jefferson in 
retirement with no pension needed money he sold congress his 
library one of the best outside europe 6487 volumes for 23950 
they came bumping over the pitted roads of virginia in 10 
horsedrawn wagons 
jefferson was the librarys first hero the second was lincolns 
choice of librarian a dynamo with the catchy name of ainsworth 
rand spofford he yearned for oceans of books and rivers of 
information 
he got himself a tidal wave by persuading congress to move the 
copyright office from interior to the library henceforth anyone 
claiming a copyright on any book map chart play music 
engraving cut print photograph or negative thereof had to send 
two copies to the library you can get a lot of free books etc 
that way and the library did and does 
books etc were soon spilling over into the halls closets 
basement and committee rooms of congress the library desperately 
needed its own building 
what it got in 1897 was one of uncle sams most lavish 
productions a temple of culture for an adolescent nation still 
growing strong and rich and showing off fiftytwo leading artists 
and 20 sculptors and tons of majestic marble from around the world 
were used to show that uncle could rise above materialism 
as a result demosthenes emerson goethe franklin macauley 
dante and many others emerge larger than life the main reading 
room rises 125 feet to a magnificent dome ornamented with 
seashells griffins cherubs and garlands the ceilings of the 
great hall are done in stained glass 23carat gold leaf marble

elalamein egypt ap they were young soldiers far from 
home huddled in desert sands waiting for the nighttime sky to 
explode 
the last time some of them would ever look at their watches was 
939 pm oct 23 1942 in one minute the wails of bagpipes would 
summon the guns of bernard law montgomerys 8th army the desert 
rats and the final battle at elalamein would begin 
such abombardment had not been seen since world war i what 
followed was one of historys great tank battles along egypts 
barren but beautiful northern coast 
how many died to turn the tide of german victories nobody 
knows but after elalamein it was the allied forces marching 
forward after elalamein adolf hitlers dreams of world conquest 
began to sour 
lance barnard a former deputy prime minister of australia 
served with the 9th australian division the diggers who took the 
brunt of field marshal erwin rommels fury at the end of 
elalameins final battle 
each generation seems to produce another dictator and somebody 
has to go out and stop him barnard said 
twelve hundred diggers are among the 7354 men of the combined 
british commonwealth forces buried at elalamein they proved that 
germanys seemingly invincible rommel the desert fox and his 
famous afrika korps could be beaten after all 
six days after the allied victory on nov 4 british prime 
minister winston churchill gave elalamein its place in world war 
ii history this is not the end it is not even the beginning of 
the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning 
patience would prove him right the ordeal of stalingrad was 
then only beginning american marines were digging in at 
guadalcanal and dday the beginning of the end still was almost 
two years away 
historians debate whether elalamein was the most crucial battle 
of the war but none ignores what happened here 
after sweeping through libya axis forces under rommel sped 
along the only road on northern egypts coastline toward cairo the 
suez canal and the rich oil fields of persia they could smell 
victory 
allied commander montgomery had other ideas he sent escape 
vehicles to the rear and told his troops if alamein is lost 
egypt is lost if we cannot stay at alamein alive we will stay 
there dead 
the cost of winning and losing the battles of elalamein which 
raged off and on from july until november 1942 was staggering 
dead still lie in unfound desert graves but the number of 
casualties on both sides has been estimated at 65000 the allies 
suffered 13500 dead and wounded half the forces of germany and 
italy were killed wounded or captured 
the opposing forces were uneven montgomery had 11 divisions 
about 210000 men he had 1200 tanks more than 1000 field and 
medium guns adequate fuel and ammunition and a short line of 
communications to his home base in cairo 
rommel commanded four german and eight italian divisions and 
some independent units he had no more than 108000 men and 600 
tanks but plenty of artillery also he relied on 5 million mines 
planted in the 50milewide elalamein bottleneck between the 
mediterranean sea and the quicksand of the qattara depression his 
fatal flaws were the lack of fuel and a steady supply line 
the battle of elalamein should have been a showpiece for tank 
warfare it wasnt tanks broke down the tinny italian version 
was nicknamed selfpropelled coffin and the qattara to the 
south prevented brilliant manuevering 
montgomery lost 600 tanks about the number rommel had when the 
battle began and by nov 2 rommel was fighting with only 30 
in his diary rommel lamented the battle rivers of blood were 
spilled over a miserable strip of land which in normal times even 
the poorest arab would never have bothered about 
todays elalamein is not much better but its stilled 
battlefields a military museum and monuments of the famous battles 
beckon visitors to make the fourhour trek from cairo 
each year since 1978 individual countries have put aside 
differences to honor the fallenworld war ii desert fighters of all 
sides at observances on the sunday nearest the oct 23 battle 
anniversary the service attended by hundreds of diplomats 
veterans and wellwishers rotates among the commonwealth cemetery 
and the german and italian memorials 
this years is oct 21 at the italian monument atop a hillside 
overlooking the mediterranean 
elalameins newest memorial is a simple but poignant obelisk 
honoring the australian diggers the 20foottall monument of 
locally quarried limestone and australian granite stands before the 
commonwealth cemetery and its thousands of allied dead 
the monument was dedicated in the spring of 1989 and for the 
australians it was long overdue 
barnard the former deputy prime minister and everard baillieu 
of melbourne a gunner severely wounded at elalamein spearheaded 
the campaign for a monument to honor their fallen comradesinarms 
its such an emotional experience for me to go back to 
alamein it was the place we stopped rommels advance forced him 
to go back leave north africa barnard said by telephone from 
melbourne he has made the pilgrimage four times 
the first visit i made i was looking at the graves of my 
comrades the graves of my friends each time i come i believe more 
and more that victory was made possible because of the efforts of 
the 9th division 
melbourne attorney frank minotti another veteran of the 9th 
has written a division history he wrote that until the obelisk 
no one visiting the cemetery would find anything to tell them 
what part the australians played in those famous battles and in 
what circumstances those in the cemetery gave their lives 
there are guest registers at the memorials for the commonwealth 
german and italian soldiers few leave elalamein without shedding 
a tear 
last july 18 australian margaret gillespie visited the 
commonwealth cemetery my brother jim always remembered by his 
family she wrote 
david and myrna mcdonell of brisbane may there never be cause 
for such a sad place

editors note he was an american newspaperman who went to 
japan 100 years ago to teach english and fell in love with the 
country in the following years lafcadio hearn wrote extensively 
about japan and its people and admirers say he was one of the few 
westerners who truly understood the culture while his work is 
little known in the west today the japanese have never forgotten 
him 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
lafcadio hearn gazed out through his 
cedarframed window contemplated a lotus pond surrounded by irises 
and mosscovered rocks and listened to the cicadas buzzing on a 
plum branch 
he turned to his waisthigh desk and put pen to paper he wrote 
a melancholy prophecy that is still valid 100 years after he 
arrived in this small lakeside city in izumo the mythical province 
of the gods 
already a multitude of gardens more spacious and more 
beautiful than mine have been converted into rice fields or bamboo 
groves he wrote and the quaint izumo city touched at last by 
some longprojected railway line will swell and change and 
grow commonplace and demand these grounds for the building of 
factories and mills 
not from here alone but from all the land the ancient peace 
and the ancient charm seem doomed to pass away for impermanency is 
the nature of all things more particularly in japan 
the greekirish journalist from the united states had fallen in 
love with japan although he became increasingly ambivalent as it 
modernized and while hearn has largely slipped into obscurity in 
the west the japanese have never forgotten him particularly in 
this centennial year 
admirers say he was one of the few westerners who truly 
understood japanese culture possibly because he considered it 
superior in many ways to the industrialized west 
he loved the ordinary life the daily life of the japanese 
people says kenji zenimoto professor of intercultural studies 
at shimane university in matsue and president of the national 
lafcadio hearn society 
elementary school pupils around the country still read hearns 
japanese ghost stories and highschool students practice english 
with his evocative travel writings university students study his 
philosophical essays and scholars argue passionately over his 12 
major books and hundreds of articles and letters 
the largest celebration of his centennial began in matsue on 
aug 30 exactly 100 years after hearn arrived at age 40 to teach 
english in the citys middle school 
hearn wrote about the town in the chief city of the province 
of the gods part of glimpses of an unfamiliar japan 
published in 1894 
here between a lake and lagoon near the japan sea about 390 
miles west of tokyo one can see that much about japan has changed 
and much remains eternal 
part of hearns garden remains including the pond and ancient 
pines but other houses now encroach upon the northern portion 
where wild flowers and grasses once extended to the wooded hills 
far beyond 
the lafcadio hearn memorial museum displays hearns desk the 
shell he blew when he wanted his pipe lit his glasses and socks 
and even a lock of his hair preserved in a stone monument 
there are displays which tell of hearns japanese wife their 
four children and his teaching posts elsewhere in japan including 
imperial university in tokyo 
next door is the lotuspond garden and the house where hearn 
lived after his romance with japan turned into marriage although 
he left matsue in november 1891 he was to stay in japan until he 
died in 1904 
he wed setsu koizumi the daughter of an impoverished samurai 
family became a japanese citizen and a buddhist and adopted the 
name by which he is known to most japanese today yakumo koizumi 
yakumo which means eight clouds is a poetic version of izumo 
as a child hearn had been virtually abandoned by his irish 
father and greek mother after working as a reporter in cincinnati 
new orleans new york and the west indies he thought he had 
finally found a peaceful home in old japan 
but japan was in the throes of modernization begun in the 1868 
meiji revolution and just as marriages occasionally succumb to 
disenchantment hearn increasingly found fault with japan 
historian kaoru sekita a hearn scholar at waseda university in 
tokyo says hearn predicted that japan could never successfully 
adopt some western ideas particularly democratic political 
processes hearn thought the modes of japanese human relations 
had not fundamentally changed since mythological times sekita 
says 
hearns collection of essays written shortly before he died 
also discusses the problems that arise from japans emphasis on 
group loyalty over individual enterprise hearn warned of a rise 
of new power in japan an oligarchy of wealth that would 
enslave the people 
hearn is not universally admired in japan some critics say his 
romantic portrayal of old japan perpetuates the myth that japan is 
unique a misconception they say still keeps japan from 
participating fully in the international community others condemn 
his work as a defense of ultraconservatism 
lots of people who love hearn today are nostalgic about the 
old japan says yuzo ota associate professor of history at 
mcgill university in montreal they are modernized intellectuals 
who like his romanticized picture of japan they feel threatened by 
their own mixed identity 
hearn didnt have a simple love affair with japan but a 
complicated lovehate relationship ota says 
the accepted view that hearn loved japan is based on 
suppression of evidence in hearns letters to friends and other 
scholars he says 
zenimoto says some of hearns letters were cut for publication 
to remove passages critical of japan including some that 
castigated its rigid bureaucratic military and educational 
systems also cut were some of hearns wry observations about sex 
in japan which was more open in the late 1800s than it is now he 
says 
zenimoto has written to about 10 us libraries with extensive 
holdings of hearn letters in an attempt to compile a definitive 
collection he and his assistant yuko kawauchi also are working 
on a hearn catalog that will list everything written by and about 
him so far they have listed 1900 items and have an estimated 
7000 to go 
hearns 28yearold greatgrandson bon koizumi curator of the 
hearn memorial museum prepared a special collection for the 
festival it includes manuscripts classroom notes of hearns 
students and englishlanguage textbooks he prepared for his wife 
and children 
zenimoto ota and koizumi were among a dozen scholars 
participating in the fiveday festival which included 
presentations on hearns newspaper stories on macabre events in 
cincinnati the effect of hearns irish roots on his work hearns 
and other westerners interpretations of shinto japans indigenous 
religion and hearns ghost stories 
lafcadio hearn was an ideal foreigner to understand japan but 
he also understood cultural shock and the culture gap zenimoto 
says we must understand more minutely his life but we must not 
idolize him

editors note when a woman goes to prison often it is her 
family that suffers the most and here in a remote corner of west 
virginia near the federal prison for women at alderson there is a 
group that cares at the alderson hospitality house friends and 
loved ones of women behind bars can find food and lodging and a

once a month joe gump leaves his home in 
bloomingdale mich and drives all night to visit his wife here in 
the allegheny mountains of rural west virginia 
gump is a 62yearold retired chemical engineer and businessman 
his wife jean gump is a 63yearold inmate at the 
minimumsecurity federal prison camp of alderson serving eight 
years for helping trash some missile silos in missouri during an 
antinuclear protest in 1986 
as a result of his monthly visits gump has found a home away 
from home in this remote town of 1000 people where the federal 
prison which holds about 800 women is the biggest industry 
hes a regular at the privately funded alderson hospitality 
house which opened in 1977 to provide lodging and meals for 
friends and families of prisoners the first of its kind in the 
nation 
the threestory white house built in 1889 as a boarding house 
has 11 guest rooms and two bathrooms to house up to 35 people 
including children it is operated by dee and john vodicka strong 
advocates of prisoners rights 
you put someone in prison to punish them for a crime but 
youre really punishing the people they leave behind says joe 
gump 
in their case thats a lot of people joe and jean gump raised 
12 children 
and theyre the kind of people the vodickas want to help 
these families are us given the same circumstances mrs 
vodicka says that saying there but for the grace of god go 
i is so true we learn that every weekend 
most of the inmates at the alderson prison are blacks or 
hispanics from big cities most serving time for drug offenses or 
tax evasion faye pollard an assistant to the warden estimates 
that 60 percent of them are mothers 
what cost is prison wreaking on the children mrs vodicka 
asks what is their future fifteen or 20 years down the line 
that anger is going to need to be handled 
the vodickas feel most of the prisoners should be sentenced to 
home confinement work release and drug rehabilitation 
i think the vast majority of women here could be let out today 
with no effect on society vodicka says there are few women up 
here who have committed heinous crimes like you read about they 
have offended society by breaking laws but they could have been 
diverted short of prison 
she cites the gump case 
jean gump and four friends entered a nuclear missile site at 
knob noster mo on good friday 1986 and attacked the silos with 
sledgehammers she poured her own blood on the silo and then the 
five waited 45 minutes for the police to arrive and arrest them 
after jean went to prison joe got involved with civil 
disobedience he used the same tools and banners that jean used 
when he staged his own protest in 1987 on the day the atomic bomb 
was dropped on hiroshima 
he got a different judge and was sentenced to two years in 
prison 
but alderson also has been home to some notorious offenders 
including lynette squeaky fromme and sandra good disciples of 
charles manson convicted in the sharon tate murders and sarah 
jane moore fromme and moore tried to assassinate president gerald 
ford just 17 days apart 
moore and fromme were transferred to other prisons after they 
tried to escape and are serving life sentences good was paroled in 
1985 
john vodicka 42 is no stranger to prisons he worked as a 
chaplain for the san francisco bay area county jails as a prison 
rights advocate in new orleans and in a program for the homeless in 
atlanta before moving to west virginia 
alderson house has a 26000 budget and receives no federal 
funding vodicka says about half the money comes from guests and 
the remainder from private or church donations 
there are few frills 
none of us receives a salary practically all of it goes back 
into the house for upkeep and utilities vodicka says food and 
maintenance are the big items 
furniture is donated by churches and individuals guests often 
bring food instead of money 
visiting children play with the vodicka children gabriel 5 
and luke 2 and samuel born sept 12 
the large kitchen table has several highchairs around it 
colorful alphabet magnets an arms length away on the 
refrigerator are a big draw to the children who like to spell out 
their names and leave messages 
the vodickas share the chores volunteers frequently live with 
them 
the vodickas are the third couple to run the house dick dieter 
and maggie louden opened the hospitality house in 1977 basing 
their philosophy on the roman catholic worker movement of the 1930s 
and 1940s the movement emphasized a simple lifestyle based on 
pacifism and helping those in need 
after another couple ran the house for two years the vodickas 
took over in 1986 
just to the right of the houses front door is the office from 
which the vodickas coordinate guest lists and compile three 
newsletters that promote their views against the death penalty and 
for prisoners rights they live in two private rooms behind the 
office 
now the vodika family is looking for someone to take over the 
house with their new addition to the family they are outgrowing 
the two small rooms 
every time the house has need someone or something it has 
come through mrs vodicka says

robert urich best known as a streetwise 
detective moves away from the urban battleground in a new tv 
comedy series american dreamer he plays a modern philosopher 
in a small town 
the nbc show offers a mixture of humor introspection 
remembrances and fantasy focusing on urich who portrays a former 
network journalist seeking a new life after his wife is killed by a 
terrorist while they are on assignment together 
the tv reporter quits his highpaying highprofile job to move 
his son and daughter to a small town to write a weekly 
humaninterest column his new assistant played by carol kane 
says human interest oh you mean fluff each episode becomes 
a meandering odyssey as he explores his innermost thoughts en route 
to arriving at his column 
the way he thinks about things is the nut of the show urich 
says in an interview at his home on the edge of the hollywood 
hills the writing of a column can be a catalyst for him to 
explore some personal experience the column is his life and his 
life is the column 
in a novel a writer can take a chapter to examine a 
characters feelings we can do it in a snap by having him step 
into limbo the stage suddenly goes black except for the spotlight 
on him were experimenting with different lighting techniques the 
limbo is a chance for us to not complete scenes but to let him 
explain what happened or recreate a scene from his past 
despite more than a decade in toughguy roles urich sees 
american dreamer as a return to his roots 
i started out on the straw hat circuit doing father of the 
bride and all that stuff he says when i came to la the 
first thing i did was bob amp carol amp ted amp alice i was told it 
was comedy and its difficult you have to read i said wait 
thats what i do for a living then i was in soap and tabitha 
so its familiar yet different 
the way they work here is amazing you dont have a finished 
script when you start out at least 80 percent of its rewritten 
its an exploration by the actors and writers the writers listen 
and watch and finetune it finally by the end of the week youve 
got it down when the audience comes in its like opening night 
the writers and producers dress up send flowers and come in ready 
to have a good time 
the shows from gary david goldbergs ubu productions which 
last did family ties 
of his past comedies urich may be best remembered as the sexy 
tennis pro whose dalliances and murder got soap off to a 
rousing start in 1977 
he was a uniformed police marksman in swat in 197576 
but turned detective in vega in 1978 it lasted three years 
then came gavilan in which he played a sort of waterlogged 
secret agent it lasted about three episodes spenser for 
hire based on robert parkers brooding brainy brawny detective 
also lasted three years 
theres been a lot of talk about a spenser movie urich 
says 
spenser for hire was filmed on location in boston and urich 
moved his family back from boston only a year ago to concentrate on 
tv movie projects 
he played a texas ranger in the acclaimed miniseries lonesome 
dove and a convicted wife killer in blind faith during the

he named his sailboat season three 
i bought it with thirdseason money he says my familys 
not into sailing it got to be too expensive id just go down and

whether he wants to or not tony goldwyn seems 
destined to become a movie star 
hes got the looks dark blond curly hair iceblue eyes and a 
slightly offcenter smile 
hes got the luck playing the yuppie wall street villain in 
ghost the surprise movie hit of the summer a romantic fantasy 
that bested beatty swamped schwarzenegger and even wiped out 
willis 
hes got the training nearly a decade of stage and television 
work including studying two years at the london academy of music 
and dramatic art and playing half dozen summers at the williamstown 
festival in massachusetts 
hes got the pedigree descended from a famous hollywood family 
the 30yearold goldwyn also has a levelheaded sense of self in 
a business where sudden success unreality and hyperbole rule the 
day 
i realize acting is a profession and i want to be in it for 
the rest of my life he says a lot of the roles i was offered 
after ghost were onedimensional bad guys i thought it was 
better to make noise quietly and do something i believe in 
consider his latest project despite his current big hollywood 
flick goldwyn is toiling these days for minimum wages in a small 
offbroadway theater in greenwich village hes costarring with 
richard venture in the sum of us a comedy by australian 
playwright david stevens author of breaker morant 
its a beautiful play which i first did at williamstown 
goldwyn says 
set in a bluecollar suburb of melbourne the sum of us 
concerns the complex relationship between a son who is gay and a 
father who accepts him for what he is 
what i think is most interesting about the play is that david 
stevens examines a relationship that is completely unconditional 
and nonjudgmental and the problems that that can create he 
says 
goldwyn began his career while at brandeis university on 
stage it was a conscious effort to distance himself from an 
impeccable showbusiness pedigree that he says could close as many 
doors as it could open 
one grandfather was movie mogul samuel goldwyn the man behind 
such classics as the best years of our lives and wuthering 
heights the other was broadway playwright sidney howard author 
of they knew what they wanted and the silver cord 
mom is onetime stage actress jennifer howard dad is samuel 
goldwyn jr a force in todays hollywood as producer of such 
recent film hits as mystic pizza 
their son takes his familys celluloid celebrity in stride 
they in turn protected him from it 
i felt naive when i finally got into show business goldwyn 
says i felt i didnt know anything about the movies because i 
had been so sheltered from it as a kid 
i was very close to my grandparents and parents but they were 
so sensitive to the negative aspects of the hollywood world that 
they kept us completely separated from it i was never involved in 
my fathers work 
there never were movie stars around kids in school used to 
ask me what movie stars do you know and i was embarrassed 
because i didnt know any 
goldwyns decision to become an actor was greeted with mixed 
feelings by his parents 
my mothers whole family was from the theater and she had been 
an actress in new york as a younger woman goldwyn recalls so 
the theater held great romance for her she thought it was great 
my father was terrified but he said do what you want to 
do goldwyn says but he was nervous about it 
father and son have not worked together at least not yet 
our relationship is primarily personal and i wouldnt want to 
threaten it by getting into business together goldwyn says we 
have such a good solid relationship as a father and a son that its 
not worth it to either of us to muck it up 
goldwyn found out about the role in ghost through his wife 
jane musky who was production designer on the film but director 
jerry zucker thought he was too nice and sympathetic to play 
the man who tries to come between patrick swayze and demi moore 
only after the producer and the scriptwriter saw an audition 
tape goldwyn made and raved about his performance did zucker 
consider him for the job 
goldwyn and his wife live with their new daughter anna in 
hoboken nj 
i have avoided the whole hollywood scene largely because it 
doesnt appeal to me he says when i first went back to 
california to work in television it was rough i didnt know 
anybody and yet people thought i did so that made it even harder 
id walk into an office and they would say oh i know your 
dad so their perspective is oh this is just another kid from a 
showbusiness family who thinks he wants to be an actor i dont 
want that to be the focus of things 
ghost has changed that after he finishes his run in the 
sum of us goldwyn will portray jody powell president jimmy 
carters press secretary in a television movie for ted turner 
about the iran hostage crisis 
the bottom line is that its a struggle for anyone to be an 
actor he says now that ghost has become a success the 
family connection has taken on a whole new meaning people think it 
is wonderful and say gee isnt it amazing that youve made your 
mark and now another goldwyn does his own thing and that has 
been great

harrys the sort of guy as his best friends son says you feel 
like taking out into the woods and leaving under a rock thats 
probably being too kind 
harry mention danny glover is a charming hustler whose very 
presence spells danger in charles burnetts to sleep with 
anger after many years he suddenly appears at the los angeles 
home of his old friend from the south gideon and his family 
stirring their passions tampering with their dreams and fears 
worsening their conflicts 
gideon paul butler and his wife suzie mary alice are 
godfearing people who believe in the inherent goodness of others 
theyre raised two sons junior responsible and committed to his 
parents pregnant wife and daughter and babe brother selfish 
insecure irresponsible and indifferent toward his wife linda 
but the clash is more than merely generational its also 
lifestyle linda sheryl lee ralph and babe brother richard 
brooks are selfish yuppies who leave their son with his 
grandparents each day and sometimes dont pick him up until 
midnight during family gatherings linda prefers staying outside 
in the ca instead of joining in because she says she doesnt 
know anything about crops or how to get rid of garden pests 
the chasm between babe and linda and babes parents is like a 
lake filled with hot lava and with harry on the scene its about 
to boil over 
harry insinuates himself into the very fragile family 
relationship seducing babe to his misogynist selfish and 
neocriminal ways and almost possessing him until the family 
barrels into a neartragedy 
burnett blocks to sleep with anger which he also wrote 
like a wellstaged threeact play and his denouement is delicious 
and devilish his action is understated a poetic sweep rather than 
a frenzied dance this is his first major feature film his other 
works have included killer of sheep my brothers wedding 
and horse his is an original vision 
his ensemble cast is balanced and works well alice is always a 
gentle joy and glover continues to astound with his range from his 
hip keystone cop capers with mel gibson to his lyrical boarder in 
places in the heart theres good support from ralph butler 
carl lumbly as the older son and vonetta mcgee as his wife 
to sleep with anger made its debut at the new york film

drummer roy haynes and bassist dave holland and headed for the 
studio 
their goal was a good time rather than a record but when 
metheny played back the tapes of their eighthour session he liked 
what he heard and decided to release some of the music as 
question amp answer 
sad to say methenys enthusiasm was misplaced there isnt much 
to hear here as always he coins some nice melodies and then takes 
them in interesting directions the lovely reflective change of 
heart is comparable to his best work 
but while metheny is often spinning intricate sounds his rhythm 
section detracts and distracts haynes always a busy drummer is 
annoying with his incessant cymbals its as though he was being 
paid by the ching hollands bass is undermixed and mumbles most of 
the time especially on the fast tunes and when he solos 
another reason the 62minute record seems longer is that its 
dynamically flat as metheny points out in the liner notes he 
played one guitar at one setting throughout his synclavier on the 
closing three flights up provides the records only change in 
texture 
metheny has released only two other trio albums so his fans may 
regard question amp answer as a treat but its not for the 
fainthearted

whats americas best unknown rock band heres a vote for new 
york citys finest the del lords 
the del lords music little tales of life and redemption with 
three guitars and drums seems almost quaint today but its done 
with intelligence and dedication all the more impressive since 
theyve never achieved the stardom some predicted for them six 
years ago 
this is a quartet of workingclass new yorkers who havent lost 
their pride in the city despite anger at whats become of it 
somewhere in queens scott kempner sings the sun is always 
shining 
but enough sociology lovers who wander is a collection that 
illuminates common life from a landlord who sues a tenant for 
being a day late and a dollar short to of course lovers who 
wander the del lords never quite give in to their frustrations 
and one suspects its largely due to the healing powers of music 
most of kempners songs depict various stages of relationships 
from the anticipation of i need love to the resignation of 
learn to let go while the del lords retain their musical 
toughness the material here demands more subtlety than the band 
has shown in the past and they handle it with aplomb 
the only wish here is that kempner loosen the reins on his band 
only twice does he let someone else write the songs and one of 
them rockabye written and sung by drummer frank funaro is 
terrific guitarist eric ambels voice enough to carry a strong 
solo album a year ago isnt heard until the final song kempner 
wrings as much emotion from his gruff bronxaccented voice as can 
be expected but hed be better off spreading the vocals around 
more 
much of rock n roll is fantasybased but the del lords have 
both feet firmly on the ground and their victories are also their 
listeners call it music you can use

americans will get a rare glimpse of how 
one japanese art collector viewed western art when a collection of 
60 impressionist and modern paintings goes on exhibit next sunday 
shojiro ishibasi founder of bridgestone the worlds third 
largest tire manufacturer began collecting artwork before world 
war ii only once before has any part of the collection left tokyo 
and that was in 1962 when works traveled to paris 
bridgestone has two tire plants in tennessee and had its 
american headquarters in the state until it merged with firestone 
and moved to arkon ohio 
masterworks paintings from the bridgestone collection will 
hang in the tennessee state museum through jan 20 the exhibit 
features works by nearly every major painter of the impressionist 
school and includes claude monets twilight venice and amedeo 
modiglianis portrait of a young farmer 
its one japanese collectors view of western art tennessee 
state museum curator lois riggins ezell said some did not paint 
in the impressionist style but they all began painting in that 
time period and were all influenced by the school of 
impressionism 
the museum has booked tours from new york and the midwest since 
bridgestone probably will not let the exhibit travel again ezell 
said 
highlights include wellknown paintings such as water 
lilies from the later works of monet and the outstanding mont 
saintvictoire and chateau noir by paul cezanne 
cezanne spent half of his life painting his mountain and this 
is one of the best ezell said 
works by henri rousseau paul gauguin and henri matisse provide 
a look at impressionism moving into modernism 
the collection also includes modern paintings such as pablo 
picassos cup and spoon and giorgio de chiricos 
troubadour 
cup and spoon is a still life in cubist style while 
troubadour is a painting of a mannequin one of the types of 
work for which chirico is best known 
the 60 paintings were selected primarily by the curators of the 
tokyo museum as the most artistically significant and the most 
stable ezell said paintings by toulouselautrec and chagall were 
considered two fragile for shipment and work by rembrandt van rijn 
was painted on a board which lacks the resiliency of canvas and 
does not travel well 
the collection will be on display through jan 20 1991 and will 
then return to japan

there was nothing special about elizabeth 
perkins as a child unless you consider staring at people in 
restaurants hopping freight trains and cheating on rorschach tests 
to be nothing special 
her career in films has been so far nothing special she 
started off in 1986 with a hit about last night and then 
appeared in a pair of flops sweethearts dance and from the 
hip playing tom hanks girlfriend in big earned her solid 
reviews and the offers started pouring in for hanks 
its like death out there perkins 29 said during a recent 
interview at a manhattan hotel 
there are no parts for actresses they just dont exist 
wheres jessica lange wheres jane fonda why did meryl streep 
make shedevil i just happened to be the actress in big so i 
got a few offers i got offers to play uptight actresses with a 
heart of gold just like my part in big 
she was willing to beg for big and nearly two years later 
felt the same way about her latest movie avalon 
the actress had become friendly with director barry levinson 
while he was making the academy awardwinning rain man when 
casting began for avalon he offered her the role as the mother 
of a family growing up in levinsons native baltimore during the 
1940s and 50s 
perkins didnt need to finish the script 
it was so brilliantly written she said i got about half 
way through before i called i would have played a waitress if he 
had asked me to i would have brought in coffee in a scene 
he said i had the cynicism and i had the banter down he said 
i looked like a woman from the 1940s he said i had a very period 
face i dont think i have a contemporary face 
perkins was born in queens ny but her parents divorced when 
she was a baby and she lived on a 600acre farm in brattleboro 
vt with her mother and stepfather 
basic acting and basic insubordination were her specialties 
drama awards faulty attendance and expulsion from a boarding 
school are among her childhood memories under parental supervision 
she was liable to gaze at strangers free to do what she pleased 
perkins supplied erotic answers for her rorschachs inkblot 
analyses for personality testing just for shock value and 
tested her jumping skills on moving trains 
that was a big thing in my town she recalled ride it 
and then hop off how can a kid really do anything that bad the 
things they kick you out of school for when you get to be older 
you realize that wasnt so bad stealing food from the dining hall 
skipping school smoking a joint theyre part of growing up 
after boarding school perkins lived with her father in chicago 
and then spent three years training at the goodman theater school 
two years of looking for work convinced her to move to new york 
this time she paid for transportation where she eventually 
landed a part on broadway in neil simons brighton beach 
memoirs 
acting in films is easy she insists just a matter of summing 
up a character in a few words or images for avalon perkins 
played the part worried seeing herself as a woman whose family 
was slowly breaking up in big she relied on a visual effect 
one of the things i did was to slowly lower the height of my 
shoes for the entire movie so by the end my feet were completely 
flat on the ground that for me gave a physical aspect to the role 
i started out the movie in 4inch high heels and i ended it flat 
i started with my hair up and eventually lowered it and 
lowered it until it completely went down hanks brings her back 
down to earth he brings the real her out 
but fans seem to confuse the real perkins with someone else 
no one seems to realize theyve encountered a genuine trainhopper 
thats why cynicism and banter come easily for her especially when 
greetings alternate between werent you tom hanks girlfriend in 
big and arent you elizabeth mcgovern 
the first time we met each other was about a year and a half 
ago at an audition she said of mcgovern another darkhaired 
actress with a face for period pieces ragtime once upon a 
time in america 
we were sitting and she turns to me and says do people 
confuse you with me as much they confuse me with you i said 
yes she said at least youre talented and i said yeah at 
least youre talented its not like youre a bimbo

florence harrison nesbit has spent 60 years 
trying to shake the image of a lady flower painter 
at 80 nesbit still slips on a smock for painting binges at 
her studio in seattles queen anne neighborhood she creates amid a 
stack of canvasses that includes watercolors of whidbey island and 
walla walla and scenes of her old sun porch in berkeley calif 
a shoebox of note cards keeps track of a lifetime of paintings 
some are sold some are displayed at seattles bayview manor where 
the artist lives many are forgotten 
a port angeles gallery manager recently scouted nesbit for a 
showing of her work are you just a flower painter he asked 
skeptically she bristled at the remark 
its a stigma you cant get rid of nesbit said we want 
to paint just as badly as men do most of us have had the same 
training as men had but we have an awful time finding a place to 
show 
seattle gallery owners david martin and dominic zambito want to 
change all that 
this month the martinzambito fine art gallery on capitol hill 
is mounting an exhibition of paintings by northwest women to 
commemorate the 60th anniversary of the women painters of 
washington 
the show will display works primarily from the 1930s 40s and 
50s by nesbit and more than a dozen other members of the womens 
painting group only five of the artists featured are still alive 
relegated to family archives or sometimes destroyed altogether 
art from this generation of northwest women has not been easy to 
assemble martin said hes rounded up works from families friends 
and some of the painters themselves a few paintings were picked up 
at new england auction houses 
while critics continue to praise the vision of northwestern 
painters mark tobey kenneth callahan and morris graves lesser 
known painters have been lost in history martin said this show 
he said attempts to give northwest women artists the recognition 
they deserve 
it just seems unbalanced martin said they are as 
talented as their male counterparts who showed in museums and 
gallery retrospectives i want people to come and see their artwork 
because its very good 
the exhibition is a travelogue of washington state countrysides 
and cityscapes paintings are priced from the high hundreds to 
6500 
dorothy milne rising offers 1940s scenes of the puyallup fair 
and seattles pike place market rising 95 currently lives in 
mukilteo 
cle elums oldest homestead from the 1930s is portrayed by olive 
malestrom carl there are paintings of mount shuksan by elizabeth 
warhanik and eastern washington haystacks by dorothy dolph jensen 
two founders of the women painters of washington 
the exhibit also includes an 80yearold photograph by myra 
wiggins another cofounder one of the photo secessionists 
wiggins participated in a landmark photography exhibition with 
alfred stieglitz in new york in 1910 a picture from that show will 
be on display at the pike street gallery 
perhaps the best known artist featured is yvonne twining humber 
82 of seattle a painter for the works progress administration 
wpa in boston in the 1930s humber sells more art work in new 
england than the pacific northwest martin said but the strength 
of her painting is apparent in an ethereal depiction of the 
cascades at night and her lively carnival scenes her work will 
be exhibited in a onewoman show this december at the 
martinzambito gallery 
the circus fascinated me said humber at her home in the 
citys magnolia neighborhood old circuses would have a tent with 
elephants wandering around it was the informality there was loads 
of life 
a northwest resident since the 1940s humber said she has never 
been a flower painter job opportunities not sexual politics 
directed her vision and she said her early experience with the wpa 
was influential 
i paint buildings with better composition than i do fuzzy 
little trees the artist explained it was just circumstance 
that pushed me in that direction but i loved it 
humber says she experienced no discrimination as a woman 
painter but regrets her sexsegregated art training at the 
national academy of design in new york 
femaleonly classes however were better than no school at all 
after a divorce in 1967 nesbit applied to the fine arts program 
at her alma mater the university of washington she hoped to earn 
a masters degree after completing one year of studies at scripps 
college in california but she was turned down by the program 
director an old college classmate who flatly told her that uw was 
not enrolling women painters 
in those days before womens lib we didnt think about it 
we just took it nesbit recalled i almost gave up painting and 
that was my life 
nesbit was an early success placing first in watercolor in 1933 
at the seattle art museums northwest annual exhibition in the 
decades that followed she won several painting awards and exhibited 
at a number of onewoman shows in california and seattles frye art 
museum 
employed as a wpa painting teacher in the 1930s nesbit later 
got a job drawing fashion figures for newspaper advertisements she 
cofounded the northwest watercolor society in 1940 
when she can nesbit still takes to the outdoors to paint live 
landscapes but with age confining her more to the art studio she 
has begun experimenting with new techniques such as tilttop 
painting 
like other talented women artists of her generation nesbit 
followed her passion but was rarely encouraged to take it 
seriously after six decades of perfecting her art she still 
stumbles in labeling herself a professional painter 
my sister worked at boeing for 27 years and that was 
considered successful i was just a painter messing around 
nesbit said 
financially i couldnt exist from what i make from my 
painting emotionally i couldnt have lived without it

when members of the rock group inxs hit the 
road this month for a yearlong world tour they wanted to kick it 
off where the band had its humble beginnings the australian pub 
were playing up in queensland and places like that up in the 
north places that really dont get to see us that often little 
towns you know says michael hutchence lead singer of the 
sextet 
we could obviously do much bigger shows in australia says 
guitarist and keyboardist andrew farriss but we feel its a good 
way to start off the tour because its grounding for us 
the tour promoting their newly released x album will wind 
around the globe through southeast asia and europe reaching north 
america sometime in january the first single from the album 
suicide blond is already scurrying up the charts 
the songs title has spurred some confusion among listeners who 
wonder just what a suicide blond is hutchence explains that its 
simply a term that was used in the 1940s for a shade of hair dye 
it was hard times everyone used to dye their hair with 
peroxide in the sink at home so it was dyed by their own hands 
hutchence says i thought that was an interesting case of 
semantics going on so i turned it into the song its actually 
much more positive than it sounds its not about suicide 
x with the bulk of the songs written by hutchence and 
farriss is reminiscent of the rawness inxs has produced in 
previous albums rhythmic rock mixed with a dab of funk were a 
hybrid you know hutchence says proudly 
and as the bands main songwriters hutchence 30 and farriss 
31 take their jobs seriously 
youve got to move to music or music has to move you or you 
shouldnt do it in my opinion says farriss youve got to be 
interested and want to move something around whether its peoples 
emotions interest or loins or something of that nature 
but we dont write something purely to dance to theres a 
sense of rhythm theres a sense of life adds hutchence 
he warns that if you get too introverted in your approach to 
songwriting you can get wigged out in sad miserable tales 
rounding out inxs are farriss brothers jon and tim kirk 
pengilly and garry gary beers they began as a band out of sydney 
called the farriss brothers in 1977 while most members were still 
in high school 
they toured the australian pub circuit developing a huge 
following the guys credit those pub days with giving them the 
power to negotiate contracts with record companies without 
compromising their own visions for the band 
we were signed because we had created something already we 
werent made into anything and thats the way weve always run 
it hutchence says no one has ever ever run me and said to me 
or andrew you better do this or do that no ones ever told us to 
do anything 
the band debuted in the united states in 1983 with the release 
of the single the one thing but it was the 1985 
multiplatinum album listen like thieves that catapulted the 
group to widespread fame 
the single from that album what you need became the bands 
first top 10 hit in the united states their next album kick 
released in 1987 had the hits need you tonight devil 
inside new sensation and never tear us apart 
the band took a break after that album and followup tour some 
members spent the hiatus producing other acts and creating new 
bands 
hutchence whose charismatic stage presence has been compared to 
the late jim morrison of the doors transformed his talents to 
the movie screen 
he plays a small part in the yettobe released roger corman 
film frankenstein unbound starring john hurt and raul julia 
he also got raves for his first feature role in the 1986 australian 
film dogs in space 
i love films im a real fan of films i guess i aspire to 
that says hutchence the only band member who makes his home 
outside of australia he resides in hong kong where his british 
military father was stationed during part of his childhood 
hutchence also used the hiatus to put together max q a 
group that garnered critical but not popular acclaim for its sole 
album 
i thought it was going to be bigger than thriller it was 
going to be killer he jokes referring to michael jacksons 
megahit album 
the title of the latest album reflects the bands attitude 
toward simplicity 
we didnt want something too wordy like the unbearable 
lightness of being says farriss we just wanted something 
simple so it stands for whatever you want to make of it 
the x could stand for the roman numeral 10 signifying the 
10th anniversary of the bands first album inxs or it could 
be a mocking jab at the music rating controversy hutchence 
suggests although their own material does not push decency limits 
the band members belief in simplicity carries over to their 
attitude about live performances which they say will be reflected 
in the tour 
our shows are more traditional hutchence says we spend a 
lot of money on sound equipment and stage equipment itll look 
good but really its just a band playing and i think people 
appreciate that 
were not clowns its real

though old ones close and new ones open the juke 
joints of the mississippi delta persist unique individual 
apparently oblivious of franchise america 
these roadhouses with such names as magic city monkeys place 
and the out of sight club appear all along the fertile basin of 
the river the settings are rural the clientele black 
what they have in common are music a jukebox usually beer or 
harder stuff and their regulars the same faces this week as last 
for most of america these elemental pieces of the delta puzzle 
are if anything another world in the midst of my own as 
photographer birney imes says in a new book that collects his 
evocative pictures of the juke joints 
imes a white southerner whose work appears in the museum of 
modern art was referring generally to black culture which he said 
he was only vaguely aware of before attending an integrated 
high school in the 1960s 
when i began photographing six or seven years later he 
adds it was in part my wish and my need to overcome this 
ignorance that helped make my choice of subject an obvious one 
beginning by photographing people and scenes in rural 
mississippi he eventually came to see the juke joints as subjects 
the result is juke joint university press of mississippi 
3995 
the collection of 61 color photographs provides outsiders with a 
tantalizing look into these clubs which beckon and forbid when one 
passes them on a country road their strings of yearround 
christmas bulbs give off firefly light their doors may open 
momentarily to release a yellow glow and a thudding bluesy beat 
its the photos capacity to be other than cultural 
snapshots that novelist richard ford appreciates the 
mississippian author of the sportswriter analyzes the 
pictures uncanny art in an introductory essay 
still the peek in the jukes door the view of these private 
places that the pictures offer is an undeniable part of the books 
value 
thats partly because in some cases the places depicted no 
longer exist beyond that details in the corners of photographs 
help flesh out the lives of the mostly unseen juke joint patrons 
signs on the wall often handwritten reflect the local sense of 
humor or the approach here to problems seen everywhere o lord 
please help me keep my damn nose out of other peoples business 
says one sign and next to it no dope please crack will kill 
you look at your buddy hes dead you no 
in the homely decorations of many clubs that imes portrays any 
reader quickly glimpses the notorious poverty of the region as 
well as its legendary creativity 
some photos focus closely on brightly spraypainted interiors or 
homemade furniture on a cracked wall of the riverside lounge in 
shaw miss somebody painted a large floating bull in a style 
that strangely recalls the art of the cave paintings of france and 
spain 
what i see in imes photographs does not equal the human 
condition ford writes only a human condition a miniature 
advanced as art and meant to ease the adjustments between ourselves 
and the world by offering beauty consolation diversion the 
satisfaction of direct address all the usual enticements by which 
art dignifies and pleases us 
its risky to suggest where art originates but part of what 
compells a reader to these pictures of places that are anything but 
glamorous comes from the light the photographer captures in one 
photograph a golden sunrise or sunset light bathes the torn 
tarpaper wall of the pink pony cafe in darling miss and makes 
shadows all in profile of a line of people just outside the 
frame 
the simultaneous presence and absence of people in many of the 
photos is another reflection of imes art some interior shots were 
exposed and printed so that furnishings such as a pool table 
appear in sharp focus while patrons such as moving pool players 
appear as blurs almost as ghosts 
no one is seen in a claustrophobic shot of a bands instruments 
speakers amplifiers and even drink glasses but the reader almost 
hears the din of conversation between sets 
here and elsewhere in this collection the unknown as ford 
says seems to have been put to use

singer matraca berg is a feisty and 
defiant newcomer who slays the country music axiom stand by your 
man 
in her wellcrafted debut album the 26yearold firebrand 
ridicules her reallife exhusband in the things you left 
undone 
in another autobiographical tune appalachian rain her 
reallife father who helped conceive her without marrying her 
mother and then abandoned mother and child is shot by her family 
berg says the song is true except for the shooting which she 
describes as wishful thinking 
the album is lying to the moon a collection of rebellious 
country rockers and thoughtful ballads written by a woman sung by 
a woman and definitely about women 
so what does she put into her music 
my heart and my soul she said in an interview thats 
exactly what i put into every song i write and honesty 
in the album she repeatedly tells men goodbye i dont 
love you and i can make it on my own 
theres little acknowledgement of country queen tammy wynettes 
viewpoint in stand by your man more than 20 years ago 
the first single released from the album baby walk on is a 
rollicking tune asserting that a woman doesnt mind if her lover 
leaves the relationship 
i must have been crazy is an uptempo tune questioning why 
she loved someone 
lying to the moon is a soft ballad about the pain from a 
misleading lover it was written on the porch of a mountaintop 
cabin as she watched the moon rise and the mist form 
her songs are laden with romantic themes drawn heavily from her 
personal life 
i think we all go through trials and tribulations in love 
affairs she said i just happen to be writing about them the 
songs are directed at a couple of guys in my life and not at men in 
general 
im a reporter as a songwriter i observe what other people go 
through and what i go through and i report it in the best way 
possible with the most empathy i can feel in the most undiluted 
fashion i can 
berg whose first name is pronounced muhtraysuh has been 
writing hit songs since age 18 when she penned faking love 
which was recorded by country singers tg sheppard and karen 
brooks she also wrote the last one to know a no 1 hit by 
country star reba mcentire 
shes been singing all along with stops along the way with a 
louisianabased rock n roll band and a spot in the movie made 
in heaven in which she is discovered singing by actor timothy 
hutton 
berg the daughter of the late nashville recording session 
singersongwriter icee berg also sang with rock veteran neil young 
at the liveaid concert in philadelphia and other concerts 
on lying to the moon she enlisted and received the help of 
veteran singer emmylou harris who provides backup vocals 
shes pretty accessible especially to young new talent 
berg said she contributed to making my year shes a hero of 
mine so this was a high point in my career 
her mother who died of cancer six years ago never got to hear 
the folksounding song about her outofwedlock child and the 
fictional fate that befell the father berg said shed be proud 
i grew up realizing i was born an illegitimate child my 
mother just never made a big deal about it its not such a nono 
to me as maybe it would seem to other people she said 
my mother went through a lot of hard times back in the early 
60s when this happened i think its a beautiful story worth 
writing about 
she jests that the things you left undone could be subtitled 
ode to my exhusband he is a songwriter the couple divorced 
last year after two years of marriage 
its a tongueincheek kind of song i dedicated it to him one 
night at a show we are friends we just couldnt live together he 
owns his part of the bad deal and i own my part and we go on with 
it he likes the song 
berg believes women are more enlightened than they were a 
generation ago and will welcome the viewpoint in her lyrics 
women are working now so their livelihood doesnt depend on 
this person that they are married to so i think they tend to think 
more of themselves as a separate entity than they used to she 
said 
they are tougher in a lot of ways so they stand up for 
themselves a lot more

washington ap democratic leaders predicted that a new budget 
agreement easing medicare cuts and tempering excise tax increases 
will be reached before the government shutdown takes full effect 
tuesday 
democrats told their leaders sunday to go ahead with a plan 
designed to let democraticcontrolled committees draft later the 
specifics for reaching 500 billion in deficit reduction over the 
next five years 
 
new york ap the failed federal budget accord slammed stock 
and bond prices but the markets recovered nearly all the lost 
ground partly on president bushs tough stance against congress 
in a lengthy night session a rebellious house early friday 
overwhelmingly defeated the 500billion compromise package of tax 
increases and spending cuts sought by bush and congressional 
leaders 
wall street professionals had hoped for a budget accord to help 
reduce the amount of borrowing needed to pay the federal deficit 
and spur the federal reserve to reduce interest rates

parent company of united airlines said that 2 billion in bank 
financing for its bid on tuesday has fallen through

such as airplanes and leases them back employee investments and 
cash on hand 
 
dearborn mich ap the united auto workers union and ford 
motor co reached a tentative national labor contract that closely

million

quarterly dividend to 40 cents a share from 60 cents 
the company said it was the first major addition to reserves 
since june 1988 when travelers added 415 million to cover 
anticipated real estate losses the latest increase boosts reserves 
to 115 billion at quarters end 
 
st louis ap trans world airlines inc sent layoff notices 
to 430 employees to cut its losses further in an industry hit hard 
by rising fuel prices and the slumping economy

prices since iraq invaded kuwait in august usair group inc pan 
am corp and midway airlines inc also have announced layoffs

weeks after the iraqi invasion of kuwait to keep interest rates

geoffrey moore is a referee whos not looking 
forward to his next call he could blow the whistle on the longest 
economic expansion in us peacetime history 
moore and six colleagues affiliated with the national bureau of 
economic research in cambridge mass will decide perhaps before 
years end on whether the latest recession has begun 
many private economists believe a downturn is imminent if it 
is not already here and moore said he expects his committee to 
decide before december whether the next downturn is under way 
the current growth cycle which would be eight years old in 
november already has broken the previous peacetime record of 58 
months from march 1975 to january 1980 the alltime record of 106 
months of economic growth ran from february 1961 to december 1969 
a time period that included the vietnam war 
the last recession lasted from july 1981 to november 1982 
according to moore and his colleagues on the bureaus business 
cycle dating committee the next would be the eighth that moore has 
been involved in defining 
i dont look forward to recessions he says i just try to 
identify them after theyve started 
the bureau a private research organization of several hundred 
academic economists scattered around the world has become 
recognized as the arbiter of business cycles founded in 1920 it 
is funded by corporate contributions and government and foundation 
grants 
its tables showing the extent of business growth and contraction 
since 1854 have been published regularly in commerce department 
publications beginning in 1961 
thats what has made it official more than anything else 
that a government agency would use its data moore said in a 
recent interview 
he retired from the bureau staff in 1979 after 40 years to 
become director of the center for international business cycle 
research at columbia university a position he still holds at age 
76 however he still is affiliated with nber 
their calls are widely accepted said adren cooper a 
commerce department spokesman since the nber has been doing that 
theres been no controversy that i know of 
the government itself does not announce the beginning and end of 
business cycles out of fear that it would be accused of making 
politically manipulated decisions 
the nber definition of a recession is more complicated than the 
oftenused formula of two consecutive quarterly declines in the 
gross national product the broadest measure of the nations 
economic activity that was coined by arthur okun chairman of 
president lyndon johnsons council of economic advisers 
the nbers broader definition is a recurring period of decline 
in total output income employment and trade usually lasting from 
six months to a year and marked by widespread contractions in many 
sectors of the economy bureau spokeswoman donna zeritz said 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan also uses a more complex 
definition of a recession 
a recession is a cumulative process of deterioration in which 
events feed on each other causing a major economic decline he 
told congress last month a process in which the economy is 
deteriorating in a cumulative interactive manner is a true 
recession 
although greenspan and the bush administration contend the 
economy is not now in a downturn many private economists disagree 
saying the economy began contracting during the current quarter 
others say a recession is likely before years end 
moore describes the criteria for measuring a recession as the 
3d words duration depth and defusion 
as for duration the longest recession lasted 65 months from 
october 1873 to march 1879 the shortest lasted six months from 
january to july 1980 the great depression went on for 43 months 
starting in august 1929 and ending in march 1933 
in addition to duration moore said we look at measures of 
aggregate economic activity such as nonfarm employment industrial 
production real gnp real income and real sales 
we get a variety of measures of that sort and see whether the 
decline thats begun is comparable with the magnitude of previous 
cycles he explained 
defusion moore said means the decline is experienced widely 
and not contained in just one or two industries such as housing and 
automobiles 
joining moore in deciding the peaks and troughs of business 
cycles are martin feldstein of harvard university the nber 
president who became economic adviser to president reagan as the 
nation was emerging from the last recession robert hall the 
committee chairman from stanford university william branson of 
princeton university benjamin friedman of harvard victor 
zarnowitz of the university of chicago business school and robert 
gordon of northwestern university 
the bureau also is credited with developing the commerce 
departments index of leading economic indicators designed to 
forecast economic activity six months to nine months in advance

general motors corp this week introduces its new 
saturn line into a market some say is already crowded with cars in 
the 10000price range 
no less than seven other manufacturers offering more than three 
dozen kinds of cars including some of the bestselling vehicles in 
the united states already are in the same ballpark as saturn 
where does it fit in said herb adcox owner of herb adcox 
chevroletgeo in chattanooga tenn there is no shelf space 
officials of saturn corp a gm subsidiary established to help 
show the distinction of its cars from gms others said theyre 
planning to get 80 percent of the corporations projected annual 
sales of 250000 cars from wouldbe import buyers 
auto analysts said the goals especially the 80percent import 
conquest rate will be difficult to attain as foreign automakers 
especially japanese grab larger shares of the shrinking us auto 
market 
at the end of september japanese automakers held about 28 
percent of the us car market 
based on price and other statistics the four saturn models will 
be competing against three models each of the dodge shadow and 
plymouth sundance six of the ford tempo six of the honda civic 
three of the mazda protege seven of the nissan sentra and five of 
the toyota corolla 
thats in addition to two models of the chevrolet cavalier and 
four of the geo prizm both sold by adcox and thousands of other gm 
dealers the cavalier was the third bestselling car in the 1990 
model year and civic was at no 10 
weve got dozens of models in that same saturn price 
bracket adcox said i dont know how in the world you are 
going to market a 10000 to 12000 car 
saturns four models carry base prices between 7995 and 
11775 without taxes destination charges options or other 
costs other cars in that price segment offer incentives but 
saturn isnt for now at least 
its pretty clear that by starting out at 8000 base they 
fully intend to sell this vehicle without an incentive said auto 
analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman brothers in new york 
city 
the last thing you want to do is taint the vehicle or its 
reputation by having to slap an incentive on the vehicle in weeks 
or months or a very short period after its introduction he said 
selling a car without an incentive in the united states these 
days is a tough chore in some cases selling a car with an 
incentive is tough too 
for example sales of the chevrolet cavalier through the first 
nine months totaled 222980 cars down 33 percent from last year 
gms latest incentive on the car is a 900 cash rebate 
in addition to cash some of saturns main competitors are 
giving away air conditioning and automatic transmissions 
while cavalier sales slipped januaryseptember sales for the 
honda civic which carries no incentives were up 11 percent 
compared with last year to 198284 cars 
basically saturn officials are banking that their dealers 
showrooms will be flooded with people who have bought import cars 
in the past but feel guilty about shunning american manufacturers 
saturn wants to build a reputation quickly that its cars are 
more like imports than other gm models saturns first round of 
advertising contains no references to it being a part of gm and the 
company is requiring that saturn dealers erect separate dealerships 
for saturn sales and service operations 
its the first time in 58 years that gm the worlds largest 
automaker has created a new division 
there are more than two dozen companies selling hundreds of 
kinds of cars in the united states ranging from yugos to rolls 
royces all scrapping for parts of a shrinking market last week 
foreign and domestic automakers reported car and truck sales that 
resulted in the worst model year in the industry since 1983 
the real question for gm is what does this vehicle do to other 
gm products phillippi said theyve got to get a significant 
number of sales threefourths from nongm family brands

shortly after the ussoviet business weekly 
commersant hit the newsstands in january government ministers 
started calling editorial offices to find out how to muzzle its 
sharp commentaries 
when they found out we were independent they kind of lost 
their bearings and gave up said vladimir yakovlev commersant 
editorinchief 
commersant and two other new soviet periodicals owe their 
independence in part to the policy of glasnost or openness and in 
part to their backing from investors in the united states and other 
western countries 
unlike most soviet publications they are not affiliated with 
the communist party or government and are not subject to the same 
hierarchical pressures that soviet bureaucrats are accustomed to 
applying 
commersant backed by the us investment company refco is the 
type of soviet business that a visiting delegation from the new 
york stock exchange will be scrutinizing during a threeday meeting 
in moscow this week 
the tabloid provides a weekly barometer of the ups and downs of 
foreign enterprises performances in the soviet union and critical 
features on soviet economics 
although paper shortages have forced the government newspaper 
izvestia to miss editions twice commersant has a supply contract 
with a private company guaranteeing a steady flow of newsprint 
its russian circulation is 350000 and its english distribution 
is 30000 yakovlev said commersan recently went on sale in the 
united states 
according to officials of the state committee for the press 
joint ventures have filed 23 applications to start publications 
sixty applications have been filed by private individuals and 20 by 
political parties and public organizations the officials said 
two glossy magazines moscow and business in the ussr are 
building their circulations and several pilot publications have 
appeared 
izvestia and hearst publications published a pilot issue of a 
new englishrussian newspaper on july 4 and hope to be issuing a 
regular edition next year the weekly magazine business week 
brought out a dual language edition last summer and also hopes to 
publish regularly 
special onetime editions of western magazines including ladies 
home journal and paris match also have appeared in soviet shops 
other joint venture magazines include new farmer an offshoot of 
the usbased rodale press that could distribute in the soviet 
union next year to give soviet farmers american agricultural 
knowhow and russian business review a quarterly to be published 
in 1991 by a swisssoviet joint venture 
business in the ussr is aimed at the emerging class of 
soviet business leaders said editor vadim biryukov 
we want to hit the right guy the economist the factory 
director the banker the small businessman anybody who deals 
with the economy he said 
until recently the term businessman was disparaging 
biryukov said we are trying to change that we clearly see all 
our readers we talk to them try to give them the courage to 
become businessmen to be proud to be a businessman 
in a step designed to open the door for jointventure 
publishing the supreme soviet parliament adopted a press law aug 
1 under the law a new pubication can start after an application 
is filed and a regestration fee of 2000 3200 is paid in hard 
currency 
that could pose a problem for biryukov who founded the magazine 
earlier and may end up paying twice 
we registered before the law was adopted now we have to 
register again he complained we havent had time to earn that 
kind of money 
business in the ussr published its sixth issue in october 
with a circulation of 100000 editions in russian and 50000 in 
english the magazine relies heavily on advertising for hard 
currency revenues 
moscow magazine is patterned after the trendy glossy 
publications that thrive in big american cities 
we are styled a little after city magazines like new york 
said editor derk sauer a dutchman

britains longdelayed entry into europes 
exchange rate mechanism could spur the european communitys move 
toward economic and monetary union but for margaret thatcher the 
immediate motives are closer to home analysts say 
linking the pound to other european currencies should stabilize 
the pounds exchange rate help fight inflation and bring down 
interest rates which could improve the prime ministers chances of 
winning a fourth consecutive term 
but the price of joining the socalled erm could be a further 
crimp on an already slowing economy and a rise in unemployment 
the government announced friday it would link the pound to the 
mechanism on monday the government also said britains 15 percent 
interest rates would come down a full percentage point the same 
day 
under the mechanism britains currency will be allowed to 
fluctuate no more than 6 percent from an agreedupon exchange rate 
putting a floor under the pound gives mrs thatcher room to cut 
high interest rates unpopular with both homeowners and businesses 
before she must call an election by mid1992 
it was becoming urgent for the government to get interest 
rates down if they were going to stop the next election being lost 
on the recession issue robin aspinall analyst at the london 
investment firm hoare govett ltd 
britain already is in a mild recession the business community 
and opposition labor party say no it isnt the government 
argues 
mrs thatcher likes a strong pound because it adds up to tighter 
monetary policy it fights inflation by forcing companies to keep 
export prices competitive by keeping wages and other costs down 
but as a strong pound forces export prices higher it becomes 
harder for british companies to compete overseas corporate profits 
can fall and jobs can be lost 
yes erm would impose a small discipline for bringing 
inflation down but it does so at the expense of growth said 
avinash persaud a monetary economist at the london investment firm 
ubs phillips and drew 
britain becomes the tenth of the 12 european community 
currencies to enter the exchange rate mechanism currencies of 
britain and spain are allowed to flucutate 6 percent from the 
agreed rate and the others are allowed to swing 225 percent in 
either direction still outside the mechanism are the portuguese 
escudo and greek drachma 
central banks of erm member countries are required to buy or 
sell currencies to keep the exchange rate within the prescribed 
band 
the erm is intended to provide stable exchange rates that make 
business planning easier and reduce disruptions to economic 
strategies of the ec and its member states 
after years of pressure from erm advocates mrs thatcher in 
june 1989 promised to join once british inflation fell closer into 
line with the ec average of 55 percent and once capital flowed 
freely in europe 
britain has decided to join even though inflation stands at 106 
percent because the rate is headed downward mrs thatcher said 
friday she has kept interest rates at 15 percent for a year to 
fight inflation by slowing consumer demand 
the fact that our policies are working and are seen to be 
working have made both these decisions possible she said 
entering the mechanism would underpin our antiinflationary 
stance she said 
britain said the pound would enter the erm at a rate of 295 
german marks 
by entering britain fulfilled its commitment to the first part 
of a threestage plan for the economic and monetary union of the ec 
nations 
but while spurring monetary union the move also strengthened 
mrs thatchers hand in fighting the next two stages a single 
currency and central banking system 
it will make the path easier said geoffrey dicks who 
teaches at the london business schol but it also will give the 
uk a stronger base from which to launch its serious criticisms 
instead of a single currency britain has proposed turning the 
european currency unit into a 13th common european currency to be 
used alongside the existing 12 ec currencies

here in questionandanswer form is an 
explanation of europes exchange rate mechanism or erm 
what is the erm 
it is a feature of the european monetary system that limits the 
fluctuations of european community currencies 
why was it set up 
it was set up in march 1979 to prevent disruptive exchange rate 
swings the fixed exchange rates which had supported european 
economies since world war ii had broken down and the floating rates 
were creating havoc for the 12nation community 
who belongs to the erm 
with newly joining britain 10 ec countries still to join are 
portugal and greece 
how does the erm work 
the erm limits how much the currencies can move up or down 
against one another most of the members observe a margin of 225 
percent above or below agreed rates but britain and spain use a 6 
percent band which gives their governments more breathing space 
how do countries keep their currencies within those bands 
central banks intervene buying or selling currencies or 
changing their interest rates 
does it always work 
no sometimes inflation or other economic conditions threaten to 
push a currency beyond its band when that happens the members 
realign the system by mutual agreement changing the basic rates of 
one or more currencies to relieve the pressure there have been 14 
rate or band realignments since 1979 the last was on jan 8 when 
italy switched from the 6percent to the 225 percent band 
does the erm affect european exchange rates against the dollar 
it has no direct bearing on these currencies values against 
nonec currencies

the united auto workers union and ford 
motor co have tentatively agreed on a national labor contract 
nearly identical to one reached with general motors corp last 
month 
the threeyear agreement reached with ford on sunday like the 
one reached with gm includes a 3 percent pay raise in the first 
year lumpsum payments of 3 percent of wages in the second and 
third years an income guarantee for laidoff workers and no change 
in healthcare benefits 
if the pact wins final approval the union will turn its 
attention to the last of the big three domestic automakers 
chrysler corp said uaw president owen bieber 
he added that he isnt worried about comments chrysler officials 
made after the gm contract was negotiated that they would have 
trouble affording the same deal 
the no 3 us automakers thirdquarter losses promise to wipe 
out the 251 million it earned in the first two quarters of this 
year 
i dont get all shook up with them telling me how bad they 
are bieber said sunday 
he added that the pace of talks between the uaw and chrysler 
would pick up soon but said he wasnt sure when he would go to 
chryslers headquarters in highland park 
were going to go to chrysler as soon as we get the work done 
here he said 
uaws 135member ford bargaining council meets in dearborn on 
tuesday for briefings on the ford pact by bieber and uaw vice 
president ernie lofton who heads the unions ford department 
the group of presidents and heads of bargaining committees from 
the uaws 44 locals at 79 ford locations nationwide must approve 
the contract before it is sent to the approximately 100000 members 
for a ratification vote 
lofton said he wants to have the ratification process finished 
by oct 21 the agreement with gm was ratified by the companys 
workers in an 80 percent to 20 percent vote announced a week ago 
among the provisions of the contracts the uaw negotiated with gm 
and ford are 
a 3 percent increase in base wages in the first year and 
lumpsum payments of 3 percent of wages in the second and third 
years with no changes in the costofliving protections for wages 
a commitment by the companies to fully pay employees laid off 
for more than 36 weeks during the next three years because of sales 
slumps gm said it would spend up to 4 billion and bieber 
estimated that the ford commitment would be about 15 billion 
two lumpsum payments to retirees totaling 1260 
a new schedule of penalties for scheduling excessive overtime 
ranging up to 5 an hour the previous maximum was 125 an hour 
no change in healthcare provisions 
the overtime penalty appeared to be the most worrisome to ford 
as talks accelerated last week ford makes more liberal use of 
overtime than gm or chrysler 
but the overtime penalty doesnt appear to be a problem in the 
near future because car and truck sales are down and economic 
recovery doesnt appear to be close at hand said ford chairman 
harold poling

persistent uncertainty about possible war in 
the persian gulf and fear of crude oil shortages sent retail gas 
prices upward an average 6 cents per gallon over the past two 
weeks an industry analyst says 
since the iraqi invasion of oilrich kuwait in early august the 
average price of gasoline nationwide has jumped 26 cents a gallon 
at the pump since the crisis began an international embargo has 
blocked all iraqi oil exports 
the sale of kuwaiti oil also was banned to prevent iraqi leader 
saddam hussein from making money on appropriated crude oil 
reserves increases in oil market prices were passed on to 
consumers quickly 
the cause of course is the continued passthrough of higher 
crude oil prices which is driven by fears of shortages due to 
confrontation in the middle east analyst trilby lundberg said 
sunday in a telephone interview 
the latest biweekly lundberg survey of 13500 gasoline stations 
nationwide showed the overall price of gas for all grades 
including taxes was 14420 cents per gallon the survey was taken 
friday 
the average price was 584 cents higher than the average derived 
from a sept 21 lundberg sampling she said 
the lundberg surveys overall average price on july 20 the 
latest preinvasion sample was nearly 118 a gallon 
the price increases have really put on speed said lundberg 
adding that she was unable to predict whether prices would continue 
their upward spiral 
its entirely dependent on what the crude oil market does 
lundberg said its insecurity but not a world shortage the 
sensitivity of the market is tremendous 
the survey taken friday showed the average price of regular 
leaded gasoline including taxes at selfserve pumps was 13059 
cents per gallon at full service stations regular leaded averaged 
15221 cents 
selfserve unleaded was 13356 cents per gallon and 
fullservice unleaded was 15511 premium unleaded was 14995 cents 
per gallon at selfserve and 16879 at full service 
lundberg notes selfservice customers represent more than 80 
percent of gasoline sales the full service prices really 
represent a specialty service that not too many use she said

the us dollar plummeted to a 1year low against 
the japanese yen in heavy trading today because of rising pessimism 
over the us economy traders said stock prices soared 
the us currency dropped 367 yen from fridays close ending 
the day at 13005 yen it was the dollars lowest closing level 
since march 15 1989 when it ended at 12988 yen 
the dollar also fell against european currencies 
toshiaki kakimoto a senior analyst with sumitomo bank said 
investors unloaded the dollar because of a belief the us federal 
reserve will lower interest rates following fridays release of 
worsening us labor statistics 
he said the failure to reach a deficitreduction accord also 
added to pessimism these factors made investors think that us 
economic fundamentals are not likely to improve kakimoto said 
a narrowing interest rate gap between the two countries also 
made the dollar less attractive analysts said 
compared to fridays 794 percent federal funds rate japans 
counterpart call rate was only slightly lower at 765 percent 
today 
on the tokyo stock exchange the 225issue nikkei stock average

friday 
volume on the markets first section was estimated at 400 
million shares compared with fridays 450 million 
stock prices soared as investors encouraged by the stronger yen 
and rising bond prices went bargain hunting traders said 
indexlinked buying also helped to send stock prices higher 
in bond dealings the price of benchmark no 119 10year 
japanese bonds closed higher at 8354 up from fridays 8290 
their yield ended at 8020 percent down from fridays 8170

the employee group trying to buy ual corp the 
parent of united airlines says it has failed for the second time 
in two months to get bank financing but it plans a bid tuesday 
using money from other sources 
one analyst gave the endeavor little chance of success and said 
the waning value of the groups offer is beginning to resemble a 
k mart bluelight special 
gerald greenwald chief executive officer of the united employee 
acquisition corp announced sunday that the 2 billion in bank 
financing his group had hoped to assemble had disintegrated he 
blamed tight credit and economic uncertainties following the 
persian gulf crisis 
the group instead will use a combination of cash and equity from 
other sources to meet a tuesday deadline to offer a bid he said 
greenwald declined comment on how much the bid would total a 
statement from his group said only that it would be substantially 
higher than the current price of ual stock which closed at 10275 
a share friday on the new york stock exchange 
substitute financing is to come from company suppliers 
saleleaseback arrangements in which the company sells equipment 
such as airplanes and leases them back employee investments and 
cash on hand greenwald said 
were trying to come to the board with in total an equally 
attractive package he said in a telephone interview from new 
york we are trying to make up the shortfall in cash with some 
other features 
but analyst stephen dexter of kemper financial services inc in 
chicago said he believes it will be very difficult to persuade 
suppliers to finance the deal and also to sell the board on an 
inevitably lower buyout offer than the 165 to 175 per share the 
group was believed to have been readying 
its starting to look like a k mart bluelight special he 
said youre marking down the price and marking down the price 
until finally you get financing 
two months ago when the board granted the employee group an 
extension to arrange financial backing the employees were working 
on a 201ashare offer 
that was far less than the 300ashare bid that pilots and 
management were trying to put together a year ago when financing 
collapsed 
whatever the bid the price should be higher than the value of 
rival american airlines about 38 billion dexter said 
particularly since taking a company private should add a premium to 
the price 
if the united employees offered 165 to 175 a share the total 
would amount to 36 billion to 38 billion 
the two united and american are very similar in size very 
similar in domestic networks but united has the real jewel of the 
airlines industry the pacific division dexter said 
its much more profitable than the domestic or atlantic 
division you should be paying more for that not less if board 
members take out their pocket calculators theyre going to find it 
just doesnt compute 
dexter said if the board rejects the bid on tuesday he believes 
the employeebuyout effort is a dead deal 
greenwald said the banks were attracted by the deal but 
concerned about economic uncertainties 
some of the banks who declined to participate said yours is 
the best proposal and most tempting one weve seen all year but 
were just very worried about the economy greenwald said

extra production by opec members in 
september made up for 3 million of the 4 million barreladay loss 
caused by the iraqkuwait crisis the middle east economic survey 
reported monday 
but the respected newsletter said the world still faces a 
shortfall in the fourth quarter of this year 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
produced an average 2249 million barrels a day in september the 
nicosiabased oil newsletter said in july the cartel was producing 
235 million barrels a day 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the world embargo on 
exports from those two major producers cut 4 million barrels a day 
from opec quota exports 
the middle east economic survey said in september the increased 
production came from saudi arabia with an extra 21 million barrels 
a day venezuela 305000 nigeria 260000 iran 250000 and libya 
100000 
it should not be forgotten that the world production system is 
operating at a very full stretch the newsletter said 
it said opec crude production of 225 million barrels a day 
compared with projected demand by the international energy agency 
of 239 million barrels a day in the fourth quarter this would 
leave a need for consumers to draw down existing reserve stocks of 
14 million barrels a day in the quarter 
saudi arabias oil minister hisham nazer has estimated world 
reserve stocks at 700 million barrels 
the middle east economic survey said however that saudi arabia 
plans to increase its production another 300000 barrels a day to 
78 million barrels a day in october with possible further 
increments to be forthcoming in future months 
the newsletter said total opec production might be increased by 
500000 barrels a day to 23 million by the end of the year mainly 
from saudi arabia

consumer sugar prices are starting to level 
off and agriculture department analysts say domestic and global 
supplies are large enough to help dampen them for a while 
on the world level it looks like prices should stay about 
where theyre at says peter buzzanell of the departments 
economic research service the reason is that we see more of a 
balance in world supply and demand 
buzzanell said in a telephone interview that growth in 
consumption out paced production and led to an upturn in prices 
in the last several years 
however he said the price of raw sugar delivered to caribbean 
ports lately has been just a little more than 10 cents per pound 
compared to the 13 or 14 cents a few months ago 
in the united states buzzanell said the 1990 sugar cane crop 
was hit by poor weather but the sugar beet harvest is expected to 
be improved from last year 
sugar consumption by americans is still growing but not at a 
sharp rate he said so with our new import quota were 
anticipating that well have a balanced situation and prices 
about where they are or hopefully softening a little bit 
buzzanell was asked to comment on a new sugar outlook report 
issued last week by the usda agency 
in it analysts noted that retail prices of refined sugar in the 
united states averaged 418 cents per pound in the first nine 
months of the 1990 fiscal year that ended sept 30 up 27 cents 
from the same period in 1989 
the july average was 427 cents per pound according to the 
bureau of labor statistics and it edged up to 433 cents in 
august the september prices have not yet been announced 
total domestic sugar production in the crop year that began 
sept 1 is estimated currently at 647 million short tons of 2000 
pounds each raw value down 113000 tons from 198990 production 
beet sugar output was estimated at 377 million tons up 11 
percent from the drought and freezedamage crop of 198990 but 
cane sugar production is expected to be only 27 million tons down 
15 percent because severe freeze damage and drought in louisiana 
a new tariffrate quota was announced on sept 14 by 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter under it the united states 
will import slightly more than 19 million tons of raw sugar during 
the year that began oct 1 
under the new system a twotiered quota level is used allowing 
a fixed amount of sugar into the united states at a relatively low 
duty rate of 0625 cents per pound and additional imports at a 
much higher duty an additional 16 cents per pound 
the socalled trq system replaces an absolute quota which had 
regulated us sugar imports since 1982 the report said 
australia had complained about the earlier method of quotas and 
the united states was found to be in violation of rules under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade the trq method puts the 
united states in compliance under gatt the report said 
 
washington ap the number of cattle herds under quarantine 
for brucellosis has edged below 1000 for the first time since the 
eradication program began nearly 60 years ago 
according to agriculture department officials at the beginning 
of september there were 959 cattle herds quarantined for the 
disease down from 1005 herds a month earlier 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service reducing the quarantine herds to 
below 1000 marks a significant point in the history of the 
cooperative statefederal program against brucellosis 
in the early 1930s when eradication efforts first started 5 
percent of the nations cattle herds were estimated to be infected 
with brucellosis a disease that causes abortions and lowers milk 
production he said by the late 1950s there were nearly 
124000 herds under quarantine by 1980 this had been cut to 
7074 by 1985 to 4533 
currently 29 states and the us virgin islands have been 
declared free of brucellosis 
 
washington ap rising milk production has boosted the output 
of butter and other dairy products according to a monthly report 
by the agriculture department 
in august butter production was estimated at 838 million 
pounds up 4 percent from august 1989 the report said 
total cheese production was reported at 488 million pounds up 7 
percent from a year earlier and nonfat dry milk for human food 
was estimated at 629 million pounds a 20 percent increase 
milk production in 1990 is forecast at a record 1477 billion 
pounds compared with 1443 billion last year and the previous high 
of 1452 billion pounds in 1988

texas and oklahoma led an increase in the number 
of working oil and natural gas rigs in the united states which 
rose 17 this week to 1064 baker hughes inc reported monday 
the houstonbased toolmaker reported monday the count was up 
from last weeks 1047 and was above the number for the same week 
a year ago when 960 rigs were working across the country 
the rise for the week was led primarily by oklahoma which 
reported a gain of six rigs for the week and texas which reported 
a gain of four 
seasonally this is the time when the rig count rises said 
ic kerridge a baker hughes vice president and keeper of the 
count 
kerridge said the rig count dropped the last two weeks and 
this may be getting back on the seasonal track 
bakerhughes has kept track of the rig count the widely 
watched index of drilling activity since 1940 the count 
represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil not those 
producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
kerridge said higher oil prices have not yet affected the rig 
count but said a 9 percent jump in workover rigs used for routine 
maintenance on producing rigs was attributable to the higher 
prices 
were looking for a strong fourth quarter kerridge said 
people would like to see some stability and oil prices staying at 
a reasonably high level if that continues will see increases in 
the rig count 
besides oklahoma and texas other major oil producing states 
that reported gains for the week included colorado up two 
louisiana up four new mexico up three and pennsylvania up one 
among states reporting a loss in drilling activity for the week 
were california down two kansas down one ohio down one and 
wyoming down five north dakotas rig count was unchanged

it isnt just money an april attendance report showed that only 
21 schools had 90 percent to 94 percent attendance each day a 
dress code took effect this fall a measure to curb violence such 
as the shooting of an osborn high school student over his 135 
jacket and the slaying of a kettering high school student who was 
stripped of his coat and 70 sneakers 
mayoral spokesman bob berg says racism is part of the citys 
trouble the citys about 70 percent black the suburbs are 
white he says 
there are people who brag about not coming downtown in years 
they say its not racial but it is 
detroits black population soared from 289 percent to 631 
percent between 1960 and 1980 census data shows detroits 1980 
black population was the largest among the nations 10 major 
cities 
the racial divide between detroit and its suburbs is deepening

unemployment includes people who have given up looking for jobs a

ibm hungary is the giant computer 
companys window on the east 
the subsidiary was one of the few western companies to weather 
more than four decades of communism in hungary now it is serving 
as ibms model for expansion in the rest of eastern europe 
perhaps the reason communist authorities allowed a little bit of 
capitalism to survive all those years is that it filled a vital 
need it serviced ibm machines that were used to perform the census 
and other recordkeeping said eugen k hahn managing director of 
eastern european operations for international business machines 
corp 
we took care of the equipment so we protected the investment 
the government made he said in an interview at ibms modernistic 
headquarters building in a residential neighborhood 
ibm hungary employs nearly 100 people all hungarians to sell 
and service the companys products 
zsuzsa branyik who resigned as general manager of ibm hungary 
in april after about 20 years recalled how the subsidiary managed 
to survive during the communist years even though it was limited 
largely to servicing equipment not selling new machines 
at one point in the 1960s even the service operation was shut 
down and the engineers transferred to the state but in the early 
1970s the company was given back its employees and began to 
flourish 
it would be wonderful for me to work today so many things 
are much much easier said mrs branyik the only female head of 
a country organization ibm has ever had 
ibm has sales and service representatives throughout the former 
east bloc but it wants to establish a greater presence in these 
nations along the lines of ibm hungry hahn said 
to increase its presence ibm has donated computers to 
universities in several eastern european nations as part of what it 
calls its academic initiative in exchange the universities are 
expected to develop software and ties to local industry 
ibm also plans to tie these universities together in a computer 
network and then link that network to the west one of the first 
such computer connections in the former east bloc hahn said

christopher sinclairstevenson a courteous old 
etonian in the tough world of british publishing broke away to set 
up on his own after 28 years with one company and struck gold with 
his first book 
sinclairstevenson ltd sold 60000 copies of a life of 
everpopular charles dickens in less than two weeks at 1995 pounds 
3770 each the sales sent dickens to second place on the 
sunday times bestseller list behind a book on cricket 
but what shook the book trade was the large sum of 650000 
pounds nearly 13 million offered by the fledgling independent 
publisher to peter ackroyd an admired writer who tackled dickens 
after doing other literary lives some in novel form 
it was an unusually large amount of money but ackroyd has a 
good reputation and track record and the offer also covers a book 
he is writing about william blake the publisher said 
sinclairstevenson 51 talked in the office he set up with a 
staff of 10 in a charming kensington mews 
he launched his company and the dickens book sept 3 just over 
a year after leaving the respected hardback publishing house of 
hamish hamilton his only employer since he left cambridge 
university with a modern languages degree his last 15 years with 
the firm were spent as managing director 
he didnt like the changed atmosphere when the firm which had 
earlier been sold to the canadabased thomson group was sold again 
to penguin the giant paperback publisher 
from friends and contacts he raised 24 million pounds 45 
million to start his own company when authors whose books he 
edited found he was leaving they went with him including ackroyd 
sinclairstevenson is steering clear of paperback publishing 
and a large slice of ackroyds advance came from selling the 
paperback rights in dickens to other companies sales of the 
hardback should comfortably make up the balance he said 
the new publishers first catalog is half fiction and the rest 
mostly travel memoirs and contemporary history wellknown writers 
such as paul theroux an wilson and jk galbraith are on the 
list and of the 27 books 20 are by authors from his old 
employers 
he handled most of the hamish hamilton authors who were 
finalists over the years for the booker prize the literary event 
of the year in britain 
most people thought william boyd who was a finalist in 1982 
with an icecream war should have been nominated again this year 
for brazzaville beach which we submitted we will be in some 
difficulty next year deciding which three of our novelists to put 
in the publisher said 
publishing is big business total book sales in britain were 
worth 22 billion pounds 41 billion last year book exports 
amounted to a further 655 million pounds 12 billion 
the industry is dominated by about a dozen companies among 
them macmillan the oxford and cambridge university presses and 
harpercollins and news international which belong to media magnate 
rupert murdoch 
publishing has changed vastly from the days when it was 
considered a leisurely occupation for gentlemen revered imprints 
have disappeared while others cling to their identities in the 
embrace of multinationals and conglomerates 
i think publishers take over other publishers to stop other 
publishers taking them over when they become big they want to be 
strongly based everywhere sinclairstevenson said 
a big organization has clout in the marketplace it can afford 
expensive authors has more power in dealing with bookshops and a 
bigger presence in the publishing world he said 
corporate life is very different to that of an independent 
publisher i began to feel the imperatives in the penguin group 
were systems rather than books 
editors are concerned with publishing and selling but 
conglomerates keep looking at their internal affairs they work to 
dotted lines call meetings and tell people what to do their 
authors get missed out he said 
when i left in july 1989 a lot of the authors i was handling 
were my personal friends and i suppose they thought i was a good 
publisher and would do their future books well i think they felt 
that once id gone their connection with hamish hamilton ceased 
they wouldnt know anyone there 
writers are important sinclairstevenson said they lead 
rather lonely lives they are not going to an office every day and 
they need encouraging to write and to live as well i like to 
publish authors i know and like i find it difficult to publish 
authors i dont like 
he thinks the spate of mergers isnt good for publishing 
it concentrates too much power in too few hands narrows the 
choice for the author and reduces the contact between the author 
his agent and the publishers he said i think we did dickens 
as well as any conglomerate and possibly better because its our 
lifeblood 
we are hungrier he said we have no fat to live off

a new european proposal to slash government 
farm subsidies to break a deadlock with the united states in world 
trade talks would sacrifice farmers an organization of european 
farm groups said monday 
european agriculture ministers considered the plan monday for 
the first time since it was unveiled last week by the european 
commission the executive body of the 12nation european 
community 
the ministers planned to discuss the proposal next monday after 
getting more details on how the plan would affect farmers 
copa an umbrella organization for farm groups announced its 
opposition to the plan immediately copa president joseph yverneau 
said the proposals are unacceptable and we totally reject them 
they are totally sacrificing the agriculture sector he told 
a news conference we should not be put on our knees 
yverneau a french farmer estimated that at least half the 
farmers in europe would be affected adversely by the farm plan 
the communitys new proposal calls for a 30 percent reduction in 
farm subsidies for such major products as cereals rice sugar and 
livestock over the period 1986 to 1996 a 10 percent cut is offered 
in fruits vegetables and tobacco 
no specific trims are suggested in the communitys costly export 
subsidy program but the proposal signals a willingness to 
negotiate reductions with other nations 
germanys agriculture minister ignaz kiechle said the proposal 
didnt gain much initial support from the european farm officals 
he said 10 of the 12 farm chiefs were critical to very critical 
of the proposal 
british agriculture secretary john gummer who supports subsidy 
trims challenged the united states to meet the trading blocs 
proposal 
i would very much like to see the americans match it he 
said 
the dispute over farm payments has stalled the uruguay round of 
international trade talks which are designed to overhaul the world 
trading system 
the fouryear negotiations which end in december are aimed at 
reducing barriers to trade in 15 areas including agriculture 
textiles and other manufactured goods and services such as banking 
and investment 
the american push to get the community to do more to cut its 
farm payments has angered its trading partner 
gummer said the export subsidies are part and parcel of the 
communitys farm program 
just because the united states doesnt like the system we use 
doesnt mean for some reason or other we shouldnt have a 
measurement which is fair to everybody he said 
he also told reporters the us government is a very major 
subsidizer of its farmers 
the bush administration is expected to unveil a new bargaining 
position on farm payments before a deadline next monday at the 
trade talks 
the us position is expected to include a 10year plan for 
reductions of up to 70 percent in domestic supports and import 
duties and more than that in export subsidies 
the us has backed off a previous demand for elimination of 
export subsidies 
the american plan also would force the community to widen its 
markets to foreign farm goods and slash farm payments that 
encourage overproduction 
the trade ministers gather later this week to discuss the 
proposal before it is formally put on the table at the trade talks 
the uruguay round is being held under the auspices of the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade a forum and agreement for 
removing trade barriers

trading on a soviet stock exchange could start 
next year but foreigners probably will remain on the sidelines 
until the ruble is convertible the chairman of the new york stock 
exchange said monday 
its not going to look like some kind of enormous exchange 
but it could begin in a modest way chairman john phelan jr said 
in an interview at moscows international trade center i think 
its a real possibility 
phelan and a delegation of 20 prominent wall street businessmen 
were invited to moscow to give a threeday seminar on the nuts and 
bolts of running a stock market dealings in stocks and bonds has 
been illegal in the soviet union since the 1917 revolution 
the kremlin with the enthusiastic backing of budding soviet 
speculators and entrepreneurs is preparing to allow the return of 
financial markets as part of the transition to a free market 
economy the most radical economic blueprints under consideration 
call for the establishment of a stock exchange within 100 days 
phelan predicted that whatever economic plan is finally adopted 
within the next 18 months the government will have reorganized 
financial structures permitted the development of private 
companies and lifted legal restrictions on private transactions 
between individuals 
that would be the logical time for the stock exchange to 
form he said adding it could begin as soon as late 1991 
more than 400 soviet bankers economists academics and 
government officials attended the crash course on securities 
american style seeking explanations for several concepts foreign 
to communist ideology and to their command economy 
how does a company get listed on the nyse one asked how do you 
prevent the government from meddling in market prices do american 
stock exchanges compete with one another how are dividends paid 
joseph grano president for retail sales and marketing of 
painewebber inc said it was critical that private ownership 
develop at the same time as a stock exchange for this dream to 
come to fruition 
he recommended the privatization of large state enterprises 
particularly in the oil industry before allowing more private 
ownership of smaller riskier businesses 
they need some success stories and if they can show a high 
concentration of workers a high concentration of investors how it 
works and how successful it can be then i believe youve started 
changes in the mindset grano said in an interview 
since june the government has permitted the creation of 
jointstock companies although it usually retains a majority of 
shares finance minister valentin pavlov told the seminar more than 
400 such companies have been set up 
the genies out of the bottle nothing can get it back in 
again said william schreyer chairman and chief executive 
officer of merrill lynch amp co inc during a break in the seminar 
phelan later told a news conference that longterm foreign 
investment in a soviet stock market probably would require a fully 
convertible ruble the right to export profits and the right to 
receive dividends in a stable currency the state now controls the 
price of the ruble against world currencies 
the soviet public will need to overcome its lingering sentiment 
that profits are wrong and based on exploitation and its fear of 
taking financial risks several wall street participants said 
you have to learn to fall before you can walk said lawyer 
joseph flon there will be ups and there will be downs the 
market reflects changes in society changes in the world 
schreyer said public education is still needed but added i 
just got the sense that maybe profit wasnt quite as dirty a word 
as it was 
the soviet government has licensed one brokerage house although 
it hasnt started work yet a committee of business people said it 
hopes to register the first stock exchange in moscow next month 
regardless of whether the government has passed the necessary laws 
we dont have anything we dont have space we dont have the 
specialists said banker yuri chetverikov we have only ideas 
and people are very eager to structure this kind of business

stock market and foreign exchange traders 
responded enthusiastically monday to britains sudden entry of the 
pound into the mechanism that regulates most european currency 
exchange rates 
british homeowners were optimistic that chancellor of the 
exchequer john majors simultaneous announcement friday of a 1 
percent drop in interest rates could signal a turnaround from two 
years of economic gloom 
the exchange rate mechanism erm of the european monetary 
system links european currencies to avert huge swings in exchange 
rates with british membership 10 of the currencies of the 
12nation european community are linked in the system 
portugal and greece still have not added their currencies bank 
of portugal governor jose tavares moreira said monday that portugal 
would not be rushed into the system despite britains entry 
there had been speculation in the market friday that the escudo 
could follow the pound 
under the rules of ems membership the british government must 
halt any rise in the pound outside its upper band of 313 german 
marks to the pound 
sterling is allowed to range within 6 percent of its central 
rate of 296 so its lowest exchange rate is 277 marks 
if the currency goes too high britain must lower its exchange 
rate either by selling sterling or reducing interest rates 
britains entry to the ems boosted the pound to 303 marks on 
monday from 299 at fridays close on the foreign exchange markets 
the dollarpound exchange rate is not directly affected by 
britains entry into the system but the pound soared against the 
dollar monday on concerns about the us economy and the lack of a 
plan for budget deficit cuts in the united states currency dealers 
said 
the pound rose in london to 19745 from 19455 late friday and 
in new york to 19760 from 19525 
economists said entry into the system wont be a panacea but 
said it was long overdue 
weve joined a club we should have been in for quite some 
time said trevor cass foreign exchange manager at barclays de 
zoete wedd over the last five years we have seen the european 
economies benefiting from erm the uk wants a slice of that

hands 
this is the first fresh buying we have seen in ages one 
trader said 
the initial euphoria has faded and in the cold light of day 
there are other things to look at besides erm another trader 
said 
those other things included the continuing persian gulf crisis 
ian amstad senior economist at chase investment bank said the 
markets initial kneejerk reaction to entry has passed people 
are now going away to think about what it all means 
the producer price input figure released monday showed the 
sharpest monthly jump in 14 years a 22 percent increase from 
august to september 
the more trustworthy inflation indicator the consumer price 
index is due out friday inflation was running at 106 percent in 
august an 8year high septembers figure is expected to be 
higher because of oil price increases 
but british homeowners and mortgage brokers were optimistic that 
interest rates fell to 14 percent 
in luxembourg major shrugged off criticism that the drop was 
made for political reasons recent polls have shown the labor party 
with a 12 percent to 145 percent lead over the governing 
conservative party which was to begin its annual political 
conference tuesday 
he said he reduced rates because uk domestic monetary and 
real circumstances in my judgment merited it 
britains slumping building societies the equivalent of us 
savings and loans moved quickly to lower mortgage rates after 
major announced the 14 percent rate 
sharon chilcott spokeswoman for bristol and west building 
society said the mortgage market had been slow for about two 
years

soybean futures prices soared as much as 17 cents a bushel 
monday on the chicago board of trade amid heavy speculative buying 
spurred by harvest delays in the soggy midwest grain futures also 
advanced 
on other commodity markets energy futures rose precious metals 
were mixed pork futures fell sharply and cattle were mixed 
soybeans settled 5 cents to 17 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in november up 17 cents at 634 a bushel october 
soybean meal surged 840 to 19180 a ton 
wheat futures settled 2 cents to 5 cents higher with december 
at 279 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 5 cents higher with 
december at 234 a bushel oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with 
december at 123 a bushel 
soybean futures opened modestly higher and climbed gradually 
until about an hour before the close when sudden strength in the 
soymeal market sparked rounds of buying by chartbased speculators 
analysts said 
it was katiebarthedoor and we had a strong run to the 
close said david armstrong soybean analyst with agrivisor 
services inc in bloomington ill 
cold rainy weather kept farmers from their fields across a 
broad band of the midwestern soybean country sunday and monday 
farmers in some areas may have to wait two or three days for fields 
to dry out said gerald zusel manager of balfour maclaine corps 
graintrading operations in chicago 
in addition to delaying the soybean harvest which is less than 
half complete rain can cause yield losses 
every time you wet a mature soybean pod and it dries out 
again it cracks open a little more and the beans can fall out so 
more of them end up on the ground and fewer of them end up in the 
machine armstrong said 
the rally followed a usda report late friday that us exporters 
had sold 205000 metric tons of us soybean meal to the soviet 
union in addition to the 150000 metric tons reported earlier 
but zusel said the market already had discounted the meal sales 
which were the subject of rumors early last week 
crude oil and gasoline futures rose sharply on the new york 
mercantile exchange reflecting continued bullishness amid a lack 
of conciliatory gestures by iraq in the persian gulf standoff 
the markets have a natural tendency to stick with a trend 
until its reversed said peter beutel energy analyst with the 
pegasus econometric group a commodities research firm in hoboken 
nj 
light sweet crude oil settled 5 cents to 96 cents higher with 
november at 3895 a barrel heating oil was 26 cent to 12 cents 
higher with november at 10296 a gallon unleaded gasoline was 65 
cent to 111 cents higher with november at 9375 cents a gallon 
gold futures rose moderately on new yorks commodity exchange 
following crude oil but silver futures finished narrowly mixed 
gold settled 120 to 130 higher with october at 39490 a 
troy ounce silver was 07 cent lower to 03 cent higher with 
december at 4728 a troy ounce 
pork futures tumbled on the chicago mercantile exchange after 
posting sharp gains last week cattle futures were mixed 
all pork belly contracts fell the permitted daily limit of 2 
cents a pound amid profit taking hog futures also dropped sharply 
pressured by spillover selling from the belly pit and by lower cash 
hog prices 
live cattle settled 25 cent lower to 05 cent higher with 
october at 7925 cents a pound feeder cattle were 37 cent lower 
to 33 cent higher with october at 8815 cents a pound hogs were

a plan to create a new rail link between key 
east coast ports and the canadian interior may fall apart because 
of a short stretch of tracks between buffalo and niagara falls 
ny 
the tracks known as the buffaloniagara gateway belong to 
the consolidated rail corp which has gone to a special court over 
the dispute with canadian pacific ltd 
i wouldnt want to be in the position of saying whats 
motivating conrail in all of this but certainly a major competitor 
in their back yard has got to be of concern to them canadian 
pacific spokesman john cox said last week 
there are two issues embedded in one whether the trackage 
rights are available to us and second what the cost will be 
right now were blocked on both fronts he said 
canadian pacific has offered to buy the financially ailing 
delaware amp hudson railway and link it at niagara falls to cp rail 
tracks into southern ontario if it cant get the trackage rights 
cp may withdraw its 25 million offer cox said 
cox said the stretch of track was about 15 miles long on 
monday conrail said it was 30 miles cox could not be reached to 
resolve the discrepancy because of the canadian holiday of 
thanksgiving on monday the spokesman for damph was not in his office 
monday 
the link is vital to canadian pacifics plan to use the damph 
system to connect the ports of philadelphia and new york with the 
canadian interior if cp can put all the pieces together it will 
be competing directly with conrail for freight in the northeast 
the damph the nations oldest continually operated railroad 
filed in july 1988 for protection from its creditors under us 
bankruptcy laws the railroad which runs from montreal to 
washington and between albany and buffalo owes about 100 million 
cp took over operation of the damph in august and agreed to absorb 
any further financial losses which had been running at about 
200000 a month 
on oct 1 conrail took the track dispute to a special 
threejudge court which was created in the 1970s to oversee the 
railroad bankruptcy proceedings that created conrail court 
spokesman richard eriksen said the panel would hear the case in 
washington sometime between oct 10 and the end of the month 
conrail filed its motion with the special court because that 
court has indicated in the past that conrail should bring cases 
conrail believes are under the courts jurisdiction to the special 
court conrail spokesman david neurohr said last week 
on monday neurohr said conrail believes cp should pay its fair 
share to maintain the buffaloniagara tracks although he declined 
to give dollar amounts 
under conrails proposal cp and conrail would both contribute 
capital funds proportionate to each railroads use of the tracks 
neurohr said reading from a statement although the tracks are 
now in satisfactory condition the dramatic increase in tonnage 
proposed by cp is likely to impose an expensive maintenance and 
repair burden on conrail that would not otherwise be incurred 
conrail negotiated trackage rights with damph in 1976 but those 
rights were never exercised cox said conrail is arguing that 
those rights would not extend to cp as the new damph owner 
in addition cox said conrail is seeking to raise the percar 
cost for running trains over its tracks 
standard agreements between railways these days for operating 
trains over another railways line its a mileage rate per car 
can be anything between about 21 or 22 cents per carmile to 50 to 
55 cents per carmile he said 
that would translate to 6 to 10 per car he said 
but what theyre looking for is 145 in each direction so 
thats a bit of difference he said 
this is the second time that conrail has thrown up a roadblock 
in cps effort to buy the damph earlier this year conrail refused 
to negotiate the rights to its tracks between hagerstown md and 
harrisburg pa this led cp to withdraw its initial 35 million bid 
for the damph 
cp later offered 25 million for the damph a bid that was 
accepted in may by the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the railroads 
reorganization 
last week the interstate commerce commission added its 
unanimous vote of approval to the deal and the matter appeared to 
be headed to us bankruptcy court in wilmington del for the 
finishing touches 
but that hearing has been postponed from oct 10 to nov 2 
because of the special court case 
cp owns about 14000 miles of tracks in canada and about 5000 
in the united states

work force illiteracy is likely to be a rising 
problem during the 1990s but few corporations are preparing for an 
influx of workers who lack necessary reading skills a prominent 
research group said monday 
illiteracy has been a softly ticking time bomb across 
corporate america said leonard lund education specialist of the 
conference board while precise data are not available the 
evidence strongly suggests that the work force skills of many 
youngsters are declining at a time when new jobs are becoming 
increasingly sophisticated 
the study focused on 163 large corporations and found that 
nearly 20 percent reported problems finding people who can read 
well enough for entrylevel jobs almost half the companies said 
between 15 percent and 35 percent of their workers cannot handle 
more complex tasks 
the conference board said 10 percent of the companies surveyed 
have found up to half of their workers do not have the necessary 
skills to be promoted 
most of the companies contribute money to programs aimed at 
fighting illiteracy but few have their own programs the 
researchers said 
the conference board found that more than 70 percent of the 
surveyed companies have no formal procedures for testing 
entrylevel job candidates for reading and writing skills 
based in new york the conference board is a businessfinanced 
research organization that conducts wideranging studies into 
economic trends

interco inc a footwear and furniture maker 
struggling to bounce back from huge debt reported a loss of 353 
million or 153 a share in the second quarter 
the loss was the result of flat sales in the companys four core 
businesses along with more than 64 million in interest expenses 
paid by the st louisbased company 
chairman richard loynd said the poor performance was in line 
with what the company expected because of the soft state of the 
nations economy 
in last years second quarter interco reported a profit of 
1186 million or 243 per share but that included the sale of 
several companies including ethan allen furniture and senack 
shoes which brought the company 210 million 
sales from continuing operations in the quarter ended aug 31 
were 369 million down 14 percent from 430 million in the same 
period a year ago sales from the companys core businesses in last 
years third quarter were 3713 million 
in july interco reached an agreement with its numerous 
creditors on a complicated deal to restructure more than 16 
billion in debt that the company took on in 1988 to fend off a 
hostile takeover attempt 
the deal between interco and its banks mediumterm noteholders 
and subordinated debenture holders helped the company avert 
bankruptcy 
since 1988 interco has been selling off subsidiaries in an 
attempt to repay its debts it has retained four companies 
converse inc florsheim shoes lane co and broyhill furniture 
industries 
the plan to sell off assets to pay off the debt faltered 
however when interco subsidiaries brought far less than the 
company had anticipated 
for the first six months interco reported a loss of 765 
million or 321 per share compared with a profit of 87 million 
or 114 a share for the same period last year sales for the first 
half were 727 million down from 899 million for last years

dutch electronics giant philips 
consumer electronics confirmed monday it was developing a new 
digital cassette machine that would also play regular analog tapes 
the company said the system when used with digital tapes would 
provide the same sound quality as compact discs 
tandy corp said monday it was working with philips on the 
technology 
tandy said the systems introduction would depend on action from 
the us congress on copyright legislation record companies have 
been fearful that digital audio tapes ability to make nearperfect 
copies would encourage record piracy 
to help mollify the record companies dat was introduced in the 
united states this summer using a technical standard that prohibits 
the machines from being used to make secondgeneration recordings 
from cds 
although dat recorders were first introduced in japan three 
years ago sales have been slow because of their high cost the 
lack of prerecorded tapes and opposition from record companies 
unlike conventional digital audio tape machines the new machine 
would offer consumers the ability to continue playing their old 
tapes 
sony corp last month introduced a new line of dat machines 
including a car player and a walkmansized version 
dat like cds use use computerlike digital signals to 
reproduce sound however dat machines also allow consumers to make 
recordings that can rival studio equipment in sound quality
