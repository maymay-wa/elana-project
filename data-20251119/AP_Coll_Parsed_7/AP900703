japan is putting pressure on the bush 
administration to ease restrictions on log exports a newspaper 
reported tuesday 
according to the oregonian ryohei murata japanese ambassador 
to the united states wrote a letter to us trade representative 
carla a hills on june 15 asking the government to oppose tougher 
export restrictions 
the newspaper which obtained a copy of the letter said murata 
wrote that the restrictions seriously impede trade between the 
two countries 
we are especially concerned with the fact that there are 
active movements in the us congress to further strengthen log 
export restrictions murata wrote we strongly request that the 
us government take effective actions to oppose such legislation 
japan the biggest foreign buyer of us logs imported 47 
billion board feet of logs from the united states last year china 
imported about 17 billion board feet and south korea imported less 
than half that amount 
legislation is moving through congress that would make permanent 
the annual ban on exporting federal logs from the west except 
alaskan logs and ban log exports from most state lands 
the bush administration supported such measures june 19 in a 
statement about declining timber supplies and the listing of the 
northern spotted owl as a threatened species 
some proponents of a log export ban believe it would encourage 
overseas buyers to use us sawmills 
japans foreign ministry says the existing ban on exports of 
federal logs in the west violates the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade the international agreement governing most trade as 
would further restrictions us forest products industry leaders 
also oppose the legislation fearing losses to japanese sawmills 
hills said in a reply to murata that the administration had told 
congress of concerns about the effects of trade restrictions 
we will continue to seek to ensure that any actions taken in 
this area especially in the context of domestic conservation 
programs are to the maximum extent possible consistent with our 
international obligations hills said 
shotaro yachi economic counselor at the japanese embassy in 
washington called hills letter vague 
we wanted a strong commitment yachi said we have been 
importing logs from your country and wed like to continue 
japan has about 17500 sawmills which employ 131000 workers 
nishitani could not estimate the number of jobs that depend on us 
log imports 
japan imports logs dutyfree but levies tariffs on many 
processed wood products washington persuaded tokyo during the 
yearlong wood products talks to lower some tariffs to boost exports 
of finished lumber to japan

transport secretary cecil parkinson says his 
department will investigate how a man testing security at londons 
heathrow airport was able to check a fake bomb aboard a british 
airways flight to the united states 
the man dr jim swire whose daughter flora was among those 
killed in the dec 21 1988 bombing of pan am flight 103 met with 
parkinson earlier monday and detailed how he managed to fool guards 
at heathrow in the may test 
swire heads a group of british relatives of the disasters 
victims called uk familiesflight 103 
the bomb aboard flight 103 exploded as the passenger jet flew 
over lockerbie scotland on its way to new york killing all 259 
people aboard the boeing 747 and 11 others on the ground flight 
103 originated in frankfurt in west germany changing planes at 
heathrow 
swire told reporters after his 90minute meeting with parkinson 
and other aviation officials that he would continue to press 
british authorities to improve airline security 
i think you will find we will not go away until they have 
he said 
swire disclosed details of his privately organized security test 
in a radio interview sunday he said the device he used was a 
nonexplosive replica of the one that exploded over lockerbie 
british and us investigators have said they believe the bomb 
that downed flight 103 was placed by palestinian terrorists and had 
a barometric trigger set to detonate at a predetermined altitude 
swire said in the interview sunday that the fake device he used 
at heathrow in may was packed in a radiocassette recorder like 
the lockerbie bomb but used marzipan icing instead of semtex 
plastic explosives 
it had a dummy detonator which would have shown up on xray 
an extra printed circuit board extra batteries pressure 
transducer and so on all wired up in a form that would have worked 
if the marzipan had been replaced with semtex he said in the 
interview 
our flight was selected for what they call special security 
and our cases were opened and searched in front of us the 
radiocassette recorder was picked up and i was asked whether i 
had taken the batteries out and i correctly replied yes i had 
taken the batteries out it was then replaced in the suitcase and 
is now in america

president bush is suggesting a change in 
natos nuclear doctrine that is a modest shift away from atomic 
brinkmanship analysts say but the cold war question remains when 
would the west use its deadly nuclear arms 
that question has confounded allied leaders for most of natos 
41year history 
the answer has never been clear but the issue is regaining a 
policy spotlight as the western allies try to overhaul the north 
atlantic treaty organization and adjust their defense strategies to 
political changes in eastern europe 
administration sources said monday that bush will propose at a 
nato summit thursday that alliance doctrine be revised to declare 
that nuclear arms are weapons of last resort 
such a statement if endorsed as official nato policy would be 
at least a small step away from the existing doctrine known as 
flexible response according to private analysts interviewed 
monday 
flexible response holds that us nuclear arms could be 
fired during the early stages of a european ground war started by 
soviet nonnuclear forces if nato troops were being overrun 
by calling us nuclear forces in europe weapons of last 
resort bush is suggesting the united states would wait longer to 
initiate a nuclear battle than it would under existing nato 
doctrine said john steinbruner director of foreign policy studies 
at the brookings institution a liberaloriented washington think 
tank 
its unclear how bush or the allies would define a last 
resort 
the weapons in question are called battlefield nuclear weapons 
because they cannot reach beyond central europe long considered 
the most likely war theater 
only if use of these weapons failed to end the conflict would 
the united states consider resorting to use of strategic or 
longrange nuclear weapons 
steinbruner said the use of the term last resort seemed to 
suggest the administration was contemplating only a moderate shift 
in nato doctrine since bush apparently would not rule out that 
nato could be the first to fire battlefield nuclear weapons 
theyre dancing rhetorically around the subject steinbruner 
said 
the topic is particularly touchy for nato governments because 
while the demise of the sovietled warsaw pact is making nuclear 
weapons less important in europe no member of the western alliance 
is yet willing to abandon nuclear defenses altogether 
the london nato summit is expected to launch a major review of 
nuclear strategy details of a revised military stance are unlikely 
to be worked out for months 
frank j gaffney director of the conservative center for 
security policy said he interpreted bushs proposal as an attempt 
to placate the soviet union which argues that the reunification of 
germany requires that nato drop its military role 
gaffney said bushs proposal would erode the credibility of 
nato since it would bring the alliance closer to renouncing all 
use of nuclear weapons in europe 
we are in the name of trying to alleviate soviet concerns 
going to accede to radical changes in the character of natos 
traditional security arrangement he said 
david shorr associate director of the british american security 
information council a private organization based in london and 
washington said bushs proposal amounts to a rhetorical device 
with little substantive meaning 
he said the proposal was unlikely to help resolve the issue 
within nato regarding when in a conventional war against the 
soviets the west would resort to nuclear weapons 
it shows what a delicate dance nato has had to do around 
exactly what flexible response means shorr said

his oncesolid support shaken by lurid 
courtroom tales of drugs sex and abuse mayor marion barry is 
finding comfort in the public embrace of black activists on the 
political fringe 
while the murky videotape image of barry filling his lungs with 
crack cocaine replays on the television screens and in the minds of 
his city washingtons mayor has been anything but reclusive 
he joined louis farrakhan the controversial nation of islam 
leader on a stage before thousands of people last week 
on sunday he bathed in ovation and song from the imani temple 
congregation of bishop george augustus stallings jr a flamboyant 
black priest who broke from the roman catholic church to form his 
own denomination 
barry also has appeared in recent weeks with rep gus savage 
dill a virulent critic of the white press even tawana 
brawley whose allegations of kidnap rape and defilement by whites 
were discounted by authorities after creating controversy in new 
york shared a stage with him recently 
hes trying to reach out to whomever will accept him at this 
point said linda williams a veteran observer of black politics 
and a fellow at harvards kennedy school of government center for 
press and politics 
many if not most of the standard middleclass black leaders 
in the nation and in the dc area are keeping their distance 
williams said therefore these are really the only elements that 
are openly coming to him at this point 
barry 54 is a former civil rights leader and street activist 
once considered on the political fringes himself he moved into the 
majorityblack capital citys political mainstream however and 
rose through elective offices to mayor where he is serving his 
12th year 
he now is on trial in federal court on drug and perjury charges 
that followed years of investigation prosecutors last week played 
the videotape of their hotel room sting of barry 
rasheeda moore a girlfriendturnedfbiinformer and a key 
prosecution witness has alleged she and barry shared illegal drugs 
more than 100 times and that they had a sexual relationship that 
ended when barry slapped her to a hotel room floor 
in a sideshow that has kept the citys radio talk shows abuzz 
farrakhan and stallings tried separately to enter the crowded 
courtroom at barrys invitation 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson barred both ruling 
that their presence could be disruptive and intimidating he said 
farrakhan is a persona non grata in the courtroom 
the american civil liberties union filed papers with the federal 
appeals court asking to overturn jacksons ruling 
in farrakhan barry has found an ally with whom he previously 
has been at odds 
farrakhan who has created controversy for calling judaism a 
dirty religion delivered a strong attack two months ago on 
local political leaders for moral corruption and said they should 
be replaced by muslims 
but last week farrakhan declared barry a repentant soul who 
is under attack and urged him to run for reelection 
during a break in the trial monday barry appeared before a 
crowd that gathered on a plaza across from city hall to cheer him 
also speaking was abdul alim muhammad farrakhans national 
spokesman who called the trial a subversion of justice and a 
lynching conducted because barry could not be defeated at the 
polls 
barry said in a television interview on monday that the crowds 
and farrakhans embrace at the rally last week have helped sustain 
him 
got a lot of spiritual feeling a lot of love there barry 
said about 10 to 15000 people cheered us genuine love that 
made us go through the night theres a lot of love in this 
city for me 
barrys jury is sequestered and thus insulated from the activity 
outside the courtroom but ron walters chairman of the political 
science department at howard university said i would be 
surprised if some of that didnt get to the jury in some way 
walters said barry is using the displays to tap a feeling among 
many blacks that he has been unfairly pursued by white prosecutors 
although barry has said he wont seek another term speculation 
persists that he might still run as an independent if he is 
acquitted or there is a hung jury the deadline for independents to 
file as candidates isnt until late august 
i dont think he has accepted that he is dead politically 
williams said

this is a town that is drowning in words 
swimming in information but parched for facts when decisions have 
to be made the decisionmakers in congress in the white house 
in the agencies of government afloat in data and analysis still 
yearn for the decisive fact that will tell them what to do 
would reducing the tax on capital gains give the economy a 
booster shot as president bush claims or merely deepen the 
deficit gap as his democratic opponents say 
if the house ways and means committee were to announce hearings 
on that question today the corridors would be crowded tomorrow 
with experts carrying briefcases loaded with facts to prove 
indisputably both sides of the argument 
predictive facts what would happen if are not the only kind 
that are hard to come by so are contemporary facts homelessness 
is a gnawing social problem high in the public consciousness the 
subject of strenuous government effort yet no one knows how many 
homeless people are out there or who they are or how long they 
have been homeless 
back in 1971 president richard nixon concerned by inflation 
took the unprecedented step of imposing peacetime wage and price 
controls on the economy overnight it became illegal to raise the 
price of a buick or a bagel it was a radical move for a republican 
president intended to stem inflation that he saw as threatening to 
the economy and his reelection prospects 
and yet says herbert j stein who was one of nixons economic 
advisers there was a lot of uncertainty about what the rate of 
inflation actually was inflation was and is measured in dozens 
of ways and no one can say which measurement most accurately 
reflects the rise in the price of goods and services 
thats not all says stein we still dont know what caused 
the depression in 1929 theres still disagreement over whether 
some international thing was moving the whole world or whether it 
was the way the monetary system was being managed 
its hard to get information on a lot of subjects he says 
take all the talk on the sampl business it is hard to find where 
all the estimates of losses which seem to change monthly come 
from we have very little information about what happened in the 
first place 
when president franklin d roosevelt died in 1945 and vice 
president harry s truman suddenly became president he learned 
about the secret work on the atomic bomb and one of the first 
decisions he had to make was whether to use it against japan 
fleet adm william d leahy chief of staff to roosevelt came 
to him truman recalls in his memoirs and in absolute certainty 
advised him not to use the bomb 
that is the biggest fool thing we have ever done he 
observed in his sturdy salty manner truman writes the bomb 
will never go off and i speak as an expert in explosives 
thats the trouble with experts of which this town is also 
full their opinions always parade as facts 
says charles schultze who played the same role for president 
jimmy carter that stein played for nixon there are zillions of 
facts the question is having all those facts what do you 
conclude 
if you ask me what a reduction in capital gains taxation would 
do to federal revenues i can get you two highly quantitative 
reports full of numbers one saying it will go up and one saying 
it will go down sometimes the facts come from people who want 
them to be true 
as long ago as 1931 charles evans hughes then chief justice 
reflected in a speech on the potency of facts 
said hughes an unscrupulous administrator might be tempted to 
say let me find the facts for the people of my country and i 
care little who lays down the general principles 
says jim jaffe a savvy aide on capitol hill since 1976 look 
at whats happening behind what we used to call the iron curtain 
you can say one of two things you can say the reagan plan of 
spending like a madman figure theyd run out of money before we 
would has been wildly successful or you can say the communist 
world was deteriorating anyhow and look at all the domestic 
concerns we ignored while we were wasting all this money on 
missiles we had no need for its an intellectual game its 
not a factual game 
there are lots of facts in washington but judgment is always 
scarce thats a fact

agents stacked cash 3 feet high atop a 60foot 
banquet table and along the floor in announcing the seizure of 
2207 million from drug dealers who thought they were turning 
their profits over to money launderers 
the dealers actually were giving their money to undercover 
agents taking part in a 13month sting customs commissioner carol 
hallett said monday 
a dozen agents wearing bulletproof vests and carrying machine 
guns stood watch as hallett spoke with more than 18 million 
stacked on tables at the doral country club and in boxes on the 
floor the rest of the money is in new york 
this was a moneylaundering operation of unprecedented 
proportions ms hallett said and this record seizure should 
warn the drug smuggler that as each day passes were getting 
closer and closer to them and their drug money 
only one person a driver has been arrested 
hallet refused to disclose whether the sting was aimed at 
colombias cocaine cartels saying more arrests are expected but 
she said the drug ring involved colombians and cubanamericans 
working out of miami with connections in new york 
a bank gave the original tip that the traffickers wanted to ship 
the money to banks in the caribbean and in europe authorities 
said thirtyfive undercover customs agents stepped in 
the dealers collected money from street drug sales she said 
then gave it to couriers 
the agents received the money from the couriers who left 
cashstuffed cars at prearranged spots such as shopping centers 
for pickup the money much of it in small bills was so heavy cars 
had to be equipped with special pneumatic shocks 
the cash containing large numbers of 20 10 and 5 bills 
weighed more than 1 tons ms hallett said 
guillermo felix hernandezcastillo was arrested thursday after 
being stopped here with 421000 in his car authorities said he 
was jailed on 50000 bail and must prove the money he posts as 
bail is not drugrelated 
the 22 million seizure was a customs record but in a fouryear 
drug enforcement administration moneylaundering probe that ended 
last year agents seized 809 million in cash said miami dea 
spokesmn john fernandes 
the largest oneday seizure of cash was 196 million 
confiscated in january 1989 by the dea from new york dealers 
connected to colombias cali drug cartel

the cornfield is partly a barley field now and 
there arent any trees in the north woods but both are becoming 
federal property more than a century and a quarter after the blue 
and the grey fought fiercely for them in the battle of antietam 
the richard king mellon foundation and the conservation fund 
deeded 148 acres of maryland farmland including the two civil war 
sites to the interior department on monday as part of what was 
billed as the largestever land donation to the government 
the farm near antietam creek is one of 10 properties that the 
pittsburghbased foundation has purchased at a cost of more than 
21 million for donation to the government by way of the 
conservation fund a land and water conservation organization 
also handed over on monday were 93000 acres of wildlife habitat 
in north carolina the tract between albemarle and pamlico sounds 
will be administered by the us fish and wildlife service 
gifts scheduled for transfer later in the year are 
five forks at dinwiddie va site of a battle known as the 
waterloo of the confederacy forked lightning ranch nm 
surrounding the pecos national monument 130 acres of upland 
adjoining the marshes and open water of mackay island national 
wildlife refuge nc a 122acre addition to the rachel carson 
national wildlife refuge maine 
also two tracts totaling 468 acres to be added to rocky 
mountain national park colo two parcels of land on and near 
skyline drive in shenandoah national park va and a 135acre 
addition to the wilderness area of fredericksburg and spotsylvania 
memorial national military park va 
the antietam farm contained a 30acre cornfield when the battle 
of antietam the bloodiest single day of fighting in american 
history was fought on sept 17 1862 of the 23000 killed and 
wounded 55 percent were struck in and around the cornfield as the 
site became known 
some were buried there said edwin c bearss chief historian of 
the national park service from 1865 to 1867 the dead were removed 
to a union cemetery in sharpsburg md and to confederate burial 
places in shepherdstown wva and hagerstown md 
the foundation bought the property from paul culler who with 
his son lynn has farmed it for 37 years they plant it in corn 
some years and in barley oats and hay at other times in 
accordance with modern crop rotation this year said lynn culler 
they have 18 acres in corn and the rest in barley 
richard rambur superintendent of antietam national battlefield 
in sharpsburg said the cornfield would be returned to its original 
size and configuration on the basis of contemporary maps he said 
trees would be planted in the woods from which union troops 
advanced into the field 
the cullers will continue to farm the property for three or four 
years under a lease arrangement with the park service as 
guaranteed by their arrangement with the conservation fund rambur 
said after that it will be put up for lease by the highest 
bidder like other farmland in national parks 
the farm includes not only the cornfield but most of the north 
woods the wood lot from which union troops advanced into the tall 
corn there are no trees in the north woods now and rambur said 
trees will be planted to make it the way it was in 1862 
in addition to the farm the foundation bought two other pieces 
of property outside the park boundary that will be held for 
possible donation later altogether the 280 acres of land sold for 
11 million conservation fund spokesman jack lynn said

federal reserve policymakers meeting today are 
probably tilting toward nudging interest rates lower this summer 
many economists predict 
the move if it comes would occur at an ideal time for 
president bush he is looking for a rate cut and renewed economic 
growth as a reward for abandoning his no new taxes pledge and 
reaching out to democrats for a deficitreduction pact 
the federal open market committee which began its closeddoor 
twoday midyear policy review on monday likely will decide to 
cut rates in coming weeks as signs of economic softness emerge 
analysts said it may even decide to push rates down immediately by 
a quarter of a percentage point 
although many economists believe the administration has a good 
chance of getting what it wants they say it will not be because of 
the political pressure bush and other top officials have been 
trying to apply 
the fed never wants to be seen as caving in to politics but 
my feeling is for separate reasons theyre going to move 
said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a new york 
government securities dealer 
the economy is in danger of slipping into a recession by the 
end of the year and i think the fed will recognize it at this 
meeting he said 
minutes of the meeting will be made public in six weeks 
evidence of economic sluggishness is much more pronounced since 
the open market committees last meeting may 15 jones said 
until recently the softness seemed to be confined to just a few 
sectors of the economy such as automobiles and construction now 
consumers who represent twothirds of the nations economic 
activity are pulling back 
retail sales fell from march through may the first triple 
decline since the 1982 recession 
the economy has virtually stopped producing new jobs excluding 
the temporary hiring of census workers the economy created only 
105000 jobs from march through may scarcely more than onetenth 
the rate of a few years ago 
adding to the pressure for lower rates are reports of a credit 
crunch not from monetary policy but from bank examiners 
business people are complaining that loans are harder to get 
because examiners spooked by the sampl crisis are forcing banks to 
be more careful 
although many economists predict a series of interest rate cuts 
through the summer others argue that the persistence of inflation 
will prevent the fed from acting precipitously 
excluding volatile food and energy prices consumer inflation 
was 48 percent in the 12 months ended in may compared with 46 
percent in the preceding 12month period 
its going to be a tough call i think they may end up having 
a conditional directive which says if the unemployment rate 
rises the fed should ease said economist paul boltz of t rowe 
price in baltimore 
the open market committee consists of the seven governors of the 
federal reserve board and the presidents of the 12 regional federal 
reserve banks only five of the presidents vote the committee 
controls the socalled federal funds rate the interest charged 
among banks for overnight loans

pointing to a map of lebanons 
coast the captain of the israeli patrol boat dvora says the 
possibility of a palestinian guerrilla attack has seldom been 
greater 
in the eight years i have been on these boats i dont 
remember a time when there was such certainty in the air that 
something was going to happen said capt chen 
he spoke as the 69foot craft sliced through the waters a few 
hundred yards off the south lebanon coast sweeping the coastline 
with radar and occasionally stabbing through the darkness with a 
powerful searchlight 
the tension felt by chen and his eightmember crew is reflected 
throughout israel at a time when efforts to arrange 
palestinianisraeli negotiations are at a standstill 
palestinian guerrillas including hardliners who oppose plo 
chairman yasser arafats diplomatic initiative have mounted two 
recent seaborne raids using speedboats for the first time and 
finding a chink in israels armor 
on the jewish holiday of shavuot on may 30 boats with heavily 
armed palestinians from abul abbas palestine liberation front were 
launched from a mother ship that had set sail from libya 
one outran israeli defenders and reached the shore near a 
crowded beach resort before four arabs were killed and seven 
captured the attack prompted the united states to suspend its 
political dialogue with the plo 
on june 23 chens dvora bee in hebrew ran down a speedboat 
heading toward the israeli border settlement of rosh haniqra and 
killed two guerrillas armed with rocketpropelled grenades and 
automatic rifles responsibility was claimed by a fundamentalist 
faction of lebanese sunni moslems traditional allies of the plo 
ariel merari a terror expert at tel aviv university says a 
successful raid could set off a chain reaction that could end in a 
new middle east war he notes that terror raids were a contributing 
factor to the 1956 1967 and 1982 wars between israel and its arab 
neighbors 
a single dramatic terror attack or series of smaller ones 
change the atmosphere and trigger a war he said 
for example he said if abul abbas heavily armed guerrillas 
had slain israelis on beaches and in hotels as reportedly planned 
the public outcry in israel would have made it necessary for the 
government to carry out a spectacular retaliatory strike i 
presume against libya 
that in turn could have prompted iraqs saddam hussein to make 
good on pledges to help arab states attacked by israel 
at night along the rocky coast of south lebanon the defense 
against guerrilla raids seems fragile indeed 
the israeli craft based on a us patrol boat designed for 
vietnams mekong river seems to have little more firepower and 
speed than most of its guerrilla adversaries 
its weaponry consists mainly of world war iiera 20mm cannons 
and light machine guns plus some rocketfired munitions its top 
speed is about 40 knots 
its like soccer we cant let them get past us and head for 
the goal explained chen who spent much of a recent night 
hunched over trying to sort out suspect ships from birds waves 
and friendlies on a platesized radar screen swarming with a 
rorschach of dots 
chen whose full name could not be used in keeping with military 
regulations was surrounded by a bank of squawking radios linking 
him to other israeli patrol craft as well as radar and other shore 
installations 
overriding everything however is the driving beat of wont 
back down a tom petty song being played by israels armed forces 
radio 
the crew breaks the boredom by microwaving a series of snacks 
including pizza and a soybean chicken substitute made in a factory 
on chens kibbutz in northern israel 
about 330 am a bell sounds for battle stations and the crew 
scrambles from the airconditioned bunkrooms to the slippery decks 
of the lurching and rolling dvora 
moments later they stand down it was just a flock of birds 
said eldad a crew member who was steering the craft on the exposed 
fly bridge within rifle range of the coast 
the jumpiness is both an outgrowth of the proximity to israels 
border and the variety of threats the guerrillas pose 
chen said guerrillas have tried to sneak past israeli defenses 
by sending lone frogmen underwater or rubber dinghies that hug the 
shore line and are difficult to see with nightvision scopes and 
radar they have also planted mines or tried suicide attacks 
the political situation is such that the palestinians are 
returning to the use of arms they are trying from the shore from 
the sea and from the air he said

if pilots on longhaul flights are allowed to 
take a brief snooze in the cockpit theyre more alert for the 
landing a federal study concludes 
the national aeronautics and space administration study of 10 
boeing 747 crews produced the first scientific evidence that short 
rest periods act as a safety valve to reduce fatigue and 
improve alertness during the most critical stage of a long flight 
investigators said monday 
the federal aviation administration which cosponsored the 
study is reviewing the results officials said currently only 
military transport crews are allowed regular rest periods during 
flights some airlines in other countries also have adopted the 
practice investigators said 
the volunteer crews on northwest and united flights across the 
pacific were divided into a rest group and a nonrest group with 
two nasa investigators monitoring each crew on the flight deck 
the researchers found that given the opportunity to rest in 
their seats the pilots generally were able to fall asleep easily 
and sleep well the report said later these crew members 
demonstrated significantly higher levels of vigilance than their 
norest counterparts 
the report said the differences were especially dramatic near 
the end of the cruise phase of the flights just before the pilot 
starts the descent for landing 
pilots who took the preplanned rests on four successive flights 
also were less affected by having to make consecutive flights and 
flying at night the report said 
crew members who were allowed to rest each were given 40minute 
rest periods on a rotation basis so two pilots were always 
controlling the plane 
crew reaction was measured both by observations recorded in a 
log book by the nasa investigators and by portable monitoring 
equipment hooked to the pilots wrist 
previous research has shown that repeated time zone crossings 
often produce poor sleeping patterns particularly on eastbound 
flights when days are shortened 
nasa and faa studies also have found that pilots themselves 
often cannot accurately predict their own sleepiness

at least one of every six farmers who take out 
federal crop insurance does so in order to get a loan to stay in 
business according to a recent survey by the agriculture 
department 
the survey also showed that crop insurance was more likely to be 
a requirement if loans were sought from the farm credit system 
fcs or the farmers home administration fmha 
merritt hughes of the departments economic research service 
said the findings were based on the annual farm cost and returns 
survey for the 198889 crop year and a recent followup survey of 
3000 farms that focused on insurance 
writing in the july issue of agriculture outlook magazine 
hughes said roughly half of the farms represented by the survey had 
some form of debt and that 23 percent of the indebted farms carried 
federal crop insurance in 198889 
commercial banks and the fcs have stated that they never 
require crop insurance as a prerequisite for lending the report 
said fmha has required federal crop insurance participation for 
some loan contracts in some years 
the latest survey questioned borrowers rather than the lenders 
about 17 percent of all farm operators represented by the survey 
who bought insurance did so because it was required by lenders 
considering just the three major lenders fcs fmha and 
commercial banks almost 31 percent of their borrowers represented 
by the survey who bought federal crop insurance said they did so 
because of a requirement by their lender the report said 
the three institutions accounted for about 80 percent of the 
nations farm loan volume in 1988 
of the total number of borrowers who said they were required to 
buy insurance almost half were required to do so by banks roughly 
onethird said they were required by fmha and one out of seven by 
the fcs

some consumer groups and others want the 
agriculture department to disclose more test information about a 
proposed new beef inspection plan before a scientific panel 
completes its review 
the government accountability project a leader in the 
coalitions demands said monday it planned to file a lawsuit in 
us district court here asking that the usda data be released 
under the freedom of information act 
at the heart of the controversy is the departments longpending 
plan for a streamlined inspection system for beef that has been 
undergoing pilot tests in preparation for final review by the 
national academy of sciences the nas was contracted by usda for 
170000 to review the proposal 
the plan called sisbeef would require participating meat 
plants to take greater responsibility for some of the chores 
traditionally done by federal inspectors 
agency officials contend that the inspectors would then 
concentrate more on checking for disease and other defects that can 
affect meat in the consumer pipeline each participating plant 
would have to submit a quality control plan in advance for usda 
approval 
critics claim that under the plan fewer inspectors would monitor 
plants and that beef would be turned out under speededup 
slipshod dirty conditions as a result of companies taking over 
some of the duties previously performed by federal inspectors 
tom devine of the government accountability project said the nas 
review should be delayed until the department releases more 
information gap is a nonprofit public interest group that 
provides legal support for government whistle blowers 
its our contention that serious public health decisions 
shouldnt be made on the basis of secret reports devine said in 
a telephone interview the reason these things arent being 
released is they couldnt withstand scrutiny 
but the usdas food safety and inspection service which 
oversees the program said results at the pilot plants show the sis 
system compares favorably with the traditional system of 
federal inspection 
spokesman jim greene said the agency denied the request by 
devine and others for more information on the ground that some of 
it is proprietary and not allowed to be made public 
some of it has a direct bearing on the ongoing agency contract 
with nas and release of that information to a third party would 
interfere with the scientific process and possibly compromise the 
results of that contract with nas he said

the agriculture department is sending a team 
of scientists to the soviet union this fall to help set up a 
computer bank for russian plants 
information about seeds and other plant reproductive material 
germplasm will be stored in a soviet data base modeled after a 
germplasm resources information network called grin developed by 
the departments agricultural research service 
james h elgin jr the agencys national program leader for 
forage and pasture crops said monday that grin stores more than 
15 million entries on about 8100 different plant species 
worldwide he will lead the usda team to leningrad in september

a few hours before the moscow bears played 
the first football game involving a soviet team on american soil 
coach john ralston was still explaining to his players how to suit 
up in full pads 
dont forget you need your thigh pads your knee pads and 
your elbow pads you dont want to land on that astroturf without 
your elbow pads ralston told the 39 players on the soviet 
national champion team in a meeting before their exhibition game 
monday with the minorleague tacoma express 
ralston speaking through an interpreter didnt go over game 
strategy or try to give them a fiery pep talk the former denver 
broncos head coach said he mainly wanted to ensure his players 
finished the game intact especially his starting tight end since 
both backups had been held back in the soviet union by the kgb the 
night before departure 
the final score justified ralstons limited expectations the 
tacoma express rolled over the bears 610 
for the past eight weeks ralston has been attempting to mold a 
group of soviet rugby players shotputters javelin throwers and 
decathletes into a professional football team 
the starting quarterback first touched a football seven months 
ago hes the veteran ralstons biggest player tips the scales at 
250 pounds 
we have one linebacker tough little guy but i dont think he 
weighs 175 pounds ralston said 
the team is playing four american exhibition games arranged by 
the international sports connection a sports promotion company 
based in gadsen ala besides tacoma the team is scheduled to play 
in fresno calif oklahoma city and macon ga with a possible 
match in charlotte nc 
american football is catching on fast in the soviet union with 
24 teams and more athletes from other sports interested in playing 
said international sports connection vice president kent dunston 
he said the tour was designed to expose the soviet players to a 
higher level of competition than they would see in their home 
country or europe 
the players dont harbor any longshot dreams about rolling over 
american teams 
starting quarterback yuri boldin who hurled the javelin for 
years before he touched a pigskin said the bears hoped only to 
show they understand the game 
the main thing is to show what we have been taught by coach 
ralston just to show that we will be able to play he said 
through an interpreter 
special teams player vladimir skordcov whose broad shoulders 
bulging arms and severe crew cut might land him movie roles as a 
russian army commando when his playing days end said the soviets 
would be easily overmatched by the americans size 
but he wasnt afraid to find out how hard the americans could 
hit 
so far we have seen them eating but do not know how they can 
play he said 
team president mikhail zakharyan predicted it would take five or 
six years for soviet teams to be competitive with the american 
minor leagues and the national football league 
maybe our children will be able to play nfl teams he said 
through an interpreter 
zakharyan thought the bears would improve enough by next season 
to beat some of the hundreds of teams in 14 european nations 
the moscow team lost a recent game to a french team by a score 
of 670 ralston said they lost by more than 80 points to a west 
berlin team 
ralston who coached some of the worlds best football players 
at denver from 1972 to 1976 said the soviet receivers still dont 
catch the ball when its thrown to them and often the quarterback 
cant get the ball to them 
but they dont lack for enthusiasm he said and they do 
everything through an interpreter

about 1400 moslem pilgrims 
suffocated or were trampled to death monday in a stampede in a 
pedestrian tunnel leading to the holy city of mecca witnesses and 
diplomats said 
almost a day after the disaster which occurred during the 
annual hajj pilgrimage saudi officials had still not given a death 
count 
king fahd was quoted by the official saudi news agency spa as 
saying that the accident occurred because a large number of 
pilgrims thronged the tunnel beyond capacity 
if the hajis had followed the instructions the accident would 
have been averted he was quoted as saying one reason why the 
number of casualties was so big is the fact that it is the first 
big accident of its kind caution cannot preclude fate 
witnesses and diplomats said the stampede began monday morning 
when some pilgrims stopped in the middle of the airconditioned 
tunnel and there was a rush outside with people pushing each other 
to escape the 112degree heat they also said the ventilation 
appeared to have stopped 
one asian diplomat who refused to be identified put the death 
toll at 1400 and said many of the victims were indonesian and 
malaysian pilgrims four middle eastern diplomats as well as 
witnesses gave the same death toll 
the stampede shattered what had been a peaceful observance of 
the hajj or pilgrimage and was the worst pilgrimage tragedy in 
recent years in previous years terrorist attacks and riots marred 
the celebration 
it came at the end of the moslem holiday eid aladha or the 
feast of sacrifice for which 2 million moslems including 800000 
foreigners came to the holy city of mecca 
ambulances and security forces rushed to the exits of the 
500yardlong tunnel that joins mecca and the tent city of mina 
according to staterun riyadh radio which quoted an interior 
ministry spokeman in mina 
witnesses said people stampeded crushing hundreds of people and 
suffocating hundreds others 
people were smothered as thousands of the pilgrims thronged 
through the tunnel of moessem causing severe congestion within 
the tunnel as the pressure was beyond its capacity the radio 
said this led to some deaths and some cases of fainting 
a witness speaking on condition of anonymity said the flow of 
people through the tunnel suddenly stopped the airconditioned 
tunnel can hold up to 1000 pedestrians but the crowd inside 
quickly swelled to 5000 he said 
with the lack of oxygen a good number collapsed unconscious 
and some died there was also a stampede the witness said 
there always should be movement within the tunnel but the 
entire crowd suddenly stopped and no one yet knows why he said 
the witness said he helped carry victims to the ambulances 
waiting by the tunnels exits but it was impossible to determine 
how many people were dead or simply unconscious 
the tunnel is part of massive 15 billion development plan for 
the holy sites to move pilgrims in a more orderly fashion for the 
hajj the worlds largest religious gathering the plan includes 
other tunnels and overhead bridges 
the tent city was set up in mina to house visiting pilgrims 
about 2 million moslems were at islams holy sites in the mecca 
area for the hajj the celebration climaxed sunday with prayers on 
mount arafat about eight miles from mecca 
at the time of the tunnel disaster monday morning the pilgrims 
were taking part in posthajj rituals or preparing to leave 
thousands of the pilgrims left mecca later monday 
these rituals of eid aladha or the feast of sacrifice 
commemorate the prophet abrahams offering of his son in sacrifice 
to god 
moslems celebrate the feast by slaughtering sheep to emulate the 
sacrifice of abraham who is also revered by christians and jews 
the moslem faith requires that each worshiper attempt to attend 
the pilgrimage 
before monday only a small fire at mina and a few cases of heat 
fatigue marred an otherwise calm pilgrimage season 
terrorism blamed on iranian or shiite moslems has occurred in 
the past three years 
the worst incident was in 1987 when iranians clashed with 
security forces leading to the death of more than 400 pilgrims 
the year before the saudis confiscated large quantities of 
explosives from members of the iranian contingent 
the saudis have since set a quota of 1000 per million of 
population for each islamic nation angered by the quotas the 
iranians have boycotted the hajj since 1988 
last year some small bombs went off during the hajj killing 
one pilgrim and injuring 16 the saudis tried and convicted kuwaiti 
shiite moslems and beheaded 16 of them

jurors unconvinced imelda marcos knew of her 
husbands alleged corrupt practices cleared her of charges she 
looted 222 million from the philippines and hid the money by 
sinking it into art and real estate 
saudi financier adnan khashoggi also was acquitted of helping 
mrs marcos and her husband conceal ownership of four new york 
buildings 
i am in great awe and respect for the jury system that 
symbolizes the soul of the american people the widow of former 
philippines president ferdinand marcos said after the verdict 
monday on her 61st birthday 
this is the best birthday present i ever had she said 
the verdict reduced mrs marcos to tears and elated supporters 
she went directly to st patricks cathedral where she walked on 
her knees down the aisle to the altar then bowed her head to the 
floor and prayed 
friends and supporters celebrated with her into the evening at 
an apartment where she stayed during the trial she later emerged 
reportedly headed for a party with khashoggi as host asked about 
her plans she said home 
philippines president corazon aquino expressed disappointment 
over the acquittal and said the former first lady still was barred 
from returning home for national security reasons 
philippine officials said they are ready to file charges against 
mrs marcos if the president lets her return the constitution 
bans criminal trials in absentia 
jurors announcing their verdict on the fifth day of 
deliberations after a threemonth trial told reporters they were 
not convinced mrs marcos knew of her husbands alleged wrongdoing 
or the source of his wealth 
the prosecution had argued that even though its evidence was 
heavily circumstantial it proved that mrs marcos as a cabinet 
minister and mayor of manila knew the millions of dollars they 
invested were accumulated illegally 
just because she was married to him doesnt make her guilty 
said jury forewoman catherine balton 
juror thomas orourke said the case did not belong in the us 
courts 
we are not big brothers to the people overseas he said 
adding that the prosecution had relied on halftruths and not the 
right witnesses 
for three years they have made this poor womans life 
miserable he said it may have been a conspiracy but not a 
conspiracy by marcos 
in a statement the office of us attorney otto obermaier 
praised the work of the prosecutors and said the jury has 
rendered its verdict our system of justice has spoken 
the prosecutors office said an estimate of how much the case 
cost the us government was not available 
the jury acquitted both defendants of all charges 
racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction 
of justice against mrs marcos and mail fraud and obstruction 
against khashoggi 
mrs marcos had faced up to 50 years in prison and 1 million in 
fines khashoggi could have drawn 10 years and a 500000 fine 
mrs marcos had been accused of conspiring with her husband to 
buy art jewelry and real estate with 222 million stolen from 
their countrys treasury 
witnesses testified the money was funneled to the united states 
through bank accounts in switzerland hong kong manila and los 
angeles and was used to secretly buy the buildings for the marcoses 
marcos was indicted with his wife in 1988 2 years after he was 
deposed in a popular uprising the couple fled to exile in hawaii 
where marcos died in september 
marcos attorney gerry spence a flashy wyoming native who wore a 
cowboy hat and boots to court said in closing arguments that mrs 
marcos was a worldclass shopper who was guilty only of loving 
and supporting her husband 
during the trial us district judge john f keenan called the 
case unprecedented because it involved a former head of state who 
was a major us ally and he wondered whether the case belonged in 
a us court 
testimony included accounts of mrs marcos shopping habits 
such as spending sprees at bloomingdales and numerous new york 
jewelry stores 
khashoggi 54 an arms dealer and jetset financier once 
described as the worlds richest man said of the verdict i feel 
very happy for myself and my family and for the united states

percent say the crunch is so severe they expect spending to exceed 
revenues in their current budget year according to a survey

budget pressures are greatest in the northeast where the regional 
economy is slumping five of six cities and towns surveyed in that 
region reported that their financial problems were worse than a 
year ago 
leaders of the organization whose membership is open to cities 
and towns with populations of at least 10000 said a major factor

the food and drug administration is requiring 
strengthened warnings against use of aspirin products by women in 
the last three months of pregnancy 
the agency said the stronger warning being published today in 
the federal register is needed because aspirin can affect fetal 
circulation and uterine contraction 
manufacturers have one year to add the stronger warning to all 
oral and rectal overthecounter products containing aspirin the 
fda said 
the warning must read 
it is especially important not to use aspirin during the last 
three months of pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by 
a doctor because it may cause problems in the unborn child or 
complications during delivery 
aspirin products now carry a general warning that says 
as with any drug if you are pregnant or nursing a baby seek 
the advice of a health professional before using this product 
an advisory panel of medical experts had recommended the 
stronger warning 
a similar warning is already required on nonprescription

a federal research group is calling for a more 
liberal policy on truck weights that it says could save 43 
billion a year in transport costs and cost railroads 750 million 
in lost revenue 
the national research council committee said all states should 
be given the option of exempting some trucks from a federal limit 
of 80000 pounds on the nations interstate highways it also 
recommended changes in the rules for bridge use that would allow 
heavier concrete mixers dump trucks and other trucks with shorter 
wheelbases 
the weight exemptions would be on the condition that they 
include fees to cover pavement and bridge wear said the committee 
which is made up of transportation experts from universities the 
industry and government the research council is linked to the 
national academy of sciences and the national academy of 
engineering 
the committee report recommends that heavy trucks still be 
restricted to designated routes comply with all other federal 
weight restrictions and comply with strict safety standards 
the exemptions would still be up to individual states but the 
report said it was not fair to prevent about half the states from 
allowing exemptions while the others who had exemptions before the 
current law can keep theirs 
if all states adopted the exemptions annual transportation 
savings for truckers could total 19 billion because of the use of 
more productive vehicles the report said

swallows nests clogging a propane swimming 
pool heaters ventilation ducts apparently caused a buildup of 
carbon monoxide that sent 136 motel guests and rescue workers to 
the hospital authorities say 
all those treated after sundays poisoning were released later 
in the day 
the cazador inn reopened monday after tests showed no traces of 
the fumes said sharon smith kandiyohi county environmental health 
inspector 
inspectors found that the buildup of the fumes which can be 
fatal resulted from poor ventilation at the twostory 33room 
motel 
in the swimming pool area investigators found some of the 
ventilation ducts plugged with swallows nests said fire chief 
tony rime the obstructions caused fumes to spread down the halls 
and into guest rooms he said 
the motel was evacuated after guests began complaining of 
illness some guests were found passed out dozens were treated 
initially on the motel lawn 
up to 30 people had symptoms usually associated with carbon 
monoxide poisoning which include grogginess headaches and nausea 
almost everyone at the motel was taken to the hospital even 
those with no symptoms 
it was kind of like being drunk said a guest chad schuler 
of granite falls 
smith said she has inspected the pool area including the 
propane heater annually since 1987 when the county began routine 
inspections she last inspected the pool area nov 15 and gave the 
heater a clean bill of health 
smith said she could not recall any problems with the system in 
previous inspections but said she usually does not inspect the 
ducts 
bob james code specialist with the state fire marshal said 
blockage is not uncommon for indoor pool heaters he said heaters 
that are used yeararound as is the one at the motel probably 
should be inspected twice a year

big bird was there and fozzie bear and oscar the 
grouch as more than 1400 colleagues family and fans paid tribute 
to muppet creator jim henson in a verdant st pauls cathedral 
england was a second home to henson who died in may at the age 
of 53 
he loved england and the english we claim him as ours said 
duncan kenworthy chief of henson productions in britain

a may 21 memorial for henson at the cathedral of st john the 
divine in new york included a dixieland band and muppets singing 
their way through the crowd henson died may 16 in new york of 
pneumonia 
hensons family asked wellwishers not to wear black saying the 
event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for hensons

he has left a heritage that will never be forgotten jim 
henson will always be with us said lord lew grade 
it was grade who contracted henson in 1976 to make 24 halfhour

stunt fliers and air show enthusiasts doubt 
the deaths of six stunt pilots in the past month are related but 
say the industry should take another look at how it operates 
if there is something thats a common denominator weve got 
to find it said rick nadeau executive director of the 
international council of air shows based in michigan 
people in the industry said monday that the crashes which are 
under investigation apparently are unrelated because they involved 
different aircraft locations and flying conditions 
a vietnam veteran flying loops in a world war ii training plane 
slammed into the niagara river near buffalo on sunday a crash in 
ottawa the same day also involved a stunt plane dating to world war 
ii on saturday a man died when his biplane crashed during a stunt 
takeoff 
three more stunt pilots died at air shows in crashes in oklahoma 
city abilene texas and zeeland mich 
stunt flier tom poberezny president of the experimental 
aircraft association said the accidents seem unconnected but he 
added we wouldnt want to be so flippant as to say its just 
luck 
poberezny said it is important that the crashes are thoroughly 
studied to make sure theres no underlying cause as to why they 
happened 
a spokesman for the federal aviation administration said it is 
too early to draw conclusions but there is no reason to suspect 
the regulations are at fault or anything else is at fault in the 
crashes 
if theres a common thread in these accidents said 
spokesman dick stafford you can bet the faa will do something 
about it 
stafford said faa regulations deal with the pilot the plane 
the stunts and the proximity of spectators no spectators were hurt 
in any of the crashes

homeless people who seized an abandoned hotel two 
weeks ago agreed to leave today after mayor maynard jackson 
promised to build thousands of singleroom apartments for the 
homeless by 1994 
jackson and homeless leader bill jones announced their agreement 
monday night after hours of negotiations bringing cheers from 
about 50 of the street people who have been living in the 
ramshackle imperial hotel 
the city had set a midnight deadline for an end to the 
occupation 
the mayor promised the city will build 3500 units of 
singleroom occupancy housing over the next 3 years 
in return the squatters said they would leave the imperial 
today and move to a 200bed shelter opened monday the city said 
the shelter would have more lenient rules about entering and 
leaving than most other city shelters 
on monday jacksons administration rushed two proposals before 
the city council that would provide 638000 to build or renovate 
nearly 300 units of sro housing 
the mayor offered no cost estimate for the overall plan or 
indication of where the 3500 units of housing might be built 
the point is weve got a problem here and atlanta is in the 
forefront of trying to solve it jackson said 
the agreement averted a confrontation between the homeless and 
police it also avoided the possibility of a demonstration by the 
squatters as the independence day parade passes the imperial on 
wednesday 
eight demonstrators took over the hotel june 18 protesting the 
lack of apartments and the closing of several shelters for summer 
they renamed the hotel welcome house and began cleaning it up 
welcoming other homeless people 
the squatters had refused to move to shelters until they had a 
promise of more permanent housing 
its been a crisis for a long time but their demonstration 
has made us sit up and take notice said shirley franklin the 
citys chief negotiator who spent a night with the squatters 
jones said the takeover has done more in two weeks for the 
homeless than committees have done in seven years 
atlanta has 10000 homeless people according to the task force 
for the homeless

even though the film trade considered the 
opening weekend receipts for days of thunder less than 
thundering tom cruise says hes happy with the results 
you can buy yourself an opening by putting your picture in 
3500 theaters and spending a lot of money the important thing is 
to have legs the star of the racing movie said using the 
industry term for staying power 
days of thunder finished atop the boxoffice charts but 
grossed just 155 million a weaker opening than dick tracy 
total recall another 48 hrs teenage mutant ninja 
turtles and back to the future part iii 
the figures released monday by entertainment data inc showed 
the 55 million movie could be headed for trouble the lightly 
regarded robocop 2 by comparison grossed 141 million in its 
first weekend 
the exit polls for days of thunder have been fantastic 
cruise countered in a telephone interview monday im very happy 
with the reaction to the film when ive seen it in theaters it 
plays well with an audience they laugh in certain areas that i 
dont expect 
he said the mixedtotepid reviews didnt bother him either 
i dont read reviews even the good ones he declared 
they dont affect me or the film a lot of filmmakers whom i 
respect have called me to say how much they liked the movie 
they were actually surprised he said laughing heartily 
a stock car racer himself cruise formulated a story four years 
ago and robert towne turned it into a script 
i studied all the past race movies i could find said the 
actor i found different things in each of them but none of them 
took the spirit of the driver and developed it thats what we 
tried to do 
the important thing is to stretch the genre even my entrance 
is set up as a wink like the arrival of the hero in a western 
cruise said he has no new project and is looking at a lot of 
scripts he added ruefully putting together a film today is like 
assembling a super bowl team

each year hundreds of thousands of moslems from around the 
world travel to the holy city of mecca by land sea or even on foot 
for the annual pilgrimage known as the hajj it is the worlds 
largest religious gathering 
the pilgrimage to islams holiest shrines in saudi arabia brings 
together arabian princes merchants from indonesia peasants from 
soviet uzbekistan and paupers from bangladesh 
the hajj must be made at least once in a lifetime by all moslems 
who can afford it a moslem who performs the pilgrimage is called a 
hajji 
during the hajj pilgrims must abstain from sex and may not 
quarrel cut their hair or even kill a fly 
hajjis start the pilgrimage by praying at the grand mosque in 
mecca they then circle seven times around the kaaba a granite 
cube draped with goldembroidered black brocade moslems honor the 
kaaba as the house of allah where the prophet abraham offered his 
first prayers to god 
hajjis are then required to run back and forth seven times 
between two rocks about halfamile apart called alsafa and 
almarwa this ceremony is meant to relive the agony of hagar 
abrahams second wife when she was looking for water for her son 
ishmael considered the ancestor of the arabs 
the main center of the pilgrimage then moves to mina a meeting 
place for the hajjis to gather before they climb mount arafat for 
the climax of the observances moslems believe arafat is where 
abraham showed his devotion to god by offering to sacrifice his son 
at mount arafat each pilgrim throws seven stones at each of the 
three devil pillars a spot where moslems believe the devil 
tried to tempt abraham to disobey allah and refuse to sacrifice his 
son at twilight pilgrims offer the eid aladha or feast of 
sacrifice prayers before slaughtering hundreds of thousands of 
sheep cows and camels 
over the years the hajj has been beset by tragedy 
in 1979 religious extremists seized the grand mosque in mecca 
and held it for two weeks before saudi forces stormed it more than 
250 people were killed and saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more 
in 1987 clashes with saudi security forces in mecca killed 402 
people during the hajj 275 of them iranians it was the most 
serious of a series of incidents during pilgrimages since irans 
1979 islamic revolution 
after that carnage saudi arabia restricted the number of 
pilgrims and later broke off diplomatic ties with iran 
the incidents were fired by iranian efforts to politicize the 
hajj and encourage other moslem nations to seize shrines at mecca 
and medina from the control of the kingdoms saud royal family 
iran denied in september 1989 that it was involved in two bomb 
blasts in mecca two months earlier and tehransupported terrorists 
vowed to avenge saudi arabias execution of 16 shiite moslems 
convicted of setting the explosions 
the bombs exploded as thousands of people took part in the hajj 
killing one person and injuring 16 
the attacks were believed connected to the centuriesold feud 
between sunni and shiite moslems the saudi royal family is sunni 
while shiites are an overwhelming majority among irans nearly 50 
million people 
last year an estimated 18 million moslems from more than 80 
nations went on the annual pilgrimage an estimated 2 million 
people attended this year

scott heimdal got a heros welcome in his 
hometown from friends and strangers who helped raise the 60000 
ransom his south american kidnappers demanded for the release of 
the american gold miner 
its a great feeling to be home said heimdal 27 upon 
arriving in this western illinois city except for a celebration 
saturday heimdal said his only plans for this week were to take 
it easy 
wearing an i love peoria tshirt heimdal stepped off a 
plane late monday with his mother marge who had flown to ecuador 
june 18 to negotiate his release after the colombian guerrillas 
refused to free him even though they had been given the money 
heimdal had been working as a miner in ecuador when he was 
kidnapped april 28 near the colombian border 
his family raised 60000 in four days of public appeals bars 
and banks took up collections children sold lemonade and nursing 
homes held bake sales 
heimdal said he intends to return to ecuador its really a 
wonderful country he said 
earlier monday during a stopover in miami he identified his 
captors as members of the communist peoples liberation army he 
said they treated him with great respect and wished him good 
luck on his release 
tv camera lights reporters questions and a jubilant crowd of 
about 100 wellwishers deluged the heimdals as they entered peoria 
airport 
this has been the longest day of our lives said linda 
heimdal one of his sisters 
heimdal received a bouquet of roses from trudy maloof wife of 
the towns mayor a family friend outside a blue van was 
decorated with balloons and a sign saying welcome home scott and 
marge 
those welcoming heimdal included ruby culess who said she 
didnt know the family but had prayed for his release she carried 
a sign that read god hears our prayers 
we dont know the family but its wonderful thats hes 
coming home said jo frederick 
in miami heimdal recounted his kidnapping which took place 
while he was returning to the ecuadoran capital of quito 
we were going down river in a 30foot indian dugout canoe when 
three men attacked us they killed the driver wounded the other 
guy and took me hostage they were looking to kidnap a north 
american he said 
heimdal said that he initially feared for his life but that his 
captors treated him well he said he was often moved about and was 
guarded by up to 25 guerrillas the group kidnapped him to finance 
its war with the government of colombia 
originally his captors wanted far more money for his release 
but heimdal said he convinced them his parents could not afford it 
in latin america there is a misconception that being from 
north america means being rich he said 
heimdal said his father roy stayed in quito to withdraw the 
remainder of the familys money from a bank there and to bring his 
sons fiancee sandra durango to the united states 
mrs heimdal said she did not know exactly how much was raised 
for her sons release but that any money that might be left would 
go to charity 
everybodys been so supportive even strangers people who 
dont know the family heimdal said i owe a debt i probably 
will never be able to repay

the fall and winter brought east 
germanys revolution summer saw the economic merger of the two 
germanys now people are predicting a hot autumn as the two 
states stride toward political unity 
so far the moves toward unification have been charged with 
symbolism the tearing down of the berlin wall the establishment 
of a single currency the elimination of internal border controls 
the next stage looks to be more prosaic long and difficult 
negotiations toward the political treaty that will iron out 
constitutional and legal obstacles to unification 
government negotiators hope to be able to present a unity treaty 
to their respective parliaments in september 
on monday night the east german government called for joint 
elections in both countries on dec 2 one of two december dates 
proposed by the bonn government 
guenther krause a leader of east germanys dominant christian 
democratic union said the east german proposal also calls for 
state elections in east germany on oct 14 
officials in bonn have said they want to change only those parts 
of the west german constitution absolutely necessary for 
unification 
but one of the biggest legal differences between the two 
germanys their opposing abortion laws will probably be left 
unresolved before unification 
in west germany a woman must prove medical or financial 
necessity to have an abortion in east germany abortions on demand 
are legal in the first trimester 
a west german government spokesman speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the differing laws would probably continue for a 
transitional period meaning west german women could travel east 
for abortions 
another point of contention is what city berlin or bonn will 
be the capital of a united germany 
east german prime minister lothar de maiziere has said he wants 
berlin stipulated as the capital in the final unification treaty 
but politicians in the west have balked and kohls government has 
said the decision must come from a united german parliament 
how to conduct allgerman elections for a united parliament has 
also become a point of debate 
west german law requires political parties to have a minimum 5 
percent election showing for representation in parliament there is 
no such minimum in east germany and politicians there have said it 
would be unfair to require east german parties to attain 5 percent 
of the vote in a united germany 
as a compromise west german interior minister wolfgang 
schaeuble has suggested that the balloting be conducted separately 
in east and west germany 
domestic financial issues also need resolving 
east german finance minister walter romberg has demanded 
negotiations to include east germany in a west german financial 
program that redistributes funds from rich areas to poorer ones 
but according to a west german draft of the unity treaty the 
five new states in what is now east germany would not be eligible 
for such revenuesharing until after 1994 
the 70 billion german unity fund established to help with east 
german reconstruction would be the sole source of financing until 
then the draft says 
unification is also contingent on international approval but 
that is expected to come in november at a meeting of the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe 
last week west germany addressed some of moscows concerns 
about german unification by announcing that 780 million would go 
to help finance the cost of the 380000 soviet troops in east 
germany for the second half of 1990 
the status of soviet troops in east germany the military 
posture of a united germany and the size of a combined german army 
have been the kremlins main worries about a reunited germany 
the soviets have opposed a united germanys membership in nato 
but chancellor helmut kohl plans to visit moscow july 1516 for 
talks that are expected to focus on winning soviet approval for 
german nato membership by providing western aid to the moribund 
soviet economy 
west germany has already backed a 3 billion bank credit to the 
soviet union and has been pressing the european economic community 
to support an even larger aid package

anatoly grishchenko a soviet helicopter pilot 
who contracted leukemia after what was hailed as a heroic effort to 
try to douse the fire at the chernobyl nuclear plant has died at 
age 53 
grishchenko had been in critical condition with a lung infection 
for more than two weeks at fred hutchinson cancer research center 
where he had received a bonemarrow transplant april 27 in an 
attempt to conquer his leukemia 
he died late monday of cardiopulmonary failure said spokeswoman 
susan edmonds 
grishchenko in 1986 repeatedly flew his heavylift copter 
through the intensely radioactive gases spewing from the chernobyl 
plant dumping sand and cement in an overmatched effort to cap the 
crippled reactor 
he and a handful of others in the operation were designated 
heroes of the soviet union that countrys highest honor 
despite lead shielding on the aircraft and other protective 
gear grishchenko suffered radiation sickness and was found to have 
radiationrelated leukemia last year 
he arrived in seattle on april 11 for the marrow transplant 
which was performed after chemotherapy and radiation treatment to 
kill off his own marrow 
the transplant went smoothly but grischenkos condition 
suddenly deteriorated in midjune antibiotics had failed to knock 
out the lung infection which grishchenko developed before coming 
to seattle 
the pretransplant therapy leaves patients with no natural 
immunity against disease until the new marrow which is 
transplanted intravenously takes hold 
theres a lot of sadness its been difficult watching him not 
progress and as with all our patients we hope they come here be 
treated and go home and have a long life edmonds said it was 
very sad to watch him have problems and grow worse 
grishchenkos wife of 27 years galina was at his bedside 
edmonds said

the rev al sharpton was cleared of charges he 
stole some 250000 from a civil rights organization he declared 
the verdict proved he was targeted by prosecutors for his role in 
the tawana brawley case 
the jury that sat through the threemonth trial deliberated less 
than six hours monday before acquitting him of 67 counts of fraud 
and larceny 
at a victory party at the cotton club in harlem sharpton said 
of state attorney general robert abrams when he cant get one 
out of 67 counts not one to stick then its clear it was a 
vendetta 
two years ago sharpton had served as a spokesman for miss 
brawley the black teenager who was found by a grand jury to have 
concocted a story of rape and abduction at the hands of a gang of 
white men 
during the brawley investigation sharpton had accused law 
enforcement authorities of a racist coverup 
the flamboyant sharpton has taken part in other racially charged 
cases acting as spokesman earlier this year for the family of a 
black teenager slain by a white mob in the citys bensonhurst 
section 
abrams spokesman ed barbini said we accept the verdict of the 
jury we could not ignore the body of evidence that pointed to 
improprieties at the national youth movement and we felt it was 
our obligation to take these allegations before a jury 
sharpton had been charged with stealing from the national youth 
movement an organization he started at age 16 he faced up to 
seven years in prison if convicted 
assistant attorney general victor genecin had charged that 
sharpton sold ideals and then cheated the very people he was 
supposed to be helping 
the defense called no witnesses the state called more than 80 
defense attorney alton maddox had said abrams brought the 
charges out of vindictiveness because of sharptons role in the 
brawley case 
sharpton still faces tax fraud charges in a separate case in 
albany

county commissioners turned up the heat 
on state authorities they accuse of paying too little rent for 
space in the berkshire county courthouse 
they shut off the air conditioning 
lawyers in chief administrative justice arthur masons office 
not surprisingly are hot under the collar theyre considering 
appealing to the state supreme court asking that the air 
conditioning be restored to the 19thcentury courthouse in this 
western massachusetts city 
weve had both phone calls and correspondence indicating 
that the situation is very uncomfortable michael edgerton a 
lawyer for the massachusetts trial court in boston said monday 
massachusetts pays rent to counties for space in local 
courthouses for state courts and offices 
county commissioner peter f menard said the state plans to pay 
305000 about 100000 less than the amount the county believes 
is owed a dozen other counties are unhappy with the amount of rent 
they are getting from the state and all 13 are appealing the issue 
menard said 
commissioners dont plan to turn the air conditioning back on 
unless theres a court order or court rent menard said 
state officials facing a budget deficit of more than 1 
billion say they dont have the money 
our position is that weve paid out all the money thats been 
appropriated to the counties and we certainly cant pay out more 
than the state has edgerton said 
menard said he doesnt know why lawyers and other state office 
employees are complaining the courthouse has only had air 
conditioning in all rooms for about a year he said 
the electric bill jumped 10000 to 45000 last year and 
commissioners decided they had to cut back he said 
courthouse employees said the temperature is comfortable in 
basement offices but can get a little sultry in upstairs 
courtrooms temperatures in the berkshires rarely break out of the 
80s

aids activists attached condoms to 2000 coinbox 
copies of the arizona republic to protest an editorial cartoon that 
one protester claimed amounted to aids hatemongering 
the june 26 cartoon by the newspapers editorial cartoonist 
scott stantis showed two men walking into a bathhouse and one 
saying it puts me in a tizzie to think the government hasnt 
done a thing to stop the spread of aids 
the phoenix chapter of the national aids coalition to unleash 
power or act up said it attached the condoms in packages 
emblazoned with the groups name to mondays editions of the 
newspaper on sale in phoenix and three suburbs 
that cartoon presents such misinformation its a heinous 
crime to the valley said the chapters vice chairman jeff 
ofstedahl 26 it was aids hatemongering its been the gay 
community thats been chiefly responsible for closing down the 
bathhouses 
stantis said the cartoon was inspired by the abominable 
disruption of last months sixth international conference on aids 
in san francisco by aids activists who drowned out a speech by 
health secretary louis sullivan 
the activists have criticized us immigration restrictions on 
people with aids and say more money needs to be put toward the 
fight against aids 
david hume a spokesman for phoenix newspapers inc said those 
who disagree with an editorial commentary can promote their views 
through letters to the editor oppositeeditorial columns and 
discussions with our editorial page writers we hope that those 
with objections to anything we publish would do so in a civil 
manner

the lawmakers who replaced the 
communists as leaders of the prosperous northern republic of 
slovenia have proclaimed the states full sovereignty but stopped 
short of calling for secession 
there was no immediate reaction to the slovenian declaration 
from federal authorities or from rival serbia 
mondays parliamentary declaration provides for establishing an 
independent legal system that would take precedence over federal 
laws and for slovenian control over armed forces stationed in the 
republic state media said 
the document said slovenia should adopt a new democratic 
constitution within the next 12 months but made no mention of 
earlier calls for the republic to secede from the troubled yugoslav 
federation 
the media said a joint session of the republics 240seat 
legislature voted unanimously to adopt the declaration of 
sovereignty of the state of slovenia 
slovenia contains 2 million of yugoslavias total population of 
23 million 
the ljubljana nightly television news said the declaration asked 
slovenian authorities to assume control over units of the 
yugoslav armed forces stationed on slovenian territory and 
said a 30 percent cut in defense spending would be implemented 
a coalition of centerright parties formed a new government last 
month in slovenia the most prosperous of yugoslavias six 
republics after trouncing reform communists in the first free 
state elections held in communistruled yugoslavia in 45 years 
the republics new authorities demand that yugoslavia transform 
itself into a loose confederation of sovereign states they 
threaten that slovenia will declare full independence from 
yugoslavia if the remaining republics do not accept its proposals 
for a confederation 
yugoslavia including slovenia was created in 1918 
premier lojze peterle and other slovenian leaders also say 
slovenia should take urgent steps to join the european community 
no matter what yugoslavias communistruled southern states say 
the demands have been echoed in croatia the countrys 
secondlargest state a centerright party came to power there last 
month in free elections 
the hardline communist government in the largest state of 
serbia vehemently opposes turning yugoslavia into a confederation 
serbia rejects westernstyle democracy and does not plan to hold 
free elections for at least another year 
the slovenian declaration also said police should take over 
control of frontiers with neighboring italy and austria replacing 
border guards deployed for the past 45 years by yugoslavias 
communist government ljubljana tv said 
it said the state would establish its own intelligence and 
counterintelligence services that would be independent of their 
communistcontrolled federal counterparts 
the adoption of a declaration of sovereignty has been under 
discussion in the new parliament since the new government was 
installed in may 
slovenias president milan kucan has said that slovenia 
intends to proclaim sovereignty as part of its drive for liberal 
political and economic reform in yugoslavia 
the timing of mondays proclamation by slovenia may have been 
affected by serbias sudden decision last week to hold a special 
referendum sunday and monday on adopting consitutional reforms that 
would virtually destroy any remaining autonomy for its troubled 
province of kosovo 
slovenia and croatia increasingly have sided with kosovos 
ethnic albanian majority in its drive for autonomy from serbia 
in kosovos capital of pristina after serbian police on monday 
barred about 100 ethnic albanian deputies from entering the 
provinces parliament about 40 deputies proclaimed kosovo equal to 
the six yugoslav republics 
the deputies want to revoke a constitutional amendment that gave 
serbia almost total control over kosovo

prime minister kazimiera prunskiene of lithuania 
says leaders of the three baltic republics will meet next week to 
devise a strategy for independence talks with the kremlin 
mrs prunskiene who returned from a visit to finland and 
estonia on monday night said she wanted all three baltic states to 
be involved in negotiations with the kremlin but that the moscow 
leadership was opposed to the idea 
the official tass news agency quoted her as saying at a news 
conference in the lithuanian capital of vilnius that lithuania 
estonia and latvia would work together on lithuanias approach to 
negotiations with the kremlin 
meanwhile soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov said the initial 
phase of the independence talks would be the most difficult as 
lithuania offers its ideas about its future course 
if the republic remains a part of the ussr with some 
special status this will call for one scenario he said if 
they categorically insist on seceding from the ussr 
negotiations will have a completely different scenario 
ryzhkov also told the unofficial interfax news agency that talks 
between the kremlin and lithuania should be held at the prime 
ministerial level 
but he said unfortunately we have received no answer yet from 
the lithuanian leaders as to who will negotiate with soviet 
officials on the level of prime minister or otherwise 
the soviet government responding to lithuanias agreement to a 
moratorium on its declaration of independence resumed pumping oil 
to lithuanias largest refinery at mazhiekia on saturday 
but motorists in lithuania are still finding it difficult to buy 
gasoline for their personal use a parliamentary spokesman in 
vilnius said 
gasoline is going mainly to agricultural concerns said haris 
subacius a spokesman for the supreme council legislature 
the blockade is being lifted but we cannot feel it yet 
subacius said he said it would probably be two or three weeks 
before the situation was normal 
the soviet government cut off shipment of all oil most natural 
gas and numerous other items to lithuania on april 18 in an attempt 
to force it to rescind its march 11 declaration of independence 
natural gas shipments were to be resumed today the news agency 
postfactum said but there was no information on supplies of other 
raw materials that were blocked by the kremlin 
on friday the lithuanian parliament accepted a compromise which 
traded a 100day moratorium on the independence decree for an 
immediate end to the blockade and the start of negotiations 
subacius said the negotiations between vilnius and moscow could 
begin within two weeks

a west german chemical company has agreed to 
pay 375 million to a woman who claimed her leukemia was caused by 
a detergent used to launder her diapers 23 years ago 
fawna wright 23 of mound city ill reached the settlement 
with basf wyandotte corp on monday her lawyers contended 
chemicals in loxene may have harmed thousands of infants before the 
detergent was pulled from the market in the 1960s 
im amazed by it said wright whose leukemia is in 
remission something that happened as a baby took part of my 
life 
wright had sued in 1985 maintaining her illness was caused by 
chemicals in loxene that included pentachlorophenol a substance 
more widely used as a pesticide and wood preservative the trial 
was to have begun monday 
despite being warned as early as 1959 that pentachlorophenol was 
unsafe the company instructed booth memorial hospital in st 
louis where wright was born in how to use loxene on diapers crib 
sheets and other linens the lawsuit charged 
the nowdefunct hospital was operated by the salvation army for 
unwed mothers 
the salvation army agreed to pay wright 5000 and dow chemical 
co setttled for 60000 said her lawyer robert s bogard dow 
and monsanto co were accused of manufacturing chemicals in the 
detergent monsanto was dropped as a defendant 
in a statement basf said that it is not directly responsible 
for her condition because the hospitals disregarded clearly 
stated use instructions and warnings 
wright became gravely ill when she was 5 days old but recovered 
at age 12 she was diagnosed as having leukemia the lawsuit said 
because of sealed records wrights lawyers said they were able 
to trace only eight other babies born at booth during the time the 
hospital used loxene 
two died as infants and a third suffers from a learning 
disability the lawyers said in 1966 an outbreak of illness 
attributed to loxene at pembina county hospital in cavalier nd 
left one infant dead they said 
bogard said wyandotte chemical as the company was known at the 
time should have removed loxene after the north dakota outbreak 
instead of waiting until the products registration was revoked 
more than a year later 
we now have hundreds of persons exposed at booth or other 
hospitals using loxene during the 1960s who may be suffering from 
problems bogard said

the oil spill in the chesapeake bay probably 
will have a minimal effect on the environment the coast guard says 
officials said about 30000 gallons of fuel oil went into the 
bay and the elizabeth river when two cargo ships collided at the 
mouth of the estuary on sunday 
a coast guard board of investigation was to convene today to 
take testimony from the ships crews 
capt eugene k johnson commander of the coast guard marine 
safety office said aerial surveys showed that the oil in the bay 
was dissipating but that some had washed ashore on norfolk beaches 
he said most of the oil was in the river 
i think the environmental impact on the bay will be minimal 
johnson said monday 
the bridge crews and pilots of both ships were given drug and 
alcohol tests a standard procedure after such accidents but the 
results were not yet available he said 
environmentalists were concerned that the spill could 
contaminate spawning blue crabs in the mouth of the bay but robert 
byrne associate director of research at the virginia institute of 
marine science said it appeared the crabs might be spared because 
most of the oil was in the river 
johnson said the cleanup would take several days about 150 
people and five oil skimmers collected about 1500 gallons monday 
he said 
the outbound columbus america en route to melbourne australia 
sustained extensive damage the coast guard said johnson said the 
ships owner columbus america inc of hamburg west germany has 
agreed to pay for the cleanup 
officials had no estimate of what the cleanup would cost 
the singaporeregistered neptune jade which was inbound 
received minor damage the coast guard said 
the columbus americas 140000gallon fuel oil tank ruptured in 
the collision the ships captain immediately returned to port 
heading for a ship repair yard and leaking fuel along the way the 
coast guard said 
it was his determination that the problem could not be fixed 
at sea and he chose to return to port we concurred johnson 
said

it started looking bad for the first soviet 
football team to play on american soil when the players heard the 
turkish national anthem played in their honor 
it went downhill from there 
the soviet national champion moscow bears were whipped 610 
monday night by the yearold tacoma express a minorleague 
football team in an exhibition game before 1300 spectators in the 
tacoma dome 
the game was billed by promoters as glasnost on the gridiron 
bears coach john ralston a former denver broncos head coach 
didnt talk game strategy or give his players a fiery pep talk 
before the game he explained to them how to suit up in full pads 
dont forget you need your thigh pads your knee pads and 
your elbow pads he said through an interpreter you dont want 
to land on that astroturf without your elbow pads 
the moscow bears are among some 20 teams in the fledgling soviet 
union american football league founded a year ago for the past 
eight weeks ralston has been trying to mold the group of onetime 
rugby players shotputters javelin throwers and decathletes into 
a professional football team 
after monday night it was clear he still has a ways to go 
im disappointed in our fundamentals he said after the 
game i dont think we do the fundamentals very well 
the bears are playing at least four american exhibition games 
arranged by an alabama sports promotion company the team is to 
play in fresno calif oklahoma city and macon ga with a 
possible match in charlotte nc 
the starting quarterback first touched a football seven months 
ago and hes the veteran ralstons biggest player tips the scales 
at 250 pounds 
ralston had said he mainly wanted to ensure his players finished 
the game intact especially his starting tight end since both 
backups had been detained in the soviet union by the kgb the night 
before departure 
the bears suffered no major injuries 
the anthem mixup wasnt the only glitch fans found their 
programs carried no numbers for the soviet players the announcer 
searched in vain for starting lineups while waiting for a soviet 
interpreter who never got to the booth she stayed on the field to 
relay ralstons play calls and other assignments 
i had a dream three weeks ago that i was calling a football 
game and that i didnt know the players or what was going on the 
dream came true what a nightmare said tim harrington a 
playbyplay announcer for radio station kkmo 
when it came time for national anthems the soviets appeared 
stunned when they heard the selection played for them 
organizers discovered their mistake while the american anthem 
was being sung fans and players then stood a third time to listen 
to the real soviet anthem 
tacoma built a 130 lead after one quarter and a 340 advantage 
by halftime with the express leading 480 after three quarters 
the fans began to chant go bears 
ralston said earlier that competition or the lack of it could 
be a hurdle in the whole communist system theres no incentive 
for being better than somebody else he said theres no 
competition and that hurts 
until this week the players were outfitted in whatever castoff 
equipment they could find he said he told of watching games where 
a team had equipment for only two dozen players and players had to 
trade helmets and pads when they went in as substitutes 
but thanks to american corporate sponsors who have donated 100 
pairs of shoes and enough helmets and pads for the whole team the 
bears will return to moscow as well dressed as most minorleague 
american teams

japan today rejected as premature a soviet proposal 
to share ownership of sovietheld islands in the kuril chain which 
japan claims as its own 
we insist that they do belong to japan and that subject 
should be cleared up first foreign ministry spokesman taizo 
watanabe said at a news conference but he said the proposal was 
interesting 
the issue is a longstanding sore point that has prevented the 
soviet union and japan from signing a peace treaty to formally end 
world war ii 
earlier this week political commentator vsevolod ovchinnikov 
wrote in pravda the soviet communist party newspaper that the 
dispute over the islands could be settled if tokyo and moscow 
agreed to place the islands under united nations trusteeship as a 
special economic zone jointly owned by the soviet union and japan 
soviet troops occupied the islands in the closing days of world 
war ii 
japan insists that the islands were japanese by longstanding 
agreement and that they were not war booty to be taken from 
japanese rule 
the soviets have said repeatedly that the issue was settled long 
ago and they refuse to consider japans demand 
japan has been cool to suggestions by other western countries to 
give financial help to the soviets to help bolster president 
mikhail s gorbachevs economic liberalization 
watanabe asked about such proposals to aid moscow said japan 
does not stand in the way of other countries giving money but the 
lack of a peace treaty prevents tokyo from supplying aid 
that is a problem weve got to solve first before we can go 
into largescale economic cooperation with that country he told 
foreign journalists 
later this year soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze is 
expected to visit tokyo for talks preparing for an official visit 
gorbachev has announced for next year the territorial issue would 
be high on the agenda for the gorbachev visit 
the islands off the coast of northernmost japan lie in waters 
rich with fish and have some strategic importance in controlling 
sea lanes between the pacific ocean and the sea of okhotsk

the philippines can pursue its legal 
effort to recover assets purportedly hidden by the late president 
ferdinand marcos despite his wifes acquittal by a new york court 
a swiss official said today 
however marcos attorneys in switzerland said the new york 
verdict appeared to back their argument that imelda marcos cannot 
be held responsible for alleged crimes by her late husband they 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the verdict reached monday cleared mrs marcos of looting 222 
million from the philippine treasury and sinking it into manhattan 
real estate and other investments 
the new york jurors told reporters they were unconvinced that 
mrs marcos knew of her husbands alleged wrongdoings 
swiss justice department spokesman joerg kistler however said 
the acquittal has no legal effect on the swiss proceedings 
it would be wrong to conclude from the acquittal in new york 
that swiss judicial aid to the philippines is not permissible he 
said 
switzerland is helping the philippines government of president 
corazon aquino in its quest for swiss courts to order the return of 
assets the marcos clan purportedly deposited in accounts here the 
philippines claims the asserts were illgotten gains 
but appeals by marcos lawyers have blocked any return of money 
or handing over of bank documents since marcos was ousted and 
forced to flee his country in february 1986 at that time mrs 
aquino was swept to power by what became known as the people 
power rebellion 
the swiss accounts involved in the case are believed to contain 
several hundred million dollars although the new philippine 
government originally spoke of billions

orders to factories for manufactured goods 
rebounded 21 percent in may the government said today in another 
report indicating the economys weak industrial sector may be 
bouncing back 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 2409 billion and 
regained their 21 percent loss in april 
the size of the may increase had been expected by many analysts 
at the same time the april decline was smaller than the 23 
percent drop initially reported last month 
it was the third gain in orders since they dropped 55 percent 
in january their steepest decline since a 70 percent decrease in 
december 1974 all major categories advanced except nondurable 
orders which were unchanged at 1124 billion 
there have been other recent signs of an improving manufacturing 
sector including a 06 percent jump in industrial production in 
may 
factory orders are a key economic barometer of manufacturing 
industry plans for production a decrease in orders could result in 
a slump in that sector and subsequent layoffs 
but much of the improvement has been attributed to exports 
american consumers on the other hand have slowed their purchases 
which had been a major driving force during the 7 years of 
economic expansion 
and the construction industry remains stalled commerce reported 
on monday that spending fell 04 percent in may for its second 
straight monthly decline 
commerce said the increase in new factory orders was 
concentrated in durables bigticket items expected to last at 
least three years they were up 40 percent to 1286 billion and 
nearly regained their 41 percent decline in april 
durable goods orders had been reported up 39 percent in the 
departments initial report on june 22 
most of the increase was in transportation orders up 101 
percent to 355 billion automobiles accounted for most of the 
gain although defense aircraft orders also were up 
excluding transportation orders rose 08 percent 
in the key category of nondefense capital goods a barometer of 
business investment plans orders slipped 15 percent to 360 
billion they had fallen 106 percent in april after a march gain 
of 133 percent 
shipments rose 20 percent to 2389 billion more than 
offsetting aprils 13 percent decline and exceeding the previous 
record of 2382 billion set last august 
unfilled orders increased 04 percent to 5203 billion and 
inventories were unchanged at 3724 billion inventories have been 
relatively flat since last july 
among the durable sector nonelectrical machinery orders rose 
35 percent to 223 billion nearly erasing aprils 37 percent 
loss electrical machinery orders advanced 08 percent to 206 
billion after a 44 percent gain primary metals orders were up 17 
percent to 118 billion nearly matching aprils 16 percent drop 
the volatile defense category posted a 192 percent gain to 
100 billion on top of increases of 48 percent and 45 percent 
the previous two months excluding defense orders were up 15 
percent

mr pig is rolling in it 
the 150pound grayrumped hog along with a german shepherd 
named calamity jane will be taken care of for the rest of their 
lives after inheriting part of a 600000plus estate left by margo 
lamp of davenport who died in february at 81 
chico the amazon parrot is also living comfortably despite 
losing a large chunk of an inheritance to its late owners 
godchildren but the fate of four cats clementine martha gene 
and smudge hinges on what happens in probate court 
the animals belonged to three iowans who stipulated in their 
wills that money from their estates be used for the wellbeing of 
their pets the owners all died over the last eight months 
i dont think its strange at all said susan halberstadt of 
the american humane association in denver its a very special 
bond that exists between people and their animals 
many people are doing this she said obviously these 
people had a very deep profound love for their pets 
ms lamp willed the bulk of her estate to the scott county 
humane society but set aside money for her dog and her hog mr 
pig she had no close relatives and left 1000 to a distant cousin 
and 1000 to a friend said her lawyer george goebel 
i think that what you have is older people that because of 
advanced age their sphere of friends die disappear their pets 
become close companions to them he said 
chicos owner ellen goldie bengston of clinton left most 
of her 70000 estate in a trust for her parrot and a poodle named 
pipi pipi died soon after and harold bengston the executor of his 
sisters estate asked a judge to reduce the amount set aside for 
the bird 
the amount was lowered to 18000 with the rest of the money 
going to two of ms bengstons godchildren 
melody stanton of camanche willed her 12000 estate to the four 
cats her mother eleanor hodge said it was stipulated that the 
money be used for the care and comfort of the only possessions i 
have in my life my animals my cats

arson investigators have received 
hundreds of tips since gov george deukmejian posted 50000 
rewards for information leading to the culprits in two wildfires 
that destroyed nearly 500 homes 
no arrests have been made but authorities reported progress in 
glendale where 46 homes were destroyed and 26 damaged by a fire 
set wednesday in 105degree windy weather 
fire capt john orr said monday that glendale officials had 
tracked down the owners of two cars who were nearby when the fire 
was started by a butane lighter rigged with a pin to keep burning 
a third car was being sought 
at this point theyre witnesses as far as were concerned 
orr said 
in santa barbara where a fire destroyed 430 homes and 28 
apartment buildings and killed a woman investigators found what 
they described as an incendiary device in a remote area 
the new york times reported the device was a match and the los 
angeles times said the device was sent to the fbi for analysis 
officials declared the 4500acre fire fully controlled at 6 
am today said maeton freel a us forest service spokesman 
some of the 710 firefighters planned to remain several days on 
mopup operations he said 
orr said the fires were believed set by socalled vanity 
pyromaniacs who want attention or perhaps to become firefighters 
or by true pyromaniacs who are thrilled sometimes sexually by 
watching the destruction 
investigators are concentrating on interviewing anyone who was 
on hand when the fire began officials said 
arson is the only crime where the suspect sticks around orr 
said 
even after a fire is out investigators haunt the area where it 
began 
sometimes these firebugs will come back said maeton freel 
forest service information officer for the santa barbara fire if 
they can catch them coming back even if they cant arrest them 
right away sometimes they can backtrack

when she reported for jury selection three 
months ago imelda marcos posed the question why was she being 
tried here instead of in her homeland 
after the prosecution had called its 95th and final witness the 
judge was equally curious to ask why a us court was trying a case 
involving the theft of money from the philippines 
the jury was puzzled too and on monday it settled the issue 
we are not big brothers to the people overseas juror thomas 
orourke said it was a totally silly case 
the jury acquitted the former philippines first lady of charges 
she helped her husband loot 222 million from their homeland and 
hide the money in art and us real estate 
codefendant adnan khashoggi also was acquitted of helping the 
marcoses hide ownership of their investments 
in a statement us attorney otto obermaiers office praised 
the work of the prosecutors and said the jury has rendered its 
verdict our system of justice has spoken 
in manila president corazon aquino said she was disappointed by 
the acquittal and said mrs marcos was still barred from returning 
home for security reasons her officials said they are ready to 
file charges against mrs marcos if she is allowed to return 
us district judge john f keenan ruled that us courts 
properly had jurisdiction citing a precedent set in an earlier 
case and the fact that the disputed real estate purchases had 
occurred in new york but the judge had wondered why the united 
states was prosecuting a former ally 
i want to find out what the frauds were here in america 
because mrs aquino can enforce her own laws he said last month 
i dont want to enforce her laws here 
legal experts who watched the case said the jury could follow 
standards different from those keenan was required to adhere to by 
legal precedent 
the jury probably said we dont care its the philippines 
problem if its anybodys said vivian berger a professor at 
columbia university law school 
whether mrs marcos was properly tried in the united states was 
not the only reason for acquittal jurors said a sympathy factor 
and what they saw as a weak government case also played a role 
we thought the government did a terrible terrible job said 
orourke they had halftruths and not the right witnesses it 
was a terrible case 
it was a poorly prepared case said jury forewoman catherine 
balton there was nothing to convince any of them that there was 
a case 
orourke said the us government should have dropped the case 
when marcos died in september three years after the couple fled to 
exile in hawaii 
for three years they have made this poor womans life 
miserable he said the trial was interrupted three times because 
mrs marcos fell ill on one occasion she collapsed in front of 
the jury and coughed up blood 
witnesses testified that the marcoses through associates and 
friends secretly funneled millions of dollars out of their country 
and bought four new york buildings jewelry for mrs marcos and art 
the central issue jurors had to decide was how much mrs marcos 
knew about her husbands alleged corrupt practices they were 
unconvinced of her involvement clearing her of racketeering 
conspiracy fraud and obstruction 
just because she was married to him doesnt make her guilty 
ms balton said

president bush will urge the nato allies this 
week to adjust to changing times by adopting new strategies for 
repelling a soviet attack with fewer nuclear weapons and fewer 
troops along europes eastwest divide us officials say 
the most dramatic aspect of the change will be to make the use 
of nuclear weapons a highly unlikely last resort quietly however 
the nato allies also will respond to a diminished soviet threat by 
thinning out their ground forces along the eastwest frontier 
instead the officials told the associated press on monday a 
heavy proportion of nato troops will be deployed at various points 
behind the eastwest line prepared to rush to any breach in 
western defenses 
a pending treaty to sharply reduce us and soviet troops 
tanks artillery and other nonnuclear arms in europe is 
contributing to the revision in strategy that bush and the leaders 
of the 15 other nato countries will undertake in london on thursday 
and friday 
there simply will be fewer us troops in europe and fewer 
soviet soldiers to defend against 
moreover east germany is about to be absorbed by west germany 
removing the onetime staunch soviet ally from the front line and 
requiring a tactical shift in the alignment of nato troops 
as part of the new western approach bush is ready to consider 
scrapping the 1470 us nucleartipped artillery shells now based 
mostly in west germany and reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 
1560 us nuclear bombs deployed in seven nato countries the 
officials said 
the disclosures left at least some american liberals unimpressed 
paul warnke the chief arms control negotiator in the carter 
administration said the administration was stalling while trying 
to make nato look a little less threatening 
warnke said the anticipated withdrawal of some nuclear weapons 
was only cosmetic and that the 700 us nucleartipped lance 
missile still in western europe should be pulled out as well 
at a news conference warnke said the missiles were aimed at 
east germany and could also be used against poland and 
czechoslovakia there is no purpose there is no targeting sense 
to their being there anymore warnke said 
but warnke said the bush administration intends to replace the 
withdrawn tactical nuclear weapons with sealaunched cruise 
missiles and a new airtosurface missiles 
and david shorr assistant director of the british american 
security information council a private research group said 
there has been scant recognition in the bush administration that 
the security situation in europe has changed radically 
the change in nuclear policy is prompted by a vastly reduced 
soviet threat and the crumbling of the sovietled warsaw pact for 
instance hungary whose parliament last week voted in a 
nonbinding resolution to leave the alliance has quietly proposed 
to nato participating as observers in political or 
nonmilitary committees a us official said 
the revision in nato strategy would not strip the western 
alliance of all nuclear weapons however in fact the bush 
administration has made sure in its arms control talks with the 
soviets to clear the way for production of a new shortrange 
nuclear weapon the airtosurface tasm 
but the officials speaking on condition of anonymity stressed 
that the likelihood of an attack by the red army and other warsaw 
pact forces or a blitzkrieg that nato could only push back with 
nuclear weapons was becoming very remote 
some of the changes bush and the 15 other allied leaders will 
approve will appear in the communique issued at the end of the 
summit on friday others officials said will be implemented in 
the field with the pace partly determined by what the east does 
about its forces 
the shift in nato thinking varies among the allies britain and 
france are the least inclined to relax the nuclear deterrent while 
west germany italy and the scandinavian countries want to 
deemphasize nuclear weapons without abandoning them an official 
said 
that places bush somewhere in the middle of the debate but also 
prepared to scrub the concept of early first use of nuclear 
weapons in the event of attack the officials said 
that theory was adopted in the 1960s over the opposition of 
robert s mcnamara defense secretary in the kennedy and johnson 
administrations it calls for threatening and actually using 
nuclear weapons if natos forces are incapable of halting an 
invasion of the warsaw pact which has an edge of 2 to 1 in tanks 
and artillery 
but now soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is committed to 
withdrawing tens of thousands of tanks and troops from eastern and 
central europe while most of the countries in the warsaw pact are 
gradually leaving the soviet orbit 
meanwhile nato and the warsaw pact are in the midst of 
negotiating a treaty in vienna that would limit soviet troops in 
europe to 195000 us troops to 225000 and set ceilings on 
tanks artillery and other categories of nonnuclear weapons 
bush responded in may by abandoning plans to replace the 88 us 
shortrange lance nuclear missile launchers in west germany the 
netherlands and italy with a more powerful version 
and now according to the officials he is ready to withdraw the 
1350 nucleartipped artillery shells deployed in west germany and 
120 others based in germany turkey and italy if the allies concur

in a major breakthrough toward 
reconciliation of the two koreas the north and south today 
completed negotiations on terms for a historic summit by prime 
ministers of the rival nations 
the meeting would be the first talks between top government 
leaders of the koreas since the 1945 division of the peninsula into 
the communist north and capitalist south the talks could be held 
as early as august 
south korean negotiator song hanho told delegates at todays 
session that the summit will open a new chapter for realizing 
peaceful unification of the peninsula 
we cannot stick to the logic of the cold war and ignore 
changes in the world any longer he said 
the norths delegate paik nam jun said todays talks marked 
a new milestone in the history of the northsouth korea dialogue 
the delegates agreed to meet in the border village of panmunjom 
on july 26 to sign a negotiated accord that would outline a 
proposed agenda for the toplevel talks 
the agreement calls for those talks to be held in alternating 
capitals starting with the south korean city of seoul 
todays decision to sign the accord was reached during a meeting 
that lasted less than an hour unlike most dialogue between the two 
countries it was free of rancor 
the session was the first in five months the north suspended 
dialogue to protest joint ussouth korean military maneuvers 
although todays developments were hailed as a milestone in 
korean dialogue some longtime observers cautioned the talks could 
still falter 
years of hostility have bred distrust on both sides the two 
countries are still technically at war because no peace treaty was 
signed after the korean war from 1950 to 1953

leaders of both houses of congress 
urged president corazon aquino today to reverse herself and let 
imelda marcos come home after her new york acquittal on charges of 
looting this nations treasury 
but mrs aquino refused to relax the ban and accused mrs marcos 
of supporting a coup attempt in december 
the president found herself politically isolated with longtime 
supporters joining marcos loyalists in calling for the former first 
ladys return the constitution prevents her from being tried by a 
philippines court in abstentia 
on monday a federal jury in new york cleared mrs marcos of 
allegations that she used 222 million in government funds to buy 
real estate art and jewelry saudi financier adnan khashoggi was 
acquitted of helping her conceal ownership 
the acquittal does not alter the national interest and 
security grounds on which we have premised our decision not to 
allow the return of mrs marcos at the present time mrs aquino 
said 
in a second statement later mrs aquino said intelligence 
reports also showed that mrs marcos encouraged and supported 
those who wanted to grab power during the dec 19 coup attempt 
the fighting left 113 people dead and more than 600 injured 
the return of mrs marcos would enable her to mobilize the 
underground network of the marcos dictatorship which is designed 
to overthrow this government and endanger our democratic gains and 
economic momentum mrs aquino said 
in a telephone interview with manila radio station dzbb mrs 
marcos said i am not opposing mrs aquino 
i am not going to fight her what i will do is just pray to 
the lord that i be allowed to come home i know that he will grant 
me this just like my acquittal she added 
despite mrs aquinos stand most key leaders of the senate and 
house of representatives said mrs marcos should be allowed to 
return if only to stand trial 
house speaker ramon mitra said mrs marcos should never have 
been tried abroad and that it is important that the arm of the 
law gets hold of her and she gets her day in court 
in my view mrs marcos should be allowed to present her 
defense before philippine courts said senate president jovito 
salonga who was once jailed by marcos 
senate majority leader teofisto guingona said that unless i am 
shown specific proof that there is really danger to national 
security i would back allowing mrs marcos to defend herself 
personally here 
philippine officials said today they were ready to file criminal 
charges against mrs marcos if the president allows the former 
first lady to return 
the aquino government claims marcos and his associates stole 10 
billion before he was ousted in 1986 
the issue of mrs marcos is however especially difficult for 
mrs aquino because they share such a long and bitter history 
mrs marcos husband ferdinand was toppled by the 1986 popular 
revolt that brought mrs aquino to power he died in september in 
hawaii 
mrs aquinos husband benigno was slain upon returning home in 
1983 to challenge marcos 
some people suspect that personal bitterness between the two 
widows plays a more important role than national security in the 
decision to bar mrs marcos 
in addition allowing mrs marcos to return home now could be 
perilous for mrs aquino whose own popularity is at a low ebb 
recent public opinion surveys point to dissatisfaction over high 
prices deteriorating infrastructure and perceived inefficiency in 
the aquino administration 
the recent withdrawal of all us peace corps members from the 
country and reports that one of them has been kidnapped by 
communist rebels heightened concern about a deterioration of law 
and order 
meanwhile the military says renegade leaders of the december 
coup attempt are again recruiting followers for another putsch 
mrs aquino has said she does not plan to run for reelection in 
1992 and no clear favorite has emerged 
some political commentators believe that if mrs marcos were 
allowed to return she could wield considerable influence in the 
elections either by endorsing a candidate or running herself

public school teachers earn the highest salaries 
in alaska and the lowest in south dakota according to a survey 
that put the national average at 31315 
the average salary for us public school teachers in 198990 
rose 57 percent from a year ago said the survey issued monday at 
the annual convention of the 744000member american federation of 
teachers 
alaska had the highest average salary 43097 south dakota the 
lowest 21300 
average teacher salaries are nearly double 1980 levels of 
16100 and more than triple the 9705 earned in 1972 but after 
adjusting for inflation salaries have gone up a scant 68 a year 
since 1972 the survey said 
the statistics covered pay rates for the regular school year 
excluding extra pay for such things as working during the summer or 
supervising extracurricular activities 
teacher salary increases exceeded inflation for the eighth 
straight year and average starting salaries topped 20000 for the 
first time aft research director jewell gould told reporters today 
but starting teacher pay remains 5000 to 10000 below most 
other professions gould said starting engineers for example 
earn 32304 on average according to the union statistics liberal 
arts majors average 26244 and beginning accountants average 
27408 
with the lousy working conditions most teachers face and the 
lower salary levels its no wonder people are choosing other 
professions said aft president albert shanker 
teacher pay lags behind that of most other professions he said 
lawyers average 57172 auditors 36007 and chemists 47081 
the investment we are making in education as its reflected 
in teachers salaries is simply not sufficient to meet the needs 
of public education or our nations work force shanker said 
starting teacher salaries averaged 20476 in 198990 up 58 
percent according to the survey alaskas beginning pay topped the 
list at 29763 west virginias was lowest at 15778

rival factions of the palestine 
liberation organization clashed in this west bank village and 
three palestinians were killed and nine wounded when a grenade was 
thrown witnesses said today 
the toll in the battle monday was one of the worst in an 
internal plo dispute since the palestinian uprising began more than 
30 months ago villagers said it was between rival factions of the 
fatah wing of the plo 
witnesses said the battle broke out during a memorial march for 
a youth killed last year they said hundreds of villagers fought 
for several hours with rocks firebombs and guns before the battle 
ended with the grenade blast 
the three dead were between the ages of 12 to 14 and the injured 
were all youths or teenagers hospital officials and palestinian 
reporters said 
the army confirmed the deaths and injuries but said the clash 
appeared to have been the result a clan feud it said no troops 
were involved 
the army closed off the village today but witnesses to the 
clash told a reporter on idnas outskirts that the clans involved 
represent two groups within fatah each side accuses the other of 
collaborating with israeli authorities they said 
imad batran 16 told a reporter that one side in the villages 
fatah faction was staging a march for a 12yearold killed by 
soldiers a year ago when a villager from the rival faction pulled 
a knife on one of the marchers 
he said the intruder was pushed aside but later tried to drive 
into the marchers with a car setting off a melee batran called 
the intruder an israeli informer but refused to give the mans name 
i know his name but i will not say it he said 
ahmad rashid tmaize a 45yearold villager from the other 
faction said the driver of the car was from his family but was 
only driving near the march and accidentally got caught up in it 
he said the organizers of the march were four young villagers 
and referred to them as the gang of four the other fatah who 
are doing irresponsible things in the village he said they had 
argued with other plo factions and extorting money from villagers

the chief military prosecutor has opened 
investigations into the deaths of 11 people who were shot by east 
german border guards as they attempted to flee to west germany the 
staterun news agency reported today 
but the prosecutor col karlheinz boesel said he would only 
look into whether the guards were obeying orders the adn news 
agency said 
since the berlin wall went up on aug 13 1961 192 people are 
known to have died while trying to cross the heavily fortified 
border in berlin or between the two germanys 
most were shot to death by east german border guards under the 
notorious shoottokill policy that was canceled only last year 
there have been widespread public demands that border guards be 
prosecuted for the killings 
boesel said he would not act in any of the 192 cases unless 
specific charges were pressed by the victims relatives 
he spoke in an interview scheduled to be broadcast this evening 
by the west german ard television network adn was quoting from an 
advance text 
adn gave no details on any of the 11 cases being investigated 
except to say that relatives had filed murder or homicide charges 
border guards correctly obeying the shoottokill order were 
no violent criminals boesel said 
he argued for issuing some kind of exemption from prosecution 
so that border troops who used their firearms in the line of duty 
are offered a way out and a chance to make themselves known 
adn said the shoottokill order was issued in 1961 by gen 
heinz hoffmann who was east germanys defense minister until his 
death in 1985 
former communist leader erich honecker is the target of an east 
german murder probe stemming from the deaths of wouldbe escapees 
the adn report came two days after the final removal of all 
existing border checks between the two german states on sunday 
the two nations took their biggest step yet toward unification by 
merging their economies

the energy department said today it will cost 
about 6 billion in each of the next five years to store and clean 
up waste from nuclear weapons plants nearly 50 percent more than 
earlier was projected 
the agency blamed the higher cost estimates primarily on the 
discovery of additional wastes at doe sites and stricter government 
regulations that make the department and its contractors more 
susceptible to lawsuits 
it predicts that a doubling of cleanup staff may be necessary to 
meet the goals of does new fiveyear waste management plan through 
1996 
the revised fiveyear total through fiscal year 1995 will exceed 
286 billion compared with the 195 billion doe estimated six 
months ago according to a copy of the report summary made 
available monday by aides to rep norm dicks dwash 
such growth cannot now be managed responsibly and effectively 
given the inadequacy of the doe contractor industry and regulator 
infrastructure the report said 
preliminary estimates indicate that doe and its contractors 
must increase staff to at least two and onehalf times present 
levels it said 
a key member of congress said today he expected some increase in 
the cost estimates 
i always expect them to be higher but that is a mighty big 
difference between the estimate and the revised estimate said 
rep tom bevill dala chairman of the house appropriations 
energy and water subcommittee 
bevill said the new numbers will be closely scrutinized but he 
anticipates congress will support efforts to dispose of nuclear 
waste given the nations growing environmental concerns 
i think congress will be very supportive of anything dealing 
with the environment in this decade because our track record has 
not been so good in the past and people are now starting to realize 
it we are not getting very far very fast so far weve just 
talked about it he said 
dicks said the new figures demonstrate a need to finance 
research that will yield technology capable of disposing of the 
waste in a cheaper way 
the costs are going up we expected that said paul grimm 
assistant secretary for defense programs and director of the 
departments environmental safety and health coordination staff 
the more remediation we do the more we find that is going to 
have to be dealt with he said in confirming totals mentioned in 
the summary 
cost growth is to be expected as a normal consequence of this 
process however the cost estimates used in developing this 
fiscal year 199296 plan exceed what is considered a manageable 
growth rate the summary said 
these amounts challenge and almost certainly exceed the 
resources that can be brought to bear by doe its principal 
contractors the environmental restoration and waste management 
industries and state and federal regulators 
grimm said that in addition to new problems discovered at waste 
sites the increased costs are the result of stricter state and 
federal regulations governing waste disposal and cleanup 
perhaps the most significant and troubling factor in driving 
up cost estimates has been increased awareness of and exposure to 
civil and criminal liabilities for doe and contractor employees 
the report said 
grimm said some costs are expected to decline in the future as 
new technology uncovers cheaper ways to store and neutralize 
radioactive waste 
he said the new fiveyear plan through 1996 projects consecutive 
annual spending of 59 billion 64 billion 68 billion 63 
billion and 6 billion for a total of 314 billion 
the projections are consistent with earlier estimates that it 
would cost between 150 billion and 200 billion to clean up and 
store wastes at nuclear weapons plants nationwide over the next 30 
years grimm said 
the report stipulated that the estimates include unvalidated 
figures but it concluded that the costs have increased 
significantly since the last fiveyear plan was completed 
i dont think anyone was really caught by surprise said 
george behan dicks press secretary

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told the 
communist party congress today that four senior party officials had 
submitted their resignations although they had not yet been 
accepted 
none of the names mentioned by gorbachev was a major player at 
the 28th soviet communist party congress where the soviet leaders 
reform policies are under fire from hardliners 
the four included two members of the ruling politburo nikolai 
n slyunkov and vitaly i vorotnikov nonvoting politburo member 
alexandra biryukova and one member of the secondmost powerful 
body gumer i usmanov who sits on the party secretariat 
slyunkov and vorotnikov were two of 12 voting members of the 
politburo and biryukova was one of seven nonvoting members 
gorbachev said that slyunkov 61 was very ill and in the 
hospital he had not attended the party session which opened 
monday in the kremlin palace of congresses 
gorbachev said that usmanov 58 also was resigning for health 
reasons 
he did not give reasons for the resignations submitted by 
vorotnikov 64 and biryukova 61 although vorotnikov recently 
lost a job that carried nearly automatic inclusion on the 
politburo that of president of the russian federation the largest 
soviet republic 
the office of the russian presidency was drastically changed 
this year and communist maverick boris n yeltsin was elected to 
the job on may 29 he is not a politburo member 
when gorbachev announced biryukovas name there was a pause 
and a considerable hum of surprise among the delegates biryukova 
the only woman on the politburo was in charge of consumer goods 
the shortage of consumer goods has been one of the main 
complaints about gorbachevs policies 
word of her resignation came the day after gorbachev told the 
congress he would like to see more women elected to senior party 
positions 
gorbachev made the announcement reluctantly after he was 
pressed several times by delegates who asked from the floor 
whether rumors of impending politburo resignations were correct 
the resignations have not been accepted yet said gorbachev 
i think we should deal with personnel questions after the 
partys rules because they call for new positions and a new 
structure in the party leadership he said one proposal would 
rename the politburo as the presidium and expand the membership to 
30 
asked whether any other politburo members had submitted their 
resignations gorbachev said thats all so far 
another politburo member alexander yakovlev told the 
associated press last week that he had submitted his resignation to 
the secretariat when he was named to the presidential council an 
advisory board to gorbachev he did not indicate whether the 
resignation had been accepted 
another politburo member eduard a shevardnadze told the 
congress on tuesday he did not see any need for senior government 
officials to sit on the politburo

rioting broke out in the albanian 
capital when hundreds of people tried to enter a foreign embassy 
and an unspecified number of people were wounded the albanian 
government said today the greek government said there were reports 
of deaths 
western diplomats said about 200 refugees had sought sanctuary 
in foreign embassies since late last week in an apparent attempt to 
flee albanias repressive regime 
a statement by the official albanian news agency ata said 300 to 
400 people including vagabonds former prisoners as well as 
some deceived adolescents tried to enter a foreign embassy in 
tirana the capital monday night 
they clashed with forces of order throwing stones bricks 
and breaking shop windows and some people were slightly 
wounded it said 
the greek government released a statement saying according to 
other reports which have been impossible to confirm up to now 
shots were heard last night and it is rumored that there were 
victims among the population 
the albanian news agency said with the immediate interference 
of the forces of order and the working people of the capital the 
persons who violated order and tranquility dispersed there were 
slightly wounded on both parties a number had been detained it 
said 
the news agency called the disturbances alarming and said 
they were aimed at distorting the image of albania in the world 
a western diplomat in tirana who spoke to the associated press 
on condition of anonymity said other western diplomats told him of 
rioting in central tirana monday night i didnt see it myself 
but i heard shouting and shots the diplomat said 
earlier a west german foreign ministry spokesman said 83 
refugees were in the west german embassy compound and 60 to 80 
others were scattered in other foreign embassies 
the spokesman hanns schumacher would not specify which 
embassies were involved the west german bild newspaper said they 
included the embassies of greece italy algeria and egypt 
a western diplomat in tirana speaking on condition of 
anonymity said about 200 albanians had sought refuge in at least 
11 embassies 
the wave started last week especially on thursday and friday 
when 25 albanians entered the polish embassy the diplomat said 
he declined to say why so many albanians had suddenly rushed to 
the embassies 
the incident was reminiscent of events last year in which east 
germans crowded western embassies in eastern europe triggering the 
popular revolution in their country 
schumacher said one person was wounded in the leg late sunday 
night as albanian guards fired at refugees at the west german 
compound 
seventynine people fled into the compound monday night and 
early today four sought refuge the night before schumacher said 
he said the 79 refugees succeeded in entering the compound 
either by climbing the wall or by breaking it down with a truck 
in both cases the albanian security guards tried to hinder 
them by using their weapons the spokesman said 
he said the refugees motives were not clear but he assumed 
this is the outbreak of dissatisfaction with the existing 
political realities in albania 
he added nobody will be expelled from the embassy against his 
will 
the west german government summoned the albanian ambassador to 
the foreign office in bonn today and formally protested the 
brutal behavior of the albanian security guards schumacher said 
the foreign ministry also set up a crisis task force and 
schumacher said a meeting of the foreign policy arm of the european 
economic community was scheduled for wednesday in brussels to 
coordinate a response to the situation 
the situation is extremely difficult the bild newspaper 
quoted an unidentified west german embassy staff member on the 
scene as saying the report said the embassy apparently has been 
ringed by members of the albanian militia 
last august hungary opened its borders to the west and 
thousands of east germans began taking refuge in western embassies 
in warsaw pact nations or fleeing across the hungarian border 
east germany eventually was forced to open its borders and its 
communist government fell 
albania a hardline stalinist state has been vigorously 
resisting the types of prodemocracy reforms that have been 
sweeping other eastern european countries 
however the communist leadership has signaled some willingness 
to increase foreign ties and grant citizens freedoms long denied 
under the rigid regime imposed by the late leader enver hoxha 
the albanian state news agency ata reported last month that 
under new travel regulations all albanians age 16 and over would 
be entitled to apply for a passport valid for five years 
ata had indicated the decree would take effect this month 
travel for albanias 3 million citizens has been difficult if 
not impossible for decades 
last month albania also pledged to adopt basic reforms and seek 
full membership in the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe albania is the only nation in europe that refused to sign 
the 1975 helsinki agreements on security and human rights 
other moderate reforms announced in recent weeks had included 
the abolition of the death penalty for those trying to flee the 
country and the acceptance of religion officially banned for 
decades 
albanian leaders had also announced they were seeking to mend 
relations with the superpowers

nelson mandela was put on the defensive today over 
his calls for britain to reverse its policy of refusing to 
negotiate with the ira 
the black nationalist trying to calm the uproar he created with 
remarks in ireland on monday insisted he was only promoting peace 
not interfering in the northern ireland conflict 
the controversy developed after mandela on an otherwise 
triumphant 14nation trip to promote his antiapartheid efforts 
said in dublin that the british government should negotiate with 
the irish republican army british officials have refused to do so 
saying it is a terrorist group 
the deputy president of the african national congress has drawn 
bipartisan british criticism over his comments he was challenged 
to clarify his statement today when he spoke to about 200 members 
of parliament at the house of commons 
mandelas twoday visit to london which began late monday 
night was expected to focus on britains stand that european 
sanctions on south africa should be lifted to encourage the reforms 
launched by president fw de klerk 
instead the ira dispute has attracted the most attention both 
the british and irish governments oppose involving the outlawed ira 
in negotiations as long as it uses violence in its quest to end 
british rule in northern ireland 
i expressed no opinion whatsoever on the actual conflict 
between the ira and the british government mandela told todays 
meeting of parliaments allparty southern africa committee 
he said his group believes that all conflicts wherever in the 
world should be settled peacefully 
what is the use in the parties involved killing one another 
and killing innocent civilians when they could sit down and address 
their opponents by peaceful means 
mandelas african national congress is the leading group 
challenging south africas white government and its racist system 
of apartheid the anc has refused to renounce violence but de 
klerk has opened talks with that group and others 
ivor stanbrook of the governing conservative party introduced 
mandela today with words of praise but then chided him for 
appearing to equate the ira with the anc 
there is all the difference in the world between the struggle 
of a liberating movement against an oppressive despotic regime and 
violence carried out for political ends in a parliamentary 
democracy stanbrook said 
however several lawmakers greeted stanbrooks remarks with 
shouts of rubbish and disgrace 
mandela then delivered a 25minute speech appealing to britons 
to support international sanctions until there is irreversible 
progress toward ending apartheid 
south africas white government has launched a program to 
dismantle some of the apartheid system of racial discrimination de 
klerk also says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will 
bring blacks into the national government but allow whites to 
maintain veto power over major policy decisions however he 
opposes the oneperson onevote system the anc is demanding 
in his remarks to lawmakers mandela said he had tried to avoid 
commenting on internal problems of the countries he visited during 
his tour he added he took great pains not to comment on racism 
during his eightcity us tour last month 
mandela 71 was freed from prison earlier this year he had 
been jailed since 1962 and was serving a life term for sabotage and 
plotting to overthrow the government 
prime minister margaret thatcher who narrowly survived an ira 
bomb in 1984 was expected to defend britains policy barring talks 
with the ira during a meeting with mandela on thursday 
however the thatchermandela meeting will reflect a turnaround 
in another british policy britain had refused with talk to the 
anc branding it a terrorist group as well

conservatives mounted a counteroffensive against 
some of mikhail s gorbachevs reforms today at a crucial communist 
party congress that could help determine the fate of the soviet 
presidents ambitious program 
hardline politburo member yegor k ligachev won thunderous 
applause from the 4567 delegates at the 28th party congress when 
he angrily denounced what he described as a media campaign against 
conservative party members and their allies in the military 
in our day there are forces going against socialism and the 
communist party and they have great influence in the mass 
media ligachev said 
gorbachev who is general secretary of the party sat 
stonefaced as ligachev and other conservatives criticized reforms 
that they said were weakening the authority of the party 
the session was broadcast nationally after an eighthour delay 
mondays congress opening was broadcast live 
ligachev leading the conservatives attack was followed to the 
podium by two other prominent conservatives kgb chairman vladimir 
a kryuchkov and defense minister marshal dmitri t yazov 
a gorbachev ally foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
answered with a strong defense of reform or perestroika and of 
gorbachevs efforts to shift power from the party to government and 
legislative bodies 
shevardnadze who has been the point man in arms deals with the 
united states fended off criticism of concessions in the 
security arena 
squandering a quarter of our budget on military expenditures 
we have ruined the country he said we shall have no need for 
defense because a ruined country and an impoverished people have 
no need for an army 
he praised soviet policy toward eastern europe where since last 
august new more democratic governments have replaced what he 
called totalitarian regimes that had been imposed on them and 
were alien to them 
we forecast this we sensed that if there were not changes 
there would be tragedy he said 
in a remark that ran counter to soviet tradition shevardandaze 
said he did not see why the foreign minister should also sit on the 
politburo the top party body consisting of 12 voting and seven 
nonvoting members 
shevardnadze was applauded but not nearly as much as ligachev 
who later told reporters that the loss of eastern europe doesnt 
strengthen our position but weakens it 
yazov wearing his green marshals uniform emblazoned with 
several rows of medals sharply opposed calls by progressive 
communists to eliminate party cells in the soviet armed forces 
that would be very harmful he told the delegates including 
some military officers 
kryuchkov urged communists in their search for new political 
ideas not to ape the west which he said was plagued by 
materialism crime drug use and high unemployment 
very recently it was written here that in the west everything 
was bad and here everything was good kryuchkov said now we 
hear assertions that in the west everything is good and here 
everything is bad 
none of the conservatives criticized gorbachev by name but they 
attacked some of his policies 
ligachev harshly criticized three of gorbachevs programs the 
antialcoholism campaign that has since been abandoned and two 
emerging policies private ownership of factories and a move toward 
private ownership of land 
ligachev has been mentioned as a possible challenger to 
gorbachev when the 28th party congress elects the party leader 
he refused to say today whether he would be a candidate but he 
has said gorbachev should not hold the top party job and the 
countrys presidency at the same time 
ligachev received strong applause when he charged that putting 
factories in private hands will not help socialism but the 
audience was quiet when he said communal land unites while 
private property separates the interests of the people 
two weeks ago ligachev said gorbachev should not hold the top 
job in the party and the presidency at the same time 
but he received a restrained final ovation perhaps reflecting 
the sentiment that gorbachev retain both posts 
the congress has the power to elected a new central committee 
and major changes are expected in the personnel and structure of 
the politbuo those changes began to emerge during the afternoon 
session when gorbachev announced that four senior party officials 
had submitted their resignations 
none of the resignations had been accepted he said 
the four included two full members of the ruling politburo 
nikolai n slyunkov and vitaly i vorotnikov nonvoting politburo 
member alexandra biryukova and one member of the second most 
powerful body gumer i usmanov who sits on the party secretariat 
they have not been major players at the congress 
slyunkov and vorotnikov were two of 12 voting members of the 
politburo and biryukova was one of seven nonvoting members

the show didnt have any stars per se and we all got along 
well lanson recalled in a 1979 interview with the associated 
press it was very clean and there was no suggestive dancing a 
5 or 6yearold could watch it and of course a lot of people 
watched it to see what song was no 1 that week 
among the songs lanson sang were ebb tide he and mr 
sandman 
i sang mona lisa 13 straight weeks because it was a mans 
song and i was the only man on the show then lanson said 
lanson also said he was lucky to have been on the hit program 
i have no illusions of grandeur he said in 1979 i know 
that 99 percent of the singers roaming the country then were better 
than me 
i know my time has come and gone i had my time

when the trial ended with his acquittal adnan 
khashoggi did what hes done every day since it began last march 
he took the subway home 
smiling broadly surrounded by family and aides the man once 
considered the worlds richest person led a pack of photographers 
down the stairs plunked a token in the turnstile and boarded the 
no 6 local for the ride uptown 
minutes earlier on the steps of manhattans federal courthouse 
where he and former philippine first lady imelda marcos had just 
been acquitted of all charges khashoggi told reporters 
i am very happy for myself i am happy for my family and i am 
happy for america with your system of justice you should be very 
proud of yourselves 
khashoggi 54 had been accused of obstructing justice and mail 
fraud by faking documents to help mrs marcos and her late husband 
conceal their ownership of four new york office buildings and some 
paintings after a 1986 court order froze their assets 
throughout the threemonth trial he told reporters well wishers 
and anyone who would listen that he had done nothing wrong and 
trusted the american jury system to clear up the misunderstanding 
but this woman he would say referring to his codefendant 
she is sick and why are they treating her like this 
short portly and balding khashoggi looks like the consummate 
middle man that he has been for more than 30 years bringing 
together people who need something with those who have it and 
taking his cut for services rendered 
in that role he built an investment portfolio that once reached 
into 35 countries and earned him 80 million to 100 million a 
year although business setbacks have shrunk that empire and 
slightly crimped his jetset lifestyle in recent years he still 
has homes and offices in his native saudi arabia and in france 
switzerland britain and the united states a private dc8 and a 
yacht 
a devout moslem who only occasionally sips wine he loves night 
life and is likely to turn up in the local hot spots whenever he 
travels 
in the late 1980s he came under fire for his gobetween role in 
the irancontra affair in which the reagan adminstration secretly 
sold weapons to iran and diverted the funds to the usbacked 
contra rebels in nicaragua 
but khashoggi insists that everything he did had the approval of 
the us and saudi governments 
although he is acquainted with presidents and kings king fahd 
of saudi arabian guaranteed the 10 million bond that got him 
released from a new york jail intimates say that khashoggi 
retains a generous nature and common touch 
one friend who spoke on condition of anonymity said khashoggi 
once wrote a check for a distant relative who needed money and 
after the recipient doctored the check to increase the amount 
khashoggi instructed the bank to cash it anyway 
james linn khashoggis attorney said his client rode the 
subway to the trial because he had a habit of being late and it was 
faster than a limousine 
riding uptown on monday khashoggi sat between his son hussein 
and his daughter nabila posing for photographers and signing 
autographs for other riders 
and later as his entourage of 25 trooped across town toward his 
apartment at olympic towers adnan khashoggi took a cellular phone 
from his pocket and began calling the good news to relatives and 
friends in london paris and santa barbara calif

the national assembly voted 
overwhelmingly tuesday to replace the marxist state emblem with 
hungarys traditional coat of arms lawmakers then burst into a 
spontaneous singing of the national anthem 
it was the nations latest move to erase the legacy of four 
decades of communist rule 
of the 386 legislators 258 voted in favor 28 against 35 
abstained and the rest were absent 
there was considerable debate over two versions with and 
without the crown of st stephen the king who ruled between 997 
and 1038 ultimately the version with the crown was approved 
the largest opposition party the league of free democrats 
expressed fears that neighboring countries could misinterpret a 
national emblem containing the crown because the same coat of arms 
was used by the rightist prewar regime of admiral nicholas horthy 
supporters of the crown argued that it was the symbol of 
hungarian statehood it was king stephen who welded the hungarian 
tribes into a nation and christianized the people

bensonhurst racial attack defendant john vento 
was found innocent this morning of one count of murder but the 
sharply divided jury could not reach a verdict on a second murder 
charge against him 
the jury which was in its ninth day of deliberations convicted 
vento of two counts of unlawful imprisonment and four counts of 
menacing for his role in the attack which left 16yearold yusuf 
hawkins dead on a brooklyn sidewalk 
vento who backed out of a deal to testify against his 
codefendants in the case faces one and onethird to four years on 
the unlawful imprisonment counts and 90 days on each menacing 
count sentencing was set for aug 14 
the 21yearold sat silently as the verdicts were read 
vento was acquitted of the first murder count a weapons 
possession charge one count of unlawful imprisonment and five 
counts of discrimination the jury was also was hung on a count of 
firstdegree riot 
prosecutors said vento would be retried in september on the 
charges for which there was a hung jury 
the vento case was the second trial stemming from the attack by 
a white gang on hawkins who was shot and killed in the 
predominantly white neighborhood last year hawkins was in the area 
to look at a used car 
the first trial actually two trials held simultaneously with 
separate juries resulted in a murder conviction against joseph 
fama 19 and a conviction on lesser charges against keith 
mondello also 19 
state supreme court justice thaddeus owens who also presided 
over the earlier trials told the jurors judging ventos case that 
he knew it was not an easy case to decide 
i can understand your chagrin and i can also understand your 
anguish owens told the panel before dismissing them 
hawkins a black high school student was fatally shot last aug 
23 as he and three friends walked through the south brooklyn 
neighborhood of bensonhurst the four blacks crossed paths with a 
gang of batwielding whites which vento allegedly helped organize 
the attack was widely viewed as one of the worst racial 
incidents in new york in years the murder was a shock for a city 
trying to heal from the wounds of the racial killing in another 
predominantly white neighborhood howard beach as well as 
allegations of police attacks on blacks and other racially charged 
incidents in the late 1980s 
fama named as the triggerman by several of the defendants was 
sentenced to 32 and twothirds years to life ringleader mondello 
19 was acquitted of homicide charges but sentenced to five and 
onethird to 16 years in prison for his other convictions 
five other young bensonhurst whites accused of being part of the 
mob are to stand trial later 
the day after hawkins murder vento fled upstate but he soon 
called prosecutors to admit his role he also agreed to cooperate 
in the investigation and to testify against his friends in exchange 
for immunity from prosecution 
when he appeared before a grand jury in september vento gave a 
complete and graphic account of the attack he said he watched from 
just several feet away as fama pulled an automatic pistol and fired 
into hawkins chest 
vento told of seeing the sparks coming out of the gun pop 
the fire as hawkins collapsed to the sidewalk fatally wounded 
the whites ran without stopping to help him 
around christmas with the scheduled start of the first 
bensonhurst trial a little more than two months away vento again 
fled the city he surrendered to fbi agents in dayton ohio in 
march but announced he would no longer cooperate he was indicted 
by a grand jury a week later 
while theres no evidence vento even touched a gun the night of 
shooting prosecutors accused him of being a key player who helped 
his friend mondello call together the gang 
like a good general john vento marshals his troops just 
before the fray assistant district attorney martin hershey said 
in his final arguments 
vento was as guilty of murder as the shooter prosecutors 
charged because he continued to pursue the blacks after hearing 
fama say he was going to shoot one of them 
but defense lawyer gerald dichiara said fama acted independently 
and without warning in killing hawkins he also accused prosecutors 
of creating a racial issue for political purposes and going after 
vento out of vengeance because he reneged on his agreement to 
testify against the others

a navy task force was standing over the 
horizon off liberia today ready to evacuate americans or liberian 
president samuel doe if requested to do so by the state department 
in the wake of renewed fighting the pentagon said 
defense department spokesman pete williams said the navy ships 
sent to the area may 31 were still in international waters over 
the horizon from the coast of the troubled west african nation 
williams said about 800 americans including 70 embassy 
personnel remained in the liberian capital of monrovia 
rebels attacked monrovia on monday in a twopronged offensive 
that cut all major land routes from the capital according to a 
pool report filed by journalists there 
the pentagon spokesman said the primary purpose of the navy 
ships which have about 2500 sailors and marines on board is to 
evacuate americans if needed 
the state department advised us citizens on may 31 to leave 
liberia because of deteriorating conditions and some departed on 
chartered airline flights last month 
in response to a question about possible evacuation of doe 
williams said if the state department were to ask us to assist 
in moving president doe we would certainly be prepared to do what 
they asked us 
the state department has said it is prepared to help doe depart 
the country if he so requests 
a rebel source in ivory coast across the border from liberia 
said today that several thousand rebel troops were approaching 
monrovia to put an end to doe 
the united states and other governments have urged doe to resign 
and leave the country a condition the rebels have set for 
accepting a ceasefire

togo doe 40 a former master sergeant has ruled liberia since a 
bloody coup in april 1980 he ousted the descendants of freed 
american slaves who had ruled the west african country for more 
than a century

is made up of the amphibious assault ship uss saipan and the 
supporting ships uss ponce uss sumter and uss peterson the ships 
arrived off the coast june 3

evacuees for 10 days the navy said

some fuzzy images from the hubble space 
telescope may be improved through the same computer process that 
cleaned up photos taken by the voyager spacecraft but the pictures 
will still be less clear than originally expected a scientist said 
today 
ed weiler a hubble project scientist said a team of experts 
was being selected to determine how much of the fuzz ball now 
being seen by the space telescope can be turned into crisp pictures 
through computer techniques 
improving poor pictures through computers weiler told a news 
conference is something of a black art but experts in the 
field believe some hubble views such as those of bright objects 
can be improved 
ill believe it when i see it weiler told a news 
conference well let the experts play with the images people in 
the field say there is a lot of hope there 
weiler emphasized however that the computerenhancing 
technique is only an effort to salvage some good from a 
fundamentally flawed telescope 
this is not a cureall for the problem he said noting that 
the picture computer processing would recover less than 50 percent 
of the visual photo science that was expected from the 15 billion 
telescope 
hubbles basic problem is that a mistake was made in the 
grinding and polishing of either the primary or the secondary 
mirror on the telescope weiler said one of the reflecting surfaces 
was not cut to the correct prescription and as a result the two 
mirrors do not work together properly 
the result is a fuzzy view of the universe from the telescope 
lennard fisk chief scientist for the national aeronautics and 
space administration said on monday that the computer enhanced 
photos from hubble would be so good that you are all going to be 
delighted with the kind of results that the telescope produces in 
the next few years 
nasa engineers meanwhile stepped up tests designed to find and 
isolate a hydrogen leak that has grounded the nations three space 
shuttles 
helium under 30 pounds of pressure was forced into the hydrogen 
rocket fuel system of space shuttle atlantis as it sat monday on a 
launch pad at the kennedy space center a similar test using 
supercold liquid hydrogen revealed a leak last week 
plumbing and valves from columbia which was grounded last month 
when a hydrogen leak was found are now being tested at the shuttle 
manufacturers plant in california 
engineers hope the tests will pinpoint precisely how the 
hydrogen leaks from the shuttle and fuel tank while the supercold 
liquid rocket fuel is being loaded the leaks occurring within 
weeks of each other from the same area of two different shuttles 
led nasa last friday to ground the fleet until the problem is 
corrected 
fisk said the hubble focusing problem is absolutely consistent 
and that this reliable symmetry will enable scientists to correct 
the fuzzy view through a computer program 
there is growing optimism that because of the nature of the 
signal that we will be able to do image reconstruction and 
produce clear exciting views of the universe he said 
such techniques were used at the jet propulsion laboratory to 
improve the quality of pictures returned from the two voyager 
spacecraft that explored the outer planets and radioed views back 
to earth 
if youve seen pictures from voyager you know how capable we 
are of doing image reconstruction when the signals are not 
precisely in the focus that you want said fisk i think you 
will discover that hubble in its current capability produces 
exciting and very dramatic pictures of the universe 
engineers learned last week that one of the two main mirrors f 
the 15 billion space telescope contained a manufactured flaw that 
kept the telescope from seeing the universe clearly the hubble in 
effect is like a person who needs glasses and is trying to see the 
world without them 
fisk said the true focus of the hubble view is missed by a tiny 
measure about onefiftieth of the width of a human hair and 
that this makes the flaw easier to correct 
six months from now a year from now i expect you all to ooh 
and ahh over the picture that hubble is going to produce and of 
course compliment the current management of nasa for their success 
in pulling it off he told reporters 
at the same news conference nasa space flight director william 
b lenoir said the space shuttle mystery leak must be solved within 
a few weeks to keep the agency anywhre near its ambitious flight 
schedule 
columbias leak forced postponement of an astronomy mission in 
may and atlantis leak is delaying a secret military mission 
columbia had been scheduled to fly twice more this year and 
atlantis once more 
the third shuttle discovery must be launched in october to 
take advantage of a planetary alignment that occurs only once every 
two years the shuttles cargo is the ulysses science probe that is 
to study the sun 
lenoir said tests now under way may provide answers to the leak 
problem by thursday and allow the agency to reestablish a launch 
schedule

two maleonly eating clubs at princeton 
university discriminate against women and must open their 
membership to females the state supreme court ruled today 
the high court ruled unanimously in an 11yearold sex 
discrimination case brought by sally frank a former princeton 
university student who is now a law professor at new york law 
school in new york city 
the court rejected the clubs argument that menonly clubs are 
permitted as long as they sever their relationship with the ivy 
league university 
im really thrilled ms frank said from washington dc 
im glad that the court decided to stop discrimination at 
princeton 
lawyers for the eating clubs could not be immediately reached 
for comment 
ms franks suit was against the ivy club and the tiger inn the 
only two among the universitys 13 private eating clubs that 
exclude women princeton began admitting women in 1969 
earlier this year the two clubs voted to admit women but two 
more rounds of voting must be conducted next year before women can 
join most juniors and seniors eat at the clubs housed near the 
princeton campus 
it is undisputed that the clubs had a general policy that 
excluded females from consideration as members the high court 
said it is also undisputed that the clubs applied this policy to 
frank when she tried to join the clubs 
in arguing the case before the supreme court attorneys for the 
two clubs had maintained that the clubs were private and not part 
of princeton university they said that gave the clubs the right to 
choose their membership 
but ms frank argued that the university has promoted the clubs 
in its publications and added that princeton has relied on them 
since more than 75 percent of the upperclassmen at the school eat 
at the clubs 
the supreme court ruling upheld a 1987 decision by the new 
jersey division on civil rights which ordered the clubs to begin 
admitting women that decision had been overturned by the appellate 
division of superior court which granted the clubs request for a 
new hearing because of prodecural errors 
but the supreme court said the clubs had already been afforded 
their administrative due process and it did not see any disputed 
facts 
frank had sued a third eating club but that club began admitting 
women in 1986 and settled with ms frank for 20000 the 
university was also named in the suit but also settled in 1986 
paying ms frank 27500 in legal fees and pledging to dissociate 
itself from sexually segregated clubs 
ms frank said she pursued the case because its outcome has 
implications beyond princeton 
for better or for worse people who graduate from princeton 
tend to take positions in leadership ms frank said if they 
learn while they are students at princeton that discrimination is 
acceptable then they are going to take that lesson with them i 
dont want them to learn that lesson

president bush said today that he 
would discuss a proposal to use nato nuclear forces only as a last 
resort when the allies meet in london later this week 
bush refused to confirm that the united states was offering such 
a proposal but when asked about reports that a change in nuclear 
strategy was on the agenda he said im ready to discuss that 
with them 
as things change we want to be sure that evrybody understands 
that nato is the stabilizing factor that we think it should be and 
will be he told reporters after meeting with top advisers at his 
seaside vacation home 
continuing the presummit talks with allied leaders in advance 
of the nato bush said that he had talked this morning to the prime 
ministers of denmark and belgium 
he said he didnt talk to them about the matter of natos 
socalled flexible response strategy of using nuclear weapons in a 
mix with conventional arms 
i didnt go into that specific he said but i think the 
general approach that were proposing seems to be getting wide 
acceptance 
he said he wants to underscore that a unified germany belonging 
to nato is not a threat to the soviet union 
if there are certain things that we can do to expand natos 
role that drives that point home so much the better he said 
in a briefing with top aides and cabinet members today bush 
shifted gears from the nato meeting to next weeks economic summit 
of seven industrialized nations 
bush said were in good shape for that meeting and that 
trade issues would be particularly prominent 
he said he also expected a good discussion of the 
environment and that he would continue to reject us 
participation in economic aid programs for the soviet union until 
it reforms its own market practices and halts aid to marxist cuba 
bush spent much of monday preparing for the twoday nato summit 
meeting in london which begins thursday 
bush said after a briefing session with secretary of state james 
a baker iii defense secretary dick cheney vice president dan 
quayle and others that were in pretty good shape on it now 
according to administration officials bush intends to urge the 
allies to overhaul the nato defense strategy by using nuclear 
weapons only as a last resort in a war situation 
bush also is ready to consider scrapping the 1470 us 
nucleartipped artillery shells now based mostly in west germany 
and reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 1560 us nuclear bombs 
deployed in seven nato countries the officials told the associated 
press 
he said monday before setting out to play golf with quayle that 
there will be some very interesting developments at the nato 
meeting this week but nothing he considers of bombshell 
dimension 
national security adviser brent scowcroft told reporters that 
arms control issues will be on the agenda in london 
the administration intends to propose that the allies eliminate 
nuclear stockpiles including artillery shells now deployed in west 
germany from europe if the soviets completely withdraw their 
troops from foreign soil according to administration officials who 
insisted on anonymity 
todays session included treasury secretary nicholas brady 
trade representative carla hills quayle and other officials who 
are preparing for the economic summit july 911 
the participants intended to review with bush the draft 
communique they want to issue at the end of the economic summit it 
has been prepared in consultations with the other participating 
nations 
among the topics they will prepare is how to address the matter 
of western economic aid to help the soviet unions flagging 
economy bush has said he is not particularly interested in that 
idea but has no objections if the other nations want to help 
leaders of the 12member european community already have agreed 
in principle to provide some form of financial help to soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev on the basis that his efforts to reform 
his economy help the western world as well 
bush told reporters last week he has a hard time seeing large 
aid packages going to the soviet union when theyre spending 18 
percent of their gross national product on military and when 
theyre spending an estimated 5 billion annually in cuba 
bush and his aides today also were to discuss prospects for 
environmental agreements at the economic summit 
several european nations have committed themselves to reducing 
or stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the decade to 
cut down on the global warming trend 
the bush administration has maintained that more research is 
needed on the warming of the earth before taking such measures 
also up for possible discussion on the environmental front is 
how to deal with worldwide deforestation and the destruction of 
tropical rain forests due to development 
bush is spending a sixday long holiday weekend at his maine 
vacation home before departing wednesday night for london 
he was to watch early fireworks tonight from a coast guard 
cutter offshore from his walkers point home

a mass grave discovered last week in 
northern yugoslavia may contain the remains of 40000 people 
executed by victorious communists in 1945 a newspaper reported 
tuesday 
most appear to have been ustasha soldiers of the defeated nazi 
puppet state of croatia vjesnik said 
the victims apparently were executed after surrendering to 
communist partisans or being deported to yugoslavia by the western 
allies from austria where many had sought refuge at the end of 
world war ii 
the ustashas were an elite sstype military unit accused of 
murdering hundreds of thousands of jews serbs and gypsies after 
the socalled independent state of croatia was created under german 
auspices in 1941 
piles of bones estimated to be up to 10 yards deep in places 
were found in a 40yardlong pit near the village of sosice about 
45 miles west of the croatian capital of zagreb 
the vjesnik story was illustrated with large photographs of a 
cave at the bottom of the pit filled with skulls and human bones 
townspeople and former partisans quoted by the daily said that 
truckloads of wounded croatian soldiers members of the ustasha 
youth movement army nurses and other people were brought to the 
site they then were shot and thrown one by one into the narrow pit 
earlier reports had estimated the dead in the thousands but the 
vjesnik account was the first to put a possible figure on remains 
in the grave while not clarifying how it arrived at 40000 
victims vjesnik quoted townspeople as saying that for months 
trucks loaded with captives drove toward the pit and returned empty 
a centerright party the croatian democratic union assumed 
power in croatia last month after trouncing the ruling communists 
in the first multiparty elections in 45 years 
authorities are investigating reports of mass executions at 
several sites in 1945 of ustashas and chetniks royalist guerrillas 
who fought both the germans and the communists in a threesided war

alaska officials angrily rejected an 
environmental groups call for more federal restrictions to protect 
the states wilderness 
the wilderness society issued a report monday that called the 
decadeold alaska national interest lands conservation act a 
great disappointment it accused the bush administration of 
putting development interests ahead of the acts mandate to protect 
wildlife 
the report proposed congressional hearings a ban on oil and gas 
exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge and passage of 
federal oilspill legislation 
from what ive seen of it this report appears to be a cursory 
look by people who dont live in alaska at a law which alaskans 
have to live with every day gov steve cowper said 
we appreciate the wilderness society joining the call for 
federal oilspill legislation but we dont agree that the federal 
government needs to be even more involved in the lives of 
alaskans 
when the act was signed into law by president carter in 1980 it 
was praised by environmentalists as one of the most ambitious 
preservation laws ever it set aside 1043 million acres of 
national parks wildlife refuges and other protected areas in the 
nations largest state 
the report also urged a permanent federal takeover of fish and 
game management on alaskas public lands 
it was released one day after washington took over game 
management on all federally owned land in alaska twothirds of 
the state the takeover resulted from a conflict between state law 
and the federal act which required the state to give rural 
alaskans priority for subsistence use of fish and game 
im not surprised by any of the allegations by this 
organization said rep don young ralaska 
they want more wilderness more federal enforcement of 
regulations as they interpret the laws more restrictions on every 
type of land use he said the only thing these environmental 
elitists want less of is access by alaskans to federal lands 
the report says oil development in the refuge and logging in the 
tongass national forest are the most serious threats to alaskas 
public lands the group wants congress to designate the refuge a 
wilderness to prevent development 
the refuge in the states remote northeastern corner includes 
a coastal plain oil companies see as a potential source of oil to 
replace the diminishing flow from alaskas huge prudhoe bay field 
congress was considering authorizing further exploration and 
development there before the exxon valdez oil spill last year

rasheeda moore who participated in an fbi 
sting against mayor marion barry testified today that she lost a 
city contract in 1988 because she refused his request for a sexual 
favor 
testifying for the fifth day at the mayors drug and perjury 
trial moore said that when she rejected barrys overture he said 
you refuse therefore you refuse the contract 
moore testified that in 1986 when she was romantically involved 
with barry her city contract for a summer youth program was 
approved speedily after the mayor told me it would be 
the city spent more than 180000 on project me a modeling 
program designed by moore to build selfesteem 
but in 1988 just after her affair with barry had ended she 
went to a room at the vista hotel where she met with barry and 
another woman maria mccarthy moore testified 
mr barry suggested i put maria mccarthy in charge of the 
administrative end of project me moore said in response to 
questions by assistant us attorney judith retchin 
we were using drugs testified moore after mccarthy left 
barry asked moore to join him 
was there a sexual request said retchin 
yes moore said on redirect examination by the prosecution 
did you comply asked retchin 
no said moore 
barry at that point said you refuse therefore you refuse the 
contract moore testified 
she said that barry told her that because i refused his 
request for a sexual favor he would be unable to promise her 
the contract this year 
the program was not renewed 
moores testimony about the contract followed her 
crossexamination by barrys lawyer r kenneth mundy that began 
last thursday 
mundy said moore who participated in an fbi sting against the 
mayor has received more than 32000 in government aid he 
suggested she may be lying for the fbi 
moore testified she and barry had used drugs together more than 
100 times but can you give me a month a day and a year for 
these episodes asked mundy 
tell us a date that youre positive of he challenged mundy 
suggested moore was being vague about dates of the alleged drug use 
because she is afraid the defense will find that she is giving 
perjured testimony 
barry travels a lot and moore is concerned that he was not 
even in town on days when she said the two used drugs together in 
washington said mundy 
no i am not said moore 
the mayor has a very busy schedule being out of town and 
being on trips and is that a reason you cannot be more precise 
asked mundy 
no insisted moore she said as she has since last thursday 
when her crossexamination began that she is just not good with 
dates 
mundy maintained that moore who is in the governments witness 
protection program has received 32000 from the government since 
january 
i havent said moore 
but she said the fbi paid for her and her three children to come 
to washington put her up in hotels and paid for her clothes she 
said she has no idea how much the government has spent on her 
on monday barrys lawyer said moore provided the pipe the 
light and the knowhow for barry to use crack he made the 
assertion as he replayed at the trial a videotape of the fbi sting 
barrys lawyer is using the governments videotaped evidence in 
an attempt to show that the mayor was entrapped by the fbi into 
smoking crack cocaine 
the tape was first played publicly last week by the prosecution 
it pertains to one of the 10 misdemeanor charges accusing barry of 
cocaine possession he also is accused of conspiracy and three 
counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his involvement with 
drugs 
barry seven times declined moores offer to use drugs during the 
sting mundy said as he went over the transcript of the jan 18 
hotel room meeting between the mayor and moore 
you provided the encouragement by bringing the subject up ad 
nauseam mundy told moore a former barry girlfriend 
moore didnt deny mundys suggestion that she kept bringing up 
the subject of drugs but she said barry readily engaged in 
discussing drugs and initiated talk about them himself on more than 
one occasion in the hotel room any hesitance on barrys part 
stemmed from his suspicions that something was amiss she said 
on the videotape barry said he didnt know how the crack pipe 
worked and that he had never smoked crack before mundy pointed out 
barry was suspicious of a hotel room situation and he felt 
intuitively something was going on when he walked into the hotel 
room said moore he was guarding his conversation 
then why did he go on and hit the pipe mundy asked 
because he had a desire to moore replied 
barry who was treated at two clinics following his arrest in 
the sting said outside the courtroom that he has been free of any 
substance abuse for 163 days he declined to say whether he was 
treated for cocaine abuse he has admitted to having problems with 
alcohol and prescription drugs

the shootings reported in the albanian 
capital come at a time when that hardline communist nation has 
sought to implement cautious reforms and pledged to respect human 
rights 
reforms were initiated in may following a year of popular 
upheaval that ousted orthodox communist governments from most 
eastern european nations 
now scores of albanians apparently unimpressed with the scope 
of the reforms have fled to western embassies in the last few days 
in the largest known show of defiance against 45 years of stalinist 
rule the albanian government on tuesday acknowledged that rioting 
had broken out 
barely two weeks ago the albanian parliament a rubberstamp 
body for communist policy approved new travel regulations under 
which all citizens over 16 were gven the right to own a passport 
valid for five years 
such a concession would have been impossible under the late 
communist leader enver hoxha whose 40year rule ended with his 
death in 1985 
the tirana government firmly committed to marxismleninism as 
interpreted by soviet dictator josef stalin broke diplomatic ties 
with the soviet union and china after those countries moved away 
from what it considered orthodox communism 
britain and the united states severed ties with tirana after 
hoxhas communist party won elections in 1945 following a purge of 
anticommunists 
ramiz alia who took over after hoxhas death slowly began to 
open up the tiny balkan nation of 3 million establishing 
diplomatic ties with dozens of countries while ruling out renewed 
ties with the superpowers 
in may after the changes in the soviet bloc albanias 
communist leaders began announcing cautious political economic and 
foreign policy reforms and signaled willingness to reestablish 
ties with washington and moscow 
last month the isolated nation indicated its wish to rejoin 
europe saying it would seek full membership in the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe that it had 
boycotted since its inception in 1975 
in another sign of moderate change a family of albanians who 
had spent more than four years in the italian embassy in tirana 
were allowed in may to travel to rome 
the economic changes in albania have largely been designed to 
improve food and energy supplies and beef up trade 
but other reforms such as the liberalized travel regulations 
the abolition of the death penalty for defectors and the lifting of 
a ban on religious propaganda appeared aimed both at appeasing the 
population and impressing foreign governments 
albanian officials have pledged to honor the tenets of the 
european security conference including its human rights provisions 
but despite the pledge of some reforms albanian leaders have so 
far remained opposed to any form of political pluralism 
the latest tensions follow yugoslav and greek newspaper reports 
in january of unrest in the northern city of shkoder and in the 
capital of tirana these could not be independently confirmed and 
were vehemently denied by highranking albanian officials

orders to factories for manufactured goods in 
may regained their 21 percent loss of a month earlier the 
government reported tuesday and analysts said industry may be 
starting to recover from its slump 
the manufacturing sector seems to have gone through the worst 
and has a slight upward tilt said robert g dederick chief 
economist with the northern trust co of chicago but the real 
question is whether its a false dawn and whether it will fade 
again 
the commerce department said orders for both durable and 
nondurable goods rebounded 21 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
2409 billion 
the size of the may increase had been expected by many analysts 
at the same time the size of the april decline was a slight 
improvement from the 23 percent drop first reported 
it was the third gain in orders since they dropped 55 percent 
in january and their steepest decline since a 70 percent decrease 
in december 1974 all major categories advanced in may except 
nondurable orders which were unchanged at 1124 billion after 
inching up 02 percent in april 
but analysts expressed concern over the strength of any 
manufacturing turnaround saying much of it is coming from us 
exports while demand from american consumers has weakened recently 
exports represented just 142 percent of the 1989 gross national 
product the nations total output of goods and services while 
personal consumption contributed 642 percent 
another weakness that has really been making the industrial 
sector go sideways is capital spending said priscilla trumbull 
an economist with the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa but we seem 
to be seeing a little bit of improvement there 
nondefense capital spending excluding aircraft edged up 01 
percent in may after backtoback 11 percent declines in the 
preceding two months this category often is often viewed as a 
barometer of business investment plans 
if this is part of a turnaround its still pretty much in the 
embryonic stage said gordon richards director of economic 
policy at the national association of manufacturers 
nevertheless richards and other analysts said the factory 
orders report was the latest of several suggesting the 
manufacturing slump may be about to reverse itself 
orders for durable goods bigticket items expected to last at 
least three years jumped 40 percent to 1286 billion nearly 
recovering the 41 percent decline in april 
the often volatile defense orders also rose up 192 percent to 
100 billion after gains of 48 percent and 45 percent excluding 
the defense category orders were up 15 percent

links 
he was just being pleasant ill bet bush said of his vice 
president on tuesday 
quayle somewhat sheepishly told reporters he won on the first 
tee 
won one hole thats what he meant bush clarified 
quayle had told reporters on monday when setting out to golf 
near bushs seaside vacation home that he was destined to lose 
quayle is renowned in washington for his expertise on the golf 
course bush on the other hand is trying to improve his somewhat 
ragged game 
when asked later monday who won the game at the cape arundel 
golf course quayle said the president won suspicion was 
widespread that he was speaking tongue in cheek 
asked about that by reporters tuesday during a photo session 
outside bushs seaside home quayle insisted the president won 
as he should 
but bush interjected that quayle had played well with six 
birdies thats pretty good golf 
told that quayle had said he won bush said he was just being

about 800 liberian rebels have 
attacked their capital and several thousand more were approaching 
to put an end to liberian president samuel doe a rebel source 
said today 
the source based near the liberian border said rebel leader 
charles taylor was at the front directing attacks on monrovia the 
liberian capital 
in washington officials said the united states was prepared to 
evacuate doe if requested to do so 
the rebel source said the fighters were preparing to attack the 
city center but so far had only taken areas on monrovias outskirts 
the christian missionary radio station elwa in its 5 pm news 
broadcast said armed soldiers were stationed throughout monrovia 
but it made no mention of fresh fighting the broadcast was 
monitored in abidjan 
most city streets and public places were empty the radio said 
because people were afraid of fighting breaking out the report 
said rebels controlled all roads in and out of monrovia 
some of the advancing rebels were bringing up heavy artillery 
and mortars in case doe put up a last stand in his heavily 
fortified executive mansion the rebel source said 
the source was reached by telephone from abidjan and spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
rebels attacked monrovia on monday in a twopronged offensive 
that cut all major land routes from the capital according to a 
pool report filed by journalists there 
international telephone and telex lines into the city were cut 
on monday morning the citys water and electricity supply also 
were cut after rebels captured their main facilities 
the united states and other governments urged doe to resign and 
leave the country a condition the rebels have set for accepting a 
ceasefire 
four us warships remained over the horizon off liberia 
ready to evacuate americans or doe if requested to do so by the 
state department officials in washington said 
defense department spokesman pete williams said the navy ships 
sent to the area may 31 were still in international waters 
the pentagon spokesman said the primary purpose of the navy 
ships which have about 2500 sailors and marines on board is to 
evacuate americans if needed 
the state department advised us citizens on may 31 to leave 
liberia because of deteriorating conditions and some departed on 
chartered airline flights last month 
in response to a question about possible evacuation of doe 
williams said if the state department were to ask us to assist 
in moving president doe we would certainly be prepared to do what 
they asked us 
several countries have offered doe asylum including nigeria and 
togo doe 40 a former master sergeant has ruled liberia since a 
bloody coup in april 1980 he ousted the descendents of freed 
american slaves who had ruled the west african country for more 
than a century 
doe initially won wide support but subsequently was accused of 
brutal oppression of critics suppressing the countrys free press 
and mismanagement and corruption 
the rebels of the national patriotic front invaded liberia 
from the ivory coast dec 24 sweeping across the country with 
little resistance from does forces 
government troops were accused of killing hundreds of kinsmen of 
the rebels in an effort to put down the invasion the deaths 
increased support for the rebels said reporters who visited the 
war zone 
the rebels in turn were accused of killing members of tribes 
seen as supporting the president in revenge for the attacks on 
their kinsmen 
government resistance stiffened when the rebels got within 35 
miles of monrovia four weeks ago 
but the rebels broke through to attack the capital in the last 
week after refusing to attend a second round of churchmediated 
peace talks aimed at ending the war

here are excerpts from the speech of politburo 
member yegor k ligachev at the 28th communist party congress on 
tuesday as translated by the associated press 
if everything remains at the current level the situation with 
food supplies in the country will become even more critical i am 
aware of the difficulty of finding a solution to the problem 
we need to stick to public property as i think that it unites 
peoples interests while private property separates them and 
without doubt leads to social differentiation in society 
what was the original goal of perestroika reform it was to 
use the full potential of socialism i want to ask you does the 
selling of factories to private owners really help to uncover all 
possibilities of the socialist order of course not 
we are not justified in forgetting about the class approach 
which leads to our underestimating the class representation in the 
soviets elected legislatures underestimating the workers and 
peasants movement 
there are forces in our country fighting against socialist 
order against the communist party they are acting with energy and 
drive they have strong influence on some of the mass media they 
applaud things that are directed toward the breakup of socialism 
in our country at undermining the party present them as 
innovations as real perestroika and often they shout about things 
directed toward renovation and consolidation of socialism saying 
they are actions by conservative forces 
my open perhaps uncompromising position on true socialism and 
the role of the party my principles i am not afraid of looking 
immodest have become the reason why i was placed in the center of 
the political struggle and portrayed as a conservative and almost 
an opponent of perestroika reform all means were used as you 
know including libel and horrible charges 
it seems there are commands from some center to start abusing 
people on the principle that those who are not with us are against 
us they have started attacks on the army which has finally 
started to defend itself 
comrades i see no alternative to perestroika renewal of the 
society i do not think of myself as a conservative or a radical i 
am just a realist and any limitless radicalism improvisations 
have done little for us in the five years of perestroika 
the country really needs political stability but there is 
talk lately that communist party or no party perestroika will 
continue i think differently i believe deeply that the party 
will remain a marxistleninist democratic viable force

the nato alliance is no longer needed to keep 
the peace in europe and should be replaced by a security 
community of all european nations plus the united states the 
soviet union and canada a private group said tuesday 
the proposal by the british american security information 
council would do away with the 16nation north atlantic treaty 
organization and its cold war rival the warsaw pact which has 
been fractured by the democracy movements in eastern europe 
replacing these military blocs would be a paneuropean body 
based on the conference on security and cooperation in europe or 
csce an existing organization comprised of the two superpowers 
canada and all european nations except albania its main role now 
is to consider human rights and economic issues 
the report said the csce should be broadened and given an 
explicit link to the united nations france and some other european 
governments already have suggested this but the bush 
administration says csce should not be a replacement for nato 
questions about reshaping natos military and political roles 
are to be discussed at an alliance summit meeting thursday and 
friday in london the leaders are not expected to take any steps 
toward dissolving the alliance they are likely to say nato will 
change but will remain the central security body for europe 
at a meeting last month leaders of the sevennation warsaw pact 
agreed to keep that alliance intact at least until the conclusion 
this fall of a study on ways of transforming its role 
the proposal unveiled tuesday has been endorsed by numerous 
european and american politicians military experts and former 
government officials said david shorr associated director of the 
group that published the report 
paul warnke a former director of the us arms control and 
disarmament agency told a news conference the proposal was a 
sensible blueprint for the future 
warnke said he believed nato should be preserved only until a 
paneuropean replacement organization is in place he argued that 
the alliance will not be needed because the threat of a soviet 
attack on europe no longer exists 
among those endorsing the proposal according to shorr is 
pierre harmel the former belgian foreign minister who initiated a 
landmark nato study in 1967 that established the foundation for 
western relations with the soviet bloc through the 1980s 
the new report said a paneuropean security organization would 
have a permanent headquarters perhaps in berlin or prague 
czechoslovakia and an inner security council consisting of the 
united states the soviet union britain france and a reunified 
germany 
the organization would mediate disputes among european 
countries serve as a negotiating forum for european disarmament 
and verify and monitor agreed arms reductions members would sign a 
treaty disavowing any threat or use of force against each other

already sluggish global economic growth is 
likely to slow further in 1990 and growth in eastern europe and 
the soviet union is virtually at a standstill according to a un 
report released tuesday 
the 1990 world economic survey by the un department of 
international economic and social affairs said world economic 
output increased by 31 percent in 1989 compared with 44 percent 
in 1988 
it noted diversity in economic performance and said that 
industrialized market economies continued to expand growing by 35 
percent although that was lower than the 43 percent in 1988 it 
was stronger than had been expected the report said 
but the developing world as a whole it said suffered a 
downturn in economic growth in 1989 dropping from 45 percent in 
1988 to 34 percent in 1989 economic performance varied greatly by 
region 
the report agreed in general with the findings of the 
parisbased organization for economic cooperation and development 
which said last week that the economies of the industrialized world 
remain on a steady course 
like the oecd report it warned against inflation especially in 
east european countries that are changing from statecontrolled to 
market economies 
economic growth in eastern europe and the soviet union came to 
a virtual halt in 1989 it said adding that output increased by 
only 12 percent un economists said they did not expect a bright 
picture for the immediate future in countries restructuring their 
economies although the longterm prospects could improve with 
painful reform 
the danger of rapid inflation in the reforming socialist 
countries is a major concern it said requiring prudent 
monetary and fiscal policies during the transition to more 
marketoriented economies 
world trade it said maintained considerable buoyance and 
increased by 67 percent in 1989 it was the fifth consecutive year 
in which the increase in world trade exceeded the increase in world 
output the report said 
it observed that the brady plan named for former treasury 
secretary nicolas brady is not solving the debt problem of the 
heavily indebted countries 
in 1989 it said latin america made a net transfer of 28 
billion in financial resources to other countries africas net 
receipts of financial resources amounted to only 3 billion in 
1989 a decline of 1 billion from the previous year 
in several latin american countries hyperinflation is a serious 
problem it said and stabilization policies are likely to prove 
costly in the short term longterm prospects are uncertain 
the un survey also predicted that world oil consumption will 
reach a record high in 1990 and the gap between sustainable 
production capacity and demand will narrow 
the survey said developing countries as a group experienced a 
sharp slowdown in economic growth in 1989 their increase in output 
declined from 45 percent in 1988 to 34 percent in 1989 
the economies of south and east asia grew by 62 percent 
compared with 82 percent in 1988 the survey said chinas growth 
rate delined sharply from 114 percent in 1988 to 39 percent in 
1989 
latin america and the caribbean saw only a 07 percent increase 
and per capita output fell for the second consecutive year 
inflation was unprecedented in the region 
in africa economies expanded by 28 percent in 1989 below the 
rate of population growth and per capita output fell as a result 
in west asia economic recovery continued with a 25 percent 
growth rate economic stabilization measures stalled growth in 
mediterranean countries 
the survey proposed establishment of a central european payments 
union similar to the european payments union established after 
world war ii as a temporary measure to assist reforming eastern 
european countries in their transition to marketoriented economies 
with convertible currencies 
inflation is an inevitable consequence of the marketoriented 
economic reform under way in the socialist countries the survey 
said

as heavy fighting raged northeast of the 
liberian capital of monrovia on tuesday us officials said they 
believed that the government of president samuel k doe could 
collapse in a matter of days 
the officials asking not to be identified said that there had 
been a number of desertions from the elite unit that protects doe 
and that his hold on power was becoming more precarious by the day 
two officials said does demise could come before the weekend 
he has ruled liberia for more than a decade 
state department spokesman richard boucher said there was 
fighting on both sides of the st paul river in addition to the 
combat northeast of monrovia the fighting was inhibiting 
communications out of liberia 
meanwhile a rebel source reached by telephone from neighboring 
ivory coast said about 800 rebels of liberias national patriotic 
front have begun an attack on monrovia and several thousand more 
were approaching to put an end to doe and his government 
the source based near the liberian border said rebel leader 
charles taylor was at the front directing attacks on the liberian 
capital taylor launched his rebellion last christmas eve 
reportedly with help from libyan leader moammar gadhafi it is not 
known whether gadhafi has provided any assistance recently 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said a navy task force 
was standing over the horizon off liberia ready to evacuate the 
estimated 795 americans in liberia if requested to do so by the 
state department 
were considering all options but a decision to evacuate has 
not yet been made said boucher at the state department there 
were no reports of injury to any americans 
officials have said that the us government is prepared to 
evacuate doe if it is asked to do so they said togo also in west 
africa has agreed to receive doe if he is forced out of liberia 
boucher said monrovia was without water electricity or 
telephone service all main roads out of the capital were cut most 
of does cabinet and other senior administration officials have 
fled liberian and diplomatic sources said army chief of staff lt 
gen henry dubar resigned during the weekend a dusk to dawn curfew 
was in effect 
boucher said a voice of america transmitter is located behind 
rebel lines but the rebel forces have not interfered with its 
operations 
the new us ambassador to liberia peter de vos met with doe 
on sunday on monday he met with the vice president harry moniba 
and three other senior legislators boucher said 
us policy has been to support the formation through political 
negotiations of an interim government that would oversee a 
transition to democratic rule 
doe has offered a national unity government with participation 
by taylors group but the rebel leader has rejected the proposal 
taylor has repeatedly demanded that doe resign before he and the 
rebels will stop their advance 
there also have been official us contacts with taylor a 
former liberian government official who infiltrated the country six 
months ago with a small band of followers 
taylor has informed the us envoys that if his movement ousts 
doe he will promote democracy and respect human rights but 
officials have said they are not certain that taylor will abide by 
those pledges 
taylor also has offered assurances that his forces will not harm 
americans or other foreigners in liberia boucher said

the road from minsk to moscow proved longer than 
expected for nikolai shchesternev who came to his first communist 
party congress seeking direction he was disappointed 
i expected an analysis of the situation but it hasnt 
happened yet its all gray i am not happy at all so far 
shchesternev told a reporter during a break tuesday in the 28th 
congress of the soviet communist party 
the 38yearold computer specialist from the capital of 
byelorussia said in a wideranging interview that he came to the 
kremlin palace of congresses hoping to find ideas on improving the 
lives of the employees in his enterprise ideas that he said had 
been lacking in five years of perestroika 
and he hoped for a chance to tell the kremlin leadership some of 
the ideas bubbling up from the 4400 members of the communist party 
cell that selected him from among 21 candidates 
shchesternev said party leader mikhail s gorbachevs reform 
policies of glasnost and perestroika have not helped him as party 
secretary in the consortium for computer production in the 
byelorussian capital of minsk 
in five years we have not found the idea that allows us to pay 
people better or improve their living conditions and the speeches 
so far dont indicate that we have found it yet shchesternev 
complained 
i am very pessimistic i thought the report gorbachevs 
report to the congress would concentrate on philosophical and 
economic principles on how to lead the society but there was none 
of that he said 
with his redandgold congress badge pinned to the lapel of his 
light grey suit shchesternev ressembles many of the other 4656 
delegates to the congress although he is younger than most 
delegates the average age is 46 
he spends most of his time during breaks at the congress and in 
the evening at a nearby hotel with the other three delegates from 
his cell and the rest of the 171member byelorussian delegation 
shchesternev said many members of his delegation believe party 
policy should be formed on the basis of the experience of its 
members and not dictated from the top 
if the leadership doesnt draw on the resources of those on 
the bottom then the finale of this party is going to be a 
sorrowful affair he said 
he said he had closely followed events in neighboring poland 
where the communist party simply fell apart last year after failing 
to meet societys political and economic aspirations 
shchesternev doesnt believe he will ever have a chance to speak 
at this congress even though it will last at least eight more days 
more than 400 delegates had deposited a white slip of paper in 
wooden urns scattered throughout the massive palace of congresses 
where the meeting is held saying they would like to speak 
unfortunately i have no possibility to express myself so we 
are going to choose somebody from our delegation to represent us to 
get the possibility to make ourselves heard he said 
although the party has paid for shchesternevs train tickets and 
his hotel room in moscow the congress appears to be a pretty sober 
affair even after the formal sessions are over 
we spend the evening meeting in our delegations and work on 
the results and look toward the future there isnt much time for 
anything else shchesternev said

american indian leaders say theyre pleased by nelson mandelas 
promise to return to the united states this fall and visit them 
but some also say he shouldnt assume their situation is the same 
as that of south african blacks 
before mr mandela can help the indians hes got to 
understand the indian tribes and their relation to the united 
states mescalero apache president wendell chino said after 
hearing about mandelas offer 
its not as simple as it looks chino said the situation 
of the indian people is totally different 
mandela made his announcement saturday on the last day of his 
11day us trip he told 58000 people at a rally in oakland 
calif that he would return in october to visit indian 
reservations and exchange views as to what i can do to help them 
in their struggle 
the indian people have written to me and explained their 
problems and it is but natural that i should respond to that by 
seeing them as i proposed to do mandela said 
the offer apparently had its origins in an invitation from two 
women who met him at the oakland airport and delivered an 
invitation and gifts a sacred blanket a shawl for mandelas 
wife winnie and some traditional medicine 
we told him that we share many of the same problems of his 
country and would like to have the opportunity to share them with 
him said betty cooper director of the nonprofit native 
american alcoholism program in oakland 
sally gallegos the executive director of the oaklandbased 
consortium of united indian nations said the two werent prepared 
for mandela to take them up on the offer 
it was a shock gallegos said the tribes had a concern to 
make known to mandela that we are here 
gallegos and cooper were attending a conference in san francisco 
sponsored by families in recovery an organization that mainly 
serves indian drug addicts and alcoholics and their families 
they and others at the meeting said indians were dismayed that 
they were not invited to officially receive the south african 
leader despite the parallels between their plight and that of 
blacks under the south african system of apartheid 
nelson mandela is as much a symbol as a reality and that 
symbol for us is one of disenfranchisement oppression and his 
ultimate victory said john perez an apache representing the 
life plus foundation 
americanindian leaders generally agreed that a visit by mandela 
could help them highlight problems in their communities poverty 
and poor education among them 
the problems are so serious that i think any kind of public 
attention will be helpful said gary kimble director of the 
association on american indian affairs an indian rights 
organization based in new york 
chino the mescalaro apache leader agreed that a mandela visit 
would be good for indians 
i think whats going to happen is the united states is going 
to be grossly embarrassed if mandela comes back and exposes the 
paternalism broken promises and the erosion of various treaty 
obligations chino said monday 
but some indian leaders also agreed with chinos point that 
there are vast differences between indians and south african blacks 
the difference i think is that nobody is intentionally 
preventing indians from becoming part of the legislature said 
rep ben nighthorse campbell dcolo the only american indian in 
congress in south africa they virtually lock black people out 
of running from office 
and others have taken a skeptical approach to the entire matter 
mr mandelas going to have enough problems of his own in 
south africa to just come back here and help us said wayne 
ducheneaux of eagle butte sd president of the national congress 
of american indians well wait to see what this means

federal safety investigators said today that 
the captain of usair flight 5050 probably caused the crash of his 
jetliner by failing to respond adequately to problems during 
takeoff 
the national transportation safety board in a 40 vote also 
said the planes problems began with an erroneously set rudder 
control that the pilot failed to detect it said it could not 
determine how the control was wrongly set 
the board said the probable cause of the crash was the 
captains failure to exercise his command authority in a timely 
manner to reject the takeoff or take sufficient control to continue 
the takeoff it also cited his failure to detect the rudder 
problem 
two of the 57 passengers aboard the plane were killed when it 
skidded off the end of the laguardia airport runway sept 20 all 
six crew members survived 
board member jim burnett moved to also blame usair for failing 
to staff the plane with an adequately prepared and seasoned 
flight crew but other board members rejected that proposal 
saying the crew members met all regulatory requirements 
we are putting a tremendous burden on one individual in a very 
complex system said board member john lauber but he said this 
was justified because there were so many lapses in the pilots 
performance including his decision to let an inexperienced 
copilot control the takeoff 
bob benzon staff investigator in charge of the crash said 
earlier the planes rudder trim was set for full left rudder but 
he said enough rudder authority remained to fully control the 
aircraft during takeoff and in the air 
the federal aviation administration suspended the flight 
certificates of usair pilot michael martin and copilot constantine 
kleissas who was controlling the takeoff of a boeing 737 passenger 
flight for the first time 
the air line pilots association protested the actions as 
totally unwarranted 
alpa official tom kraemer said later the decision was a total 
travesty and the board should have blamed the design of the 
rudder control of the boeing 737 
but both martin and kleissas dropped appeals of the suspension 
and can fly again if they pass recertification tests 
the faa said martin does not possess the care skill judgment 
and responsibility of a commercial pilot and cited his failure to 
fully complete a pretakeoff checklist and perform other required 
actions on the taxiway before he ordered the takeoff aborted 
crash investigators said the rudder was erroneously set all the 
way to the left causing the plane to drift to the side during the 
takeoff attempt although cockpit communication tapes showed the 
pilots made all the proper checks 
in february the faa ordered a boeingdesigned change in the 
control panels of 737s to prevent accidental movement of a rudder 
trim control knob that could reduce the pilots ability to control 
the plane 
the changes cost about 830 per plane and affected 641 boeing 
737300 and 737400 models worldwide although faa safety orders 
are not mandatory for foreign carriers they usually comply 
boeing began work to redesign the cockpit controls before the 
crash following reports that the ruddertrim knobs could be 
affected by visitors in the cockpit placing their feet on the 
console or a pilot throwing down a manual 
the ntsb conducted a hearing in new york on the usair crash 
taking testimony on rudder control design cockpit crew training 
crew coordination the effects of the usairpiedmont merger runway 
design and faa scrutiny of usair operations

davy crockett probably wasnt born on a 
mountaintop in tennessee and nobody really thinks he shot a bear 
when he was only 3 
but that doesnt take anything away from the legend at least 
for the 180 crockett descendants gathering in texas this week 
those kinds of things are interesting to read about but they 
dont necessarily reflect the real david crockett said leonard 
stasney one of the crockett descendants holding their fifth 
biennial reunion at this town 30 miles southwest of fort worth 
davys widow settled in granbury after his death at the battle of 
the alamo in san antonio in 1836 
the myth was bigger than the man said descendant sandra 
weaver of granbury who wore a cloth crockett doll with a real coon 
tail on the cap the whole thing pinned to her shoulder like a huge 
corsage 
ms weaver and crockett kin traded tales about their famous 
ancestor tuesday at the clan picnic swapped gossip and argued over 
the best place to get a genuine coonskin cap 
they debated how often a fighter could fire the muskets of 
davys day and whether crockett was killed in action or as some 
historians say executed by the mexicans after surrendering the 
alamo 
davy crockett went down swinging a rifle he wasnt no 
coward insisted charles edward crockett sr of falls city ore 
it just doesnt matter ms weaver said all the men who 
died at the alamo were heroes 
for the descendants gathered at granburys plantation inn its 
the search for a real davy crockett that matters most 
and according to them thats not the davy crockett a generation 
of americans knew from the disney tv series that made the 
buckskinclad actor fess parker an instant celebrity and prompted 
millions of youngsters to buy coonskin caps 
the show became one of the biggest overnight hits in television 
history ninety million people watched the tv davy swing his rifle 
as santa annas troops attacked the alamo according to disney 
productions the ballad of davy crockett the theme song of the 
series sold 18 million copies in 1955 billboard said 
joy bland the new president of the descendants group 
dismisses all that as hollywood glamour 
they dont stick to the real facts i never could sit through 
the whole program it was awful said ms bland of paris tenn 
the clothing was too modern the story line was unrealistic 
only one descendant donned a coonskin cap for the reunion and 
he was in period costume to demonstrate the rifles and muskets of 
crocketts era 
about 200 people belong to the nonprofit corporation 
descendants of david crockett based in tennessee members must be 
blood relations to crockett associate memberships are extended to 
cousins historians and others who revere the pioneer 
its kind of exciting to talk to all the people that you are 
related to that you dont really know stasney said its just 
exciting to know that we can share the little bits and pieces of 
information and learn a little more about who we are 
some said its simply a relief to tell people theyre crockett 
descendants and be believed 
toni daigle of whitecastle la said she takes pictures and 
documents to her childrens school to convince classmates they 
really are related to the famous frontiersman 
its hard ms daigle said because some other kids come 
up and say oh yeah im kin to abraham lincoln too

a federal judge sentenced a print shop 
owner tuesday to three years in prison for plotting to ship arms to 
ireland 
brian joseph fleming 32 was caught in a sting after he and 
another man tried to purchase restricted weapons including m16s 
from undercover agents 
evidence linked the two to a group called fianna eireann which 
northern irelands top police officer testified is the youth 
brigade of the outlawed irish republican army 
flemings coconspirator charles farrell malone 63 of san 
francisco was sentenced june 25 to a 2year prison term and three 
years probation 
in addition to the threeyear prison term fleming of 
enterprise was fined 6000 and placed on three years probation 
at the sentencing hearing us district judge robert varner 
told fleming that if enough people in the country are shipping 
arms to any revolutionary forces its the sort of thing that could 
involve this country in a war 
assistant us attorney charles niven said authorities never 
traced any weapons from fleming to groups associated with the ira 
he was attempting to do it niven said 
fleming was questioned by federal agents earlier this year in 
connection with an investigation into the mailbomb slaying of a 
federal judge in birmingham and a civil rights lawyer in savannah 
ga 
federal agents later said there was no connection between the 
two cases no one has been charged in the mail bombings

scientists have tagged about 500 geese 
in a program to reduce the chances a hunter will bag a goose 
contaminated with radiation near the oak ridge nuclear installation 
some geese have staked their claim at several ponds on the 
department of energys oak ridge national laboratory compound said 
gordon blaylock an oak ridge environmental scientist 
several ponds were used at one time as collection basins for 
nuclear waste and blaylock says those still are hot with 
radioactivity 
those ponds are getting a closer look from oak ridge staffers 
who tagged more than 300 geese last week in an effort to track 
their movement 
as long as we control the small ponds i dont think youre 
going to get a goose with a serious problem blaylock said 
in some cases fences were put up to keep geese from walking 
into an area while streamers attacked to rows of fishing line 
strung across the ponds are meant to deter geese 
during the past two years scientists have collared about about 
500 or onefourth of the estimated 2000 nonmigratory canada 
geese living near the government nuclear complex blaylock said 
the geese introduced several years ago by the tennessee valley 
authority are mostly nonmigratory but move within a limited area 
he said the birds movement patterns are of interest to 
scientists blaylock said 
the tags can be seen with viewing scopes letting staffers track 
the birds movement without having to capture them again 
other geese are tagged with leg bands which direct that hunters 
return the metal bands to oak ridge and include information on the 
birds location 
blaylock said monday that six geese found living on a hot pond 
near the high flux isotope reactor at oak ridge were presumed to be 
contaminated with radioactive cobalt60 those geese were killed 
for study rather than risking the possibility of contaminated birds 
leaving the area he said

north korea and south korea took a major 
step toward reconciliation tuesday and agreed to a historic meeting 
between their top government leaders 
the talks could be held as early as august officials said 
delegates from the countries met at the border truce village of 
panmunjom and agreed to sign an accord july 26 that would outline a 
proposed agenda and procedures for the first meeting of prime 
ministers 
it would be the first such meeting since the division of the 
peninsula in 1945 into the communist north and capitalist south 
in earlier talks both sides agreed the summit would be held 
alternately in the countries capitals each side would have seven 
representatives including the prime minister and two military 
delegates 
the breakthrough on a summit came after south korea accepted 
north koreas proposal to place political and military topics ahead 
of humanitarian and other exchanges on the agenda seoul had 
insisted on the opposite 
tuesdays meeting was the seventh of a series since february 
1989 the talks had been suspended for five months 
unlike most dialogue between the countries tuesdays was 
largely free of acrimony and tension 
south koreas chief delegate song hanho later said he 
expected no problems in signing a procedural agreement for the 
summit his communist counterpart paik nam jun expressed similar 
views at a separate news conference 
song said he hoped the prime ministers talks would open a new 
chapter for realizing peaceful unification of the peninsula 
we cannot stick to the logic of the cold war and ignore 
changes in the world any longer he said 
paik said tuesdays talks marked a new milestone in the 
history of the northsouth korea dialogue 
tuesdays agreement was widely seen as a major breakthrough in 
that dialogue but observers cautioned that the talks could still 
falter pointing to decades of hostility and distrust on both sides 
during a previous border meeting north korea once asked south 
korea to end the joint ussouth koran military exercises called 
team spirit 
north korea called off talks with south korea in january to 
protest the exercises and demanded the withdrawal of all us 
troops based in south korea 
south korean officials said arms reduction and other measures 
easing tensions could be discussed at the prime ministers meeting 
as a first step toward eventual unification 
buoyed by its economic success seoul has improved relations 
with the soviet union and other north korean allies and also has 
urged pyongyang to open its doors 
talks have been held sporadically between the two koreas but 
little progress had been made until recently the border on both 
sides is heavily fortified and sealed blocking exchanges of mail 
and transportation 
north korea is one of the last totalitarian communist states 
and sweeping changes in east europe and its socialist allies have 
made little impact 
paik the chief north korean delegate told the meeting tuesday 
that unification should be carried out independently with no 
interference from other countries 
he chided the south for soliciting help from outsiders on 
reunification referring to south korean president roh taewoos 
recent meeting with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in san 
francisco

interior minister prince nayef said 
today 1426 moslem pilgrims died in a stampede in a 1500footlong 
pedestrian tunnel that was crowded with 50000 people 
prince nayef said the disaster was caused when seven pilgrims 
fell from an overhead bridge near the tunnel which linked this 
holy city with a tent city 
other sources said a power failure caused the air conditioning 
in the 60footwide tunnel to switch off in 112degree heat monday 
morning setting off the stampede 
it was gods will which is above everything king fahd said 
of the disaster it was fate 
prince nayef who is the saudi monarchs brother did not give 
the nationalities of the victims 
he said that a number of other pilgrims fainted and were treated 
on the spot but he did not provide a figure 
the fall of the seven spread terror and the tremendous 
throngs of the pilgrims caused them all to tumble onto each 
other he said 
he explained that the tunnel itself was packed multiple times 
beyond its capacity with some 50000 people inside 
the disaster occurred during the hajj one of the worlds 
largest religious gatherings which draws about 2 million moslems 
observances had largely ended and pilgrims were observing 
posthajj rituals or preparing to leave 
diplomats told the associated press on monday night that about 
1400 pilgrims were killed asian and middle eastern diplomats who 
spoke on condition of anonymity said most of the victims were 
malaysian and indonesian pilgrims 
doctors at hospitals said today that large numbers of egyptians 
and pakistanis were among the dead 
king fahd acknowledged indirectly that there had been a large 
loss of life 
he called the dead martyrs of the islamic world 
had they not died there they would have died elsewhere and at 
the same predestined moment the king said at a meeting monday 
night with pilgrimage security officials 
the deaths shattered what had been a peaceful observance of the 
annual haff and was the worst pilgrimage tragedy in recent years 
in previous years the celebration has been marred by terrorist 
attacks and riots 
diplomats said the tunnel became packed beyond capacity when 
some pilgrims stopped in the middle while people outside continued 
to push their way in 
a witness said the tunnel became clogged with the crush of 
people 
with the lack of oxygen a good number collapsed unconscious 
and some died there was also a stampede said the witness who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said he helped carry victims to the ambulances waiting by the 
tunnels exits but that he did not know how many of the stricken 
were dead and how many were simply unconscious 
the pedestrian walkway runs under part of a mountain but 
sometimes cars use it as a shortcut filling it with choking fumes 
sources said 
as the scope of the disaster became apparent ambulances and 
security forces rushed to the tunnel which joins mecca and the 
pilgrim tent city of mina 
thousands of the pilgrims thronged through the tunnel of 
moessem causing severe congestion within the tunnel as the 
pressure was beyond its capacity staterun riyadh radio said 
the official saudi press agency quoted king fahd as saying the 
pilgrims had failed to follow safety rules issued in good time 
ahead of the pilgrimage season but he pledged to work for 
better safety 
god willing we will see no tragedies in the coming years 
he said 
the tunnel is part of 15 billion development plan for the holy 
sites including other tunnels and overhead bridges to move 
pilgrims in a more orderly fashion 
the king said the disaster caused grief to moslems everywhere 
but i reiterate that it is the inescapable will of god he 
said 
an estimated 2 million moslems including 800000 visitors from 
around the world come to islams holy sites in and around mecca 
for the hajj 
the celebration climaxed sunday with prayers on mount arafat 
about eight miles from mecca 
the rituals being celebrated monday the eid aladha or the 
feast of sacrifice commemorate the prophet abrahams offering of 
his son in sacrifice to god 
before monday only a small fire at mina and a few cases of heat 
fatigue had disrupted the pilgrimage season terrorism blamed on 
iranian or shiite moslems has occurred in the past three years 
the worst incident was in 1987 when iranians clashed with 
security forces leading to the death of more than 400 pilgrims 
the year before the saudis confiscated large quantities of 
explosives from members of the iranian contingent 
the saudis have since set a quota of 1000 pilgrims per million 
residents of each islamic nation iranians angered by the quotas 
have boycotted the hajj since 1988 
last year some small bombs went off during the hajj killing 
one pilgrim and injuring 16 the saudis tried and convicted kuwaiti 
shiite moslems and beheaded 16 of them

military authorities are investigating the 
deaths of 11 people who tried to flee across the western border 
during the shoottokill policy of east germanys ousted communist 
regime an official said tuesday 
the policy and the activities of the former security police have 
raised a public outcry for prosecutions of former officials 
a murder inquiry is under way against ousted communist party 
chief erich honecker for his part in the shoottokill policy but 
the ailing 77yearold is not expected to stand trial 
in his announcement tuesday chief military prosecutor col 
karlheinz boesel said he would only investigate whether the guards 
involved had obeyed orders under a law on dereliction of duty 
relatives have pressed homicide charges in all 11 cases 
the military prosecutor told the west german television network 
ard that he refused to regard the soldiers as violent criminals 
if they merely used their firearms according to orders 
a total of 192 wouldbe escapees are known to have perished 
since the berlin wall went up in 1961 it was thrown open only last 
year as the prodemocracy revolution swept the country 
the military prosecutor also argued for a general amnesty for 
border guards who had fired at refugees so that they are offered 
a way out and a chance to make themselves known 
the shoottokill command was signed in 1961 by gen heinz 
hoffmann who was east germanys defense minister until his death 
in 1985 
east germans are seeking to deal with taints in their communist 
past as they rush toward reunification with west germany 
the east german government late monday proposed allgerman 
elections on dec 2 
although the west german government hasnt officially responded 
government sources in bonn said they welcomed the idea 
the two nations merged their currencies and economies sunday 
one hurdle to formal unity is the future military alignment of 
what will be one of europes mightiest military powers 
the united states france and britain insist that germany must 
be a member of the wests north atlantic treaty organization 
perhaps with both soviet and american troops deployed on its soil 
but moscow has insisted the new german nation be neutral 
west german defense ministry sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said in bonn that their government was willing to 
consider a soviet proposal to limit troops of a united germany to 
about 400000 
the two german states now have combined forces of about 600000

as heavy fighting raged northeast of the 
liberian capital of monrovia on tuesday us officials said they 
believed that the government of president samuel k doe could 
collapse in a matter of days 
the officials asking not to be identified said that there had 
been a number of desertions from the elite unit that protects doe 
and that his hold on power was becoming more precarious by the day 
two officials said does demise could come before the weekend 
he has ruled liberia for more than a decade 
state department spokesman richard boucher said there was 
fighting on both sides of the st paul river in addition to the 
combat northeast of monrovia the fighting was inhibiting 
communications out of liberia 
meanwhile sources in monrovia told reporters that doe has 
agreed in principle to resign the sources said he was under 
pressure from close associates in addition to the advancing rebels 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said doe 
agreed to step down only on the condition that his safety and that 
of his minority krahn tribe are guaranteed 
and a rebel source reached by telephone from neighboring ivory 
coast said about 800 rebels of liberias national patriotic front 
have begun an attack on monrovia and several thousand more were 
approaching to put an end to doe and his government 
that source based near the liberian border said rebel leader 
charles taylor was at the front directing attacks on the liberian 
capital taylor launched his rebellion last christmas eve 
reportedly with help from libyan leader moammar gadhafi it is not 
known whether gadhafi has provided any assistance recently 
at the pentagon spokesman pete williams said a navy task force 
was standing over the horizon off liberia ready to evacuate the 
estimated 795 americans in liberia if requested to do so by the 
state department 
were considering all options but a decision to evacuate has 
not yet been made said boucher at the state department there 
were no reports of injury to any americans 
officials have said that the us government is prepared to 
evacuate doe if it is asked to do so they said togo also in west 
africa has agreed to receive doe if he is forced out of liberia 
boucher said monrovia was without water electricity or 
telephone service all main roads out of the capital were cut most 
of does cabinet and other senior administration officials have 
fled liberian and diplomatic sources said army chief of staff lt 
gen henry dubar resigned during the weekend a dusk to dawn curfew 
was in effect 
boucher said a voice of america transmitter is located behind 
rebel lines but the rebel forces have not interfered with its 
operations 
the new us ambassador to liberia peter de vos met with doe 
on sunday on monday he met with the vice president harry moniba 
and three other senior legislators boucher said 
us policy has been to support the formation through political 
negotiations of an interim government that would oversee a 
transition to democratic rule 
doe has offered a national unity government with participation 
by taylors group but the rebel leader has rejected the proposal 
taylor has repeatedly demanded that doe resign before he and the 
rebels will stop their advance 
there also have been official us contacts with taylor a 
former liberian government official who infiltrated the country six 
months ago with a small band of followers 
taylor has informed the us envoys that if his movement ousts 
doe he will promote democracy and respect human rights but 
officials have said they are not certain that taylor will abide by 
those pledges 
taylor also has offered assurances that his forces will not harm 
americans or other foreigners in liberia boucher said 
other officials have said that us envoys have called on taylor 
to exercise maximum restraint because a bloodbath could have an 
impact on us aid to liberia historically the largest recipients 
of american assistance in subsaharan africa

my life was determined by several feelings including a feeling 
of injustice for the striking discrepancy between the proclaimed 
ideals and slogans and reality 
in the last quarter of the 20th century international 
developments are no longer determined by the struggle of two 
opposing systems that it is no longer subordinated completely 
to the dynamics of the conflict of class interests having come 
long ago to the conclusion about deadlocks into which we are pushed 
by dogmatism and ideological schemes that kill living ideas i 
actively supported and practically implemented the idea of the 
priority of human values to class group or any other interests 
i realized quite clearly that false ideology besides 
distorting goals and substituting concepts has also weight aims 
clear material incarnation 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
i am more than convinced that our state needs strong armed 
forces but we can be armed to the teeth and live in fear ofan 
attack or you can be sure no one will attack you because policies 
can create conditions when the country will have no opponents or 
enemies 
if we continue as we did to spend onequarter of gross 
national income on military spending we will ruin the country and 
we will simply not need any defense anymore a ruined country and 
poor people do not need an army it does not make sense to defend a 
system that has led to an economic and social devastation it is up 
to politics to create security with cuts in defense expenditure

is eastern europe a failure of our diplomacy yes if our 
diplomacy has never and could not set itself the aim to oppose the 
elimination in other countries of forced and alien 
administrativecommand systems totalitarian regimes even if 
events in eastern europe had not been in our interests we would 
have not interfered in their affairs we recognize not in words 
but in deeds the equality of nations sovereignty of peoples 
noninterference into their affairs their right to free choice 
any other position is chauvinism imperialism 
the fact that democratically elected leaders of our allies came 
to the meeting of the highest body of warsaw treaty organization 
does not seem a failure but an expression of respect of our 
perestroika 
we diplomats expected the changes in eastern europe but we 
could not interfere 
we forecast this we sensed that if there were not changes 
there would be tragedy 
it bitterly hurts me to see that there are people whose 
assertions lead one to believe that the soviet army didnt liberate 
some eastern european countries but all but captured them as war 
trophies chauvinistic statements insulting the dignity of 
sovereign states are permitted by some 
i see it as my moral obligation to apologize before the peoples 
of east european states for such insulting and unacceptable 
escapades on the part of my fellow countrymen

farmers spent an estimated 1241 billion on 
production expenses last year up 49 percent from 1184 billion 
in 1988 according to a preliminary report by the agriculture 
department released tuesday 
but that was still far below the record level of 1318 billion 
spent in 1981 just before a general financial crunch that stalled 
expansion in the nations agricultural sector 
in 1986 annual spending by farmers dropped to less than 106 
billion reflecting massive cutbacks in capital investments as land 
values plummeted and debts weighed heavily on so many 
the last report by the departments national agricultural 
statistics service showed 1989 expenditures rose for all major 
categories farm and land improvements which dropped 63 percent 
and fuel which declined slightly 
farm services which include rent comprised the largest 
expenditure by farmers at 267 billion up 07 percent from 1988 
these services accounted for 22 percent of overall production 
expenses 
feed expenses were estimated at 182 billion up 17 percent 
accounting for 15 percent of the total 1989 expenditures 
overall last years production expenditures averaged 57478 
per farm an increase of 2522 from 1988 
the analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not 
include figures for net income or profits

thousands of physicians walked off their jobs 
tuesday shutting clinics and disrupting hospitals in a oneday 
strike against a courtordered cut in government overtime payments 
israeli media said the job action involved 12000 doctors but 
many of them were expected to keep treating emergency cases and 
critically ill patients 
the strike was expected to have a widespread effect since most 
doctors work in clinics or hospitals under israels system of 
socialized medicine 
nationwide doctors unions called the strike to protest a court 
ruling last week that declared illegal the nearly twoyear practice 
of giving physicians overtime payments instead of negotiating wage 
increases 
the strike came amid heightened labor unrest organized by the 
labor partydominated histadrut labor federation following 
formation of a rightwing government in early june led by the 
rightwing likud bloc 
the previous government had included the centerleft labor party 
as the doctors launched their 24hour action electric workers 
defense industry employees and workers in other public sectors 
threatened similar action over wage disputes 
the overtime arrangement was reached in november 1988 to bypass 
complicated wage negotiations and to reduce a waiting list of tens 
of thousands of israelis needing operations and other medical care 
but the arrangement was designed to last only until march of 
this year and the government brought suit to challenge 
continuation of the system 
on thursday a tel aviv court ruled that under the law the 
overtime system could not serve as a permanent replacement for a 
wage agreement 
there are few private doctors in israel most israelis pay small 
fees for treatment in hospitals and clinics which are heavily 
subsidized by the government 
the system dates to the countrys socialist origins it has 
suffered financial difficulties in recent years because of 
inefficiency and israels wider economic troubles such as 
doubledigit inflation 
doctors basic salaries start at about 600 a month with 
overnight duty shifts adding up to several hundred dollars more to 
the wages of many attending physicians 
with the overtime payments many doctors have earned an 
additional 200 to 300 a month

nelson mandela raised more than 7 million for 
the african national congress in his eightcity us tour and 
americans paid millions more in tax dollars for his police 
protection 
while no total for donations was available from national 
organizers of the 11day trip that ended saturday organizers in 
each city had rough counts as of monday many said money still was 
coming in 
similarly no sum of government costs for mandelas protection 
was available in new york city alone municipal expenses were put 
at 26 million another big spender was the state department 
which oversaw security 
there isnt even the remotest guess yet as to the federal 
expense said frank matthews spokesman for the state departments 
bureau of diplomatic services its big but i dont know how 
big 
mandela freed in february after 27 years in prison is a leader 
of the anc struggle against apartheid fundraising was a focus of 
his tour and he called for help at events ranging from stadium 
rallies to celebrity cocktail parties 
he fell considerably short of fundraising goals in some cities 
but far exceeded them in others in boston planners raised only 
about half the 1 million they sought in new york donors may 
double their 1 million goal 
when we first heard he was coming to new york we were 
delighted said fundraiser suzanne dubose we knew we could do 
a million but you always think in the back of your mind can the 
town pull it together 
it did she said the mandela tour has raised 175 million in 
new york and latearriving income makes 2 million a possibility 
the national total thus far was less than the 1 million per 
city that some organizers said was set as a target other 
participants however said they had never adopted a 1 million 
goal for their cities 
while mandela spent three days in new york they noted he had 
only a half day in atlanta where projections were for roughly 
400000 and one day in miami and miami beach where he addressed 
a union whose members raised about 300000 in boston his largest 
rally was free unlike the paid events elsewhere 
in washington most of his appearances were private meetings 
with political leaders mandela raised about 150000 there much 
of it from a stadium rally said spokeswoman lisa alfred 
income in detroit was estimated at 14 million and rising with 
help from brisk sales of a videotape account of mandelas visit 
preliminary numbers from los angeles were 17 million and from 
oakland calif 900000 
leila mcdowell spokeswoman for the tours national organizing 
group democracy for south africa said it was shocked at the 
figures provided by the local committees and called it premature to 
release them 
we dont know that theyre inaccurate or that theyre 
accurate she said you get a check you dont know whether 
its bounced or whether its real you get a pledge you dont know 
whether itll come through or not they havent had a chance to do 
a full accounting yet 
expenses were yet to be subtracted from the income but because 
much of the facilities and equipment used by the tour were donated 
or supplied at a discount organizers said most of the cash should 
reach the anc 
in detroit for example expenses were not expected to exceed 
250000 in boston and new york local expenses were estimated at 
roughly 150000 apiece however expenses of the national tour 
organizers including air travel and some accommodations were not 
yet available 
proceeds including sales of tshirts and buttons are to be 
deposited in a fund for the anc the fund is controlled by the us 
directors of the tour led by roger wilkins a professor at george 
mason university and the trips chief planner alfred said 
the money will be used to finance 14 offices in south africa for 
the newly legalized anc she said the remainder will go toward 
housing and education there 
as the tour counted its take municipalities were totaling their 
costs mostly for police overtime bostons metropolitan district 
commission police needed 110000 in overtime pay atlanta police 
an estimated 100000 miami police 20000 figures were not 
immediately available in other cities 
new york was the most specific the city racked up 2 million in 
police overtime 250000 in transportation department charges and 
210000 for cleanup and had other assorted costs for a 26 
million total 
the city said it would seek reimbursement from a state 
department fund set up to help new york pay for protecting 
international leaders visiting the united nations the state 
department has resisted saying mandelas visit did not meet the 
funds guidelines because he is not a head of state 
new york officials have found a silver lining nonetheless 
deputy mayor bill lynch said the combined tv coverage of mandela in 
the city would have cost 720000 a minute if it were paid 
advertising for new york city 
he said we could not have bought this promotion

a wisconsin program that cuts welfare 
benefits of families whose children skip school suffers from 
serious administrative problems that unfairly penalize some 
recipients a state audit says 
the findings released monday drew strong responses from critics 
of the experimental learnfare program who contend gov tommy g 
thompson has touted it while hiding its problems 
by all accounts the learnfare program has been an 
administrative nightmare said state rep peter barca im very 
skeptical at this point 
learnfare authorized by the legislature in 1987 allows the 
state to cut a familys monthly aid to families with dependent 
children benefits if a school reports a student has been 
consistently absent without excuse 
the program applies to teenagers but thompson wants it 
expanded to include elementaryschool pupils the federal 
government has authorized the expansion but the legislature still 
must approve it 
barca said expansion is out of the question given the audit 
findings 
the audit said attendance measurement practices throughout the 
state are inconsistent and errors in paperwork by county social 
workers has resulted in some families being penalized without 
reason 
thompson had not seen the report and had no immediate comment 
his office said tuesday 
learnfare requires cooperation among the state department of 
health and social services the state department of public 
instruction county social service agencies and school districts 
which keep attendance records 
unfortunately cooperation among these agencies has fallen 
short of what is needed to ensure adequate program management 
the report said 
students ages 13 to 19 who dont attend classes regularly see 
their familys monthly benefits reduced by about 100 until schools 
report truancy has ended the states average monthly afdc payment 
is 517 
in general we found that significant weaknesses in 
administration of learnfare lead to some students being sanctioned 
who should not have been and other students who had too many 
unexcused absences not being sanctioned said state auditor dale 
cattanach 
in a review of 151 cases in milwaukee county in february 1990 
it said 13 cases were inappropriately sanctioned there were three 
instances in which students were truant without their families 
being penalized it said 
milwaukee school superintendent robert peterkin said monday his 
district the states largest will design a computerized reporting 
system to improve attendance monitoring 
thomas brophy director of milwaukee county social services 
said in a response letter than his agency will make every effort 
to correct this problem so that no one is sanctioned incorrectly 
brophy also said he doesnt believe significant improvements can 
be made unless his agency receives more money 
of the 30000 students subject to learnfare 48 percent live in 
milwaukee county where 75 percent the sanctions have been imposed 
the report said

secretary of defense dick cheney stands by his 
opposition to the purchase of v22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft for 
the marine corps despite a new study indicating it would be a good 
investment a spokesman said tuesday 
the secretary has concluded that the decision that he made 
last year remains valid spokesman pete williams told reporters 
that is that the v22 is an excellent aircraft but is simply 
too expensive to buy 
the institute for defense analysis a pentagonsponsored 
research group said in a report to congress on friday that the 
osprey could perform better on military missions and do so at less 
cost than helicopter alternatives favored by cheney 
williams said cheney disagrees with assumptions on which the 
report is based 
the osprey would be built jointly by boeing helicopters of 
philadelphia and bell helicoptertextron of fort worth texas 
it is designed to rise and hover like a helicopter and then fly 
like an airplane it would be used largely for militarytransport 
missions 
williams said cheney still believes the marine corps medium 
airlift requirement can be met by alternatives that cost less 
the institute said costs could be reduced by slowing the rate of 
production of the ospreys 
even at the reduced rate however williams said the ospreys 
would cost about 37 billion more during fiscal years 1991 
through 1997 than secretary of the navy h lawrence garrett iii 
recommended be spent on medium airlift 
the report also assumed that the marine corps could get by with 
fewer of the ospreys than originally proposed by flying more 
sorties at higher speeds 
williams said it was not known whether the aircraft could carry 
equipment slung under it at the proposed speed of 200 knots or 
whether the vehicles and other equipment would survive being 
carried at this speed 
williams also said the study appeared to overestimate the 
nearterm investment cost of helicopters 
the pentagon had once hoped to eventually buy about 650 ospreys 
members of congress from texas and pennsylvania with jobs at stake 
in their states have been among strong backers of the aircraft 
sen arlen specter rpa said on sunday once this report is 
in hand with these conclusions it is no longer possible for 
cheney to say credibly that the v22 is more expensive than 
alternatives

resort other officials said 
bush leaves wednesday for the twoday nato summit beginning 
thursday in london and he has been telephoning leaders of the 
alliances other countries in advance of the meeting 
the president blending work with golf and other relaxation 
during a fiveday break at his oceanfront summer home planned to 
take in the local fireworks tuesday night from the deck of the us 
coast guard training barque eagle 
natos basic doctrine since 1967 has been that it would not rule 
out using nuclear weapons first if confronted with an invasion by 
superior conventional forces from the soviet union or its 
satellites 
however national security adviser brent scowcroft said tuesday 
the collapse of the sovietled warsaw pact justified changes in 
that flexible response policy 
scowcroft with bush in maine said the president had sent a 
letter to nato leaders trying to line up support for the changes 
he gave few specifics but administration officials aid 
privately that the bush plan would commit the 16nation alliance to 
ease their nuclearweapons stance at least to the extent of calling 
for use only as a last resort 
bush also steered clear of details as he met with reporters 
outside his vacation home but he said the general approach that 
were proposing seems to be getting wide acceptance 
scowcroft at a later news briefing said the summit takes place 
at a moment of significant historic transition in europe 
the overriding issue is how to adapt the western alliance to 
the changing security environment in europe including the 
collapse of the warsaw pact the changes in eastern europe 
and the turmoil thats going on in the soviet union scowcroft 
said 
he said natos strategy must recognize that shortly there 
will no longer be armies facing each other directly across a 
boundary 
instead he said the united states is looking for the soviets 
to withdraw their troops from eastern europe he added its a 
very different matter to attack a few hundred yards across a border 
than it is to move forces up several hundred miles into eastern 
europe to be prepared for an attack 
one has to look at the issues of forward defense flexible 
response all the kinds of strategies that nato pursues now to see 
how they might be modified to fit those new circumstances said 
the national security adviser 
he said bushs proposals are not bombshells but they are 
significant because this is a significant time scowcroft said 
the united states already has gotten favorable reactions from 
five or six nato allies 
bush conferred at his oceanfront home tuesday with vice 
president dan quayle treasury secretary nicholas brady trade 
representative carla hills and other senior officials to prepare 
for next mondays economic summit in houston bush will fly to 
texas from europe late friday 
bush said he hoped the economic summit bringing together the 
leaders of the worlds seven largest industrialized nations would 
bring progress on trade 
before that the nato allies are holding their third summit in 
the past year as the alliance prepares to welcome a new united 
germany into its ranks a move that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev staunchly opposes 
bush said he hopes the nato summit will help persuade the 
soviets that a unified germany in nato is no threat to the soviet 
union he said if there are certain things we can do to expand 
natos role that drive that point home so much the better 
while sympathetic to gorbachevs problems at home bush 
reiterated tuesday that he remains opposed to western economic aid 
for the soviet union a subject sure to come up at one or both of 
the summits 
scowcroft said i think the soviets will be looking at this 
summit very carefully 
its a difficult issue for the soviet union not only is their 
alliance collapsing and the kind of defense barrier to their west 
that they count on for 40 years but the sort of crown jewel of 
that defensive barrier is now being proposed to join the core of an 
alliance that im sure they tell their little children is evil 
incarnate scowcroft said 
in addition to agreeing to use nuclear weapons only as a last 
resort administration officials say bush has suggested other moves 
to overcome soviet anxieties including eventually scrapping the 
1470 us nucleartipped artillery shells now based mostly in west 
germany reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 1560 us nuclear 
bombs deployed in seven nato countries and pulling back troops from 
forward deployment

president corazon aquino found 
herself politically isolated tuesday as congressional leaders 
urged her to let imelda marcos return home after a us court 
acquitted her of looting this nations treasury 
longtime aquino supporters joined marcos loyalists in calling 
for the former first ladys return but mrs aquino refused to 
relax the ban and accused mrs marcos of supporting a coup attempt 
in december 
on monday a federal jury in new york cleared mrs marcos on 
charges that she used 222 million in philippine government funds 
to buy real estate art and jewelry she fled the country with her 
husband former president ferdinand marcos after the 1986 people 
power revolution toppled his regime and propelled mrs aquino 
into the presidency 
the acquittal does not alter the national interest and 
security grounds on which we have premised our decision not to 
allow the return of mrs marcos at the present time mrs aquino 
said 
that effectively rules out for now prosecuting mrs marcos in 
the philippines because the nations constitution forbids trials in 
absentia 
in a second statement tuesday mrs aquino said intelligence 
reports showed that mrs marcos encouraged and supported those 
who wanted to grab power during the dec 19 military coup 
attempt in which 113 people were killed and more than 600 injured 
the return of mrs marcos would enable her to mobilize the 
underground network of the marcos dictatorship which is designed to 
overthrow this government and endanger our democratic gains and 
economic momentum mrs aquino said 
in a telephone interview with manila radio station dzbb mrs 
marcos said i am not opposing mrs aquino i am not going to 
fight her what i will do is just pray to the lord that i be 
allowed to come home i know that he will grant me this just like 
my acquittal 
despite mrs aquinos stand most key leaders of the senate and 
house of representatives said mrs marcos should be allowed to 
return if only to stand trial 
house speaker ramon mitra said mrs marcos should never have 
been tried abroad and that it is important that the arm of the 
law gets hold of her and she gets her day in court 
in my view mrs marcos should be allowed to present her 
defense before philippine courts said senate president jovito 
salonga who was jailed by marcos this would be a good test of 
our judicial system and its ability to render speedy impartial 
justice 
senate majority leader teofisto guingona said unless i am 
shown specific proof that there is really danger to national 
security i would back allowing mrs marcos to defend herself 
personally here 
the government has frequently accused the marcos family of 
supporting moves to oust mrs aquino but has offered little proof 
in february brig gen alejandro galido claimed he asked mrs 
marcos to finance the december coup attempt but she declined 
because of financial problems 
on tuesday officials said they were ready to prosecute mrs 
marcos and were simply waiting for a goahead from mrs aquino 
we can still proceed with charges insofar as violations of 
philippine laws are concerned said justice secretary franklin 
drilon this is a political decision this means president aquino 
decides on this 
the aquino government claims marcos and his associates stole 10 
billion dollars during his 20 years in power 
but the government has never charged any member of the marcos 
family with criminal offenses for fear they would demand their 
right to return from exile to face their accusers 
marcos died in september in hawaii but mrs aquino cited 
national security in refusing permission for the former president 
to be buried in his homeland she also refused to allow members of 
marcos immediate family to return 
some people suspect that personal bitterness between the two 
women plays a more important role than national security in the 
decision to bar mrs marcos 
mrs aquinos husband benigno was slain upon returning home in 
1983 to challenge marcos 
in addition allowing mrs marcos to return home now could be 
perilous for mrs aquino whose own popularity is at a low ebb 
despite calls for prosecuting mrs marcos here it seems 
unlikely that a trial could be completed by june 1992 when mrs 
aquinos term expires 
the trial of 40 people in the benigno aquino assassination began 
in april 1987 and is still in progress ordinary criminal trials 
often take years to complete

thousands of rainsoaked protesters chanted down 
with the communist party at a rally tuesday evening across town 
from the ruling partys congress in the kremlin 
dozens of red white and blue flags of czarist russia waved in 
the crowd of more than 4000 people who gathered in a steady rain 
outside the main gate of gorky park they listened to radical 
politicians and artists such as poet yevgeny yevtushenko and 
theater director yuri lyubimov denounce communism 
down with the bandits who captured power in 1917 shouted 
moscow city council member valery fadeyev to the cheers of the 
crowd which arrived in a steady late afternoon rain that turned 
into a muggy summer evening 
progressive magazine editor vitaly korotich compared the 
prodemocracy rally to the crucial 28th communist party congress 
meeting in the plush palace of congresses 
one is under a nice roof and under air conditioning in the 
kremlin and another one is under the rain here said korotich 
editor of the popular magazine ogonyok if we will be able to 
collect and support one another in the rain well be stronger than 
the others who want to put fear in us 
the crowd cheered lustily at any mention of boris yeltsin the 
radical president of the russian republic who was not present it 
whistled derisively at references to the kgb secret police and 
conservative leaders 
besides the czarist flags a lithuanian and ukrainian banners 
also waved as did the allblack standard of the anarchists not 
one hammerandsickle was present except on a placard that showed 
the communist symbol evolving into a swastika with the skulls of 
the dead below it 
fadeyev drew shouts of well done as he noted the moscow 
city council had removed a bust of lenin from its chambers we 
also put up the tricolor russian flag and hope that this flag 
our own flag will become the symbol of free russia 
yevtushenko drew laughter when he read a poem that ridiculed the 
communist system and compared it to a little piglet that sucked 
on the breast of the nation and bit it 
lyubimov told the rally i think these are horrible times and 
we are not really aware of the depths we have fallen into 
he paraphrased czechoslovak president vaclav havel saying 
that for 40 years we served a totalitarian regime and each of us 
is guilty we served this horrible machine and we have become like 
beasts all of us 
lyubimov said the communist leaders have not a shadow of 
intellect in their faces and cannot even speak russian 
to the crowds delight he then mocked the southern accent of 
soviet leaders since stalin including mikhail s gorbachev and 
especially made fun of the wheezing of the late leonid i brezhnev 
who in his final years slurred his words badly 
drawing some of the biggest cheers of the rally was oleg 
kalugin a former kgb agent who has joined the democratic platform 
reform movement on saturday it was announced that gorbachev 
stripped him of his rank of major general two weeks after he told 
western reporters that the kgb still is tapping telephones 
infiltrating religious and union organizations and carrying out 
dirty tricks 
kalugin said at the rally that during his years assigned to the 
united states he learned to respect activists in the civil rights 
movement and protesters against the vietnam war 
yes america affected me to the extent that i witnessed the 
revelations about the cia and fbi which like the kgb oppressed 
the people suppressed dissent used criminal methods he said 
and i saw the american people struggle against it without fear of 
possible losses 
of being stripped of his military rank by gorbachev kalugin 
said i am still a soldier of the army of freedom

the national transportation safety board said 
tuesday that the pilot of usair flight 5050 probably caused his 
jetliner to skid into new yorks east river killing two passengers 
the board ruling 40 said pilot michael martin made several 
mistakes while attempting to take off from laguardia airport last 
sept 20 and then in aborting the takeoff 
among the errors the ntsb said were 
martins failure to detect an improperly positioned rudder trim 
control correctly set the control sets the rudder to a neutral 
or straight back position the knob on martins boeing 737 had 
somehow been set to full left rudder 
his failure to realize that even with the knob incorrectly 
set he could have taken off by adjusting other controls 
his failure to carry out standard precautions and procedures 
for aborting a takeoff 
the plane skidded off the runway and landed in the river 
splitting apart the 61 survivors were rescued from the river 
the air line pilots association called the boards determination 
of probable cause in the crash a total travesty and said it 
would ask the ntsb to reconsider its finding the union said the 
design of the knob itself was to blame 
ntsb board member john lauber said investigators had been 
reluctant to lay all of the blame for the crash on martin but 
lauber said the pilots performance on the laguardia airport runway 
showed so many lapses that the decision was justified 
while the ntsb said investigators could not determine how the 
trim control had been improperly set the board in the past has 
found 90 incidents on 737s in which the knob had been incorrectly 
set 
boeing and safety officials have determined that the knob could 
be accidentally moved by cockpit visitors putting their feet on the 
console between the pilot and copilot or by laying a book or other 
object on the console 
boeing and the federal aviation administration have called for 
changes in the trim control knobs on all of the more than 600 
boeing 737s in use 
the ntsb also said martin used poor judgment in letting copilot 
constantin kleissas attempt the takeoff on a dark rainy night 
even though he was certified to fly the plane kleissas had never 
before had the controls of a commercial 737 
martin also failed to follow the standard procedure of calling 
out air speeds to his copilot as the plane moved down the runway 
as the planes speed increased it began drifting to the left 
at which point martin told kleissas he was taking the controls and 
aborting the takeoff but the ntsb said martin had not made himself 
clear and kleissas wasnt sure what was happening 
once the decision to abort was made the board said martin 
improperly tried to control the plane by steering with the 
nosewheel instead of the rudder 
in addition investigators said the pilot had failed during 
preparations for the flight to ensure that the planes automatic 
braking system was set to engage in the event the takeoff was 
aborted 
in summary the board said the probable cause of this 
accident was the captains failure to exercise his command 
authority in a timely manner to reject the takeoff or take 
sufficient control to continue the takeoff which was initiated 
with a mistrimmed rudder 
bob benzon the ntsb investigator in charge of the crash said 
simulator tests had showed that with proper pilot decisions the 
plane could either have stopped safely on the runway or could have 
taken off even with the rudder trim error 
martin and kleissas both had their licenses suspended by the 
faa which was critical of their failure to appear for drug tests 
after the crash both however have dropped their appeals of the 
suspensions and can fly again if they pass recertification tests 
board member jim burnett joined in the 40 vote but filed an 
additional assertion that usairs failure to assign an adequately 
prepared and seasoned flight crew was a contributing factor in 
the crash 
burnett said the board did not cite design of the control knob 
as a factor because the pilot had so many chances to discover and 
correct it and because boeing and the faa already had ordered 
changes to be made on all 737s to correct the problem

health secretary louis sullivan said tuesday 
he is asking officials to avoid all but necessary and 
productive dealings with the aids activist group act up 
members of the aids coalition to unleash power act up led a 
noisy demonstration that drowned out sullivans speech at an aids 
conference in san francisco last month and pelted him with wads of 
paper and other objects as he spoke 
through a spokesman sullivan repeated that he will not deal 
with people who behave as act up did 
whatever dealings that other parts of the department have we 
just want to make sure that they are necessary and productive we 
will not let the department be used as a punching bag by act up or 
any other group we are determined to work together in the fight 
against aids his statement said 
james brown a spokesman for the public health service which 
oversees the bulk of the aids research and education efforts in the 
department said he could not give an example of the kind of 
communication that might be cut off 
it would have to be determined issue by issue he said 
much however will remain the same he said for example act 
up members who sit on department advisory panels will not be 
removed and act ups advice will be sought when necessary and 
productive brown said 
larry kramer founder of act up said in a telephone interview 
from his new york home that sullivans response only inflames 
already bad relations between him and the groups members 
to dr sullivan i say this your presence has been so 
negligible and you have done so little for us that whether you 
decide to work with or us or not with us is irrelevant 
kramer said the group has been assured that its relationship 
with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases 
which does most of the governments aids research is still a 
productive one

a congressman called tuesday for infant 
formula makers to reduce their prices by 30 percent to prevent 
thousands of women and babies from being dropped from a 
federallyfunded feeding program 
infant formula prices have skyrocketed by nearly 150 percent in 
the last 10 years surpassing milk price increases of 364 percent 
grocery increases of 508 percent and the 591 percent rate of 
inflation said rep ron wyden dore 
the manufacturers of infant formula are gouging mothers who 
desperately need to feed their babies said wyden 
about a third of the formula sold in this country goes to 
mothers enrolled in the special supplemental feeding program for 
women infants and children 
wyden said he wrote to the chief operating officers of the five 
leading formula makers asking fr price reductions they are ross 
laboratories makers of similac mead johnson makers of enfamil 
american home products makers of sma carnation makers of great 
start and worthington foods makers of soyalac 
wyden said the two largest companies ross laboratories and mead 
johnson have raised their prices 12 times since 1981 
spokesmen at american home products the third largest infant 
formula maker and ross laboratories said they had not seen wydens 
letter and would not comment 
the letter is dated july 3 it was received this afternoon at 
about 445 pm the person to whom it was addressed is not here we 
have not read it and are not able to comment beyond that said 
jerry parrott spokesman for bristolmyers squibb co of which 
mead johnson is a subsidiary 
congress voted last week to allow states to borrow 3 percent 
against next years appropriation advocates said the move was 
necessary because rising costs of food have caused states to start 
cutting participants 
robert greenstein director of the center on budget and policy 
priorities said that even with the borrowing capacity 15 states 
will have to eliminate participants 
to be sure these states will remove significantly fewer 
participants than would have been the case if the legislation had 
not passed said greenstein however some tens of thousands 
will still be dropped perhaps as many as 100000 overall

air traffic controllers complaining they are 
overworked and underpaid began a threeday strike tuesday that 
forced cancellation of about twothirds of all flights in and out 
of paris at the start of the summer vacation season 
about 90 percent of the controllers at frances largest flight 
control center athismons south of paris reportedly joined the 
strike 
the dutch airline klm and swissair were among the foreign 
carriers that announced they were either canceling all flights into 
paris for the duration of the strike or reducing them drastically 
british airways said it canceled 14 services between heathrow 
airport and paris 
air france and the french domestic carrier air inter said they 
were reducing short and mediumhaul flights by 60 percent air 
france said it would maintain its longhaul flights 
officials warned that delays should be expected 
the strike disrupted some other flights over western europe 
because athismons controls the air space over northern france used 
on those routes 
strikers cited increased air traffic understaffing and the high 
cost of living in the paris area in demanding compensating bonuses 
in a letter to controllers transport minister michel delebarre 
expressed his profound disagreement with the strike saying it 
would seriously penalize french and foreign users and notably 
those going on vacation

the judge in mayor marion barrys drug case 
argued tuesday that he is entitled to bar nation of islam leader 
louis farrakhan and a dissident roman catholic priest from the 
trial because their presence probably would intimidate witnesses 
and jurors 
the justice department in a separate filing supported judge 
thomas penfield jacksons contention that neither barry farrakhan 
nor george augustus stallings is legally entitled to ask for relief 
from the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the american civil liberties union which brought the suit on 
behalf of barry farrakhan and stallings will respond wednesday to 
the justice and jackson filings said local aclu legal director 
arthur spitzer 
when he barred farrakhan from the courtroom last wednesday 
jackson said that the muslim leaders presence would be 
potentially disruptive and very likely intimidating he cited the 
same reasoning in denying stallings entry to the proceedings 
in his submission to the appeals court the judge wrote 
farrakhan and stallings by reason of their extraordinary 
publicity and their widely known and highly controversial views on 
matters directly pertainting to the ongoing trial would be likely 
to send an impermissible message to and to distract disrupt and 
intimidate both jurors and witnesses 
barry can take up the matter with the appeals court if appeals a 
conviction in his drug possession and perjury case the judge wrote 
revs farrakhan and stallings are not parties to any case or 
proceeding in the district court jackson wrote it follows 
that because there is no proper jurisdiction in this court for 
them there is no valid basis for any requested relief 
district courts posess considerable discretion to exclude 
specific spectators in order to ensure that jurors and witnesses 
are free of distraction disruption and intimidation the judge 
added 
jackson concluded that his actions were well within my 
discretion under the unique circumstances that barrys trial has 
produced 
the judge announced his decision to exclude farrakhan and 
stallings while the jury in barrys case was outside the courtroom 
in both instances barry had sought to give one of his special 
guest passes to the men 
in his initial filing spitzer argued that jackson must present 
proof that farrakhan and stallings would disrupt the trial he also 
claimed that jacksons order violated the mayors constitutional 
right to a public trial 
but the justice department wrote that since the press and 
members of the public are allowed to attend all proceedings 
defendant barrys right to a public trial is preserved 
about a dozen of farrakhans followers have protested jacksons 
actions outside the courthouse this week while stallings has 
decried jacksons decision as well 
the story has become a sidelight in barrys case both farrakhan 
and stallings who are black claim that they have been excluded 
from the proceedings because of their race barry and his backers 
have been suggesting for months that the case against the mayor was 
racially motivated 
thirteen of the 18 jurors are black 
jackson who is white has refused to comment on the matter 
outside his legal filings

mikhail s gorbachevs hardline kremlin 
colleagues on tuesday sharply attacked his reforms of the ailing 
soviet economy politics the military and diplomacy 
there are forces in our country fighting against socialist 
order against the communist party warned conservative politburo 
member yegor k ligachev rejecting attacks on party hardliners 
and their allies in the army 
his remarks drew thunderous applause from the 4657 delegates at 
the 28th communist party congress gorbachev the party general 
secretary and president sat stonefaced behind the speakers 
platform in the kremlin palace of congresses 
opponents ligachev said applaud things that are directed 
toward the breakup of socialism in our country toward undermining 
the party presenting them as innovations as real perestroika 
gorbachev told the delegates that four top party officials 
submitted their resignations further undermining the traditional 
public unity of the collective kremlin leadership gorbachev 
increasingly has been the target of public criticism by his 
colleagues 
the four officials included nonvoting politburo member 
alexandra biryukova the highestranking woman in the leadership 
she was responsible for consumer goods and gorbachev gave no 
reason for her resignation 
gorbachevs critics did not mention him by name in keeping with 
tradition but the resignations and the abuse heaped on his 
policies raised doubts that he has enough support at the top to 
push further reforms 
when the 10day congress is over it will have elected a party 
leader and central committee and will have approved a new platform 
and party rules 
the harsh speeches by gorbachevs colleagues on the ruling 
politburo the first allowed at a congress of this type since 1921 
were televised nationally after a delay 
a gorbachev ally foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
praised the reforms and countered conservative criticism that he 
had signed unfavorable arms control treaties with the west and too 
much was cut from the military budget 
gorbachev appeared unperturbed by the criticism acting as 
congress chairman he cracked jokes and laughed 
after communist leaders aired their differences about 4000 
reformers gathered across the moscow river and gave the congress a 
bad review braving a steady rain they rallied at the main gate of 
gorky park shouting down with the communist party and down 
with the kgb 
many waved the red white and blue flags of czarist russia 
inside the red brick walls of the kremlin the 69yearold 
ligachev railed against three of gorbachevs reforms his plan to 
put factories and farms in private hands his farm investment 
policy and his antialcoholism campaign which has been abandoned 
ligachev also said gorbachevs 5yearold perestroika reform 
program was marred by limitless radicalism and 
improvisations that have brought little good 
kgb chairman vladimir a kryuchkov in a speech laden with 
marxistleninist ideology criticized economic reforms he said have 
produced property stratification among the population and a 
whole layer of millionaires 
he said some people want to import capitalism bringing with it 
the many ills of that system 
we hear assertions that in the west everything is good and 
here everything is bad we are drawn to western experience but 
can we allow that along with useful experience the negative in the 
world of capital has also been transferred into our life 
he listed the ills as mass unemployment rampant crime and drug 
abuse 
gorbachev repeatedly has praised western economies especially 
during his trip to the united states last month for providing 
incentives to workers and fostering high living standards 
another conservative defense minister dmitri t yazov rejected 
demands by communist reformers to eliminate party cells in the 
armed forces 
that would be very harmful he told the delegates including 
some military officers yazov wore his green marshals uniform 
emblazoned with several rows of medals 
shevardnadze made a spirited defense of perestroika and 
rejected charges of concessions in the security arena 
if we continue as we did to spend onequarter of the gross 
national income on military spending we will ruin the country and 
we will simply not need any defense any more the whitehaired 
diplomat said a ruined country and poor people do not need an 
army 
shevardnadze praised soviet policy in eastern europe where 
since last august new governments have replaced what he called 
forced and alien administrativecommand systems totalitarian 
regimes 
we sensed that if there were not changes there would be 
tragedy he said 
ligachev later told reporters in the lobby that the loss of 
eastern europe doesnt strengthen our position but weakens it 
shevardnadze was applauded but not nearly as much as ligachev 
in a remark that ran counter to soviet tradition shevardnadaze 
said he did not see why the foreign minister should sit on the 
politburo 
some changes in the politburo were already in the works in 
addition to biryukova two full politburo members nikolai n 
slyunkov and vitaly i vorotnikov have submitted their 
resignations gorbachev announced 
gumer i usmanov who sits on the party secretariat also 
signaled his intention to resign gorbachev said usmanov and 
slyunkov were ill vorotnikov recently lost a job that carried 
nearly automatic inclusion on the politburo that of president of 
the russian federation the resignations have not yet been accepted

the judge in mayor marion barrys drug trial 
told an appeals court tuesday that he is entitled to bar nation of 
islam leader louis farrakhan and an excommunicated roman catholic 
priest from the courtroom 
district courts possess considerable discretion to exclude 
specific spectators in order to ensure that jurors and witnesses 
are free of distraction disruption and intimidation us 
district judge thomas penfield jackson wrote in court papers 
supporting his decision 
the justice department in a separate filing supported 
jacksons contention that barry farrakhan nor george augustus 
stallings could legally seek relief from the us district court of 
appeals 
the bar against farrakhan and stallings whose break with the 
roman catholic church has brought him widespread publicity has 
become a sidelight of barrys threeweekold trial barry 
supporters have called it evidence that the mayor is being 
persecuted by the government because he is black 
the american civil liberties union which brought the suit on 
behalf of barry farrakhan and stallings will respond wednesday to 
the government and jackson filings said local aclu legal director 
arthur spitzer 
farrakhan was barred from entering the courtroom as barrys 
guest last wednesday the judge said the muslim leaders presence 
would be potentially disruptive and very likely intimidating 
he cited the same reasoning in denying stallings entry on thursday 
in his court papers jackson wrote that barry could take up the 
matter with the appeals court if he is convicted in his drug and 
perjury trial and then appeals 
and he said he was using his authority to keep the courtroom 
proceedings moving smoothly 
jackson announced his decision to exclude farrakhan and 
stallings while the jury was outside the courtroom in both 
instances barry had sought to give one of his four special guest 
passes to the men 
jackson concluded that his actions were well within my 
discretion under the unique circumstances that barrys trial has 
produced 
barry has appeared to prolonged applause at public events 
recently with both farrakhan and stallings who contend they have 
been excluded from the courtroom because they are black 
in his initial filing spitzer argued that jackson must show 
proof that the men would disrupt the trial he also claimed that 
jacksons order violated the mayors constitutional right to a 
public trial 
but the justice department wrote that since the press and 
members of the public are allowed to attend all proceedings 
defendant barrys right to a public trial is preserved 
about a dozen of farrakhans followers have protested jacksons 
actions outside the courthouse this week and stallings has also 
decried jacksons decision 
jackson who is white has refused to comment on the matter 
outside his legal filings

rasheeda moore testified at marion barrys 
drug and perjury trial tuesday that she lost a city contract in 
1988 because she refused the mayors request for oral sex she said 
barry told her you refuse therefore you refuse the contract 
finishing five days of testimony the woman who aided the fbi 
sting against barry said the contract had been speedily approved in 
1986 because the mayor told me it would be 
moore answered prosecution questions seeking to counter barry 
defense attempts to show the mayor was illegally enticed into 
smoking crack cocaine the night of his arrest 
moore said she turned barry down at a downtown washington hotel 
where they and another woman maria mccarthy had been using drugs 
and discussing moores contract for a program to build selfesteem 
in city teenagers 
after she rejected the mayors sexual advance barry told her 
because i refused i cant promise you the program this year 
moore testified 
my contract had not been signed and approved by city 
officials moore said of her conversation with the mayor i asked 
him if he could make some calls 
he did ask me to have oral sex with him moore testified 
later in the day 
did you comply asked assistant us attorney judith retchin 
no said moore 
barry then told moore you refuse therefore you refuse the 
contract moore testified 
the 180000 contract for project me was not renewed that year 
said moore 
she said the incident took place in the summer of 1988 at the 
vista hotel soon after she ended her sexual relationship with the 
threeterm mayor the hotel was later the site of barrys jan 18 
arrest for allegedly using crack cocaine 
barry lawyer r kenneth mundy brought out earlier grand jury 
testimony in which moore said she had been heavily involved with 
drugs in the summer of 1988 and was in no condition to carry out 
the program but she also testified about the sex aspect to the 
grand jury 
barry 54 is facing 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession charges 
one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and three felony counts 
of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use 
moore has said the two used drugs together more than 100 times 
between 1986 and 1988 
moore also recanted earlier testimony that she had violated fbi 
instructions in the sting operation that led to barrys arrest 
she had admitted to mundy last friday that she overcarried 
fbi instructions by steering her conversation with barry to drugs 
and that she twice invited barry to come up to her room 
but on tuesday she said barry was eager to meet with her at the 
hotel and that he brought up the subject of drugs the minute he 
walked in her hotel room 
is it still your testimony that you went beyond your 
instructions asked retchin 
no its not said moore 
mundy attacking moores motives and credibility said she has 
received more than 32000 in aid from the government but that 
allowed moore under later prosecution questioning to tell jurors 
she was in the justice departments witness protection program 
because the government contends it has evidence a 100000 contract 
has been put out on her life 
the jury was told that barry had nothing to do with that threat 
against moores life 
and retchin countering mundys suggestion that barry was merely 
led along by moore asked her in a series of questions whether she 
helped barry use crack cocaine during the sting 
no i did not moore said 
moore also told jurors that before the sting she told the fbi 
the mayor used code words for drug use including the phrase mess 
around moore has contended barry raised the subject of drugs the 
night of his arrest when he asked her whether an undercover fbi 
agent posing as a friend of moores would mess around

engineers on both coasts will begin tests 
after the fourth of july to find the mysterious fuel leaks that 
have grounded americas space shuttle fleet for an indefinite time 
we dont expect the standdown to be extensive nasas space 
flight chief william lenoir said tuesday but he conceded that 
we dont know exactly how long its going to be 
a 17inch fuel line removed from the shuttle columbia was 
brought to shuttle builder rockwell international in california for 
the tests along with the complicated hardware that connects the 
line to the orbiter and its huge tank 
the shuttle atlantis still is on the launch pad at the kennedy 
space center in florida awaiting a sequence of tests being worked 
out this week both shuttles leaked supercold liquid hydrogen as 
their tanks were being filled recently causing their launches to 
be postponed 
the fuel transfer system also includes a fourinch pipe used to 
pressurize the tank and a twoinch line that pumps helium early in 
the fueling process 
the pipes are in two parts one half attached to the orbiter 
the other to the fuel tank they are connected until eight minutes 
into a flight when the tank is empty and jettisoned the half on 
the orbiter is reused the other half is destroyed with the tank 
engineers have detected leaks in both the 17inch and 4inch 
lines but dont know exactly where lenoir said the leaks show 
only when the liquid hydrogen is flowing through the pipes at 
minus 431 degrees fahrenheit 
on the 4inch side there is a leak but it may be within 
specifications which means we dont have a concern with it 
lenoir said it would appear there is a more significant problem 
with the 17inch and thats where we ought to focus our attention 
the tests in downey will be conducted first with gaseous helium 
then gaseous nitrogen then gaseous hydrogen lenoir said if that 
doesnt reveal the leak engineers will use liquid nitrogen and 
finally liquid hydrogen 
the fuel lines and fittings from the tanks on columbia and 
atlantis are numbers three and four in a batch of eight that failed 
acceptance tests in 1983 then were passed in a subsequent 
procedure the first two were used in march and november last year 
to get discovery into orbit 
lenoir said however that about 20 such units had failed when 
they were first tested only to pass on a retest and we didnt 
change procedures in order to pass these 
on nasas other big problem the outoffocus 15 billion 
hubble space telescope the space agency said that some fuzzy 
images may be improved through the same computer process that 
cleaned up photos taken by the voyager spacecraft 
but said ed weiler a hubble project scientist the pictures 
will still be less clear than scientists originally expected 
weiler said a team of experts was being selected to determine 
how much of the fuzz ball now being seen by the space telescope 
can be turned into crisp pictures through computer techniques 
he called the improvement of pictures through computers 
something of a black art but he said other experts in the 
field are certain they can improve some of hubbles views 
ill believe it when i see it weiler told reporters 
well let the experts play with the images people in the field 
say there is a lot of hope there 
weiler emphasized however that the computerenhancing 
technique is only an effort to salvage some good from a 
fundamentally flawed telescope

the ruling marxist party pledged tuesday 
to establish a multiparty democracy but said it could take place 
only after the 15yearold civil war with usbacked rebels ends 
and a new constitution is adopted 
a spokesman for the rebels criticized the declaration as vague 
in luanda the capital the central committee of the ruling 
popular movement for the liberation of angola issued its statement 
after five days of often heated discussions 
the peoples republic of angola will evolve toward a 
multiparty political system within a framework of a new 
constitution to be submitted to a popular referendum the 
statement said 
but the shift away from singleparty rule would only come once 
peace stability and internal security exist it added 
the statement also reaffirmed support for president jose eduardo 
dos santos to overcome obstacles that continue to block a peace 
settlement with rebel national union for the total independence of 
angola or unita 
the rebels led by jonas savimbi have been fighting the 
government since angola gained independence from portugal in 1975 
in washington a rebel spokesman said the declaration falls 
short of our expectations 
they are talking about a possibility after a referendum 
nobody knows when said jardo muekalia unitas washington 
representative 
we had expected them to come out with concrete terms for a 
ceasefire and multiparty democracy he said in a telephone 
interview 
since the collapse of last years truce government and rebel 
officials have met twice this year for portuguesesponsored peace 
talks 
dos santos has been under pressure from hardline party 
officials to scrap peace efforts and push further military action 
some rebel leaders have also opposed the peace talks 
after the last round of talks in midjune portuguese officials 
said the two sides were close to a lasting ceasefire agreement 
points of contention are how to monitor a ceasefire and terms 
for angolas political future diplomats said 
savimbi visiting the african nation of togo on tuesday 
demanded a ceasefire before resuming negotiations 
he said he was optimistic that talks would proceed because the 
natural allies of our antagonists are no longer in a position to 
aid them 
luanda has received massive amounts of soviet military 
equipment and moscow has pledged to continue supplies despite its 
economic problems 
the war once pitted south african forces backing unita against 
some 50000 cuban troops in angola to support the government 
south african aid to the rebels officially ended with regional 
peace accords signed with angola and cuba in december 1988 but 
unita still receives us military assistance 
cuba has already sent home more than 33000 soldiers under the 
agreement but soviet military aid continues

imelda marcos acquitted of federal charges that 
she helped her husband loot the philippine treasury celebrated at 
a noisy party with codefendant adnan khashoggi 
marcos spokesman willie padrone said mrs marcos hasnt decided 
to return to hawaii where she has lived since she and her late 
husband president ferdinand marcos fled a popular revolt in the 
philippines in 1986 
another aide to mrs marcos roger peyuan said mrs marcos 
might stay in new york for a while to do things she wasnt able to 
do while she was on trial 
khashoggi whose acquittal freed him of restrictions on his 
movements headed for palm beach fla the 54yearold financier 
said he would fly to france then to his native saudi arabia to 
visit islams holiest shrine at mecca 
mrs marcos slept in tuesday after monday nights party early 
tuesday evening she left manhattan for the hillsborough nj 
home of her friend doris duke the tobacco heiress peyuan said 
mrs duke lent mrs marcos her manhattan apartment and 
reportedly paid legal fees including 5 million for her main 
defense attorney gerry spence 
peyuan said mrs marcos might stay at dukes home overnight or 
possibly for several days 
don robinson an attorney who represents miss duke quoted her 
as saying when i posted the bail for my friend imelda a year and 
a half ago i did it because i knew she was innocent now that 12 
good citizens after hearing all the evidence have agreed with me 
i am overjoyed god bless america 
the jury on monday rejected the governments allegations that 
mrs marcos had helped her husband loot their countrys treasury of 
222 million to secretly buy new york buildings and other luxuries 
it acquitted khashoggi of charges he faked documents to show 
that he rather than the marcoses owned the properties before a 
federal court order froze their assets in 1986 
in postverdict interviews jurors made clear they felt the pair 
shouldnt have been tried in the united states one juror thomas 
orourke called the case totally silly 
ironically a state department memo which surfaced after the 
acquittal showed that us attorney rudolph giuliani who initiated 
the charges against the marcoses guaranteed that the case 
would end in conviction 
giuliani the memo said believed the evidence was so strong 
that there was no reason to offer marcos a plea bargain because he 
would be more likely to settle after being indicted the state 
department disagreed 
marcos should be given a last chance prior to indictment to 
reach a voluntary plea agreement that should enable him to 
avoid being sentenced to prison the state department urged in 
the september 1988 memo 
the memorandum was written by abraham d sofaer the state 
departments chief legal expert shortly before a federal grand 
jury indicted the marcoses khashoggi and several others it is 
part of the record of the trial 
it did not mention mrs marcos or khashoggi but focused 
entirely on marcos who the justice department said was 
continuing illegal activity while living in exile in hawaii 
after marcos death last september us officials chose to 
continue the case against his widow 
giuliani left office in january 1989 and was defeated as the 
republican candidate for mayor of new york last november he is 
with a private law firm and did not return a phone call to his 
office 
a secretary said he has made it a policy to decline comment on 
cases left over from his time as us attorney 
the office of giulianis successor us attorney otto 
obermaier said it could not estimate the cost of the threemonth 
trial 
speculation that mrs marcos might mount a political challenge 
to president corazon aquino who replaced marcos was snuffed when 
mrs aquino said mrs marcos is a security threat and would not 
be allowed to return 
mrs aquino said intelligence reports also showed that mrs 
marcos encouraged and supported those who wanted to grab power 
during a dec 19 coup attempt in which 113 people were killed and 
more than 600 were injured 
in washington state department deputy spokesman richard boucher 
said mrs marcos return was a matter for the government of the 
philippines to determine but he added that the us immigration 
and naturalization services june 16 1989 departure control 
order prohibiting mrs marcos from leaving the country remained 
in effect 
he said the ban was based on the potential for destabilizing 
activity should she return to manila as well as the legal 
problems here

rioting broke out in the albanian 
capital of tirana and diplomats said tuesday that hundreds of 
people stormed foreign embassies there trying to flee europes last 
bastion of hardline communism 
italys foreign ministry in a statement in rome said albanian 
security forces used firearms to try to turn back the refugees a 
greek government communique reported shooting and unconfirmed 
accounts of victims among the population 
the albanian government confirmed the rioting and acknowledged 
people were wounded at one embassy 
a statement by the official ata news agency said 300 to 400 
people including vagabonds former prisoners as well as some 
deceived adolescents tried to storm the unspecified embassy 
monday night 
the statement telexed to the associated press in vienna said 
the crowd threw stones and bricks at police blocked traffic and 
broke shop windows it said security forces restored order and 
detained people it said some people were slightly wounded 
diplomats said about 200 albanians sought refuge in at least a 
dozen embassies since late last week the greatest concentration 
86 appeared to be in the west german compound 
hanns schumacher deputy west german foreign ministry spokesman 
said in bonn the refugees motives were not completely clear but 
he assumed this is the outbreak of dissatisfaction with the 
existing political realities in albania 
security forces patrolled tirana in strength on tuesday and 150 
officers guarded the west german and turkish embassies the austria 
press agency said 
it quoted western diplomats as saying antigovernment 
demonstrations had hit tirana in the last few days 
austria press agency reporter wilfried seywald reported from 
tirana that authorities canceled all tuesday appointments the mood 
was reported as somber with security forces everywhere

who fled to his embassy left after the albanian government allowed 
them to leave the country the anatolia news agency reported 
the czechoslovak news agency ctk said representatives of the 
czechoslovak foreign ministry began talks with albanian authorities 
to try to resolve their embassy occupation 
one western diplomat in tirana said the surge of refugees 
started last week when 25 albanians entered the polish embassy 
a host country cannot legally violate embassy premises 
the developments were reminiscent of events last year when east 
germans crowded western embassies in eastern europe and touched off 
the popular revolution in their country 
albania has vigorously resisted the prodemocracy movements that 
have radically altered other eastern european nations the albanian 
government has made only modest reforms in that country of 32 
million

up to now shots were heard last night and it is rumored that there 
were victims among the population

interference of the forces of order and the working people of the 
capital the persons who violated order and tranquility dispersed 
there were slightly wounded on both parties the people kept a 
number of them for the necessary investigations 
the agency called monday nights disturbance an alarming 
situation aimed at impairing the good relations existing with 
the friendly states represented in tirana and to distort the image 
of albania in the world 
a foreign ministry spokesman in bonn speaking on condition of 
anonymity said 86 refugees were in the west german embassy as of 
tuesday night 
guards fired on one group of four who fled into the compound

seventynine people fled to the embassy monday night and early 
tuesday west german diplomats said 
one group crashed their truck into the german compounds walls 
others fled in through that hole and the final group crashed their 
truck into the greek compound next door as albanian guards fired on 
them west german diplomats said in the confusion some albanians 
fled into the greek compound and some into the west german embassy

i heard more than 50 shots when they were trying to get into 
the west german embassy the western diplomat in tirana said 
three more refugees gained entry into the west german embassy 
later tuesday the german spokesman said

embassy said the western diplomat an italian foreign ministry

a soviet helicopter pilot hailed as a hero for 
trying to douse the 1986 fire at the chernobyl nuclear plant 
despite intense radiation died at age 53 after developing 
radiationrelated leukemia 
anatoly grishchenko died late monday at the fred hutchinson 
cancer research center the final cause of death was listed as 
heart failure brought on by a lung infection 
doctors said tuesday that grishchenko may have been doomed by 
delays in getting him treatment still grishchenkos soviet 
physician said the treatment he received at the center was the best 
anywhere and said she could not fault it 
ill try to tell my chief and all the soviet people and all 
the soviet physicians that patient grishchenko had the best 
treatment he could have here at this center dr eugenia margulis 
told a news conference tuesday 
everybody was taking care of him not only the physicians and 
the nurses and the staff but all the people from seattle 
she said grishchenko the only chernobyl victim to be treated in 
the united states received more than 100 cards and letters daily 
from around the country 
seattle mayor norm rice ordered flags on city buildings to fly 
at halfstaff tuesday in grishchenkos honor 
in april 1986 grishchenko repeatedly flew his helicopter 
through the intensely radioactive gases above the smoldering 
chernobyl plant dumping sand and cement to entomb the crippled 
reactor after it exploded 
he was among a handful of participants designated heroes of the 
soviet union that countrys highest honor when soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev visited america in june for summit talks with 
president bush he sent a top aide to give grishchenko a 
handwritten note praising his bravery 
after the disaster grishchenko suffered acute radiation 
sickness he was found to have leukemia last year he was flown to 
seattle april 11 and a bone marrow transplant was performed later 
that month 
doctors thought his chances of recovery good and hutchinson 
associate director john hansen said he was out of bed doing 
exercises after the transplant 
but a lung infection flared up and grishchenko underwent 
surgery june 12 his condition worsened and on june 15 he was 
placed on a respirator 
hutchinson dr finn petersen who assisted in the transplant 
said a combination of soviet red tape and difficulty finding a 
marrow donor contributed to the infection which he said developed 
when grishchenko got pneumonia in january and persisted until it 
cut off oxygen to his bloodstream 
he probably would not have developed this infection if we 
didnt have the wait petersen said 
we should have done the transplant last fall hansen added 
grishchenkos initial response to treatment showed promise for 
others said dr patrick beatty director of the centers unrelated 
transplant program 
despite his heavy radiation exposure in the past he 
actually did extremely well in the transplant beatty said 
margulis did not know how many people in the soviet union suffer 
from similar conditions and neither she nor hansen could say if 
others are trying to get treatment at american facilities 
margulis said a new medical center is planned for gomel about 
300 miles southwest of moscow near chernobyl 
it is better to build a new center in the soviet union than to 
send them here which is very expensive to our government 
she said 
grishchenkos treatment is estimated to have cost about 180000 
margulis said she learned a lot about treating radiation cancer 
but was frustrated at having to wait to apply that knowledge at 
home until the gomel center is built 
margulis will accompany grishchenkos body back to moscow with 
his widow galina 
mrs grishchenko is a very brave strong courageous woman and 
she is handling this very well hansen said

a frantic stampede that killed more 
than 1400 moslem pilgrims inside a pedestrian tunnel was prompted 
by the tumbling of seven people from a bridge overhead the 
interior minister said tuesday 
prince nayef put the death toll at 1426 making it the worst 
pilgrimage tragedy in recent history there were no further details 
immediately available on the pilgrims who fell from the bridge 
reporters were barred from the general hospital at mina the 
tent city connected by the tunnel to mecca officials said the 
government had ordered that journalists not be allowed to interview 
or photograph victims 
the tragedy shattered what had been a peaceful observance of the 
annual pilgrimage or hajj for the first time in four years in 
previous years the celebration was marred by terrorist attacks and 
riots 
the moessem pedestrian tunnel which is under part of a 
mountain is 500 yards long and 20 yards wide it was built under a 
15billion development project launched by the government at holy 
sites two years ago 
the airconditioned tunnel was packed multiple times beyond 
its capacity with some 50000 people inside prince nayef said 
the temperature outside soared to 112 degrees 
the fall of the seven from the bridge spread terror and the

father had mentioned before going to mecca how wonderful it would 
be if he were to die among holy people in the sacred city

family was grateful her fathers wish had come true especially 
because there would be thousands of pilgrims to pray for him and 
the others who died

pilgrims families 
outside the mina hospital tuesday pilgrims waited for word on 
missing relatives and friends 
four egyptian men said they were looking for a missing friend 
one said the group had been a few yards from the tunnel when the 
stampede occurred their friend was two yards ahead of them and had 
entered the tunnel 
he did not come back the pilgrim said he refused to give 
his name

mina they also circled the kaaba in the grand mosque which is 
islams holiest shrine

to visit the prophet mohammeds tomb 
mecca is where the 7th century prophet mohammed founder of 
islam was born 
in 1986 security officials found large quantities of explosives 
in mecca indicating some kind of sabotage was planned

violence ever saudi riot police clashed with pilgrims who defied 
a government ban on political rallies during the religious event 
more than 400 people most of the iranians were killed 
last year one pilgrim was killed and 16 wounded when two bombs 
exploded in the holy city sixteen people tried and convicted of 
the attacks later were beheaded

nato plans to signal its peaceful 
intentions toward their former adversaries in eastern europe at 
this weeks summit but is at odds over issuing a nonaggression 
declaration officials said tuesday 
the idea of sending some kind of sign to the east that we 
really mean it when we say were nonaggressive has a good deal 
of support said a senior official at nato who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
but he said there was good deal of debate about how it 
should be done 
this is completely up in the air said another diplomat who 
also demanded anonymity 
one official said it was among the most controversial issues 
leading up to the thursdayfriday summit of president bush and 
other nato leaders in london the leaders are expected to kick off 
a formal review of the alliance to give it a more political less 
military tone they want to make the north atlantic treaty 
organization appear less threatening to the soviet union 
in doing so the allies hope soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will drop his objections to full and immediate membership 
for a united germany in nato 
west germany belongs to nato east germany is a member of the 
sovietled warsaw pact more than 380000 red army soldiers are 
stationed in east germany 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner says the summit will 
offer a very clear message about the peaceful intentions of our 
member nations and also about the nonaggressive character of 
our alliance 
the soviets last month floated a vague proposal for some kind of 
a political accord between the two alliances which has led to the 
current controversy over the shape of a nonaggression declaration 
a statement could be arranged between nato and the warsaw pact 
although the western allies appear hesitant to do anything that 
might prop up the collapsing eastern military alliance 
as an alternative a declaration of good intentions could be 
worked out among the 16 nato and seven warsaw pact nations a nato 
diplomat said 
or the declaration could be as simple as a unilateral statement 
by nato 
the united states does not feel it necessary to draw up a 
formal separate document as has been suggested by west germany and 
others officials said 
an official said washington favors as little as possible 
because nato has asserted the nonthreatening nature of the 
alliance before

the huge santa barbara brush fire that burned 
hundreds of homes was brought under control tuesday as scores of 
fire victims across southern california began the formidable job of 
recovery 
the declaration was issued at 6 am 5 days after the blaze 
was set by an arsonist in san marcos pass and blew down the 
foothills of the coastal mountains through hundreds of homes on the 
outskirts of santa barbara 
a small crew of firefighters backed by a helicopter and two 
engines watched for smoldering hotspots but the blaze was 
considered controlled because no flames showed within 300 feet of 
fire lines cut through the brush 
but while victory over the 4500acre fire took less than a 
week people burned out of more than 450 dwellings were only 
beginning a long process of rebuilding and emotional recovery 
it was the same story in the los angeles suburb of glendale 
where 66 hillside homes were damaged or destroyed in a arson blaze 
june 27 and in the aftermath of a 6640acre blaze that straddled 
the orangesan bernardino county line and destroyed 14 homes last 
week both fires were caused by arson officials said 
in santa barbara and glendale the federal emergency management 
agency and state office of emergency services opened centers to 
take applications for lowinterest loans and grants 
fires also continued to burn in colorado and texas 
in california organizations like the red cross and salvation 
army continued supplying victims with immediate essentials 
including clothing medicine and in some cases psychological aid 
the stress and emotional trauma is paramount right now we 
have many severely traumatized people said red cross spokeswoman 
elizabeth quirk in santa barbara 
more than 340 families were registered with the red cross in 
santa barbara and the number was expected to top 600 six shelters 
that housed more than 1000 people during the fire were closed and 
efforts focused on finding regular housing 
red cross which already has committed 200000 in direct 
services to victims will provide the first months rent and 
security deposit 
the question will be whether there is enough housing in the 
area ms quirk said 
on the rebuilding front santa barbara county was in its second 
day of issuing demolition permits on monday 280 people began the 
permit process said spokeswoman jayne brechwald 
residents also will need permits for temporary housing 
electrical poles and similar fixtures that must be in place before 
construction can start permit fees were waived for the time being 
a private relief center was established at the goleta youth 
sports center to help people reach contractors architects and 
realestate and insurance agents 
despite the breadth of help coming to the region experts 
predicted a very lengthy recovery 
well probably still be taking care of fire victims for at 
least a year ms quirk said 
red cross had on hand 650 local volunteers and was ready to 
supply victims with some furnishings occupational supplies like 
uniforms and tools and personal items like eyeglasses 
prescription medicines and dentures 
four roving food trucks have served 4000 meals in the fire area 
since the blaze began 
help has come from across north america a robinsons department 
store gave red cross 50000 for direct dispersal to victims

a man who was convicted six years ago 
of hacking and bludgeoning his wife and three children to death was 
granted a new trial tuesday by the illinois supreme court 
the court reversing a decision it made in 1988 ruled that 
david hendricks 1984 trial was tainted by prosecutors use of 
testimony about his alleged extramarital sexual interests 
at the trial female models employed by hendricks in his 
backbrace business testified that he fondled or kissed them while 
they were partially nude 
prosecutors said the testimony backed their theory that 
hendricks killed his family with an ax and butcher knife to escape 
a sexually frustrating marriage but the supreme court ruled 
the testimony was irrelevant 
the court also said prosecutors shouldnt have been allowed to 
present testimony on the beliefs of the fundamentalist christian 
sect to which hendricks belongs prosecutors contended hendricks 
feared he would be ostracized by the group if he tried to divorce 
his wife 
hendricks 35 is serving four consecutive life prison sentences 
at the maximumsecurity menard correctional center for the killings 
of his wife susan 30 daughters rebekah 9 and grace 7 and son 
benjamin 5 in their bloomington home in november 1983 
he has insisted that he was out of town at the time of the 
killings and could not have committed them 
although the supreme court upheld his conviction in december 
1988 it took the unusual step last year of agreeing to reconsider 
the case the court offered no explanation for granting the second 
hearing 
the prosecutor who would be responsible for a second trial 
mclean county states attorney charles reynard declined to comment 
immediately he said he would make a statement thursday after 
reviewing the supreme courts decision 
but the man who prosecuted hendricks former states attorney 
ronald dozier said last year that hendricks might go free if a new 
trial were ordered because of the likely difficulty of persuading 
the models to repeat their testimony dozier now a circuit judge 
would not comment tuesday 
hendricks attorney richard mcleese said he was very very 
pleased by the courts decision but declined to comment on the 
next probable step in the case 
hendricks remarried while in prison and has been supported 
throughout his appeals by family members including nadine palmer 
the mother of his slain wife 
now i hope they can turn their attention to whoever did it and 
prosecute them mrs palmer said in a telephone interview after 
the ruling 
hendricks described by friends as a mildmannered devoted 
family man was convicted after one of the most publicized trials 
in recent illinois history 
prosecutors had no physical evidence or witnesses against him 
and he said he was out of town on a business trip at the time of 
the killings the prosecution case was based on his alleged sexual 
motives and on evidence indicating the children died before the 
time hendricks said he left the house 
after hendricks was convicted circuit judge richard baner 
denied the states request to impose a death sentence saying he 
did not personally believe hendricks had been proved guilty beyond 
a reasonable doubt 
last august in a brief filed with the supreme court hendricks 
asserted that his former brotherinlaw jon lewis committed the 
crimes lewis denied it prosecutors said lewis was ruled out as a 
suspect because he passed a liedetector test which hendricks 
refused

nelson mandela said tuesday night it is very 
likely the armed struggle of the african national congress in south 
africa will be over by the end of this year 
speaking on the british broadcasting corps newsnight 
television program the anc leader said he had discussed the issue 
with south africas president fw de klerk 
we have agreed on the removal of the obstacles to 
negotiations and i have no doubt that in our second meeting we 
will achieve this mandela said 
mandela said a ceasefire in the armed struggle was very 
likely to occur by the years end 
de klerk and western leaders including president bush and 
british prime minister margaret thatcher have urged the anc to 
give up violence the ancs armed campaign has been largely dormant 
in the past year but anc leaders said they could not end it until 
police and troops quit firing on unarmed black protesters 
mandela and other black leaders plan to meet with south african 
officials on his return from a 14nation world tour 
earlier tuesday mandela struggled to untangle himself from the 
northern ireland conflict and focus attention on britains 
opposition to sanctions against south africa 
he denied having called on britain to negotiate with the irish 
republican army insisting he was just expressing his belief that 
all conflicts should be settled peacefully british officials have 
refused to hold talks with the ira saying it is a terrorist group 
mandelas replies to questions on the ira at a dublin news 
conference on monday made frontpage headlines and continued to dog 
him at meetings tuesday with members of parliament and foreign 
secretary douglas hurd 
hurd said mandela the deputy president of the anc cleared up 
the position as far as he was concerned 
i expressed the strong feelings of everyone here that the ira 
are rejects of the political system he said having failed to 
persuade people in free elections they turn to murder and 
destruction 
britain is promoting negotiations between the main protestant 
and catholic parties of northern ireland and has suggested the ira 
can be drawn in if it disavows violence 
the ira has waged a campaign of bombings and shootings in an 
effort to force british troops out of northern ireland the ira 
wants to unite northern ireland with the irish republic and set up 
a socialist state 
mrs thatcher who narrowly escaped an ira bomb in 1984 was 
expected to reiterate britains position when she meets mandela on 
wednesday 
even before the ira issue arose britain was already expected to 
be the most difficult stop on mandelas world tour 
mrs thatcher openly opposes sanctions against south africa and 
wants those imposed by the european community relaxed as a reward 
for president fw de klerks reform program mandela insists the 
anc alone should decide when sanctions can be lifted 
but their talks signify the aboutface in british policy since 
1987 when mrs thatcher branded the anc a typical terrorist 
organization and said she wouldnt talk to it 
mandela said the possibility is always there that his talks 
with mrs thatcher might narrow their differences 
mandela 71 arrived from dublin the irish capital nursing a 
severe cold and canceled some of the engagements on his twoday 
london schedule 
meeting 200 members of parliament assembled by the allparty 
southern africa committee mandela insisted he was not trying to 
interfere in the northern ireland conflict 
i expressed no opinion whatsoever on the actual conflict 
between the ira and the british government mandela insisted 
what i said was to point out that our approach as the anc is 
that all conflicts wherever in the world they are from should be 
settled peacefully he said 
in dublin when asked about the ira mandela replied what we 
would like to see is that the british government and the ira should 
adopt precisely the line that we have taken in regard to our own 
internal situation 
there is nothing better than opponents sitting down to resolve 
their problems in a peaceful manner 
the controversy was one of the few jarring notes on mandelas 
otherwise triumphant trip to urge continued international pressure 
to end apartheid in south africa 
mandela was freed from prison in february he had been jailed 
since 1962 and was serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow the government

tuesday as saying that some of the 300 inmates held in southern 
lebanon may be freed soon a key demand of shiite moslem factions 
holding western hostages 
voice of the south a radio station controlled by the 
israelibacked south lebanon army militia said the remark was made 
by brig gen zeev zakharin it identified him as an officer in 
israels north front command 
a military source in tel aviv identified zakharin as chief 
liaison to lebanon 
the source who requested anonymity said what is under 
consideration is a traditional release of inmates on the 
occasion of islams holiday of eid aladha the source would give 
no other details 
the radio said zakharin toured israels selfdesignated 
security zone with maj gen antoine lahd a retired lebanese 
army officer who heads the 3000strong south lebanese army 
the broadcast added that zakharin met on his tour with 
lebanese notables 
he told them israel would soon consider the issue of the inmates 
at the khiyam prison located in the security zone and possibly 
release some of them the broadcast said it gave no other 
details 
israeli leaders have previously insisted that any deal involving 
the release of the prisoners at khiyam must include the release of 
three israeli servicemen captured by shiite groups in south lebanon 
proiranian fundamentalists holding most of the 16 western 
hostages have for their part demanded the khiyam prisoners be 
released before any of the western hostages are let go 
the hostages include six americans the longestheld is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the khiyam inmates are being held on suspicion of supporting 
guerrillas seeking to oust the israelis from lebanon they were 
captured in sweeps after israel carved out the 440squaremile 
security zone in 1985 israel said it took the land to guard 
against crossborder guerrilla raids 
the strip is policed jointly by the sla and 1000 israeli troops 
iranian officials demanded a goodwill gesture from the 
united states after mediating the release in april of two american 
hostages robert polhill and frank reed 
tehran said it would work for the release of others if the 
united states and western governments pressured israel to free the 
khiyam inmates 
in hamburg west germany stern magazine on tuesday quoted 
lebanese shiite leader hussein musawi as saying the time was not 
right to free any of the six americans but that west german 
hostages heinrich struebig and thomas kemptner could be released at 
once if two shiites imprisoned in west germany are freed 
musawis islamic amal organization is a prosyrian group within 
the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god hezbollah is 
believed to be the umbrella for extremist groups holding most of 
the missing westerners 
stern quoted musawi as saying struebig and kemptner missing 
since may 16 1989 are being held by members of the hamadi family 
in beirut 
mohammed ali hamadi is serving a life sentence for hijacking a 
twa airliner in june 1985 and killing a us sailor on the plane 
his older brother abbas is serving 13 years for kidnapping two 
west germans in january 1987 to gain mohammeds release 
kidnapping is our means to practice retaliation against the 
aggression of the israelis and the americans stern quoted musawi 
as saying 
the magazine also quoted him as saying terrorist attacks and 
kidnappings carried out against israel and western countries were 
intended to defend palestinian territory

president ion iliescu declared his 
support tuesday for the governments radical economic reform 
program but said introducing a market economy will pose a 
difficult challenge 
iliescu made his remarks during a ceremony at which he 
officially confirmed the appointments of prime minister petre 
romans new 23member cabinet 
he made his first public statement in support of the economic 
reform program that roman outlined to parliament last week at the 
time parliament declared its backing for the program and romans 
cabinet nominees 
iliescus national salvation front which has dominated the 
government since the december revolution that toppled communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu handily won the may 20 elections on a 
platform that promised a slower pace of change that would avoid 
economic upheaval 
in his speech to parliament last week roman said that only 
radical reforms aimed at transforming the centrally planned 
socialist system to a market economy could overcome the countrys 
economicy crisis while avoiding specifics roman pledged to 
present an initial package of reforms to parliament within six 
months 
iliescu told the new ministers that all social groups and 
political forces cannot but adhere to such a program 
but he warned that the transition from a supercentralized 
structure toward a market economy based on natural forces 
will be a difficult task 
to govern under the present conditions of our country and 
remove it from the profound economic and spiritual crisis will not 
be easy iliescu said 
unlike roman iliescu stressed in his speech that the reforms 
must be accompanied by a wideranging social protection program 
the ceremony which was attended by romanian journalists but 
closed to the foreign press was held at iliescus new headquarters 
at cotroceni palace the former headquarters of the scout movement 
last week roman blamed the foreign press for distorting the 
events of june 1315 when security forces broke up a 53day 
opposition demonstration that had blocked bucharests main downtown 
square 
roman said romanias image had been inadmissibly damaged by 
the reporting on the disturbances in the capital that left six 
people dead 
the foreign ministry on tuesday issued a protest to hungary for 
its official criticism of the violence 
the ministry said the hungarians were only considering the 
events of june 1415 when thousands of miners responded to a 
government appeal for support and beat up students and other 
government opponents in bucharest 
it said the hungarians were knowingly forgetting the events 
of june 13 when demonstrators attacked several government buildings 
after security forces broke up the demonstration on university 
square 
the united states reacted to the governments role in the 
violence by suspending all nonhumanitarian aid to romania 
on tuesday iliescu sent president bush a message for the fourth 
of july expressing the hope that relations between the two 
countries develop along new lines in a spirit of faith and mutual 
respect 
in bucharest various student groups concluded a twoday 
congress with an appeal to the government to release jailed student 
leader marian munteanu 
munteanu the president of the bucharest university student 
league was an organizer of antigovernment demonstrations he was 
among those beaten by miners and was arrested from his hospital bed 
in their appeal the students said munteanu had become a 
symbol of the nonviolence of the student movement for democracy 
and liberty

a jury acquitted a young white man tuesday of 
intentionally murdering a black teenager in a racial attack in 
bensonhurst but the jury failed to resolve a second murder count 
and a riot charge against him 
the jury in its ninth day of deliberations convicted john 
vento of two counts of unlawful imprisonment and four counts of 
menacing for his role in the attack that inflamed racial passions 
in new york city 
two other young whites have been convicted in the assault on 
16yearold yusuf hawkins who was shot to death aug 23 hawkins 
had come to the predominantly white brooklyn neighborhood to buy a 
used car 
vento who reneged on an immunity deal to testify against his 
codefendants faces a september retrial on the unresolved charges 
including a charge of murder by depraved indifference prosecutors 
said 
he could be sentenced to a year and four months to four years on 
the unlawful imprisonment counts and 90 days on each menacing 
count the sentencing will be aug 14 
the 21yearold sat silently flashing an occasional tight 
smile as the verdicts were read he was acquitted of intentional 
murder a weapons possession charge one count of unlawful 
imprisonment and five counts of discrimination 
theres a difference between racism which is not illegal and 
discrimination which is said juror lee levin 
levin one of the two holdouts for a murder conviction said 
that the disagreement on that count was over ventos mental 
culpability 
juror irwin ziegler said the deliberations were not very nice 
it was very tense very emotional a lot of yelling and 
screaming 
vento was the trial defendant to be tried in the attack five 
other brooklyn youths face trial in the case 
joseph fama 19 identified by vento as the triggerman was 
convicted of murder in the first trial and sentenced to 32 and 
twothirds years to life keith mondello 19 received five and 
onethird to 16 years for his convictions on lesser charges 
last friday the mothers of vento and hawkins had an emotional 
meeting at the courthouse in which maria vento offered condolences 
to diane hawkins new york newsday reported tuesday 
the families would not discuss with reporters details of the 
private meeting but hawkins father moses stewart said it was 
the beginning of the healing process between blacks and whites 
in new york 
that doesnt take any guilt away from their son but we have a 
mother who understands what its like to have a son whos been 
murdered stewart said gesturing toward the vento family we 
have a mother who knows what its like to have a son on trial for 
murder he added motioning toward diane hawkins 
vento fled upstate the day after hawkins murder but later

attorneys for a woman who will get 375 
million from a chemical company after claiming their detergent 
caused her leukemia say the detergent may also have harmed hundreds 
of others 
fawna wright 23 of mound city ill reached the settlement 
with basf wyandotte corp of michigan on monday the day a civil 
trial was to start 
wrights 1985 lawsuit claimed her illness was linked to exposure 
to toxic chemicals in loxene a detergent once produced by basf and 
used to launder diapers and bed linens at booth memorial hospital 
here where she was born in 1967 
wyandotte continued to manufacture loxene despite repeated 
warnings of its potential danger and continued to market it to 
hospitals after it had twice promised the usda that it would not 
one of wrights lawyers robert bogard said monday 
therefore we now have hundreds of persons exposed at booth or 
other hospitals using loxene during the 1960s who may be suffering 
from problems ranging from learning disabilities to cancer and 
they dont even suspect that their illnesses are linked to the 
diapers they wore in the hospital 
wright whose leukemia is in remission and who plans to attend 
nursing school in the fall said she hoped the settlement would 
send a message to chemical companies to be more responsible 
i want this to reach to this chemical company and shake them 
up a bit to make them realize that they are negligent she said 
i can never go back to 12 and start all over again 
wrights lawsuit centered on two chemicals in loxene a 
pesticide known as trichlorocarbonilide or tcc and 
pentachlorophenol a substance known as penta that is more widely 
used as a pesticide and wood preservative 
despite being warned as early as 1955 that penta was unsafe 
because it caused skin irritations basf wyandotte then wyandotte 
chemical corp instructed booth hospital how to use loxene in 
final laundry rinses to kill mildew the lawsuit contended 
the salvation army which operated the nowdefunct booth 
hospital for unwed mothers previously agreed to pay wright 5000 
and dow chemical co settled for 60000 bogard said dow and 
monsanto co were accused because they manufactured penta and tcc 
monsanto was dropped as a defendant 
in a statement basf said it is not directly responsible for 
her wrights condition because the hospitals disregarded 
clearly stated use instructions and warnings 
wright became gravely ill when she was 5 days old but recovered 
and was later adopted her suit says often ill in early childhood 
at age 12 she was diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia an 
often fatal bone marrow cancer 
because of sealed records her lawyers said they were able to 
trace only eight other babies born at booth during the time the 
hospital used loxene the lawyers said those babies also became 
severely ill with high fevers and profuse sweating 
two died as infants and a third suffers from a learning 
disability the lawyers said in 1966 an outbreak of illnesses 
attributed to loxene at pembina county hospital in cavalier nd 
left one infant dead they said 
bogard said wyandotte chemical should have removed loxene from 
the market following the north dakota episode instead of waiting 
until the products registration was revoked more than a year later

the foreign ministers of iran and iraq on tuesday 
held their first direct talks since a ceasefire was declared in 
the persian gulf war nearly two years ago the un chief described 
the talks as a pschological breakthrough 
iraqs tariq aziz later described his hourlong meeting with 
irans ali akbar velayati as cordial and constructive 
the two sides agreed to the direct meeting at the un geneva 
headquarters after separate discussions with secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar monday night and tuesday 
perez de cuellar called tuesdays meeting very promising and 
an excellent omen for the success of future negotations to secure 
a lasting peace 
he told reporters no substantive issues were discussed but said 
the meetings friendly atmosphere marked a psychological 
breakthrough he said agreement by the two foreign ministers to 
talk directly was a clear sign that both governments want a 
resolution of their bitter conflict 
although both velayati and aziz were present in the four rounds 
of peace talks held since 1988 the two men did not speak directly 
to each other instead relaying their comments through perez de 
cuellar 
peace talks have been deadlocked ever since they started aug 
25 1988 just five days after a unsponsored ceasefire ended the 
eightyear persian gulf war 
perez de cuellar said contacts with both delegations were 
expected to continue this week both ministers were scheduled to 
leave geneva wednesday and no date for a next ministerial meeting 
was set 
the un chief said highly technical negotiations would follow 
and that he did not know whether the ministers would like to take 
part in these he also said he was considering a visit to the area 
but no time had been fixed 
the negotiations have bogged down in disputes over 
implementation of a resolution calling for a withdrawal to 
internationally recognized boundaries 
two particular sticking points are the continued presence of 
iraqi troops on 1000 square miles of iranian territory and the 
strategic shattalarab waterway on the southern border of the two 
countries 
tariq aziz said preparations were continuing for a proposed 
summit between presidents saddam hussein of iraq and hashemi 
rajsanjani of iran but no date had been fixed 
perez de cuellar said plans for a summit featured strongly in 
his constructive discussions with irans velayati late monday 
he said of tuesdays meeting the meeting was not supposed to 
be substantive it was intended to create a different atmosphere as 
compared with the previous atmosphere and from that point of view 
i am extremely pleased to have had the two foreign ministers 
together in a very friendly relaxed atmosphere 
he declined to speculate about when a final agreement might be 
reached saying very complex problems had to be resolved

the foreign minister said tuesday that 
soviet jews could begin next week to emigrate to israel via finland 
the operation would make finland the fourth major route for jews 
emigrating from the soviet union along with hungary romania and 
poland 
finnish and israeli officials confirmed plans last month to 
transfer thousands of soviet jews to israel through a small airport 
near the finnishsoviet border then the plans appeared to stall 
because israel refused to guarantee that the immigrants would not 
be settled in occupied territories 
israel last week said it would not settle soviet jews in the 
occupied west bank or gaza strip 
at a news conference after a special cabinet meeting finnish 
foreign minister pertti paasio said the government sees no 
obstacles to he transit of soviet jews to israel or any other 
country via finland i think the transfer could begin early next 
week 
paasio indicated tuesday that finland although now ready to go 
ahead with the transfer of soviet jews was still concerned about 
the issue 
israel has no right to settle its citizens in palestinian or 
arab territories occupied after 1967 paasio said 
he said finnish authorities would allow one transit flight a 
week until oct 24 and would give permission for flights in 
batches of four at a time each flight was expected to carry up to 
200 jews 
paasio said el al the israeli airline has applied to begin 
flights from finland 
he hinted that the flights could be stopped if israel did not 
follow its policy of not settling soviet jews in these 
areas 
the foreign minister said soviet jewish emigrants would be given 
finnish transit visas that could be extended if they want to 
change their plans and travel elsewhere than israel 
they can also settle in finland if they want to he said 
under the plan convoys of finnish buses will shuttle emigrants 
mainly from the leningrad area to lappeenranta a town with an 
airport 12 miles from the soviet border 
the finnish government is also continuing talks with soviet 
officials on direct flights from the soviet union to israel

the federal election commission wants to know 
whether us subsidiaries of foreign companies should be able to 
run political action committees in this country 
the commission voted 41 last thursday to instruct its general 
counsel to draft a list of questions on which public comment should 
be sought 
political action committees or pacs are organized by 
companies unions trade associations and interest groups of all 
kinds to solicit money from their members and give it to candidates 
contributions from such pacs long have been controversial 
federal election law bars citizens of foreign countries from making 
donations to congressional and presidential elections but foreign 
corporations with wholly owned american subsidiaries are allowed to 
have their subsidiaries establish pacs just like any other company 
soliciting from their employees who are american citizens 
critics contend that allows foreign interests to influence 
elections 
the proposal to seek public comment was offered by commissioner 
john mcgarry one of three democrat appointees to the panel the 
two other democrats and republican thomas josefiak voted to open 
the issue to comment but josefiak said his vote should not be 
taken as an indication he favored a ban on such pacs or any changes 
to existing laws just that he wanted to see what comments would 
come in 
observers of the fec believe the panel would split 33 if a 
commissioner sought an outright ban on such pacs but the 
commission believes it does not have that power and over the years 
has asked congress to deal with the issue 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas the democratic nominee for vice 
president in the 1988 election recently wrote a dear colleague 
letter suggesting it was time for congress to determine whether 
pacs of foreignowned us companies should be restricted or banned

the army found about a ton of dynamite 
that it said drug terrorists planned to use to blast part of the 
highway between bogota and medellin colombias two largest cities 
a general said tuesday 
elsewhere leftist guerrillas blew up a section of colombias 
main oil pipeline tuesday temporarily halting pumping of about 
230000 barrels a day the state oil company ecopetrol said 
the 2nd division discovered the dyamite along the highway about 
100 miles northwest of bogota division commander gen jose guzman 
said in a communique that narcosubversive elements planted the 
explosives with the intention of destroying a stretch of highway 
and civilian and military vehicles traveling on it 
in the past 11 months colombian drug lords have been blamed for 
killing more than 400 people including around 150 policemen in 
medellin 
rebels of the leftist national liberation army the eln used 
dynamite tuesday on the cano limon oil pipeline in northeast 
colombia 
a spokesman for ecopetrol said the bombing caused 4000 barrels 
of crude oil to spill out of the pipeline 
the eln colombias most active guerrilla group has bombed the 
pipeline scores of times since 1986 causing estimated losses of 
around 520 million it says it is trying to pressure the 
government to reduce the presence of foreign oil companies in 
colombia

an oil pipeline company tuesday proposed 
construction of a 500 million terminal and pipeline system to take 
oil through puget sound without tankers 
the proposal which revived a decadeold idea immediately met 
opposition from some environmentalists who fear moving oil through 
the sound by pipeline or tanker risks spills 
trans mountain pipe line co ltd of vancouver british 
columbia said it wants to build a terminal at low point on the 
strait of juan de fuca which runs between the united states and 
canada 
the company would lay two partly submerged parallel pipelines 
that would carry millions of barrels of crude oil about 80 miles to 
upper puget sound 
one of the proposed pipelines would carry oil coming in from 
alaska and asia for processing the other would meet an existing 
pipeline from the canadian province of alberta that carries crude 
oil bound for export 
trans mountains first hurdle will be convincing puget sound 
refiners british petroleum atlantic richfield texaco and shell 
oil to use the pipeline at a cost trans mountain estimates at 
about 40 cents a barrel more than the average cost of transporting 
the oil by tanker 
trans mountain president richard stokes said initial discussions 
have been encouraging arco and british petroleum spokesmen said 
they were willing to consider the proposal stokes said agreement 
would be needed in order to secure the 500 million needed for the 
project 
trans mountain also would need approval from the state energy 
facilities site evaluation council after a long public review 
process stokes said 
the announcement came several hours after the release of a 
report by a regional oilspill task force that recommends serious 
consideration of an offshore terminal and pipeline system to reduce 
the risk of oil spills in puget sound 
the statesbritish columbia task force said the risk of oil 
spills under current circumstances can only increase with expected 
rises in tanker traffic in the region 
crude oil shipments into puget sound which total about 161 
million barrels annually are expected to increase by 5 percent a 
year this decade the report said with accompanying increases in 
the traffic of refined oil 
shipments from canada to asian markets also are on the rise the 
task force said and can be expected to increase more than fivefold 
this decade 
gov booth gardner who would have the power to veto the 
pipeline project considers the proposal worthy of study said 
gubernatorial spokesman dick milne 
environmentalists dismissed it 
here we go again said jeff parsons a spokesman for the 
washington audubon society recalling the bitter fight a decide ago 
over a similar proposal that plan was ultimately junked by 
thengov john spellman in 1982 
parsons said neither pipelines nor tankers are good options for 
hauling oil in the sound 
the best option is to establish a national energy policy that 
severely reduces our reliance on oil he said the only way to 
really prevent spills is to leave oil in the ground 
the task force said a terminal and pipeline system combined 
with other spill preventative steps would reduce the threat of a 
large sound spill by 66 percent 
the proposed pipelines would run by land from the terminal about 
12 miles west of port angeles on the olympic peninsula to admiralty 
inlet 
from there the lines would run underwater to whidbey island in 
the sound cross the island then go underwater again until 
reaching the mainland near stanwood on the eastern side of the 
puget sound the lines then would run north to connect with an 
existing pipeline system at burlington

two maleonly eating clubs at princeton 
university must end a centuryold tradition of excluding women and 
open their doors to the opposite sex the states highest court 
ruled tuesday 
the state supreme court rejected arguments by the ivy club and 
the tiger inn that they were private entities separate from the ivy 
league university and not subject to the states 
antidiscrimination laws 
it would be disingenuous for the clubs to assert that they 
could ever exist apart from princeton university the 
sevenmember court said in a unanimous opinion the clubs gather 
their membership from princeton and in turn provide the service 
of feeding princeton students 
because of this the clubs lack the distinctly private nature 
that would exempt them from discrimination laws the court said 
the ruling stems from an 11yearold sex discrimination case 
brought by sally frank a former princeton student who is now a 
professor at new york law school in new york city 
im really thrilled ms frank said from washington dc 
im glad that the court decided to stop discrimination at 
princeton 
stockton williams 22 undergraduate president of tiger inn 
said the ruling would be appealed to the us supreme court 
we feel that all of the affairs of the club should be decided 
by the members including who we allow in williams said 
barbara strapp nelson a lawyer for the ivy club said the club 
strongly disagreed with the courts ruling which she said 
overlooked the constitutionally protected right of freedom of 
association 
i think this case has often been viewed as an emotional 
womens rights type of case whereas its really a case involving 
whether the government should be intervening in decisions made 
by individuals as to who they socialize with ms nelson said 
she said the ivy clubs governing board would examine its 
choices before deciding whether to appeal 
in 1979 ms frank sued the ivy club and the tiger inn the only 
two among the universitys 13 private eating clubs that exclude 
women princeton began admitting women in 1969 
most juniors and seniors pay membership fees to eat at the 
clubs housed near the princeton campus 
both clubs voted earlier this year to admit women but two more 
rounds of voting must be conducted next year before any can join 
it is undisputed that the clubs had a general policy that 
excluded females from consideration as members the court said 
it is also undisputed that the clubs applied this policy to 
frank when she tried to join 
attorneys for the two clubs maintained that as private entities 
they had the right to choose their membership 
but ms frank argued that the university has promoted the clubs 
in its publications and that princeton has relied on the clubs 
since they feed more than 75 percent of upperclass students 
tuesdays ruling upheld a 1987 decision by the new jersey 
division on civil rights which ordered the clubs to begin 
admitting women that decision was overturned by the appellate 
division of superior court which granted the clubs request for a 
new hearing because of procedural errors 
but the supreme court said the clubs already had been afforded 
their administrative due process and said it did not see any 
disputed facts 
ms frank had sued a third eating club but that club began 
admitting women in 1986 and settled with ms frank for 20000 
the university also was named in the lawsuit but settled in 
1986 paying ms frank 27500 in legal fees and pledging to 
dissociate itself from sexually segregated clubs 
under tuesdays ruling the two clubs must pay ms frank a total 
of 5000 plus legal fees to be determined by the court

the government has declared a strike 
by government employees illegal and said tuesday the walkout had 
attracted little support among the countrys 100000 public workers 
leaders of the prosandinista national workers front called the 
strike on monday to protest firings and demand a say in national 
economic policy a role the union contends it is guaranteed by the 
constitution 
government officials said that as of tuesday only about 800 
employees in three ministries were on strike at the managua 
mayors office 1200 workers who had joined the walkout on monday 
reached an agreement with the mayor and returned to work tuesday 
union officials however gave vastly different figures 
lucio jimenez leader of the sandinista workers center another 
union federation called the strike a full success and said a 
total of 42000 employees had stayed away from their jobs in 
government ministries the customs service at managuas 
international airport and various stateowned industries 
including construction textile metalworking and beer plants 
an airport customs employee and workers at some of the 
stateowned companies including the milca bottling plant 
contradicted jimenez and said they were working normally 
telecommunications and postal workers stopped service including 
international telephone service for one hour tuesday in support of 
the strike service then returned to normal bus transportation 
electricity banking water or other services continued 
uninterrupted 
riot police and patrol cars cordoned off president violeta 
barrios de chamorros offices keeping away vehicles and 
pedestrians and police were on duty outside state offices to 
guarantee entry for the public and employees who wanted to work 
labor minister francisco rosales declared the strike illegal 
late monday saying it was strictly political and aimed at 
sabotaging the recovery program 
the national workers front has sought an injunction from the 
appeals court against the decree and protested the banning of 
pickets by the interior ministry 
if the court agrees that the strike is illegal the government 
can fire strikers outright something it would like to do to trim 
the bureaucracy 
the governments economic plans include returning most 
stateowned companies to the private sector and reorganizing the 
government both moves expected to involve job cutbacks 
the strike differs sharply from a walkout by 65000 government 
employees in may that paralyzed activity across the country 
including international flights and telephone service 
in may the demands focused on salary increases and a sandinista 
law protecting government workers jobs and benefits that strike 
ended after the unions won 100 percent pay hikes and a promise that 
the government would not retaliate a provision union leaders say 
has been violated 
the chamorro government they say has fired more than 800 
employees most of them sandinistas since it took office april 25 
two months after winning general elections 
the new government views the current walkout as a move by the 
sandinistas to assert themselves as an opposition power 
while most government employees are holdovers from the previous 
government many would rather try to hold onto their jobs than give 
open support to the sandinistas 
very few are going to support the strike because no one wants 
to risk being fired said a telephone operator at the 
construction and transportation ministry who asked not to be 
identified 
unemployment is officially estimated at 34 percent of the work 
force of 12 million with the end of the nineyear war by 
usbacked contra rebels against the sandinistas the number of 
jobless is growing

a dozen airplanes crashed in alaska 
over a 30hour period ending tuesday killing two people causing 
tens of thousands of dollars in damage and overwhelming 
investigators 
weve had so many crashes in the past two days its 
awesome said jim michelangelo a spokesman for the national 
transportation safety board here call me next month and well 
have them analyzed and we may know the causes 
pilot error mechanical problems bad weather impatient 
passengers and pilot unfamiliarity with terrain and weather are 
most commonly cited as the cause of alaskas airplane accidents 
since june 1 35 airplanes have crashed in alaska ten people 
have died in four separate accidents michelangelo said five were 
killed in a june 25 crash of a cessna 207 on what was to have been 
an 80minute sightseeing trip out of seward 
ten of the accidents involved airtaxi operators 25 involved 
private aircraft michelangelo said 
there are 219 airtaxi operators in alaska and more than 9000 
private airplanes and registered pilots said paul steucke 
spokesman for the federal aviation administration here 
that translates into about eight times as many pilots per capita 
and 15 times as many aircraft per capita as the rest of the 
united states the faa says 
most pilots and airtaxi operators in alaska are conscientious 
about safety and do a good job steucke said he said their clients 
sometimes unwittingly play a role in accidents by pressuring pilots 
to take risks 
tourists typically are on a tight schedule and sometimes 
reluctant to wait out bad weather he said 
sometimes they go down the street looking for another carrier 
after one pilot tells them its too dangerous to fly he said 
there were a dozen crashes within 30 hours starting sunday 
evening and ending early tuesday 
in the only fatal wreck the private pilots lack of familiarity 
with local wind patterns may have contributed to a crash at iliamna 
lake sunday that killed two people said bob cusack a lodge owner 
who helped rescue the four survivors 
cusack a guide and pilot himself said gusty winds that evening 
had dissuaded him from flying some clients back to anchorage about 
200 miles away

many women over 50 years old dont get mammograms 
because they mistakenly think they dont need them according to an 
american medical association study released tuesday 
the study found that while more than 90 percent of the women 
polled in various surveys visited a doctor regularly just 25 
percent to 41 percent received xray breast examinations during the 
previous year 
most of the women who didnt receive a mammography said they 
skipped the breast cancer screening procedure because they didnt 
think it was necessary or because they didnt have any breast 
problems the study found the nextlargest group said their 
doctors never recommended the examination 
this relatively low utilization of breast cancer screening may 
help to explain why breast cancer mortality rates have not declined 
over the past three decades the report says 
the american cancer society recommends women have one mammogram 
between the ages of 35 and 39 one every to two years between 40 
and 49 and one annually after that 
the national cancer institute and the national health interview 
survey interviewed 7011 women from 50 to 74 years old across the 
country in different studies between 1987 and 1989 the combined 
results were reported in this weeks edition of the journal of the 
american medical association 
lesseducated and poorer women were even less likely to receive 
breast cancer screenings the survey found 
doctors are hesitant to recommend the procedure because they 
feel patients are reluctant to get mammograms or will object to the 
costs the study indicated but few women surveyed said they failed 
to get one because of the cost or because of radiation fears

israels ambassador to egypt shimon shamir 
announced his resignation tuesday over policy differences with the 
rightwing government formed last month 
there is too wide a gap between my views and that of the new 
government his letter of resignation letter said according to 
israel radio 
shamir said on the radio his action had nothing to do with the 
stalemated middle east peace process in which egypt has tried to 
mediate between israel and the palestinians

installed it is a question of my overall world view compared to 
the overall platform of the existing government he said

peace treaty was signed in 1979 and the first to quit because of 
political disagreement 
shamir was named to the post in august 1988 by thenforeign

a new government led by prime minister yitzhak shamir no

likudlabor coalition collapsed in march over differences on peace 
moves 
the haaretz daily noted that since the new government took 
office friction had emerged between the ambassador and a top 
political aide to prime minister shamir over the governments 
harder line in diplomatic contacts with egypt 
ambassador shamir said he would stay on until a replacement is 
found but planned to return to his research and lecturing job at

the rockets red glare burst through the air 
tuesday night in pittsburgh where the fourth of july fell on july 
3 as tradition took a back seat to the budget 
it was calculated the move would cut down on police overtime and 
save the city 20000 
its all part of what it shaping up to be an entire week of july 
fourths across the united states as people accommodate themselves 
to a holiday that officially falls smack in the middle of the week 
george zambelli jr a vice president of zambelli fireworks 
internationale of new castle penn sees a trend 
people are thinking of the fourth of july in terms of three to 
four days before and three to four days after zambelli said in a 
telephone interview from portland maine to me its immaterial 
what day its on i love fireworks 
he would have loved the celebration of the century in boise 
idaho which at least had the benefit of historical accuracy 
tuesdays celebration had nothing to do with the nations 
independence it was to celebrate idahos centennial as a state 
this is as close as boise can get to mardi gras idaho 
supreme court justice larry boyle said as the celebration got under 
way idaho was admitted to the union on july 3 1890 
the events included picnics at four boise city parks a 
motorcade of vintage cars a 43cannon salute a jet flyover a 
huge birthday cake and fireworks 
the zambellis didnt produce the idaho celebration but they had 
their hands full elsewhere on monday they presented fireworks at 
detroits international freedom festival on tuesday they were 
scheduled to present pittsburghs show and a performance for 
president bush at his vacation home in kennebunkport maine 
they were scheduled to produce shows wednesday in philadelphia 
and thursday in washington dc 
philadelphia the birthplace of the declaration of independence 
had an especially elaborate celebration planned for wednesday it 
was to begin with the presentation of the second annual 
philadelphia liberty medal to former president carter 
later carter was to join philadelphia mayor w wilson goode in 
cutting americas birthday cake which is big enough to serve 
25000 people 
other events include the liberty to liberty triathlon the 
great american liberty parade and a concert at the philadelphia 
museum of art 
and of course fireworks 
two of the more unusual july fourth events involve flagburning

us and mexican divers joined forces tuesday 
to try to uncover historical treasures from a us navy brig that 
sank off the coast of veracruz during the mexican war 
the navy brig somers already holds a place in literary history 
on an 1842 trip to africa its captain hanged three navy trainees 
suspected of planning a mutiny author herman melville based his 
novella billy budd foretopman on the incident 
in 1846 the twomasted wooden sailing ship sank during a squall 
while helping blockade the port of veracruz during the war between 
mexico and the united states 
san francisco underwater explorer george belcher discovered the 
somers wellpreserved remains in june 1986 about five miles off 
the coast of veracruz the ship was partly buried in sand about 110 
feet underwater belcher said 
its literally a time capsule from its period belcher said 
in a telephone interview from veracruz it has everything a us 
warship in 1846 would have had on it 
on a previous dive to the wreck belcher said he found swords 
pistols crystal wine glasses and bottles and at least six of the 
ships 10 cannons 
on tuesday a mexican navy patrol boat carrying a 14member 
usmexican exploration team headed to the site of the wreck in 
the gulf of mexico 
this is the first time that the us and mexican governments 
have conducted an investigation of a sunken ship together said 
mexican adm florencio aguilar contacted by telephone in veracruz 
belcher and his brother joel are guiding the team that includes 
representatives from the mexican navy mexicos national 
anthropology and archeology institute and the us national park 
service 
team members said they plan to spend six days mapping drawing 
and photographing the wreck but will not remove any artifacts at 
this point 
another dive is planned for may and exploration could last for 
years belcher said he is producing a documentary film of the 
exploration 
the discovery of the wreck set off a claims dispute between 
mexican and us authorities but both sides eventually agreed to 
the joint exploration 
the mexican government claims the wreck is the property of 
mexico and constitutes spoils of war 
the wreck is protected under a federal law covering 
archeological and historical areas and monuments said daniel 
nahmad director of the veracruz regional anthropology and 
archeology institute 
it is in national waters but the united states considers it a 
war grave thats more or less the argument nahmad said 
thirtytwo us sailors went down with the ship said james 
delgado the us national park services chief maritime historian 
who is a member of the exploration team 
a bill is before us senate that calls for bilateral 
negotiations to allow the united states to take possession of any 
artifacts and human remains found on the somers 
both sides agreed to the joint exploration project nov 28 
belcher said 
at this point the artifacts certainly belong to the mexican 
government belcher said it is hoped that at some point they 
might be loaned to the us government 
the mexican government is in charge of the exploration and the 
national park service is representing the us government because 
it is the only government branch that has an underwater archeology 
team delgado said 
the mexican war began in 1846 and was sparked by the us 
annexation of texas us troops led by gen zachary taylor invaded 
mexico and captured veracruz in march 1847 and mexico city in 
september 1847 the war ended with the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo 
in 1848 in which mexico ceded twofifths of its territory to the 
united states including most of the present southwestern states

attic and destroyed the building which houses cells a cafeteria 
and a classroom

assistant fire chief anthony petrucelli who declared the east wing 
a total loss 
the bridgeport correctional center houses minimum medium and 
maximum security prisoners the east wing was a mediumsecurity 
area

jack kemp the us housing and urban development 
secretary called the united states hypocritical on tuesday for 
promoting democratic market economies in other countries while 
ignoring its own inner cities 
he told a meeting of the american chamber of commerce in london 
that economic opportunities must be available for all us 
citizens adding 
currently it is more attractive for many citizens in the 
inner cities to take what is on offer from the welfare system than 
work and we must change this 
the secretary said it is slightly hypocritical for the united 
states to tell the world that democratic capitalist economics can 
work when it can not even introduce capitalist economics to its own 
inner cities 
kemp predicted that east germany will prove to be an economic 
showpiece 
east germany will i believe be the laboratory which proves 
to the soviet union and the rest of the communist world that sound 
market economies approved and trusted by the people through 
democratic processes is the real way forward 
the former republican presidential candidate said it was up to 
western governments to assist the worlds burgeoning democracies 
the point is not who has won but that it has been the victory 
of ideas over armed might he said 
what the revolution in eastern europe is proving is that 
socialism and communism have failed it is now up to us in the west 
to prove that democracy and market forces are a morally profitable 
alternative that can deliver materially the opportunities for 
wealth creation and prosperty 
later kemp toured the london docklands a large office and 
housing development in eastern london 
kemp arrived tuesday and will be in london for the nato summit 
scheduled for thursday and friday said mara papatheodorou at the 
american chamber of commerce

un troops have demobilized 21863 
nicaraguan contras a number far higher than the estimated 
strength of the rebel force and collected 17883 weapons from 
them 
in a report released monday un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar said united nations peacekeeping troops completed the 
demobilization of all but about 70 contras by thursday 
the remaining rebels were believed to have been demobilized 
since 
the report refers to both armed and unarmed rebels including 
wounded and excombatants it does not say whether family members 
were included in the figure of 21863 which seems high 
but judging by the number of rebels the report says had been 
armed 16388 it appears most of those demobilized were 
combatants 
the usbacked rebels were thought to have about 11000 
combatants and an undetermined number of support personnel in the 
last years of their war against the leftist sandinista government 
the war ended after the sandinistas were voted out of office in 
february ending their 10year rule of the central american nation 
un troops in both nicaragua and honduras where the contras 
had been based photographed the rebels then collected and 
destroyed their weapons under an agreement reached in april between 
the sandinistas the governmentelect and the rebels 
president violeta barrios de chamorro whose usbacked 
coalition won the february elections took office later that month 
unarmed rebels who were demobilized provided proof from their 
commanders that they had fought in the resistance such 
documentation was required for their demobilization and 
resettlement aid 
the un report said 2607 rebels were demobilized in four 
locations in honduras including 2390 who were unarmed and 217 who 
had weapons 
in nicaragua 19256 were demobilized in 10 locations including 
16171 who were armed and 3085 who had no weapons 
the list of weapons totaled 17883 including 112 sam7 and 
redeye missiles 14920 small arms 4 heavy machine guns 134 
mortars 1265 grenade launchers 1310 grenades and 138 mines the 
un report said 
the rebels had for many years maintained base camps in honduras 
which borders nicaragua to the north

the world bank has opened its first 
permanent office in eastern europe and also granted poland a 250 
million loan for development of natural gas resources and energy 
conservation 
at mondays opening world bank vice president will wapenhans 
lauded the economic stabilization accomplished by postcommunist 
polands shock reform plan but urged even more rapid steps 
toward creating a market economy 
the world bank has loaned poland 781 million for five projects 
since lending to the country resumed in january officials say 
about 2 billion more in loans are envisioned during the next two 
fiscal years 
the new loan is to help wean poland from its dependence on 
inefficient and environmentally damaging coal 
the world bank mission in warsaw will provide advice technical 
assistance and financial services for polands economic overhaul 
proposed terms for a 300 million structural adjustment 
loan representing world bank endorsement of polands plan for 
shifting from centrallyplanned socialism to marketdriven 
capitalism are being reviewed by the government 
the loan is to be used to assist poland in reorganizing its debt 
to the west now estimated at 422 billion approval by the world 
bank directors is expected by fall officials say 
whether we will be able to continue this level of lending 
operations is dependent on poland being able to support and 
implement a debt management strategy that will return it to a 
reasonable level of creditworthiness wapenhans said 
the accomplishments of the first phase of the economic reform 
including the curbing of runaway inflation are impressive 
wapenhans said 
but he said the accompanying very severe contraction of the 
economy including a 40 percent drop in real incomes and declining 
industrial output leads the world bank to hope for even more 
rapid implementation of parts of the plan 
in the second phase of reforms a key step is continuing to 
strip away artificial pricing structures that were a hallmark of 
the highly subsidized socialist economy 
the energy development loan calls for increasing domestic 
natural gas supplies by about 20 percent said mieczyslaw 
kaczmarczyk director of the energy enterprise being supported by 
the loan 
he said longterm negligence had retarded development of gas 
and other clean energy resources noting that poland produced more 
natural gas in the 1970s than it does now 
coal has traditionally been a key source of foreign export 
income for poland which has sent most of its lowsulfur coal 
abroad and used the remainder at home resulting in a dramatic air 
pollution problem 
the washingtonbased world bank is supported by more than 150 
countries poland rejoined in june 1986

just when teacher union chief albert shanker was 
starting to sound like a mellowed elder statesman the old 
firebrand reemerged with an attack on school boards and 
administrators he accuses of impeding reform 
in his opening address monday before 3200 delegates at the 
american federation of teachers annual convention shanker 
virtually declared an end to the decadesold feud with the national 
education association 
the two teacher unions are finally cooperating seeing 
eyetoeye on most key issues he said though officials of both 
unions hastened to add that merger is at best a distant dream 
moments later the president of the 744000member aft once 
considered so feisty that woody allen portrayed him as the cause of 
world war iii in the film sleeper told reporters that school 
boards and administrators have failed to act on reform despite his 
unions flexibility 
insisting he was not trying to hurt or destroy school 
leaders he said what im shocked about is theyre not acting 
like intelligent managers 
unless reform proceeds more quickly shanker warned the public 
will turn to more drastic schemes like giving parents the right to 
use tax dollars to send their kids wherever they want including 
private school 
such a plan already is in place in milwaukee he pointed out 
those were just his opening shots shanker indicated hed have 
more to say on wednesday in an address to the convention 
national school boards association executive director thomas 
shannon replied by calling shanker myopic and forgetful 
one of the biggest obstacles to change is collective 
bargaining contracts you cant always just change things said 
shannon reached by telephone at his washington office 
we have no doubt about the sincerity of al shanker said 
gary marx spokesman for the american association of school 
administrators and he should have no doubt about our commitment 
to better schools 
the aft gathering runs through thursday more than 8000 
delegates of the 2millionmember nea will meet in kansas city 
thursday through sunday 
in another development the aft released a survey showing 
average teacher pay in the united states up 57 percent to 31315 
alaska was tops with an average salary of 43097 south dakota

a pair of graduate students from iran 
stood next to an earthquake relief booth outside the main gates of 
penn state university and waited and waited and waited 
they discovered that despite a history of compassion many 
americans arent willing to help a country they link to 
hostagetaking and terrorism 
many people have the feeling that they should not help iran 
said mohammad sadaghiani president of the schools iranianmuslim 
student association 
the project director for one relief group that has delivered 
goods to iranian quake victims calls that attitude embarrassing 
its saddening its a shame said doyt conn from americares 
of new canaan conn 
the american red cross said monday that contributions to an 
iranian earthquake fund are far below the amounts raised after 
temblors in san francisco mexico and soviet armenia 
many americans will contribute but there are a large number 
who will say let them take that or let them call on khomeini 
to take care of that which will be hard for him to do from the 
grave said roy austin an associate professor of sociology at 
penn state 
the iranian earthquake occurred june 21 it measured between 73 
and 77 on the richter scale of ground movement and killed between 
40000 and 60000 people 
the iranian temblor was stronger than either last octobers 
northern california earthquake which measured 71 on the richter 
scale or the 69 quake that killed 25000 in armenia in december 
1988 
every increase of one on the richter scale indicates a quake 
that is 10 times stronger 
in the 1 weeks after the armenia quake the red cross received 
more than 3 million for relief efforts said jim cassell an 
agency spokesman in washington dc as of monday the relief group 
had received 376410 or about a tenth of the armenian figure 
for the iranian effort he said 
cassell said after each recent earthquake relief was dependent 
upon how the news media reported the disasters 
is it at the level of armenia no but was armenia at the 
level of mexico no was mexico at the level of san francisco 
no cassell said if the story gets buried the contributions 
subside 
the san francisco quake occurred while millions were watching 
the 1989 world series on national television for days it was 
featured prominently in the nations newspapers the armenian quake 
occurred during the holiday season a natural time for giving 
the iranian quake already has been knocked from page 1 by 
stories on german reunification and president bushs relaxing of 
his no new taxes stand if it was another country the news 
wouldnt be diminished as quickly sadaghiani said last week 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani on monday thanked 98 
countries for assistance but left out the united states which the 
state department says has given 760000 in aid from government and 
private sources he also ignored relief efforts by iraq and saudi 
arabia 
its unfortunate that people dont forget these things during 
times of disaster but human beings are vengeful he said 
iranians stormed the us embassy in tehran in november 1979 
and held 52 americans for 444 days also american officials blamed 
irans late religious leader ayatollah khomeini for morerecent 
terrorism and hostagetaking 
the united states has not settled its accounts with iran 
austin said it will be a while before people feel like 
establishing any kind of normal relationship with iran 
at the penn state donation booths which will be open until the 
independence day break americans and foreigners were giving but 
foreigners gave more per person said nader tabatabaee an iranian 
penn state student 
the bulk of contributions flowing through the americares group 
were from corporations or cities that have needed assistance in the 
past its officials said 
the communities of charleston south carolina and charlotte 
nc contacted us last week and asked if they could get 
involved said steve norman americares vice president the 
cities were hit by hurricane hugo last year 
the iranian embassy at the united nations also has lent its 
backing to a relief fund and is fielding calls generated by an 
advertisement monday in the new york times 
this is a purely humanitarian issue said amir zamani first 
secretary of the iranian mission to the un there are people who 
are in need of shelter and food humanity understands that as 
such

for three months imelda marcos suffered through 
daily ridicule bouts of illness and endless hours of courtroom 
testimony about her profligate spending 
after a federal court jury declared on monday that she was 
innocent of racketeering obstructing justice and mail fraud mrs 
marcos on her 61st birthday got down and walked the length of st 
patricks cathedral on her knees 
it was the sort of center stage drama mrs marcos relished 
during her years as the first lady of the philippines a woman who 
rose from obscure beginnings to call herself the mother of the 
nation and traveled among her people like a queen 
imelda remedios visitacion romualdez was born july 2 1929 to 
vicente romualdez a lawyer sometimes portrayed as from the poorer 
branch of one of the philippines most prominent families 
a beauty contest winner she became the wife of ferdinand 
marcos a brilliant lawyer and selfproclaimed world war ii hero 
when marcos was elected president in 1965 the couple were compared 
by an adoring world press to us president john f kennedy and his 
first lady jacqueline 
they had three children daughter imee now living in exile in 
morocco daughter irene and son ferdinand jr known as bong bong 
meanwhile benigno aquino jr who had been one of imeldas 
suitors married corazon cojuangco he was driven into exile in the 
united states by marcos and was murdered on his return in 1983 
although they emphatically denied it marcos and his wife were 
widely accused by filipino critics of ordering aquinos 
assassination and his death put in motion the events that drove 
marcos from power three years later 
in the 20 years that marcos served as president meldy was 
always at his side an inseparable part of the power structure that 
doled out favors and collected tribute 
marcos made her his envoy to the united nations and designated 
her presidential envoy plenipotentiary dispatching her on good 
will missions to the soviet union china and other countries 
she was credited by the promarcos media with negotiating oil 
deals and diplomatic settlements later as the appointed governor 
of metro manila she built hotels schools hospitals and a 
cultural center as minister of human settlements she tried to 
improve housing and services for the impoverished 
in an overwhelmingly roman catholic country of 62 million she 
practiced her religion publicly and for political effect 
she brought celebrities such as actor george hamilton into her 
inner circle traveled with a coterie of loyalists known as the 
blue ladies for their dress and threw frequent parties at 
which she invariably sang to her guests sometimes rendering songs 
that she wrote herself 
she became famous for spending sprees at boutiques department 
stores and jewelers during frequent trips to new york and travels 
elsewhere 
critics assailed her jetset life style while much of her 
country struggled in poverty she responded by insisting that the 
people admired her and drew hope from her example of a better 
life 
it all ended in ignominy in 1986 when after calling a spot 
election to cement his control and apparently losing to mrs aquino 
in balloting riddled by official fraud marcos was driven from 
power by a peoples revolution and fled to exile in hawaii 
left behind along with thousands of documents that would later 
be used to incriminate the marcoses in a vast web of corruption 
were imeldas shoes more than 1000 pairs closer to 3000 by 
some estimates 
the government accused her of helping to steal 222 million from 
her nations treasury and using the money to invest secretly in new 
york real estate and other items most of the prospective jurors 
interviewed for the trial said they knew little about her except 
that she had a lot of shoes 
in court she wore black mourning clothes for her husband who 
died last september one new york newspaper newsday printed a 
photo of her shoes every day of the trial 
twice she suffered attacks of high blood pressure interrupting 
the trial and prompting doctors to fit her with a special monitor 
another time she was hospitalized for four days after collapsing at 
the defense table vomiting blood from what was diagnosed as a 
stomach ailment 
on monday after three months enough testimony to fill nearly 
6000 pages of transcript and five days of deliberation the jury 
acquitted mrs marcos on all charges 
imelda marcos pronounced herself vindicated and went to 
church to pray but in victory she was denied the thing that she 
has professed to want most the right to go home and take her 
husbands body with her for burial 
a spokeswoman for the aquino government said it still considered 
imelda marcos a security threat and the official policy 
barring her return had not changed

the governments number mills are in trouble 
at a time when the us economy never has been more complex 
federal statisticians are losing the ability to track the changes 
the official statistics report that the nation is currently in 
the midst of a period of unsurpassed prosperity a peacetime 
record of 7 years without a recession 
but private economists say many of the statistics spewed by the 
government each month that purport to track the economy are 
seriously flawed some are so suspect that analysts ignore them in 
preparing forecasts rather than face embarrassment when the 
government totally revises its original report 
history is being rewritten on a monthly basis said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co it makes it very hard 
for private sector analysts and public policy makers to come to 
correct conclusions 
take the chagrin caused last year with the monthly report on 
retail sales the government first reported retail sales fell by 
01 percent in may 1989 only to discover belatedly that the survey 
had overlooked 14 billion in sales 
thus a small decline turned into a sizable 08 percent increase 
but the problem didnt stop there the initial erroneous report 
was picked up in the governments broadest measure of economic 
activity the gross national product which originally showed an 
anemic 17 percent growth rate during the spring 
after the error in retail sales was caught the gnp report was 
revised to show the economy growing at a much more respectable 25 
percent but the correction came too late to stop policy makers at 
the federal reserve from acting to cut interest rates for fear the 
economy was headed into recession 
a number of economists believe the fed has been forced to keep 
interest rates higher this year because of that mistaken easing in 
credit last year 
bad data triggers more than bad government policy 
millions of dollars can be lost in seconds on wall street based 
on investors jittery response to the latest report even though 
bad news one month might be revised to look significantly better a 
month later 
the consumer price index affects the pocketbook of virtually 
every american in a different way 
the cpi the governments most closely watched measure of 
inflation is used to adjust the monthly payments of 38 million 
social security beneficiaries 20 million food stamp recipients 
35 million federal retirees and at least 85 million workers 
covered by collective bargaining contracts that link wage increases 
to cpi increases 
even the amount of taxes we pay is affected because the cpi is 
used each year to adjust rates to prevent inflationinduced tax 
increases known as bracketcreep 
in studying government data everyone from the national academy 
of sciences to the national association of business economists has 
reached the same conclusion there are serious problems regarding 
the accuracy and usefulness of the statistics 
a survey last year of nabe members found 72 percent were unhappy 
with the quality of government data up from 61 percent the year 
before retail sales gnp and merchandise trade reports were 
identified as the worst offenders 
michael boskin chairman of the presidents council of economic 
advisers and head of an administration statistics task force 
exploring the issue said that deteriorating statistics partly 
reflect a more complex economy 
when we as a nation produced mostly things like steel and 
bushels of wheat output was easy to count boskin said tons 
of steel and bushels of wheat 
but today in an economy where 75 percent of the output is in 
service industries ranging from banks and hospitals to fastfood 
franchises and video rental outlets output is more difficult to 
measure 
how for example boskin asks do you assign a value to the 
increased output and productivity from an innovation such as 
24hour teller machines 
many economists however believe a complex economy is only 
partly to blame for the slump in data reliability in their view 
the bigger culprit was the reagan administration budget cuts 
forced staff reductions at the statistics agencies and cut into the 
research needed to keep sampling techniques current with a changing 
economy 
former commerce undersecretary robert ortner who oversaw the 
work at the census bureau and the bureau of economic analysis 
during the reagan administration says austere budgets during this 
time did have an effect 
because of the cutbacks we had to delay some things that we 
felt strongly we wanted to do said ortner who has written a 
book on economic policymaking during the reagan years titled 
voodoo deficits 
one of the delayed projects was an effort to modernize us 
statistics and make them more comparable to the economic 
bookkeeping done in other countries ortner said 
the unreliability of the data often is magnified when it comes 
to tracking economic activity in specific areas of the country in 
part because the government does not provide the money to gather 
large enough samples 
within the past decade we have had much greater diversity in 
regional performance than we have ever had before starting with 
the farm depression and the manufacturing depression in the early 
1980s and then the drop in oil prices which killed texas said 
ben laden a private economist who studied the statistics problem 
for nabe but the federal government is doing very little to 
track regional differences 
paul getman head of regional financial associates a private 
economic consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa agrees complaining 
that the government produces few statistics on regional economic 
activity on a timely basis 
it doesnt make a lot of sense to talk about national trends 
in housing real estate markets consumer spending and employment 
because regional growth patterns can be very different he said 
even the national statistics can mislead because of the huge 
revisions getman said 
you become very leery about using these numbers but they are 
all you have so you grasp at them and hope the government wont 
make a fool of you in the next 30 days he said 
the bush administration has sought money to strengthen the 
system of reporting economic statistics but congress turned down 
its request for 20 million in additional funds last year citing 
budget restraints caused by the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
the administration managed to salvage part of its rescue program 
by reshuffling available funds this year it came back with an 
even more ambitious request for 50 million to overhaul 25 
statistical areas 
michael darby who took ortners post as statistics chief at 
commerce said he hopes congress will deal more favorably with this 
years spending request 
everybody loses if we dont have good data and that results in 
policy errors which cause a recession he said that ruins the 
budget and ruins politicians reelection chances

wearing an i love peoria tshirt an 
illinois gold miner freed by colombian rebels after 61 days 
returned to the united states and his hometown monday he said his 
kidnappers had treated him with great respect 
scott heimdal 27 said earlier in miami that he was trying to 
find words to thank those in his hometown of peoria who helped his 
family raise the 60000 ransom they gave the communist peoples 
liberation army to win his release friday 
everybodys been so supportive even strangers people who 
dont know the family he said i owe a debt i probably will 
never be able to repay 
heimdal arrived at miami international airport with his mother 
marge they flew to chicago and then to peoria where they arrived 
around 930 pm 
its a great feeling to be back heimdal told a news 
conference in peoria 
he said that when his kidnappers released him after they 
received the ransom they wished him good luck 
heimdal said he had to convince his captors that his parents 
were not rich after the rebels demanded even more money at one 
point in latin america theres this conception that being from 
north america means youre rich he said 
heimdal said the kidnappers originally sought 12 million but 
he convinced them his family didnt have that kind of money 
he and his mother were greeted at the airport by about 100 
friends and relatives carrying welcomehome signs 
the crowd applauded as heimdal and his mother entered the 
terminal with peoria mayor jim maloof and his wife trudy 
outside the airport a blue van was decorated with 10 colorful 
balloons and signs saying welcome home scott and marge and 
peoria welcomes scott 
residents of peoria strangers and friends helped the family 
raise the ransom by holding bake sales and collecting donations 
among the peorians welcoming the heimdals back home was ruby 
curless who said she didnt know the family personally 
carrying a handpainted wooded sign saying god hears our 
prayers ms curless said members of her church grace 
presbyterian have really been praying for scott 
we dont know him but its wonderful hes coming home said 
jo frederick you never know when it could happen to you and your 
family 
a community gettogether is planned for saturday afternoon in 
peoria to celebrate heimdals freedom according to his sister 
angela 
in miami heimdal recounted how he was kidnapped april 28 in 
northeastern ecuador 
we were going down river in a 30foot indian dugout canoe when 
three men attacked us they killed the driver wounded the other 
guy and took me hostage they were looking to kidnap a north 
american heimdal said 
heimdal said he initially feared for his life he said he was 
often moved among remote jungle locations along the colombian 
border and guarded by up to 25 guerillas 
but as time went on it was obvious they had no intention of 
harming me heimdal said their mission was only to grab me and 
take me to where no one could find me i was always treated with 
great respect 
the kidnappers initially demanded 612000 from his employer 
the small goldmining company iminco 
mrs heimdal said the captors had demanded just 60000 from the 
family despite reports that the amount raised would fall short of 
that demanded 
it was strictly to finance their war against the colombian 
government heimdal said 
heimdals parents went to quito ecuador on june 18 and took 
over negotiations after iminco did not pay any ransom and failed to 
win his release an intermediary who asked not to be identified 
delivered the cash and escorted heimdal away from the rebels on 
friday mrs heimdal said 
heimdal has been in seclusion with his family since then 
mrs heimdal said she wasnt bitter toward the us government 
even though the state department took no active role in winning her 
sons release i respect the governments stand on ransoms she 
said 
heimdal said the first thing he would do on arriving home in 
peoria is get a haircut 
and he said he will return to ecuador 
i do plan to return i have some idea of what i want to do 
he said it wont be mining on the colombian border 
however if his mother has her say he wont be going anywhere 
soon 
ive aged about 100 years after doing this she said i 
pray to god no other mother has to go through it and i wish to 
god theyd get those other hostages out of lebanon 
his father roy stayed behind in ecuador temporarily

seventeen centuries after teaching the 
world how to make love india is relearning its own lesson 
the rise of a westernized middle class has brought a sexual 
revolution and formerly taboo subjects are coming into the open 
movies books singles magazines and hospitals treat sex with a 
clarity that rivals the worlds best howto sex manual indias own 
kama sutra from the 3rd century 
in june a doctor published indias first study of orgasm 
bombay friend the countrys first magazine for homosexuals began 
publishing in may 
late in 1989 a psychoanalyst brought out the first book on 
indian sexuality indias only singles magazine which publishes 
twice a year began a monthly supplement in june 
even the conservative rural population is not immune a survey 
in june indicated condom sales in the countryside rose 200 percent 
between 1985 and 1989 doctors say an increasing number of farmers 
seek treatment for sexual problems 
movies a repository of indias vivid fantasy life are 
exploring a womans sexual needs for the first time 
rape scenes previously a must for a successful movie are less 
frequent and indian leading men are starting to woo women instead 
of yanking their pony tails like latterday cavemen 
in a movie called truth a woman even makes the first move 
unbuttoning her lovers shirt sunday magazine called that a 
cinematic first for india 
in my husband belongs to me a woman accused of being a 
mans mistress defies society by moving into his house 
on the darker side aids is believed to be spreading rapidly 
studies of bombay prostitutes indicate the number testing positive 
for the aids virus has jumped 500 percent in three years to about 
10000 
we are undergoing a revolution in consciousness said sudhir 
kakar the psychoanalyst who wrote intimate relations the 
first study of indian sexuality right now we are at the talking 
phase 
most of indias 880 million people still live by hindu 
tradition which puts the extended family above the individual sex 
takes a back seat to harmony and the central family relationship 
is not wife to husband but motherinlaw to wife 
about 90 percent of indian marriages are arranged and sexual 
affairs when they occur often happen within the family according 
to a 1984 study at a new delhi hospital half the men in a group of 
1000 had their first sexual experience with the wife of an elder 
brother 
sexual taboos remain so strong in many hindu communities that 
women often do not have a word for their genitals kakar wrote in 
intimate relations women commonly refer to sex as working 
he said many indian men believe ejaculation is a sign of 
weakness and that women by nature are impure or wild beings 
in india kakar said in the study sex has become a zone of 
genital combat where mens fantasies are filled with fear and 
dread and womens longings weighed down with anger and 
disappointment 
change is under way 
teenage dating was almost unheard of in the 1970s now coffee 
shops and restaurants in major cities fill with couples when night 
falls 
a survey of 2800 people last year by the illustrated weekly 
one of indias most popular magazines found about 85 percent of 
students aged 16 to 25 approved of mixing freely with the 
opposite sex the figure for people over 25 was 70 percent 
even virginity a foundation of hinduisms concept of marriage 
has taken a beating experts say almost every man insisted his 
bride be a virgin 20 years ago but only slightly more than half of 
several thousand students questioned recently listed is as a 
requirement 
we are in the midst of great change said prakash kothari 
indias foremost sexologist and author of orgasm new 
dimensions indias first book on the subject 
women are now standing up for their rights to be sexually 
satisfied he said its just begun i would never even have 
dreamed of that 18 years ago when i started my practice 
husbands are becoming more cooperative he said by telephone 
from his office in bombay they are making efforts to satisfy 
their wives that i think is a first 
indians approach the idea of sexual revolution with a certain 
irony this is the country after all that produced the lush 
eroticism of the kama sutra and the unihibited physical celebration 
of the khajuraho temple carvings 
in some ways it is simply a process of remembering longsilent 
traditions kothari said we have to engage in an excavation of 
our subconscious 
the change appears to be coming more from the west than from 
indias past years of relatively strong economic growth have 
created a middle class estimated at about 150 million that looks 
to the west for inspiration 
indias new yuppies exude selfconfidence and a willingness to 
experiment with new lifestyles 
we are a broadminded moslem couple says an ad soliciting 
adventurous couples and ladies in the singles magazine 
bombayite there is no word no in our vocabulary

virtually none of the money gen 
manuel antonio noriega allegedly made from corruption and drugs has 
been recovered and the united states is partly to blame panamanian 
investigators say 
a major problem according to the investigators is that 
washington will not turn over more than 15000 boxes of documents 
captured by american soldiers in the december invasion that ousted 
the dictator 
noriega is jailed in miami on federal drug charges 
panamanians say they need the booty to help an economy damaged 
by years of corruption and an economic embargo the united states 
imposed in hopes of forcing noriega to leave peacefully 
for panamanian justice to be adequate quick and effective we 
need to examine the documents and computer systems captured by 
american troops because they contain records of the management of 
property and public funds by former members of the defunct defense 
forces a document from the national comptrollers office said 
the documents and computers which belonged to noriegas 
military operations were found at the headquarters of his special 
antiterrorist unit at fort amador where the united states still 
controls some buildings both nations had soldiers at fort amador 
before the invasion 
officials of the comptrollers office say the united states has 
given noriegas lawyers access to the documents but not to the new 
panamanian government 
lawyers for the general deny having access and contend the 
papers would show the united states sanctioned some of his 
activities they claim the us government has many more documents 
than it acknowledges 
us embassy statements have said negotiators from the two 
countries were seeking a way to give panama appropriate access to 
noriegas documents but that legal precedents must be considered 
foreign minister julio linares said panama was using 
diplomatic channels in an attempt to get the documents 
in washington justice department spokesman doug tillett said 
as in any other case involving large quantities of evidence we 
want to ensure that the proper procedures are in place to prevent 
questions about handling of the documents from arising in the 
future 
tillett said the united states took posession of the documents 
at panamas request 
eusebio marshosky head of the comptrollers office of 
patrimonial responsibility said 25 million in assets belonging to 
officials of noriegas regime had been seized but the only 
confiscated property belonging to noriega was a ranch near the 
costa rican border worth about 15 million 
noriegas main residence appraised at about 10 million and 
another near the rio hato military base on the pacific coast remain 
in the hands of the attorney generals office 
marshosky said his agency was looking at other residences that 
might belong to noriega but were hidden under corporate ownership 
he said bank accounts of noriegas officers totaling between 50 
million and 70 million had been frozen for investigation but not 
seized 
the united states estimates noriegas wealth at about 300 
million his lawyers claim at least 11 million came from the cia 
to which noriega supplied information for years and intelligence 
agencies of other nations 
noriega and at least seven of his officers have been charged 
with looting the treasury marshosky said the delay acts in favor 
of people who eventually will stand trial in panama 
he quoted the state department as saying much of its information 
about noriega came from third countries and the united states 
cannot give panama the information without permission from those 
countries 
noriegas fortune does not have only one origin marshosky 
said it came from crimes against the national wealth drug 
trafficking money laundering arms deals and influence peddling 
the dictator moved his money from place to place making it 
difficult to determine where it came from he said 
if panama wants to retrieve funds from abroad it will have to 
prove the money came from a specific source such as trafficking 
marshosky said 
the case is complicated he said we have problems with 
evidence problems with the searches for funds and problems with 
conflicts of jurisdictions panama is being denied evidence and 
lacks the money to build an effort to get the information it 
needs

tony bennett logged two disparate credits this 
year the first was singing for president bush the second was 
singing a parody of new york new york for a future episode of 
the simpsons 
his bush appearance taped in march was at a benefit for the 
ford theater in washington the 90minute show is being broadcast 
tonight at 805 pm edt by ted turners tbs superstation 
his simpsons visit recorded in may and to be shown next 
fall on the fox network was a first for bennett 
but singing for presidents is old hat for him bennett 63 has 
done it for every president going back to harry s truman 
its usually been enjoyable for both sides he says however 
there was one occasion of unease at the white house when he was to 
sing at a function held by president lyndon b johnson 
the honored guest was the prime minister of japan a white house 
aide called bennetts thenpianist and longtime friend tony 
tamburello to ask if the singer knew any japanese songs 
sure said tamburello 
it must be noted at this point that tamburello has a different 
kind of mind but this is to be expected from someone who used to 
room with rodney dangerfield and once owned a music company called 
horrible records 
the white house guy asks for the words to the song i was to 
sing bennett recalls so tony says goodby mama im off to 
yokohama to fight for the red white and blue 
the aide was old enough to recall that this was a world war ii 
song that spoke of bringing the japanese to their knees 
there was silence on the other end bennett said finally 
they said hes not going to sing that is he 
he wasnt and didnt 
the republic survived so did bennett who now is in his 40th 
year in show business even though he persists in singing popular 
song classics by guys like george gerswhin cole porter irving 
berlin and johnny mercer 
their music has been enjoying a revival in recent years thanks 
in part to such younger folk as harry connick jr and michael 
feinstein and such fortysomething delegates as carly simon and 
linda ronstadt 
bennett approves of all this with some qualifications 
their versions of american popular classics may not have the 
style or phrasing of a nat king cole or an ella fitzgerald he 
says but its still good that theyre doing it its always 
going to be going on and that music is permanent 
bennett last year recorded his 92nd album astoria a portrait 
of the artist a collection of songs loosely pegged to the idea 
of kid growing up in the astoria section of queens ny where he 
grew up 
he now is helping columbia records put together an 80song 
compact disc collection of songs he did in his 23 years with 
columbia 
he never thought his career would last as long as it has he 
never doubted his abilities but he recalls a time in the 60s 
when rock music roared in that he wasnt quite sure about how to 
face the farlouder competition 
i asked count basie what do you think i should do and he 
just looked up at me with those big eyes and said why change an 
apple

despite decreasing network audiences no network 
executives have yet impaled themselves on a ratings point indeed 
they are so optimistic that theyve got 33 new series coming up 
next season 
but hello whats this saatchi amp saatchi advertising one of 
the nations largest advertising agencies doesnt rate any of the 
newcomers as a potential hit this does not mean it is bummer time 
though 
saatchis annual forecast rates nine new series as having a 
very good chance of success including nbcs fresh prince of 
bel air which will test whether rap music can work in a sitcom 
set in bel air 
bel air a wealthy enclave in los angeles is largely populated 
by hollywood folk most are brooklyn natives who always wanted to 
play tennis 
nbc seems to have caught the rap wave while its still high 
says the saatchi analysis in regard to fresh prince 
saatchi does not exactly do the wave for steven bochcos cop 
rock though an innovative abc series the show juxtaposes 
bigcity police work with songs and musical production numbers 
it may well be much more than just a show where police warn a 
suspect anything you sing can and will be used against you 
indeed saatchi says the shows dramatic scenes are as 
hardhitting as anything ever seen on tv but the musical numbers 
at best are amusing and at worst can be distracting and 
irritating its analysis says 
it declares cop rock a maybe 
two cbs series get the lowest mark of long shot they are 
the flash about a police scientist made speedy by a lab 
accident and the green machine about what youd call an 
environmental ateam 
nbcs signs of life a reality series about medical case 
histories from the patients points of view also gets a long 
shot judgment its painfully uncomfortable to watch saatchi 
says 
but therell be a dire need in hollywood next season for live 
studio audiences who will laugh at anything even a sitcom taped 
right in front of them this is because 18 of next seasons 33 new 
shows are sitcoms 
in fact says the study new and returning comedies will 
represent 29 percent of the combined schedules of cbs nbc abc and 
fox broadcasting up 2 percent from the halcyon season of 198990 
nbc which has a total of 17 new and returning sitcoms on its 
roster is seeking the most laughs saatchis study says nbcs 
sitcom roster represents 36 percent of that networks schedule 
the highest percentage of any network 
but dramas as they call hourlong series are momentarily in 
decline at the networks because of their disappointing 
performance in ratings last season saatchi says cutbacks have 
been made 
dramas will account for 38 percent of the networks schedules 
next season compared to 45 percent in 198990 
how does saatchi handicap this falls network ratings joust 
nbc the primetime winner for five seasons will remain in 
first place but its margin of victory over abc in household 
ratings will be half that of the fall of 1989 the agencys study 
says 
secondplace abc will continue to make inroads especially 
among younger viewers where the network will be ahead of nbc 
the study says 
cbs whose executives grouse about reporters who precede the 
initials cbs with the phrase still mired in third will find 
itself still mired in third 
but it will hold onto its young audience via new comedies 
the study says 
and upstart fox broadcasting by expanding to a 
fivenightaweek schedule this fall will forfeit its 
extraordinary growth patterns of recent seasons but should still 
hold its youthful viewers

the day a stranger forced his way into 
nancy ziegenmeyers car cursing her for being white and savagely 
assaulting her was just the first of two events that changed her 
life 
the second came eight months later on july 11 1989 when she 
decided to tell the story of her rape to the des moines register 
one of the nations largest newspapers and to do it without the 
cloak of anonymity 
few women have opened the doors to their private hell in such a 
public way and the response invitations to speak requests for 
interviews from journalists the world over has been 
overwhelmingly positive 
the response tells me society is ready to deal with this 
crime she said i think society is saying yes were ready 
to learn teach us 
mrs ziegenmeyer came forward because of a column written by 
register editor geneva overholser exploring the refusal of her 
newspaper and others to identify rape victims the purpose she 
wrote was to protect victims from new pain but it instead 
unwittingly reenforces the canard that somehow the victim is at 
fault 
a troubling consequence of our reluctance to talk about rape 
is that we rarely confront it directly she wrote we shy away 
from thinking about rape we shy away from its victims 
as long as rape is deemed unspeakable and is therefore not 
fully honest and honestly spoken of the public outrage will be 
muted as well 
mrs ziegenmeyer called the paper and agreed to be interviewed 
at length for stories on the condition they not appear before the 
man accused in the crime bobby lee smith came to trial smith was 
convicted of firstdegree kidnapping and sentenced to life in 
prison with no chance for parole 
the series by reporter jane schorer ran this year from late 
february through early march it started with the rape including 
spare but graphic details of what happened that early saturday 
morning in november 1988 and continued with mrs ziegenmeyers 
frustrating attempts to deal with her family the trial and 
everyday life 
i think it was the dreary dailyness of her story that made it 
so powerful ms overholser said 
we knew it would be a powerful story in iowa but we had no 
idea it would be in such demand nationwide the editor said 
media people indulged in a feeding frenzy to share the story 
and get reaction she said 
mrs ziegenmeyer wasnt the first smalltown woman who was raped 
when she visited the city and she wasnt the first to tell her 
story by name 
ive decided that timing is everything the editor said 
this seems to be the season for the issue in new york for 
example there was some disagreement over whether to report the 
name of a woman who was raped by a gang of youths while jogging in 
central park 
mrs ziegenmeyer feels her story touched so many because it is 
not hers alone its the story of thousands of other women 
across the country 
my single intent when i worked with geneva and jane was to 
help other victims and help society understand that this is a crime 
of violence just short of murder said mrs ziegenmeyer in a 
telephone interview from her home in grinnell about 40 miles east 
of des moines 
the only difference is that the rapist leaves the victims 
alive 
the interviews were cathartic she said but not essential for 
her recovery 
a great amount of healing had already taken place before the 
story was published she said i remember the first time i 
laughed one of those laughs were you laugh until you cry it felt 
like a ton of bricks were lifted off my shoulder i thought my 
god im human i can do something other than cry 
after that i began to heal she said 
she and ms overholser emphasized that her decision to come 
forward was not a recommendation for other victims the editor said 
the paper would continue its policy of omitting names of victims 
unless they preferred otherwise 
the good of this story is the realization that this can happen 
to anyone said karen muelhaupt a rape counselor for polk county 
most women already know the men who rape them ms muelhaupt 
said the man who jumps out of the bushes is a relatively rare 
occurrence she said 
at least 80 percent of victims are assaulted by acquaintances 
she said and almost all are raped by someone of the same race 
mrs ziegenmeyer white was assaulted by a black stranger 
the only negative letters ive gotten are a few who approach 
the racial aspect of the story said mrs ziegenmeyer i 
certainly think there was a racist in my car that morning but it 
wasnt me 
another strangerrape victim mary williams of des moines said 
mrs ziegenmeyers story did a lot to take away the myth that 
weve all heard that somehow the rape victim brought this on 
but she said the story left the impression that as soon as 
rapists are caught they are out of their victims lives forever 
mrs williams said the man who assaulted her was sentenced to up to 
25 years and could be released at any time she is certain he will 
try to attack again 
in an introduction to the story ms overholser wrote that mrs 
ziegenmeyers story was simply that one womans story 
we never say the story is representative the editor said 
all we were doing was telling a hell of a story that nancy let us 
tell with her name on it

a new wrinkle has turned up in longtime baptist 
links to american freedoms but it seems a different kind this time 
while historians give baptists special credit for first 
amendment guarantees of no state church and freedom of religion 
assembly speech and press southern baptist officials have 
clamped down on their own press 
in essence theyre rejecting the baptist heritage said r 
gene puckett of raleigh nc editor of that states 
denominational weekly the biblical recorder 
other denominational editors across the country also said last 
weeks order for ouster of the professionally respected news 
executives of baptist press service aimed at controlling it for 
partisan purposes 
it is a blatant attempt to silence a free press that has 
operated in the denomination for nearly half a century said jb 
fowler president of the southern baptist press association 
he called it sad day contrary to the baptist dedication to 
freedom adding baptists of all great protestant denominations 
have always been champions of religious freedom and a free press 
with the crackdown on the denominational news service by a now 
dominant fundamentalist administration however editors of state 
baptist newspapers were considering alternate newsgathering means 
fowler of albuquerque nm editor of the baptist new mexican 
said editors of most of the 38 southern baptist state weeklies were 
to meet this saturday in dallas to examine various possibilities 
every viable alternative will be explored by the editors to be 
sure that baptist church members continue to get the truth he 
said 
in early america baptists had a catalytic role in securing 
freedoms including a free press freedom of religion itself first 
was planted by baptist roger williams in the colony of rhode island 
when ratification of the us constitution was at stake in 1789 
needed support of virginia baptists came only after james madison 
assured them of speedy addition of the first 10 amendments the 
bill of rights 
its ironic that baptists with their great contributions to 
freedom would now be trying to control the press and do away with 
its freedom said jack brymer of jacksonville fla editor of 
the baptist witness 
when people are denied access to information from which they 
can discern the truth rest assured that their other freedoms also 
soon will be denied 
baptist press which distributes daily news reports to about 400 
outlets including 38 baptist weeklies with a combined circulation 
if l8 million was in a semiblackout early this week 
a main offering was the text of a statement by the rev sam w 
pace chairman of the denominations executive committee about its 
officers asking that baptist press chief editors either resign 
quietly or be dismissed 
it was felt the denomination would be better served by 
handling this quietly and graciously pace said adding that 
committee president harold bennett gave the removal notice in the 
most loving manner 
however after bp director alvin shackleford and news editor dan 
martin noted that bylaws gave no authority to committee officers 
alone to fire personnel bennett called a special meeting july 17 
on the case 
with the 77member committee now strongly dominated by 
fundamentalists the ouster seemed a foregone conclusion 
the fundamentalist administration insists on conformity to 
recently elaborated views of the bible by all denominational 
personnel and baptist press has carried forthright accounts of 
conflict over that policy 
pace of lawton okla said an everincreasing perception of 
the vast majority of his committee was that baptist press has 
been the very opposite of fair equitable and balanced 
such criticisms by fundamentalist leaders have intensified as 
they achieved expanding control of the 149 millionmember 
denomination culminating with a sweeping victory at its june 
convention in new orleans 
however impartial studies have found the service highly 
reliable objective and adhering to the best journalistic 
standards so concluded a panel of secular news professionals 
retained six years ago to evaluate the service 
two years ago the southern baptist press association conducted 
another extensive examination of bp news reports and concluded they 
were as fair and balanced as humanly possible 
religion reporters have considered baptist press the best 
journalistic service of any denomination says john dart of the 
los angeles times president of the religion newswriters 
association made up of specialists covering religion 
don mcgregor of jackson miss editor of the states baptist 
record said they have stuck to the ethics of journalism right 
down the line 
ousting them says that when a power group gets hold of a 
denomination they may not stop at any length to accomplish their 
purposes he added the first thing they want to control is 
means of disseminating information 
bob terry of jefferson city mo editor of word and way called 
the crackdown a bloodletting 
julian pentecost of richmond va editor of the religious 
herald said the people responsibile for what has happened want a 
controlled and manipulated press

the cuba of jorge mas canosas dreams is an 
economic dynamo engorged by us investment it is a veritable 
suburb of florida it is free 
and who would be president of this postcastro cuba some 
observers say mas already is campaigning for the job but the 
50yearold businessman arguably the most powerful cuban exile in 
this country denies it 
what im doing is very american dreaming with a model of a 
republic for some its a utopia for me its a reachable 
dream he said 
for 30 years since he left cuba as a student in 1960 mas has 
been enmeshed in the anticastro movement his vehicle has been the 
cuban american national foundation a washingtonbased think tank 
and lobby 
the foundation supported by the cuban american business elite 
has had wide influence on american policy the creation of radio 
marti and tv marti governmentsponsored broadcasts to cuba the 
lifting of the ban on aid to rebels fighting cuban troops in angola 
now convinced that communist cuba is in its declining days mas 
has turned the attention of his foundation to the future of a 
democratic cuba he discounts the complaints of critics who say he 
is power hungry and premature 
when castro is deposed he said the only presidency he expects 
to hold is that of his business and planning for postcastro cuba 
is important 
the future of cuba must be the result of serious 
wellconceived widely discussed plans with the leading experts of 
the world in each field said mas after all we can afford it 
we have the resources and the time 
work commissioned on behalf of the foundation including a 
constitution and economic plan for a hypothetical cuban government 
is to assist in the islands eventual rebuilding not to promote 
himself mas said in a recent interview 
mas said he has enlisted economists milton friedman and arthur 
laffer along with other experts to develop plans that would be 
handed over to a transitional postcastro government 
laffer is drawing up a list of fortune 500 companies willing to 
invest in a free cuba enough support could be generated through 
the private sector and the international bond market so that little 
us aid would be needed mas said 
the exiles for the most part expect that south florida would 
virtually become an extension of havana and vice versa 
mas estimates that each of the 2 million exiles would invest at 
least 3000 in cuba a total contribution of some 6 billion 
exiles also would lobby for the us government to open up its 
market to cuban goods as another way of stimulating development on 
the island he said 
the german miracle is going to be nothing compared to this 
cuban miracle said mas who also was appointed by gov bob 
martinez to chair a free cuba commission looking at the social and 
economic impact castros prospective overthrow would have on the 
state 
mas doesnt doubt for even a minute that those in el 
exilio would be welcomed in cuba we will win the people of 
cuba he said 
but others arent so sure 
its kind of arrogant and presumptuous on the part of people 
here in miami basking under the florida sun and having worked in 
the last 30 years under the most democratic market economy in the 
globe to say this is how were going to handle a change in 
cuba said raul masvidal a foundation cofounder who quit in 
1985 
furthermore masvidal finds it hard to believe a transitional 
cuban government would be comfortable taking advice from people 
who represent the extreme right of the exile community 
jaime suchlicki director of the university of miamis institute 
of interamerican studies says theres no evidence castro is 
about to collapse so i think its somewhat premature although 
theres no harm done in preparing and looking at the options 
but masvidal does see some harm in it 
of course i would like to see mr castro killed tomorrow and 
thrown out of there but i dont think its about to happen and i 
think its very painful to be playing with the sensitivities of 
families and 11 million cuban people suffering every day from a 
severe form of repression he said 
mas said his critics simply are jealous of his success his 
company church and tower of florida specializes in laying 
telephone cable for southern bell it has made him a millionaire 
at the same time he built the foundation into a powerful force 
its more than 50 directors each pay 10000 a year to serve 
in that highprofile position however mas attracts 
controversy when ernesto betancourt former director of radio 
marti resigned rather than accept a job transfer he accused mas 
of trying to use radio marti for his own political ends and 
plotting to have him removed 
mas chairman of the presidential advisory board that oversees 
radio marti has denied the charges the decision to transfer 
betancourt was made by the management of the us information 
agency he said 
when mas joined a discussion panel that included a soviet 
delegation hardliners protested outside but mas said times had 
changed conversations with anyone except castro and his brother 
raul are prudent when the object is peaceful change in cuba he 
said 
just eight or nine years ago mas said many exiles reviled him 
when he said anticastro terrorist activities should be replaced by 
political action 
they felt mas sold out to the americans said mas now 
that i talk to presidents all over they say oh he was right 
mas remains certain that he is right that now is the time to 
plan 
my biggest dream is to make a substantial contribution to the 
economic political moral and spiritual reconstruction of 
cuba mas said slowly and deliberately i wont rest until 
cuba is free

cancer robbed richard larmore 
of his ability to work and then it took his left leg 
that was aug 7 the seventh month since his application for 
disability aid began wending its way through the federal paperwork 
labyrinth and four months before he finally won approval 
critics say too many cases of deserving americans take too long 
to be decided by the social security disability system 
larmore 49 was seeking medicaid health insurance and a 44910 
monthly disability check from the social security administration to 
replace lost earnings from his former work as a plumbing and 
heating man 
while waiting for approval he survived on canned goods from a 
shelter for the homeless paid his rent on 4950 a week from the 
vermont department of social welfare and wondered how he would 
meet nearly 30000 in medical bills 
at times larmore said he gave serious thought to suicide 
i thought i had about as much chance of any dream coming true 
as a snowball in hell he said 
thanks to the advocacy of a community action agency worker and a 
vermont legal aid lawyer he got the benefits on his third appeal 
11 months later 
those familiar with the system say it can take years 
you can get justice in the system as long as youve got two 
years to devote to it said ted allen the vermont official 
responsible for a state agency that processes social security 
claims under federal contract 
anyone who really wants disability benefits should continue 
to appeal and they should get a lawyer allen said 
the disability system is complex the nearly 15 million people 
a year who apply for benefits under two disability programs go 
first to a statelevel office that reviews claims under contract 
with the federal government if the applicant is denied there 
twice he or she can pursue an appeal on two levels in the social 
security administration before resorting to the federal courts 
frank batestelli a spokesman at the social security 
administrations headquarters in baltimore said the nationwide 
average for processing disability claims on initial application 
runs from about 2 to three months 
those denied can ask the state office for reconsideration 
batestelli said he had no figures on the average length for that 
stage the average for review at the administrative law judge level 
is 205 days he said 
its not uncommon for it to take more than a year from the 
initial application to a ruling by the administrative law judge he 
said 
overall batestelli said more than twothirds of disability 
applicants are turned down on their initial application more than 
250000 appeals a year go to the administrative law judge level 
where statelevel rejections are reversed about 60 percent of the 
time he said 
critics say those reversals show the regulations set for 
statelevel reviewers are too tight 
those successful in winning help from the system get a base 
federal benefit of less than 400 a month plus an additional 
amount that varies depending on other sources of income the amount 
of working time the applicant spent paying into the social security 
system and the number of dependents 
the fundamental question asked by disability reviewers is 
whether the person asking for benefits can continue working despite 
his or her medical complaints 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress found in a study released last november that 58 percent 
of those people denied benefits in 1984 and still not receiving 
them three years later were not working that groups median family 
income was about 6500 in 1986 the gao said 
legal aid lawyers and other advocates for the disabled argue 
that the gao figures coupled with the number of reversals on 
appeal show the disability system is missing many of the people it 
should be serving and they say that is due to a bias built into a 
system that is trying to pinch federal pennies 
some social security administrative law judges who review 
disability cases appealed from statelevel reviewers complained 
last year to a us house subcommittee that they were being 
pressured to deny people benefits 
we have gotten allegations from administrative law judges of 
coercion threatened transfers and other kinds of pressures said 
rep barney frank dmass 
federal judges have criticized the agency saying it doesnt 
apply a courts ruling in one case to other similar cases 
district and circuit court rulings abound with references to social 
security systematically denying disability benefits to people 
entitled to them 
an agency memo cited in a disability case before a federal court 
in new york issued this order to statelevel reviewers do not 
apply a courts decision on one case to other cases if the 
administration decides to adopt the decision for other claims 
revised instructions will be issued 
among the most bitter and longrunning legal squabbles involving 
the disability system is that courts have repeatedly ruled that 
substantial weight must be given to the views of doctors who have 
treated a person for years when that person applies for disability 
benefits 
but lawyers with vermont legal aid and their counterpart 
agencies in other states say the treating physician rule is 
routinely ignored when applications are reviewed at the state level 
vermont officials say they are compelled to follow social 
security regulations even when they disagree with those rules 
allen the state disability aid official said he sees the 
problems resulting less from concerted federal policy than from 
simple bureaucratic unresponsiveness 
ive always thought of the social security administration as a 
brontosaurus with a real long spinal chord and slowacting 
neurons so that it steps on you not out of malice but because it 
didnt know you were there allen said 
by the time it realizes you were there he said youre a 
grease spot

one of their leaders says japanese rightists are in 
a battle for the national soul but cant win if they continue 
wearing military uniforms and blaring martial music from armored 
buses 
i think 90 percent of the japanese people are rightists at 
heart shusuke nomura said in an interview they are just 
scared off by the militarist gangsterlike image it is time for 
the right to throw away their old wartime values and become more 
like the mainstream 
the selfstyled ideologue of the new right is a dapper 
55yearold with a record of arson hostagetaking and prison now 
through his books and films nomura seeks to lead the radical right 
away from societys fringe 
japans right wing has been vocal and visible throughout the 
postwar era but many people see it as an embarrassing reminder of 
rule by the militarists during world war ii 
police say many of the 840 rightwing groups are mere fronts for 
gangsters involved in extortion and other nonpolitical activities 
the number of extreme rightists in japan is estimated at about 
120000 
nomura claims the support of about 1000 people from issuikai 
onewater group and several other large rightist organizations 
even such limited support makes him a major figure in the rightist 
movement because it is fragmented with no central leader 
he hopes the new right will make a serious effort to win back 
japans soul 
after the war we sold our soul to the united states he 
said we have to grab that soul back 
it is as impossible to return to the old days of militarism as 
it is to return to samurai times he added 
nomura said the right should abandon its rabidly anticommunist 
propaganda which he said the americans created and work for a 
more assertive independent japan that can assume a role at the 
forefront of international politics 
similar ideas are gaining in other quarters and the government 
is building toward greater influence in the world in close 
partnership with the united states 
shintaro ishihara a wellknown conservative in mainstream 
politics has become a leader of the assertiveness movement with 
his popular book the japan that can say no 
sales of a sequel nevertheless japan can still say no 
have been brisk since it appeared may 22 the publisher kobunsha 
said 400000 copies were in print 
nomura describes ishihara and other members of the governing 
liberal democratic party as fourth rate but does not favor a 
government of the right 
real japanese rightists dont seek formal power in the 
government he said those who do are fascists and i disagree 
with their actions 
racist doctrines are not acceptable nomura said and he 
disagrees with the notion of japanese superiority 
right after the end of the war americans suppressed japanese 
nationalism but then they decided communism was a greater threat 
and lumped rightists and gangsters together into a movement to 
fight the reds he said 
few historians would blame america for the gangster element in 
japans right wing but the united states had a strong influence on 
the rights postwar reformation 
during the occupation of 194552 us authorities first sought 
to stifle militant nationalism by purging rightwing leaders from 
public office and trying others as war criminals 
fear of rightists gave way to concerns about the left when 
japanese communists won nearly 3 million votes in the 1949 
parliamentary elections and the korean war began in 1950 a purge 
of communists was declared in 1950 and the campaign against the 
right ended in 1951 
much of nomuras adult life has been spent in prison his first 
jail term 12 years was for burning down the home of a government 
minister in 1963 
two years after his release he forced his way into the japan 
federation of economic organizations headquarters and held four 
people hostage for 11 hours he was sentenced to six years in 
prison 
i was young then i wouldnt do the same thing now nomura 
said but added that he still believes violence is justified in 
some situations 
violent attacks from the extreme right have increased 
hitoshi motoshima the christian mayor of nagasaki was 
seriously wounded by a rightist gunman in january in february a 
rightist shot up the campaign office of former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone 
police fear more rightist activity as japan readies for the 
coronation of emperor akihito in november reverence for the 
emperor is a tenet of the right and could prompt clashes with 
leftists or other antimonarchists 
nomura promotes his ideas through his books and soon will 
release a movie called cut him down based on an unsuccessful 
military coup in february 1936 
like most of the old right he favors scrapping the postwar 
constitution which the americans wrote 
the constitution is simply a law imposed upon japan and 
although it has many good points it isnt the product of our own 
effort he said it is also full of contradictions like the 
banning of army navy and air forces we have all of those things 
he said the security treaty under which roughly 50000 american 
soldiers are stationed in japan was lopsided and should be 
abolished in nomuras opinion until it is japan will not be an 
independent nation 
japan also must shed the stigma of war crimes trials that led to 
the executions of many wartime leaders including war minister 
hideki tojo he said nomura called the trials victors justice 
that left many japanese with the idea they are criminals 
i will not deny that we made many mistakes in the great asia 
war he said 
joining hands with the nazis was a mistake fighting china was 
a mistake but the white mans civilization has been one of the 
survival of the fittest the strong preying on the weak the youth 
of japan went to war thinking they were going to liberate asia from 
all that

members of the knights of columbus gave 
more than 92 million to charitable and benevolent activities in 
1989 plus 32 million hours of volunteer service the roman 
catholic fraternal order reports 
this represented an increase of a often includes 
adults 
in the old days zeitlin says kids didnt expect to grow up 
to become famous players of marbles but now graffiti artists are 
hired to paint wall murals breakdancers seek prizes in sponsored 
competitions and rappers angle for recording deals 
in a book to be published this fall entitled city play 
zeitlin and his wife amanda dargan lament the steady move away 
from free play the kinds of things kids do when they are 
outdoors and unsupervised video games they complain dont 
create communities the world they create is on the screen in the 
mind not on the block 
video games and other manufactured amusements also demand less 
invention and imagination when parents can afford to buy toys 
their children have little need or interest in building their own 
soapbox cars or making peachpit rings by rubbing a pit against a 
stoop until a hole forms in the middle 
new york kids always have had to fight for a share of public 
space and adapt their play to the changing city 
the paving of dirt streets and sidewalks killed marbles you 
couldnt dig a little hole for the agate so kids switched to 
skelly which used a disc such as a bottlecap that could be 
flicked into boxes marked on the smooth pavement similarly when 
row houses began to fill the sandlots that served as baseball 
diamonds kids started playing stickball in the streets 
no one claims the new play much of it indoors or under close 
supervision in parks is all bad 
brian suttonsmith a student of childrens play argues that 
the old games prepared children for an economy dependent on 
physical skill and strength the new ones he says train children 
for an information economy that values the manipulation of signs 
and symbols skill at a computer screen is more important than 
skill with a slingshot 
many city kids still play in the streets and some play 
traditional games especially in poor crowded neighborhoods like 
bedfordstuyvesant and the lower east side boys there have been 
known to build a gocart out of a police barricade and girls still 
like doubledutch jump rope 
but even where vestiges of the old play endure there is little 
of the density or complexity the dozens of variations of 
hopscotch the hirschmans discovered 
there are of course games of which the couple never dreamed 
last year police said they had discovered a playground stand 
where children operated a makebelieve drug ring offering bags of 
grass clippings and sugar they recorded drug transactions on a 
ledger and scraps of paper one read cocaine small halfbaggie

an impressively orchestrated series of receptions speeches 
awards concerts dinners and other social events usually 
characterize national conventions of the greek orthodox church in 
the americas 
but this time something different is in the offing and it may 
jar the customarily graceful protocol 
a recently organized group of lay members plans to challenge 
operations of the churchs biennial layclergy congress july 912 
in washington demanding more representative participation 
the laity has been pretty much regulated controlled and 
stifled and authority has become more centralized said george d 
karcazes a chicago attorney and president of orthodox christian 
laity 
we want to restore the participatory process in the tradition 
of our faith 
such democraticstyle procedures in which both clergy and laity 
take part in church decisionmaking including the choosing of 
bishops is part of the eastern orthodox heritage 
but the lay organization says that policy has been eroded in the 
orderly running of the 2 millionmember us church 
unlike the roman catholic systen orthodoxy has a long 
tradition way back from the beginning of the church of lay 
participation and democratic processes karcazes said in an 
interview 
but that has been eliminated the laity has become totally 
subservient and blind followers its a trend over the past years 
with everincreasing centralization and less lay participation 
we want to energize the laity into more responsibile 
involvement its a necessary role were not doing something 
against the interest of the church but are coming to its aid 
he said the complaint is not aimed at archbishop iakovos the 
widely esteemed head of the church for 30 years but is a matter of 
revising representative methods and spurring the laity into 
rightful responsibilities 
we love and respect him as our spiritual leader and hes 
largely in agreement with what weve proposed karcazes said of 
the archbishop hes a charismatic individual with an 
international reputation 
but he would get more objective advice if he had elected laity 
around him instead of a mostly appointed council 
iakovos asked his view of the lay group said the movement 
may have some merit he has met with its leaders and said he 
supported possible steps to improve our system 
he suggested that instead of a separate organization the 
group may accept assignment of questions it has raised to a special 
church task force he quoted st pauls advice to do everything in 
orderly manner 
the group is proposing that the layclergy congress be comprised 
of diocesan bishops and clergy and lay representatives of the 555 
parishes each bishop and lay and clergy representative having one 
vote 
at present karcazes said the regulations also allow retired and 
auxiliary bishops to vote and also members of the archdiocesan 
council whose 118 lay members are appointed by the archbishop but 
automatically have votes 
the proposal says lack of any limit on the councils size could 
permit the congress of more than 1000 delegates to be stacked 
with appointees thereby diluting the process 
another proposed change would provide that the congress elect 
its presiding officer and secretary rather than the archbishop or 
his appointee presiding and his appointing the secretary as at 
present 
the laity organization also criticizes the large amount of time 
the congress devotes to ceremonial and social events and the 
little time given to critical issues confronting the church 
work sessions have been sandwiched between these often 
irrelevant events and sometimes cancelled the lay group says 
it says that tendency may be even greater this time because of 
the presence of ecumenical patriarch dimitrios i spiritual leader 
of all the worlds eastern orthodox christians 
he is spending most of july visiting in this country 
karcazes whose lay group sent the patriarch a welcoming message 
asking for a meeting with him said the group has more than 2000 
members in 35 states and was started because of wide grassroots 
concern 
were not a group of renegades but of thoughtful involved 
members of the church he said were simply giving voice to 
what many priests and prominent lay people have been saying and 
writing about for years 
he emphasized that the group does not question church teachings 
or the authority of bishops over doctrine and liturgy but wants 
more representative decisionmaking on other matters 
the channels exist on paper for it but are not functioning 
he said adding that the layclergy congress has become largely a 
spectacle of banquets political speakers ceremonies and other 
extraneous events 
its no longer a working deliberative conference where clergy 
and laity have time enough to sit down and seriously confront the 
issues facing the church today

one of six education goals agreed on by 
president bush and the nations governors was to conquer illiteracy 
and boost workplace skills by the year 2000 the following report 
the third of an occasional series on those goals shows that even a 
potato chip company can no longer afford to ignore the issue 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at first glance or crunch making the 
better potato chip might seem a pretty lowtech pursuit 
mary jones a potato inspector at the fritolay plant here for 
25 years knows otherwise 
when i first started it didnt take much to do this she 
said shouting above the 90decibel din of conveyors and frying 
machines as she weeded out green or flawed spuds now youve got 
to know something 
such as how to read and interpret computergenerated graphs 
showing whether chips are just the right thickness down to 
11000th of an inch 
or which delicate adjustments to recommend if chips are cooking 
too brown too spicy or with the wrong moisture content or how to 
ensure that each of 36 million bags of potato chips corn chips 
tortilla chips and cheese puffs made per week weighs precisely the 
right amount 
wrong decisions left uncorrected can lessen profits lose 
market share and not least create unhappy customers 
whether the product is the perfect potato chip or computer chip 
us employers of every stripe are finding daily reasons to worry 
about the workplace skills of both new and veteran employees 
nearly two years ago fritolay established a basic skills 
program for employees like jones employees who typify the 
workplace literacy crisis that afflicts the nation according 
to study after study 
jones 49 completed high school decades ago she can read and 
write she is not illiterate 
but like many other us workers she found she lacked the 
math computer and communication skills needed to thrive in an 
increasingly complicated and computerized workplace circumstances 
that were spotlighted in february when the bush administration and 
the nations governors set six goals to address americas education 
problems 
among them was a vow to make every adult american literate by 
the year 2000 and give all workers the opportunity to acquire 
the knowledge and skills from basic to highly technical needed to 
adapt to emerging new technologies work methods and markets 
us companies already spend some 30 billion a year on worker 
training a recent report by the national center on education and 
the economy estimated 
companies like eastman kodak polaroid and ibm have had 
stateoftheart workplace training programs for years virtually 
all states run workplace literacy programs pennsylvania for 
example is working with local unions to help commercial drivers 
pass stiffer licensing exams 
yet some experts worry that the nations workplace literacy 
efforts are misguided too often such programs focus on boosting 
basic reading or math skills but neglect issues like computer 
literacy how to commmunicate effectively with fellow workers how 
to type skimread or interpret complicated written or oral 
instructions 
whats happening now is that a phenomenal amount of money is 
being spent and much being wasted workers have been out of school 
for years but need to be trained for changes in the workplace 
said lawrence mikulecky a professor of language education at 
indiana university who has written extensively about workplace 
literacy 
the most effective programs relate basic skills with job 
training he said 
at a class this spring at fritolays orlando plant workers 
counted the number of big medium and small potato chips in several 
bags and graphed the results a simultaneous lesson in basic math 
and quality control 
plant managers plan to expand the program this summer to include 
courses in stress management presentation skills teamwork and 
problemsolving 
five years ago we werent doing anything said robert 
beeby chairman of fritolay now he said five of the companys 
38 plants have educational programs and more are being considered 
our whole style at fritolay is pushing down responsibility 
we dont want to have to tell our workers what to do beeby said 
literacy skills arent the big problem but dealing with the 
technology 
some companies might be motivated by foreign competition from 
japan or elsewhere the orlando plants worries are just 400 miles 
away in suburban atlanta said plant manager dave nicholson 
the plant opened in may 1965 only recently began to acquire 
the hightech machinery and computers that many newer fritolay 
facilities have 
one such plant in perry ga has stateoftheart equipment and 
a highly literate workforce when nicholson and other orlando 
employees visited the perry facility it crossed their minds that 
it might someday bite into the orlando plants market area which 
includes northern florida 
as the orlando plant modernized managers decided to assess the 
reading skills of its approximately 250 employees of the 70 
percent who voluntarily took the assessment about onethird were 
told by letter they could benefit from the skills program 
the plant began classes in september 1988 with the help of the 
orange county public schools the district supplied teachers and 
worked with managers to create curricula relating basic skills to 
making potato chips 
some 65 employees have participated in classes thus far 
workers take classes in a small room at the plant two hours a 
week for nine to 12 weeks half on company time half on their own 
they also can come in on their own from 7 am to 9 am on fridays 
to bone up on math and other skills using any one of a dozen 
computers in the classroom 
an initial challenge was ridding workers of the fear that 
managers were using the skills program to lay off weak readers 
at first i was worried said ruby jefferson a packer for 18 
years who has taken three of the workplace courses i dont have 
the fear i had before a lot of people here didnt get into the 
classes because of that im encouraging them to do it 
others had to be convinced that lessons would not be of the 
dick and jane variety said training manager donna badiedietz 
readings include the employee benefits package for example a 
writing lesson might include drawing up a maintenance work order 
the program isnt about boosting standardized reading scores 
managers insisted the aim is improved morale and an ability to 
carry out correct decisions in complex situations without having a 
manager looking over workers shoulders 
we have not set any sort of benchmark beeby said we 
could easily have said there is a portion of our workforce that 
hasnt graduated high school and lets replace them what we said 
instead was lets not cast those folks aside 
for many there also have been payoffs outside the plant 
my boys know more about this stuff than i do said bj 
parker a packer at the plant for 16 years who was practicing math 
on a computer i want to catch up with them

president carlos menem has made 
the country his stage if argentina were a play he would be 
producer director and star in the first year of his presidency 
by personality as much as policy menem staved off hyperinflation 
social tension and the military unrest that forced his predecessor 
to leave office 22 weeks early on july 8 1989 
the lawyer and career politician 60 years old last monday 
charms manipulates and improvises he is blunt in one situation 
ingenious in another his greatest assets observers say are 
pragmatism and intuition 
he charted a course of fiscal austerity and political tolerance 
to jolt this south american nation from economic stagnation and 
political confrontation in the process he may transform argentina 
i have never voted peronist but if i had to vote today id 
vote for him said carlos escude an economist author and 
university lecturer he is fascinating in his strengths and 
weaknesses 
this nation of 33 million people slid from affluence to 
nearruin in four decades 
when menem took over monthly inflation was 197 percent more 
than some countries see in a generation in a fertile land that 
ships grain and beef to the world argentines were eating in soup 
kitchens and looting grocery stores 
menem is the son of syrian immigrants who once was a political 
prisoner a provincial governor with a taste for showgirls and fast 
cars who seemed an unlikely savior 
his peronist partys history of economic nationalism and 
administrative incompetence was described as a cause of argentinas 
ills not the cure 
the new president quickly separated himself from traditional 
peronism on his first day in office menem devalued the currency 
by 54 percent and raised gasoline prices sixfold argentines were 
appalled 
he has acted with similar resolve since then sometimes seeking 
consensus but often going against public opinion and the counsel of 
his advisers 
in october he pardoned military officers involved in the 
dirty war against leftists of 197683 removing a grievance 
that led to three uprisings against former president raul alfonsin 
diplomatic relations with britain resumed this year after menem 
agreed to suspend his countrys claim to the falkland islands over 
which the two nations fought a 74day war in 1982 that was 
disastrous for argentina 
he is a man with a great virtue he has no preconceived 
ideas said maria julia alsogaray a menem appointee from a 
conservative party that is anathema to traditional peronists 
some of the greatest changes have been economic 
savings accounts worth 2 billion about half the money in 
circulation were converted to 10year government bonds in january 
to stop speculation against the austral argentinas currency the 
austral has been stable for several months 
companies nationalized or created by dictator juan peron who 
founded menems party in the 1940s were put up for sale 
us and spanish investors bought the telephone company last 
month and the state airline aerolineas argentinas will change 
hands later this year 
menem halted subsidies to private companies reduced the budget 
deficit lifted controls on exchange rates and prices lowered 
tariffs partially deregulated the oil industry and encouraged 
agricultural production 
new private investment in energy and transportation alone is 
projected to surpass 6 billion before menems term ends in 1995 
many of menems actions have been taken at great social cost 
for which organized labor leftist political parties and human 
rights groups revile him oldstyle peronists call him a traitor 
at least 40 percent of argentinas 127 million workers are 
unemployed or underemployed according to labor department figures 
opposition economists say inflation shrank to about 13 percent for 
june only because the recession is so deep 
real wages for government employees have declined drastically 
policemen paid the equivalent of 100 a month usually have at 
least one other job and the crime rate is soaring teachers have 
boycotted classes off and on during most of this school year 
the middle class is declining in numbers and living standard 
the low quality of care at some public hospitals is scandalous 
many more beggars and homeless people are on the streets living in 
doorways and abandoned buildings 
menem is blamed for these things and more 
alfonsins civic radical union the secondlargest party in 
argentina claims he stacked the supreme court by increasing it 
from five judges to nine and filling the new seats with peronists 
newspaper editorials say his trip to italy for the first match 
in argentinas defense of the world cup was frivolous that his 
driving of speedboats and rally cars is reckless 
his separation this year from his wife of 24 years zulema yoma 
was treated as a soap opera menem didnt help by barring her from 
the presidential residence she complained loudly outside the gate 
whatever his problems menems approval in the polls has never 
dipped below 47 percent the share of the vote he won in the may 
1989 election sometimes it has exceeded 80 percent and nobody 
wonders who is in charge

from the air and from 
the water the urban thirst for electricity is encroaching on one 
of the great natural wonders of the world 
mighty as it is the national park service says the grand 
canyon is in distress 
about 80 miles away a huge coalburning power plant belches 
125 tons of sulfur dioxide each hour because it doesnt have 
pollutiongrabbing scrubbers on its three skyscrapertall 
smokestacks 
it is said to mix with los angeles smog and the grand canyon 
suffers 
to the northeast colorado river water races through turbines in 
a dam during the day to meet peak demand for electricity in cities 
hundreds of miles away when the demand falls at night the river 
flow is cut creating destructive tides downstream 
and the grand canyon suffers 
at issue is the quality of experience for visitors to one of 
natures masterpieces and what cost utility customers might have 
to pay to preserve a view or save a beach all this comes at a time 
when the grand canyon is hosting record crowds which themselves 
are taxing services and even raising concerns that access might 
have to be limited 
on some days a blue haze in the canyon dulls the view and 
occasionally obscures the opposite rim 10 miles away 
the daily rise and fall of river water sometimes spanning 13 
feet erodes beaches and harms spawning grounds 
the grand canyon is threatened said jim ruch vice 
president of the grand canyon trust a conservation group it is 
threatened by an accumulation of actions that were taken with good 
intentions but with little understanding for their consequences 
added former arizona gov bruce babbitt when you cant see 
across the canyon because of smog its as if the last symbol of 
the pristine west has gone the way of los angeles 
at the center of the canyons woes are two power plants that 
generate some of the cheapest electricity in the west the navajo 
generating station at the northeast end of the canyon about 12 
miles from page ariz and the 27yearold glen canyon dam near 
the utaharizona border 
the battle lines already have been drawn 
what makes this manvsnature showdown unique is that the 
troublesome plants arent blamed for health problems only for 
souring the quality of experience for visitors to the grand canyon 
the environmental protection agency concluded last year that the 
navajo generating station contributes up to 70 percent of the 
canyons haze pollution usually worst during the winter the epa 
must decide by feb 1 whether to order the plants owners to 
install scrubbers to reduce emissions by 90 percent 
cost estimate 500 million for the scrubbers and 39 billion 
to operate and maintain them over 30 years 
if the scrubbers are ordered it would mark the first time the 
epa took action solely to protect a view there is no immediate 
health danger from the smog at the canyon 
a lawsuit filed in 1982 by the environmental defense fund forced 
the epa to take action after a tracer chemical placed in the 
smokestack emissions at the navajo generating station turned up at 
monitoring stations in the canyon the epa issued its findings 
that was enough to point the finger said polly hays a park 
service scientist 
but the salt river project a public utility that operates the 
plant for electric companies in california nevada arizona and 
utah contends its coalburning doesnt pollute the canyon and that 
the tracer study was flawed 
interior secretary manuel lujan has asked the national academy 
of sciences to evaluate the findings 
on clear days grand canyon visitors can see about as far as the 
eye can see more than 200 miles hays said but a few days a 
month usually in the winter smog hangs in the canyon and 
visibility can drop to about 30 miles 
people who live in cities may think 50 miles visibility is 
great but for the grand canyon it makes a big difference hays 
said 
salt river project officials contend the canyons haze problem 
is more a result of smog blowing out of the los angeles basin and 
other sources federal officials agree but say the navajo 
generating station also is a prime contributor and a part of the 
problem that quickly can be fixed 
srp feels it is being unfairly singled out hays said but 
we have to start somewhere some people say these are sacred 
areas and if we cant protect them then the whole world must be 
falling apart 
the plant one of the largest coalfired facilities in the 
country does meet existing state and federal pollution standards 
and captures more than 99 percent of its ash srp spokeswoman teri 
morris said about 300 tons of sulfur dioxide slip through each 
day however 
we believe that navajo generating stations contribution to 
regional haze is negligible she said the amount of emission 
is in line with the size of the plant and the amount the state and 
federal regulations allow us to do 
on the other front us rep george miller dcalif has 
introduced legislation to alter bureau of reclamation operation of 
the glen canyon dam to protect the canyon downstream an 
environmental impact statement is being prepared this summer 
the bureau of reclamation miller said might as well be 
running hundreds of bulldozers down the canyon floor daily 
the park service says its surveys indicate there already are 
fewer beaches in the canyon and that there is no way to replenish 
them some rafters have been left stranded by the swings in water 
flow which sometimes fluctuate from 3000 to 30000 cubic feet per 
second in one day 
we feel were losing those beaches in that flushing action 
said grand canyon assistant superintendent john reed 
unless action is taken he said this will change the entire 
experience that people have on the colorado river and the most 
extreme change will be that those floating on the river will not be 
able to stop because the beaches will be gone 
the western area power administration an energy department 
agency that sells electricity from federal projects such as dams 
opposes millers legislation until studies already under way 
determine whether glen canyon dam is responsible for any beach 
erosion 
smoothing out the dams operation ultimately would result in 
higher electric costs for customers wapa officials said 
we are a part of the utility industry and we are always 
concerned with costs to our customers said deputy area manager 
ken maxey 
for lujan both issues present a dilemma because two agencies 
within his department are at odds with each other in both cases 
the national park service has clashed with the bureau of 
reclamation which is a part owner of the navajo generating station 
and the operator of the glen canyon dam 
the interior secretary has yet to take a stand on either issue 
asking for more study 
to environmentalists the tide is shifting in their favor at the 
grand canyon as concern over nature grows in the country 
babbitt a director of the grand canyon trust used the threats 
to the canyon as the focal point of a recent democratic national 
committee fundraising mass mailing 
ultimately these two issues are political issues the 
former presidential candidate said a lot of people in arizona 
and the nation are no longer willing to say generate electricity 
no matter what the cost

myrna hillyard 
remembers the moving experience of sitting alone at the grand 
canyon and studying the beauty but no more 
its much harder to be alone here you cant really have that 
solitary experience which is so special the elementary school 
principal says as she shepherds a class around the park 
cars orbit the parking lot in search of a space these days at 
the grand canyon tourists remain on shuttle buses for fear of 
losing a seat and postpone dinner until 9 pm to avoid the long 
restaurant lines 
as the population in the southwest has grown and the popularity 
of disneylandlas vegasgrand canyon tour packages has surged 
especially among foreign tourists the grand canyon national park 
now finds itself inundated with visitors short on staff and 
facilities and searching for solutions 
park officials expect more than 4 million visitors this year 
33 percent more than just five years ago the number of visitors 
has grown faster than at any other national park 
but bus service launched in 1974 in response to crowds then 
just 2 million a year actually has been cut back its funding 
sliced from 15 million to 620000 
fewer rangers are available for talks toilets are cleaned less 
often and roadside plants end up trampled by drivers who give up 
trying to find a parking space complaint letters are up 
were just not meeting the needs said park management 
assistant chuck lundy the demands on our facilities our 
restaurants our campgrounds or transportation have exceeded the 
abilities of the park 
at issue is whether park officials may some day be forced to 
limit the numbers allowed in daily to the most popular areas to 
preserve a memorable experience 
it is a dilemma were pleased people can come and see the 
grand canyon but were concerned about the quality of the 
experience lundy said we think the transition from what is 
expected to occur into what is unacceptable has begun to occur 
plans are in the works for a huge disneylandtype parking lot 
away from the park which would be serviced by shuttle buses lundy 
said 
yet while officials and some canyon protection groups fret over 
the crowds tourists say they have come to expect nothing else at 
major attractions 
its still so special and so wonderful id hate to see them 
limit it said mrs hillyard the principal from the fort apache 
indian reservation 
you expect lots of people and they really havent bothered us 
much cort lowerison of laguna calif said during a memorial 
day weekend visit we just eat in the off hours to avoid waiting 
in line

forget gary hart and donna rice you dont 
always need a politician and the other woman to titillate the 
imagination sometimes what goes on between a lawmaker and his wife 
is just as interesting 
and no less than the library of congress is offering a peep 
through the keyhole 
from september to march the library will display some of the 
most personal mail that ever traveled between members of congress 
and their wives over the last 200 years 
yes there was sex in washington in the nations formative 
years its described by rep job pierson dny to his wife 
clarissa on dec 17 1834 
it seems mrs piersons brother a us senator seduced a maid 
the first week of her employment and cohabitated with her during 
the whole session 
the other boarders were angry at this monopoly pierson 
wrote they enticed some four or five girls from a house of 
illfame who came there every night until the landladies 
ordered the servants to bar the doors against their admission 
other letters radiate laughter sadness courage love 
poignancy fear and that old bromide that a gal stands by her man 
there is only one woman the late rep clare booth luce rconn 
among the lawmakers featured in the exhibit which is part of the 
librarys bicentennial celebration of congress 
the letters discuss 
the role of women always be sunshine and flowers pierson 
counseled clarissa on feb 12 1833 but never worry about the 
price of wheat because such matters should be provided and 
regulated by the other sex 
spousal wit mark my magnanimity elizabeth woodbury wrote 
her jacksonian democrat husband sen levi woodbury of new 
hampshire on jan 3 1830 i here invest you with a 
carteblanche to bow to to smile upon or to flatter any lady you 
please without doing penance for it on paper 
spousal support you have rendered the world the greatest 
service you have used the power and opportunity for 
humanity and democracy belle case la follette wrote sen robert 
m la follette rwis on march 5 1917 it was the eve of 
americas entry into world war i and la follette had just fought 
bitterly under tremendous pressure against president wilsons 
proposal to arm us merchant ships 
society ladies sen woodbury writing to elizabeth on dec 19 
1829 that miss silsbee was flat as a pancake mrs munroe 
resembled the elephant her step an earthquake and her breath a 
storm and mrs polk thin as a hatchet and grown almost 
positively ugly 
the congressional pay raise of 1873 it was pushed through 
the senate during the final night using all sorts of parliamentary 
tricks according to sen carl schurz rmo he wrote his wife 
margarethe on march 5 1873 the entire operation was so 
shameless 
unflattering views of congress by those who served we dayly 
go to the capitol at about eleven oclock do little or nothing and 
return at about three oclock to dine sen simeon olcott wrote 
wife tryphena back in new hampshire on new years day 1802 
twentytwo years later andrew jackson then a democratic senator 
from tennessee wrote his wife rachel i am truly wearied with 
lounging here doing nothing but feeding on the public funds 
john j mcdonough a manuscript historian at the library said 
the exhibit will attempt to bring in the personal more intimate 
aspect of lawmakers lives into public view 
most of the letters were written when members didnt bring 
their wives to washington said marvin kranz an american history 
specialist

in 18 years on cbs the price is right 
televisions longestrunning network game show bob barker figures 
hes given away 90 million in prizes to 30000 contestants 
but he hasnt felt the urge to switch sides to join the 
contestants who try to guess the price of the prizes without 
guessing too high 
i know nothing about prices he said once a writer 
interviewing me brought a paper bag full of items and i couldnt 
get any of the prices he said i was on the right side of the 
microphone 
still barker understands the shows attraction everyone can 
identify with prices even the president of the united states 
viewers at home become involved because they all have an opinion on 
the bids 
sometimes it seems like the price is right has been popular 
since the start of recorded history the show began taping its 19th 
season on may 23 passing the previous champ whats my line 
it became a daytime show on cbs in 1972 and expanded to an hour in 
1975 and ran briefly in prime time in 1986 
of course this is merely the most recent incarnation which 
also ran briefly in prime time on cbs in 1986 in a different 
format the show ran from 19561965 in prime time first on nbc and 
then on abc with bill cullen as the host syndicated versions also 
ran during the 1970s and 1980s 
a few things have changed in the time barker has been associated 
with the show the prices for example in 18 years the tags on 
the automobiles have gone from four digits to 44000 and more 
the tanned whitehaired barker has been associated with two of 
the noisiest and most energetic game shows before price he 
spent 18 years as host of truth or consequences first on nbc 
and then in syndication 
truth or consequences was a stunt show so it was energetic 
by its own nature barker said the price is right has been 
described as an extravaganza people know theyre going to be part 
of a carnival they never know if theyre going to be a contestant 
until their name is called one of the producers interviews 
everyone and picks the ones he think will make the best 
contestants but the names are kept secret until the show starts 
barker worked in radio until ralph edwards heard him and asked 
him to audition as the host of truth or consequences 
ralph and i meet every year at 1205 pm on dec 21 to 
celebrate he said he hired me at that time in 1956 we have 
lunch and drink a toast to our many years together when we started 
it was live in new york at 11 oclock in the morning that meant i 
had to do it here at eight oclock 
the sign at the el capitan theater was free donuts and bob 
barker after four weeks on the job i got a firm contract and top 
billing over the doughnuts 
barker also spent 20 years as host of the miss usa pageant 
and the miss universe pageant barker an animalrights 
activist departed over the presentation of fur coats to the 
winners he said the pageants no longer award fur coats and have 
asked him to return no dice 
they publicize zoos and rodeos both of which i oppose he 
said 
fun facts about bob barker 
he has a redbelt in karate which is just below a black belt 
my first karate teacher was chuck norris i met him when he came 
on truth or consequences hed come to my house and kick me all 
over the garage then he would go to his acting classes i guess it 
worked out 
many people find it hard to believe that barker is his real 
name because in a sense he is a barker for the show they insist 
his name is baker 
so many people called me mr baker that i bought a basset 
hound and named him mr baker he said if anybody calls my 
house and asks to speak to speak to mr baker i put the dog on

at the very center of die hard a thriller sleeper from 
1988 was the heros sheer reliance on his wits and juryrigged 
defenses there were welldeveloped characters a strong human 
factor and a pronounced battle of wits as directed by john 
mctiernan who succeeded so well with the hunt for red october 
in renny harlins sequel maverick cop john mcclane bruce 
willis dissolves into a wisecracking james bond and high tech 
subs for imagination 
but diehard die hard fans neednt be too alarmed die 
hard 2 is filled with mouthdrying thrills and heartstopping 
chills highspeed chases on snowmobiles plane crashes sprayed 
bullets ribcrushing fights and lots of blood 
the action is played out at what filmmakers want us to think is 
dulles international airport outside of washington dc only 
problem it doesnt look like dulles and the filmmakers stupidly 
allow a closeup of a pay phone to reveal pacific bell very 
sloppy and since the movie was filmed at the alpena mich 
airport and in denver and washington state all the more reason to 
pay attention to details 
once again its christmas and mcclane is waiting for his wifes 
plane to land so they can spend the holiday together with her 
folks mcclane ever the eagleeyed cop notices some pretty 
suspicious guys milling about the airport carrying suspicious 
looking packages he sees one go to a restricted area and follows 
a gun fight follows one of the terrorists is killed and the 
airport is quickly propelled into a nightmare but mcclane is the 
only one aroused enoug to suspect more than holiday hankypanky 
a group of mercenaries out to protect our way of life as 
their leader proclaims has unleashed a string of horrors in order 
to abduct and spirit to safety a south american drug baron who is 
being brought to the united states to stand trial 
the terrorists set up shop near the airport tap into the 
control tower and assume command of runways and communication with 
airborne planes that are battling their way through a fierce snow 
storm 
here we find another interesting lapse on the part of the 
filmmakers the control tower immediately gives in to the 
terrorists and never once thinks to contact national airport 
spitting distance from dulles or baltimore international airport 
and have their control towers pick up the flights on their radar 
what this does is to dilute a sense of urgency and strain 
already strained credibility 
mcclane bumps heads with an idiot airport security chief 
finally teams with army special forces honchos led unconvincingly 
by john amos and races to a boiling climax 
along the way steven de souza and doug richardson provide some 
spirited and fun dialogue especially for willis when the agent at 
a rentacar counter allows him to use their fax machine so he can 
send the fingerprints of the dead terrorist to his pal al 
reginald veljohnson in lapd she asks him out for date his 
snappy reply as he flashes his wedding ring sorry just the fax 
miss 
theres also some nice caustic repartee on the plane between 
holly mcclane bonnie bedelia and the bozo tv reporter who almost 
got the mcclane family killed in die hard yes thornberg is 
back for the big scoop and william atherton is his smarmiest 
also back for a cameo is veljohnson with his twinkies his 
relationship with mcclane played so heavily and so well in the 
original unfortunately its been written out in the sequel 
tom bower does well as marvin a wacko janitor who sneaks 
mcclane around the airport and fred dalton thompson plays it 
straight as the airport chief trudeau 
there is too much reliance in die hard 2 on gimmicks and 
gadgets and characters from central casting such as the terrorist 
leader who works out naked muscles primed before going off to 
the mission mcclane does use his resourcefulness and it seems 
neverending just as the guy comes up for air he goes under again 
and comes back even stronger 
but where mcclane found himself in a crazed situation by 
accident in die hard hes superhero by choice in die hard 
2 this somehow makes it very different and lessens the 
sympathy or empathy we might have for him 
there are loads of laughs even when unintended by the 
filmmakers lots of raw macho action and a few surprises in this 
gordon companysilver pictures production and a lot of people 
probably wont want to fly again once they learn about the outer 
perimeter and that great parking lot in the sky 
produced by lawrence gordon joel silver and charles gordon 
die hard 2 is rated r for violence including an icicle 
impalement and language

when the founders of rykodisc formed the 
small recording label in 1984 they took the name from the japanese 
word ryko meaning sound from a flash of light 
the name reflects the companys niche as a label specializing in 
compact discs which use lasers to play distortionfree digital 
recordings 
the company borrowed more than its name from the orient 
rykodiscs slogan is were only in it for the music and the 
owners stress quality over quantity 
that philosophy has made the company a minor power in the music 
industry attracting artists such as david bowie and frank zappa 
in an era of giant music conglomerates and generic packaging 
rykodisc may be the wave of the future 
we use our size to our advantage said don rose 35 one of 
the founders and partners in the company people ask us how we 
can compete with the major labels and we tell them we dont 
compete were in a position to make a bigger splash on a smaller 
scale 
rykodisc specializes in rereleasing significant titles and 
digitally remastering them when possible adding extra tracks and 
elaborate packaging the eclectic label includes rock music 
socalled world music king sunny ade hamza el din reggae folk 
and jazz 
the company is expected to gross 20 million in sales this year 
up from 4 million in 1987 
rykodisc began as a cdonly label and rode the success of cds 
business boomed and it now issues cassette tapes and lps 
the companys two biggest coups came when it acquired the 
lucrative compact disc rights to the back catalogs of frank zappa 
and david bowie rykodisc proposed deluxe reissues on cd of their 
past hits which their own record companies had neglected to do 
after two years zappa agreed to go with rykodisc since then 
more than 20 zappa cds have been issued selling more than 1 
million units and resulting in zappas first grammy and first 
international tour in years 
the company signed bowie last year after months of 
negotiations rykodiscs release of changesbowie an update of 
bowies original greatest hits collection was its first title to 
go gold 
it was a fantastic opportunity for us said rose a 
softspoken yet intense man whose office includes piles of cds 
cassettes a digital audio tape recorder dat tapes a television 
and vcr bowies stature as a innovator is really second to 
none 
in overflowing offices that overlook salem harbor rose oversees 
a staff of 15 most of whom are in their late 20s and early 30s 
the atmosphere of the companys headquarters is quiet and casual 
the walls are decorated with music posters and cd boxes 
we view ourselves as music fans and our product comes from the 
fancollector point of view said rose 
rose has telephone conferences daily with his three partners 
based in philadelphia minneapolis and los angeles 
he has been working in the music industry since the age of 18 
when he bought the first of several record stores in the midwest 
after moving to bostons north shore in 1979 he formed a small 
label called eat records 
rykodisc hopes to acquire the back catalogs of other established 
artists it also has signed new talent like australias screaming 
tribesmen in the hope of finding a breakthrough smash group that 
can make a record company 
rykodisc also founded the proenvironment ban the box 
movement calling for elimination of the elaborate 10inchlong 
boxes cds are sold in rose said the us is the only country to 
package cds that way primarily to discourage shoplifters and allow 
retailers to use their old lp shelves the ban the box movement 
advocates the sale of cds in their small cover boxes

forstmann little amp co plans to buy cable 
television equipment maker general instrument corp for 16 
billion in the latest sign of a mild resurgence in corporate 
buyouts 
the takeover business has been languishing in recent months 
largely due to lack of interst in junk bonds the highyield and 
highrisk securities sold to finance many of the deals of the 
1980s several recent deals however have been announced by 
companies drawing on their own cash or more conservative bank loans 
to finance the takeovers 
half the money for the general instrument buyout announced 
monday will come from forstmann littles 23 billion acquisition 
fund whose investors are mainly large corporate pension funds 
theodore j forstmann general partner of the investment firm 
said the rest will will come from a group of banks led by 
manufacturers hanover trust co he said 
because of forstmann littles ability to employ a uniquely 
conservative capital structure all of the companies it has 
previously acquired have been able to continue to invest in their 
future forstmann said in a prepared statement 
the general instrument buyout would be the second for forstmann 
little this year and the 17th in its 12year history since it got 
into the leveraged buyout business forstmann little has acquired 
about 10 billion worth of companies 
about four months ago it was a partner in the 825 million 
acquisition of chrysler corps gulfstream aerospace corp 
forstmann said hopes to strengthen its acquisition fund this 
summer which could mean even more acquisitions later in the year 
were in an extremely strong position he said 
news of the general instrument deal sent the companys stock 
over the 4450 per share offer price to close at 4525 up 875 
in active composite new york stock exchange trading monday 
forstmann little officials and stock market analysts said they 
didnt see the runup as a sign that a competing bid might surface 
im not sure with the drying up up of the junk bond market who 
else will be able to put something like this together said jay 
samstag an analyst with duff amp phelps inc 
general instrument has agreed to amend its shareholders rights 
plan or poison pill and to pay forstmann little 33 million 
in the event that its board of directors accepts a higher bid 
under the terms of the merger agreement set to expire aug 13 
forstmann little will assume or refinance general instruments 
existing debt in addition to acquiring the outstanding common 
shares 
general instrument chairman frank g hickey said the board was 
urging shareholders to sell their stock because this all cash 
offer provides an excellent value 
forstmann said there were no immediate plans to reorganize 
management or sell any portions of general instrument 
forstman said his firm was particularly attracted to general 
instruments broadband communications division which provided 60 
percent of the companys revenue last year 
general instruments products include cable tv subscriber 
terminals cable and scrambling equipment 
the company has a very strong dominant core business with both 
reasonably predictable cash flow and growth potential forstmann 
told a news conference forstmann said reregulation of cable 
television was likely to take place soon and that could prove 
helpful for the industry 
general instrument which employs 14200 also produces aircraft 
surveillance equipment and semiconductors through its data systems 
and components products divisions 
general instrument earned 232 million or 84 cents a share in 
the first quarter on 3795 million in revenue earnings were 29 
percent higher the previous years quarter largely due to gains 
from the sale of discontinued operations the remaining portion of 
a major restructuring

to the likes of robert campeau and donald trump 
add ralph ingersoll ii 
the publisher like the developers built an empire with 
highyield junk bonds and got into trouble when the massive 
interest payments started to catch up with him 
on monday ingersoll agreed to trade his us interests and 
their troublesome debt burden to his investment partners he gets 
control of a smaller group of european newspapers 
ingersoll said the deal was driven by a desire to get more 
involved in european publishing 
but bankers and investors with knowledge of ingersolls business 
said the publishers buying spree of daily and weekly newspapers 
left him with too much debt to weather the nationwide slump in 
advertising revenue 
he has an unworkable balance sheet said james rubin an 
analyst at md sass investors services a new york investment 
firm md sass successfully urged bondholders to reject 
ingersolls bid to work out his debt troubles this spring 
ingersoll is relinquishing his stake in three companies that 
publish dozens of daily and weekly newspapers including the new 
haven register and the trentonian of trenton nj to the new 
york investment firm em warburg pincus amp co the two had been 
joint owners although ingersoll had voting control 
warburg pincus gains full control of ingersoll newspapers inc 
which publishes nine dailies and 53 weeklies new haven acquisition 
co publisher of the register and community newspapers inc 
which has newspapers in ohio and on new yorks long island 
ingersoll will gain control of a group of british and irish 
newspapers that he controlled jointly with warburg pincus 
the announcement came as community newspapers said it would not 
make a july 1 interest payment on its 125 million in 13 percent 
junk bonds ingersoll had been trying for months to buy back the 
bonds at a steep discount to alleviate his debt burden 
a banker involved in the buyback negotiations said the deal 
might not help bondholders because warburg pincus isnt obliged to 
cover community newspapers debts and has said it wont 
if no payment is made in 30 days bondholders can force the 
company into involuntary bankruptcy 
warburg officials did not return repeated calls for comment in 
a statement announcing the deal chairman and chief executive 
lionel pincus said only that he hoped community newspapers would be 
able to work out its problems with bondholders 
in a telephone interview ingersoll said the three us 
companies were on track to make 100 million in profits before 
taxes and interest this year on revenue of 400 million 
we are having a record year despite the economy he said 
the companies could have serviced their debt if not for the 
collapse of the junk bond market which hit bonds like community 
newspapers especially hard ingersoll said 
the company issued its bonds in 1987 with a relatively low 
interest rate by promising to set a new rate this year that would 
guarantee the bonds would trade at 101 cents on the dollar 
the bonds were quoted at about 50 cents on the dollar on monday 
down about 9 cents to push the price up to 101 cents suggests the 
company would have to pay a new interest rate of near 30 percent 
that burden would choke any company he said 
community newspapers said monday it would not reset the interest 
rate on july 7 as it was scheduled to do 
the announcement comes a little more than two months after 
ingersoll folded the st louis sun a new tabloid that he hoped 
would revolutionize the slumping newspaper market by using new 
technology and marketing strategies 
the british and irish newspapers ingersoll is gaining have 
combined circulations exceeding 1 million and annual revenue of 
178 million 
europe offers great opportunities because of the planned 
dropping of trade barriers in western europe and the spread of 
freemarket economics in the east ingersoll said 
the new europe will grow very very quickly he said its 
the new frontier 
ingersoll said he planned to expand onto the european continent 
in 1991 probably in italy 
he also said he wasnt giving up on the united states and 
planned to start or acquire a magazine here in 1991

federal securities regulators have unveiled 
their plan to distribute 19 million to alleged victims of what the 
securities and exchange commission charges was a massive 1988 
insider trading scheme 
the sec filed a proposed plan in a new york court monday for 
distributing the money allegedly obtained in what at the time was 
the secondlargest insider trading case in us history 
fred c lee agreed to pay the money but neither admitted nor 
denied any wrongdoing to settle a civil suit brought by the sec 
in 1988 the sec accused lee a taiwanese national living in 
hong kong and stephen k wang a junior analyst in the mergers 
department at morgan stanley amp co of engaging in a 19 million 
insider trading scheme 
at the time the charges were filed the case was second only to 
the 100 million settlement of disgraced stock speculator ivan f 
boesky both have since been eclipsed by the settlements of drexel 
burnham lambert inc and junk bond financier michael milken 
wang who was 24 at the time pleaded guilty in september 1988 
to one count each of securities wire and mail fraud for taking 
about 200000 to funnel confidential information to lee about at 
least 25 takeover deals that morgan stanley was handling there was 
no allegation of wrongdoing by morgan stanley which suspended and 
later fired wang wang was sentenced to eight months in prison 
although he agreed to settle civil charges with the sec lee has 
not answered a criminal indictment stemming from the sec 
investigation 
as part of his settlement last august lee agreed to pay 19 
million into a fund to reimburse investors defrauded by the scheme 
he also agreed to pay the government 15 million in fines and 45 
million in back taxes with interest 
as of april 16 the receivership fund plus accrued interest 
totaled 203 million according to the sec 
in papers filed at federal court in manhattan the sec proposed 
reimbursing investors who sold securities in 18 different companies 
on the same day the defendants bought those securities

most of the nations five options trading 
exchanges say they will comply with federal securities regulators 
request for another delay in plans to list stock options on more 
than one exchange 
it was the second delay requested by the securities and exchange 
commission which last january asked the exchanges to voluntarilly 
hold off on multiple listings until june 30 
a stock option is a contract giving the right but not the 
obligation to buy or sell a certain security at a specified price 
by a certain date options are traded on stocks listed on exchanges 
or traded overthecounter via computer 
unlike stocks options provide no voting rights in running a 
company or dividends only the potential to profit from the 
stocks price movement 
traditionally an option could be listed at only one exchange 
but under multiple listing all the options exchanges could deal in 
any option 
in a letter to the five options exchanges sec chairman richard 
c breeden asked them to hold off until oct 1 on listing options 
that are already being traded on another exchange 
the sec hopes the exchanges can come up with a joint plan for 
linking the exchanges electronically by sept 21 breeden said 
last week breeden said the sec has the authority by law to 
order the exchanges to accept any linkage system but the agency 
prefers to have the exchanges develop the system 
the june 29 letter to the heads of the chicago board of options 
exchange and the american new york pacific and philadelphia stock 
exchanges was disclosed monday by the sec 
officials at the philadelphia american new york and pacific 
stock exchanges said they would honor breedens request 
but the chicago board of options said it would be 
inappropriate to comment publicly before informing the sec of 
its stance 
until january most options on stocks listed on an exchange were 
traded exclusively in one marketplace the privelege for trading a 
specific option was assigned to an exchange by lottery a system 
the exchanges favored but the sec felt was uncompetitive 
but a rule passed by the sec last year to ensure customers would 
get the best possible price abolished the limitations on multiple 
trading of options all new options those listed for trading after 
january can be traded on any options exchange 
last week breeden said a system linking the exchanges was 
feasible and that four of the five exchanges had agreed to operate 
a system called pipe for public investor privileged express the 
philadelphia stock exchange supports a different system the 
auction intermarket system which is similar in most instances but 
has the added factor of time priority 
if more than one exchange shows the same price for an option 
the philadelphia system would send the order to the exchange that 
posted that price first the pipe version would allow the exchange 
where the order was first directed to match that price 
weve suggested a compromise to the other exchanges and the 
sec said nicholas giordano president of the philadelphia 
exchange 
under the plan the pipe system could be used as long as it 
lists only post jan 22 stock options and can evolve into a 
timeprice system 
giordano said that if pipe turns out to be more competitive than 
the auction intermarket system the philadelphia excahange will go 
along with the others

european community group 
the changes are effective aug 1 
industry observers said ivester hunter and cooper are among 
cokes brightest stars and they could rise higher in the next few 
years 
i think thats the issue with coke over the next five years 
who will rise to the upper echelon some of the very senior guys at 
coke are getting older said hugh s zurkuhlen an analyst who 
follows cocacola for salomon bros in new york 
we now know with some degree of definitiveness who are the key

co said jesse meyers publisher of the industry newsletter 
beverage digest 
the management changes are part of the companys natural

gives us the latitude to make changes like this he said when 
you have people that capable you want to broaden their 
experience

european distribution system and has been one of the companys top 
young executives 
ivesters european community group which accounts for nearly 
onequarter of cokes international gallon sales recorded 11

track at the cocacola co meyers said from his office in 
greenwich conn his financial background is excellent and now 
his operational skills are excellent 
hunter also has had success at cocacola meyers said running 
various division since joining the company in 1967 
hunter 52 is clearly marked as one of the major 
international executives who in a relatively short time will be a 
key corporate executive meyers said 
zurkuhlen said he did not expect to see any significant changes 
in cokes operations after mondays announced changes 
the company hasnt changed from an operational standpoint all 
that much in the past decade he said the focus is on 
increasing consumption of soft drinks around the world 
the news that keough was sticking around until 1993 was welcome 
news said zurkuhlen 
from most peoples perspective keough is a class act who 
understands just about every aspect of the company zurkuhlen 
said

southland corp owner of the 7eleven convenience 
store chain has revealed details of a proposed restructuring it 
hopes will enable the company to avoid bankruptcy court 
in a filing monday with the securities and exchange commission 
the company proposed swapping one share of common stock for 10 
shares of new stock issued to current bondholders through the 
restructuring 
we feel that would be a key point to the bondholders who 
would like to see some liquidity in the shares they receive 
southland spokeswoman cecilia norwood said 
southland has been staggering under debt accumulated in a 49 
billion leveraged buyout and increased competition in the 
convenience store business 
the company already has missed 69 million in interest payments 
and could be forced into bankruptcy on july 15 
in march the company proposed a restructuring that included a 
400 million infusion of money from itoyokado inc and 7eleven 
japan co in exchange for 75 percent ownership of the company 
holders of about 18 billion in bonds also would new securities 
worth about 550 million 
bondholders objected however in large part because the 
founding thompson family retained about 15 percent ownership in the 
restructured company 
a revised proposal was presented last month decreasing thompson 
holdings to about 6 percent and raising bondholders share from 
about 10 percent to about 18 percent 
the revision also increases interest paid on the new securities 
and shortens the maturities 
mondays filing details how the new bonds and common stock would 
be parceled out to current bondholders 
southland said it did not begin negotiations with the 
bondholders until monday but believes an agreement will be reached 
by the july 15 deadline 
the restructuring must be approved by holders of 95 percent of 
the value of the bonds and other creditors 
over the next 10 days there will be a lot of discussions and 
i thinks well reach an agreement said john gordon chairman of 
the bondholders steering committee 
but david glatstein president of a dallas investment firm that 
owns some of the southland bonds disagreed i dont know a 
bondholder whos willing to accept this deal this thing is going 
to bankruptcy court the only thing thatll keep it out is if the 
company decides to make its interest payments

dealers said the dollars fall was driven by strong movement 
into british pounds following widespread speculation that the pound 
would soon enter the european monetary systems exchange rate 
mechanism 
sterling rose against the dollar to levels last seen in february 
1989 
the latest interest in the pound was prompted by a statement 
monday by karl otto poehl president of the west german bundesbank 
during a speech at londons institute of economic affairs 
poehl was reported as saying he expected britains entry into 
the mechanism soon 
the word appeared in an advance version of the speech released

his address instead he said the timing of britains entry would 
be the decision of the british government

there have been attempts to take profit in sterling a few times 
today it hasnt worked it looks like sterling still wants to go 
higher 
in london the british pound rose to 17800 from 17635 late 
monday in new york sterling was quoted at 17794 at midday

northwest airlines chairman alfred checchi 
has requested a meeting with the international association of 
machinists to discuss the possibility of northwest buying eastern 
airlines a union spokesman said today 
everything is just exploratory at this point said jim 
conley a spokesman for the machinists union in washington 
officials at eagan minnbased northwest would not comment on 
whether eastern is a possible takeover target checchi repeatedly 
has made public his intention to expand the carrier possibly by 
buying an entire airline or parts of one 
two weeks ago checchi made his most direct public comments on 
the issue its fair to say we have our eyes open and maybe our 
mouths a little bit open as we see what opportunities are there 
checchi said june 20 at a news conference announcing frederick b 
rentschler as northwests new chief executive officer 
he declined to identify possible targets 
conley said machinists union officials met monday in washington 
to discuss the problems of integrating the eastern employees into 
the northwest operation he said the meeting was a prelude to a 
meeting with checchi but said he does not know when that meeting 
will take place 
there probably wont be an announcement on when the meeting 
will occur he said 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the possibility of merging 
with northwest has come up before and noted eastern employees 
received a briefing note in late june 
he said the employees were told easterns desire is to create 
a successful independent airline but its impossible to rule out 
a merger or buyout 
the employees were told in the memo that pan am and northwestern 
had shown interest but meetings and discussions would not indicate 
an imminent takeover matell said he did not know of any machinists 
meetings with northwestern 
the leader of the machinists union at eastern frank ortis 
said a northwesteastern merger would be a great marriage

here is an icy thought that oddly might make a 
hot summer seem even hotter the savings and loan bailout which 
could cost taxpayers 300 billion may be just the tip of the 
iceberg 
if the tip is equal to a sum of that size the single most 
expensive governmental cost in peacetime then how massive must the 
bulk of the berg be 
conceivably in the trillions of dollars says economist ronald 
utt who points out that financial obligations of agencies 
underwritten by the federal government now total 58 trillion 
and much of that obligation is in bad shape says utt vice 
president of the us chamber foundation a former employee of the 
white house office of management and budget and a former heritage 
foundation fellow 
potentially he says these financial obligations represent a 
staggering breakdown of government and a growing number of 
critics are saying the lack of public information on the matter 
represents a communications breakdown 
most people it seems safe to say cannot imagine that other 
financial breakdowns are threatened reasoning that if that were so 
they would have heard of them but that logic breaks as throroughly 
as the communications 
the obligations utt refers to are spread among deposit insurance 
programs loan and pension guarantees direct loan programs such as 
those administered by the small business administration and debts 
of five government enterprises 
utts chilling observations are contained in a paper written for 
heritage a conservative think tank whose opinions sometimes have 
been influential in the bush and reagan administrations 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp says utt is by no 
means the only federal credit program confronted with huge losses 
the federal deposit insurance corp and federal housing 
administration lost money in 1988 and 1989 and seemed destined to 
lose again in 1990 the fha he says has seen the level of claims 
against its shrinking reserves rise nearly three times in three 
years 
further he states half of the farm loans made by the farmers 
home administration are in default and half of these defaulted 
loans have been in that condition for more than three years 
on and on it goes 
the federal government he notes stands behind nearly 500 
million in guaranteed veterans administration and fha mortgages 
48 billion in guaranteed student loans 
and a host of other guarantees ranging from rural 
electrification to shipbuilding loans and from small business 
disaster loans to loans for building plants to convert grain to 
ethanol 
all together he estimates the contingent liability associated 
with loan and deposit guarantees totaled 35 trillion at the end 
of fiscal 1988 and other insurance programs flood insurance for 
instance add 500 million more 
how could such massive obligations not rise to the surface and 
break more forecfully into the media how can such dangers lurk so 
near and not cause more concern 
utt doesnt have an answer to those questions but he does 
suggest that both congress and taxpayers played a role 
most lawmakers he says tried to convince americans that the 
crisis was just an isolated incident and that the vast bulk of the 
government credit programs are wellmanaged and pose little risk to 
the taxpayer 
and for their part many taxpasyers have wished this to be so 
it isnt says utt who advocates passage of an omnibus credit 
solvency act to fundamentally restructure these many programs in 
order to reduce taxpayer exposure to costly program failures 
before it is too late he adds

a canadian oil pipeline company said 
tuesday it will seek to build a pipeline under the environmentally 
sensitive waters of puget sound to keep tanker traffic out of the 
narrow rocky channels 
trans mountain pipe line co ltd revived an idea rejected a 
decade ago by environmentalists and the state after a bitter fight 
friends of the earth director dave ortman said the new proposal 
likely will draw the same powerful opposition 
the announcement made in vancouver british columbia followed 
by hours the release of a regional oilspill task force report that 
recommends serious consideration of an offshore terminal and 
pipeline to reduce the risk of oil spills in puget sound 
trans mountain proposes building a 500 million offshore 
terminal and connecting pipeline at low point which is about 12 
miles west of port angeles on the olympic peninsula the company 
said the terminal would service 350 tankers and barges annually 
allowing them to unload there instead of entering the rosario 
strait and the strait of georgia 
the terminal also could be used to load tankers with crude oil 
piped from canada that oil currently is hauled by tanker from 
vancouver the company said 
a new pipeline from the terminal would connect with existing 
pipelines to refineries in northern puget sound and also with 
existing pipeline at burlington wash the company said the 
pipeline would run underwater for part of its route 
trans mountain first proposed an offshore terminal near low 
point in 1981 as part of a proposal to transport alaska crude oil 
to midwestern states the plan finally was killed as 
environmentally unfeasible trans mountain will use much of its 
earlier environmental analysis to support its new endeaver 
spokesman dick stokes said 
ortman a veteran of the earlier environmental fight said 
environmentalists would fight the new proposal too its time to 
think about not accommodating the oil industry in puget sound 
either by pipeline or tanker he said 
but a regional task force said that given increasing traffic of 
crude oil in the sound a solid way to reduce the risk of spills 
may be to move crude oil by pipeline instead of tankers

sharon goodwin doesnt exactly get paid 
to drink on the job just sip 
theres always plenty to be tasted said goodwin supervisor 
of the sensory evaluation department at brownforman corp one of 
the nations leading makers and wholesalers of alcoholic beverages 
the louisvillebased company produces or markets such brands as 
bolla wines korbel champagne and southern comfort liquor 
the company also owns jack daniels tennessee whiskey and early 
times old style kentucky whisky the nations second and 
thirdbest selling bourbontype whiskeys 
brownformans sensory lab is jammed with expensive gadgets that 
measure analyze and evaluate various aspects of the spirits but 
company officials seem to agree that the human taste bud is in no 
immediate danger of being replaced by a machine 
flavor has been an art over the years and theyre trying to 
make a science out of it said wes hazel brownformans 
analytical lab manager theyre trying to replace the tasters 
but i seriously dont think we can ever do that 
daily production of early times and old forester bourbon at the 
companys louisville distillery runs about 450 55gallon barrels 
the jack daniels distillery in lynchburg tenn produces about 
1500 casks daily 
we taste every days product said dr john e bujake 
brownformans vice president of research and development so 
theres a lot of tasting going on 
to ensure consistency goodwins 10 expert tasters oversee the 
progress of the whiskey through each stage of production they 
sample the liquor from the white product the pure distillate 
before aging to the mature bourbon which spends between three 
and five years in charred oak casks 
a separate group of tasters in the quality control department 
tests the product several times during blending and after bottling 
almost all of the 1000 employees except machine operators 
at brownformans louisville campus are potential tasters 
but apparently not all of them are whiskey lovers goodwin has 
had to use innovative ways to entice people into her tasting 
booths including raffling off china tickets to sporting events 
and even free parking spaces 
goodwin said it takes about three months to train someone to 
rate the product once the tasters are trained the company wants 
to keep them forever she said 
but the term taster is a bit misleading 
the smell is about 95 percent of what someones going to give 
you your rating on she said their goal is to describe what 
theyre smelling 
to help the workers describe the aromas the department is 
working on a series of standard keywords they range anywhere from 
juicy fruit for a taste resembling the chewing gum and 
woody to urine and cow manure 
the samples are 125 proof or about 63 percent alcohol goodwin 
said they are watered down to 20 percent alcohol for the tastings 
tasters arent supposed to swallow the product but some do she 
said goodwin acknowledged that she swallows some of the product 
but if she drank everything she tasted id never make it home 
goodwin said she is a bourbon drinker on her own time but many 
of the tasters dont drink outside the office 
ive worked here a year and a half and ive never gotten 
drunk while im here said dave dafoe a product development 
specialist and one of the expert tasters i appreciate good 
bourbons but i dont enjoy them

the stock markets best known index posted its 
fifth consecutive gain on tuesday to finish above 2900 once again 
as prices in the broader market also moved higher on the eve of the 
independence day holiday 
the gains came in typically sluggish preholiday trading 
however the us financial markets will be closed wednesday and 
many traders got a head start 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which rose 1857 points 
on monday added another 1237 to close at 291163 
it has risen in each of the past five sessions and its closing 
level surpassed the 2900 mark for the first time since it finished 
at 290173 on june 21 the record dow jones close was set june 15 
at 293589 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
834 up 650 down and 503 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 13005 million 
shares down from 13020 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 16123 million shares 
analysts attributed the rise in stocks to seasonal readjustments 
of investment portfolios along with the start of the third quarter 
institutional investors such as pension funds they said were 
looking for good values among bluechip stocks as part of midyear 
reallocations of funds 
we have some seasonal factors at work here said newton d 
zinder a veteran market analyst for shearson lehman hutton he 
cautioned against readung too much into the advance 
but gene jay seagle a top technical market analyst at gruntal 
financial inc said he was encouraged that the dow jones 
industrials managed to stay above 2900 without prompting 
programdriven selling by professionals trying to make a profit on 
price differences between stocks and stock futures 
i would expect a resumption of the up move and a test of the 
highs he said referring to postholiday trading 
the market appeared to shrug aside the commerce departments 
report that orders to factories for manufactured goods rose 21 
percent in may offsetting a revised 21 percent decline the 
previous month 
the rise was widely expected and market watchers said traders 
are more intent on employment figures for june which are to be 
released on friday the monthly reports on employment give the 
markets their first official glimpse of economic activity in the 
preceding month and often contain information that affects stock 
and bond prices 
philip morris was the most active issue on the nyse rising to 
48 
several utility issues were also actively traded evidently to 
capture dividends central maine power rose lsqb to 18 entergy

marvin b roffman says he learned as a child 
how to read stock tables at his grandmothers knee and later loved 
his job as a stock analyst so much that he stood up to donald trump 
and lost 
the securities analyst was fired by the investment firm janney 
montgomery scott inc after he told a newspaper that trumps new 
casino could encounter trouble because the economics of it were 
flawed 
what roffman already knew trumps lenders eventually found out 
and the flamboyant developer had to renegotiate his enormous debts 
but that didnt mean roffman got his job back 
an analyst has to be independent and be allowed to express an 
opinion even if its negative roffman said 
the 50yearold janney montgomery vice president was terminated 
march 23 over his critique of trumps taj mahal casino resort in 
atlantic city nj one of the most extravagant structures into 
the gaming business 
the analyst told the wall street journal the casino would 
flourish for awhile after opening in april but once the cold 
winds blow from october to february it wont make it the market 
just isnt there 
trump threatened janney montgomery with a lawsuit unless roffman 
publicly retracted the comme a matter for the government of the 
philippines to determine but he added that the us immigration 
and naturalization services june 16 1989 departure control 
order prohibiting mrs marcos from leaving the country remained 
in effect 
he said the ban was based on the potential for destabilizing 
activity should she return to manila as well as the legal 
problems here

it began as a secret project to create an 
affordable durable subcompact with 60milepergallon efficiency 
that would leapfrog the japanese and vault the nations biggest 
automaker into the 1990s and beyond 
eight years later general motors corps saturn has transmuted 
into a significantly larger pricier car with a lower mileage 
rating a less ambitious production schedule and an audience of 
skeptics 
gms showcase saturn project has in many respects become a test 
of whether american industry can adapt and beat the makers of 
hondas and toyotas at what they do best luring american consumers 
just how gm intends to convince the buying public that saturn is 
superior remains to be seen 
gm chairman roger smith saturns most enthusiastic supporter 
has said he plans to be at the wheel of the premiere model when it 
rolls off the assembly line at the saturn complex in spring hill 
tenn later this summer 
but gm officials have declined to specify a date for the worlds 
first good look at a massproduced saturn or whether they even 
plan a rollout ceremony models are supposed to arrive in dealer 
showrooms by fall 
the saturn saga began in june 1982 when gm put its best brains 
to work on a hushhush project aimed at revolutionizing carmaking 
in the united states they codenamed it saturn after the us 
rocket that helped overcome the soviet lead in space exploration 
about 2 years later smith formally established saturn corp 
calling it the key to gms longterm competitivness survival and 
success 
since then curiosity and publicity have been diluted by 
impatience cynicism setbacks and design alterations the 60 mpg 
6000 subcompact prototype wonder that smith flaunted became a 35 
mpg 10000 compact with no obvious advantages over foreign rivals 
gms initial investment of 5 billion shrank to 3 billion it 
halved the number of workers to 3000 and the annual production 
from 500000 to 250000 
there also have been suggestions of infighting between gm 
executives and their subordinates at saturn who originally were 
given wide latitude to move more quickly and responsively than at 
their fat lumbering parent in detroit 
nonetheless the goal has remained basically unchanged build 
and sell a car that can recapture a market gm has lost to its 
competitors mainly the fiercely efficient japanese 
its a lot more than just another 250000 units said joseph 
phillippi who follows the automotive industry for shearson lehman 
hutton inc the new york investment firm its the whole 
process the completely integrated manufacturing nature 
saturns underlying premise is a clean sheet approach to 
carmaking nothing in gms manufacturing past was required for use 
in saturn design and engineering approaches for the car were to be 
all new 
if successful the saturn project holds tremendous potential for 
the us auto industry 
one of detroits main frustrations which saturn presumably will 
overcome is the lengthy time it takes to bring a new car to 
market especially when consumer tastes can shift rapidly japan is 
seen as the leader in what the industry calls quick product 
turnaround time usually three years or less 
some saturn critics have said quick turnaround is exactly what 
saturn lacks its taken eight years to produce a threeyear car 
but saturn president richard g lefauve has said that time was 
needed to be sure the car was right for importconscious buyers 
we had to make constant adjustments to make the car more 
responsive he said most people think of it as a domestic 
product this car is not really a domestic in that it is not 
designed in a domestic sense 
the saturn complex that now occupies the rolling horsefarm 
country of tennessee is an experiment in automotive 
selfsufficiency the plant has its own stamping plants powertrain 
assembly and foundries 
but perhaps the most farreaching innovation is saturns labor 
agreement with the united auto workers union workers are organized 
into teams with broad decisionmaking powers and responsibilities 
they receive hundreds of hours of training and are expected to 
understand the economics behind each car 
it leapfrogs the japanese structure and the european 
structure said mike bennett president of saturns uaw local 
1853 if there is a new direction for the uaw its in spring 
hill tennessee 
saturns factory laborers come from gm plants or layoff lists in 
32 states and 136 gm locations but they are working under a 
contract that their 500000 fellow autoworker unionists would find 
alien the chief differences 
the contract has no specific expiration date exactly one year 
from the date of job 1 management and labor may begin modifying 
the contract if necessary on a daybyday basis 
saturn workers have a hand in design of the vehicle and the 
factory itself 
job classifications which number in the dozens in traditional 
automobile factories have been pared to a few 
saturn workers get paid 80 percent of the wages other uaw 
members receive but are eligible for bonuses depending on the 
cars success 
elements of the contract could spread to other auto plants if 
saturn proves successful 
if we see other plants adopt less job classification 
categories that would be a mark of success said automotive 
analyst scott merlis of morgan stanley amp co in new york 
gms most immediate concerns are whether saturn sells and who 
buys it 
the cars current estimated price hurls it against some of the 
toughest competition in the us car market in which gm will not 
only be battling with other automakers but itself as well gms 
most popular models the fourdoor chevrolet corsica and twodoor 
beretta are in the same price range 
that means gm must attract the import buyer the company has 
said it hopes 80 percent of saturn buyers will be import owners 
the bottom line is that if you are driving a honda or toyota 
corolla today you are going to feel very comfortable in a saturn 
car lefauve says if youre driving a chevrolet cavalier or 
something else in that area you arent going to feel that 
comfortable 
but many automotive analysts remain skeptical about saturns 
ability to change an entrenched preference for imports gms 
passenger car market share has shrunk from about 44 percent to 33 
percent just in the time since the saturn project was conceived 
while the japanese share has risen from 19 percent to about 25 
percent 
moreover industry studies continually show a growing american 
preference for the reliability of japanese cars just this past 
week for example jd power and associates a respected industry 
research firm said its study of 1990 buyers found that owners of 
japanese models were the happiest 
david healy who follows the auto industry for barclays bank in 
new york said he would consider saturn successful if it were able 
to derive less than half its market from wouldbe buyers of other 
gm cars 
otherwise healy said saturn may be an artistic success and a 
financial failure

thomas ohara was a good student at wayne state 
university but he didnt graduate near the top of his class which 
meant he was lucky to land an accountants job at 15 a week 
those were the gray days of 1936 in the midst of the great 
depression and just before the great war a time when communism 
seemed on the way up and american spirits on the way down 
oharas spirits didnt succumb better red than dead was a 
common slogan at the time but it made no sense to him my goal 
was to catch the fast movers the guys making 18 a week he said 
fred russell a young fellow with little cash and big hopes 
provided the opportunity an investment club to be guided by george 
nicholson jr a stockbroker not long out of harvard business 
school 
russells hope was that each member would invest 10 a month and 
that the total would be invested in stocks it was 1940 
fifty 50 years later ohara and his wife eleanor were among two 
dozen kitchentable investors who gathered earlier this year to 
dine on filet mignon and celebrate the golden anniversary of the 
mutual investment club of detroit 
in the 600 months since 1940 club members have invested 
227877 their joint portfolio now is worth 180125592 
that appreciation is even more dramatic considering club member 
withdrawals over the years more than 1 million to finance 
businesses homes college educations travel retirement 
the story of the mutual investment club reflected in the 
fruitful lives of ohara and his coinvestors is a lesson in the 
wisdom of oldfashioned thrift which fell far out of fashion in 
the booming 1980s 
the investment club is a mix of old and young don danko 
president is 43 bob bilke a mere 28 and ken janke jr just 32 
oharas two sons are members too in contrast 10 of the 22 
members are 70 or older 
the combination works well if youth has dreams age has 
experience where younger members sparkle with hope older ones 
glow with knowledge they complement each other 
the detroit club became the nucleus of the national association 
of investors corp of which ohara is chairman and ken janke sr 
president based in royal oak mich it has 126000 members 
14631 as individuals the rest in 6933 clubs 
most follow simple rules members make small monthly 
contributions usually between 10 and 50 and they reinvest all 
dividends withdrawals are allowed if contributions continue 
nicholson 83 now revered as the founding father of the 
international investment club movement laid down the rules back in 
1940 
invest regularly usually each month 
reinvest all dividends 
invest in growth companies those growing faster than their 
industries and the general economy 
other principles were developed diversifying because stocks 
ripen at varying times and biological testing to determine 
whether management is young enough to maintain performance for at 
least five years 
club members propose stocks for study and after the reports are 
in they vote typically shares are assigned to members on the 
basis of their total contributions and each month the share values 
are determined 
underlying the investment clubs way of doing things is the 
conviction that economic fluctuations the kind that cause so much 
excitement on wall street are of little concern to longterm 
investors on main street 
americas growth is strong they reason and when all the ups 
and downs are averaged out the arrow still points up when markets 
are up club assets rise when markets are down the same amount of 
money buys more shares 
investors who try to outguess the market arent likely to win 
says ohara a quiet man whose logic speaks profoundly he puts it 
this way 
the stock market is not important its the businesses the 
business effort might not be reflected in the stock market 
immediately but eventually it will 
look at individual companies and have confidence the market 
will recognize value it always has 
most of the time the gains are more steady than spectacular but 
sometimes a stock takes off 
the detroit club bought american cement later to become amcord 
at about 275 a share and sold six years later at 32 with the 
proceeds it bought kennecott copper at 25 and sold two years later 
at about 63 
more recently the club has become a large holder in american 
family an insurer selling now at more than 15 a share the clubs 
average acquisition price was about 1 a share 
soon after joining the detroit club ohara was drafted and sent 
to iceland with little to buy he doubled his contributions to 20 
a month and continued to do so throughout the war 
russell rejected for service by a heart condition invested the 
money of ohara and other members by the end of 1946 the record 
read contributions 5080 withdrawals 2519 holdings 15354 
not bad for wartime and the notsocertain prospects for the 
postwar period

after a slump the value rose to 33222 by 1952 despite 
withdrawals the value nearly doubled again by 1955 once more by 
the end of the decade and again in 1965 when it reached 246738 
by the end of 1969 after deposits of 75327 over the years 
the portfolio was worth 535604 a critical mass had been 
assembled the dividends always reinvested now totaled more each 
year than member contributions 
bad times severely tested the clubs philosophy early in the 
1970s however brokers went broke investors lost fortunes and 
many clubs like detroits disbanded inflation raged 
keeping the faith detroit club members maintained 
contributions at a rate exceeding 7000 a year even so their 
portfolio suffered its value fell more than 140000 from the 1969 
peak to just 393434 a year later after recovering to 430000 in 
the next three years it fell again to 387959 in 1974 the club 
still bought confident of a rise to come it did 
by 1979 the portfolio was valued at 759038 and by the end of 
1982 when the market rediscovered fundamentally sound stocks it 
topped 1 million for the first time of course it continued to 
grow 
over 50 years oharas monthly contributions amounted to a 
total of only 12000 the club records show he withdrew 186000 
over the years but that he still had 183000 left in the portfolio 
considering the small sum invested a person might have saved 
that amount by foregoing cigarettes the return seemed bountiful 
it didnt make millionaires of everyone but did allow them to 
realize some dreams 
a 3000 withdrawal in 1950 helped russell buy a howard johnson 
restaurant franchise eventually he owned three along with other 
food outlets and left his widow a comfortable inheritance 
bob burger who joined in 1946 withdrew 5000 years ago to 
found a business that developed into chemetco a miniconglomerate 
john biscomb indulged an intense interest in william 
shakespeare went to england and studied the bard on his own 
grounds in avon and london 
norman hill an original and wily investor allowed his 
contributions to accumulate to a current 346000 a pillow of 
comfort in his retirement 
ohara and his wife traveled widely bought their dream house 
sent their sons to private schools and colleges and convinced them 
to buy into the club ohara became a new york stock exchange 
governor and still serves as a consultant on issues affecting 
individual investors 
persistence is both the secret and the scourge of club investors 
the hardest thing is just to stay in the business ohara 
said in bad times its easy to quit 
with dedication compounding works wonders although it isnt 
easy to explain this to those of a modern getrichquick mentality 
begin with a penny and double its value each day and 10 days 
later it still amounts to only 5 but keep doubling and you have 
5 million in about a month 
the detroit club amassed its fortune at a modest annualized rate 
of 122 percent doubling its assets each five to six years 
can the detroit experience be repeated in these times of instant 
gratification yes if you have the motivation and the patience 
club members say 
modest goals help remember half a century ago oharas goal 
was simply to offset the 3 a week shortfall in his paycheck
