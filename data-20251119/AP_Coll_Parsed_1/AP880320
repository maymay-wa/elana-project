the reunification democratic party said it was abandoning 
efforts to unite the opposition after attacks sunday by members of 
the smaller party for peace and democracy

any way you slice it lucille and glenn 
stafford have an unusual recipe for extinguishing car fires milk 
and bread 
mrs stafford said experience with south dakota winters caused 
her to buy an extra gallon of milk and a loaf of bread during a 
march 3 trip to town just in case of an emergency 
the emergency came but it wasnt the latewinter blizzard she 
anticipated 
the staffords were heading home late at night when suddenly we 
saw a flame flickering in the heater vent she said 
the car was filled with black smoke and fumes she 
added the flames were rapidly melting the instrument panel i 
thought we might be asphyxiated we stopped as quickly as we 
could 
they were 14 miles from home and about a mile from the nearest 
farmhouse they had no flashlight and no fire extinguisher and no 
other cars were in sight on the country road 
we remembered the gallon of milk and loaf of bread mrs 
stafford said we subdued the flame with the milk then stuffed 
the hole in the panel with the bread saturated in milk 
we used almost the whole gallon of milk and there were just a 
few slices of bread left 
the milkbread solution eased the smoke enough so the couple 
could make it back to town to get help 
a short in the light switch caused the blaze she said 
the car has been fixed and everything has been taken care of now 
we just have to clean the interior

scientists have identified a tiny 
portion of the aids virus outer coat as a potentially promising 
target for an aids vaccine a researcher says 
we think this is the achilles heel of the virus scott 
putney of repligen corp of cambridge mass said in an interview 
sunday 
the site constitutes less than 3 percent of the overall virus 
coat but studies suggest it acts as a dominant spur to making the 
immune system try to fight the virus he said 
putney told science writers at a conference sponsored by the 
american cancer society that the fragment appears on glycoprotein 
120 the sugarandprotein outer coating of the virus 
the coating is one target the immune system attacks when it 
tries to fight the virus causing acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome the body makes proteins called antibodies that fit 
precisely to portions of the virus as part of the attack 
the idea of a vaccine is to spur the body into creating the 
right kind of antibodies ahead of time so they are lying in wait 
when the virus shows up a vaccine acts as sort of a template 
against which the body makes those antibodies 
researchers are trying to find the right portion of the aids 
virus to use in a vaccine to make the body create effective swarms 
of antibodies several teams are studying different portions of the 
viral coat 
two experimental aids vaccines are being tested in humans but 
putney said his work has not advanced far enough for that step 
the glycoprotein is made up of a long series of molecules called 
amino acids the fragment putney is focusing on is 24 amino acids 
long 
research in chimps and humans shows this stretch is a key target 
for several kinds of socalled neutralizing antibodies the body 
makes against the virus coating and the virus as a whole he said 
neutralizing antibodies are those that can block virus infection 
of a cell 
our vaccine development studies are now vigorously pursuing 
these 24 amino acids he said 
evidence suggest that antibodies against that fragment may not 
only block infection by the virus but also the merging of infected 
cells with uninfected ones which kills uninfected cells he said 
aids leaves the body open to fatal diseases by killing key cells 
of the immune system 
at least two basic hurdles stand in the way of basing a vaccine 
on the glycoprotein fragment putney said 
one is that the fragment is highly variable with different 
versions appearing in different samples of the aids virus he said 
it can vary by 40 percent to 50 percent between two samples of 
the virus he said that means that a vaccine based on the fragment 
from one virus strain would not work against other strains 
so researchers are considering a cocktail vaccine based on 
multiple versions of the variable region aimed at being effective 
against multiple strains of the aids virus he said 
putney noted that the polio vaccine is similarly designed to 
work against three different strains of that virus 
nobody knows how many versions of the fragment would have to be 
included in an aids vaccine putney said but were hoping its 
between five to 10 if it were as high as 100 a cocktail vaccine 
would probably not work he said 
a second problem is finding a way to spur high enough 
concentrations of antibodies against the fragment to prevent aids 
virus infection he said concentrations seen so far are too low 
he said 
putney said he hopes experiments in chimpanzees can begin in a 
few months 
the glycoprotein fragment called rp135 also has been 
identified and studied by scientists at duke university in durham 
nc at the national cancer institute and at the university of 
amsterdam in holland putney said results are in the process of 
being published he said

crews safely removed seven 
chemicalfilled containers near a flaming and potentially explosive 
canister in the ruins of a burned chemical plant saturday clearing 
the way for nearly 1500 evacuees to return home 
the burning gasfilled container was found friday in the gollob 
analytical services chemical plant where an explosion and fire 
killed three men thursday and severely injured a fourth a canister 
that had been sent to the plant for analysis caused the explosion 
and authorities say it may have been mislabeled or contaminated 
in pocatello idaho meanwhile a semiconductor plant that may 
contain a similar canister was also evacuated saturday as was a 
nearby nursing home 
new jersey authorities fearing that the burning container that 
was discovered friday might ignite surrounding ones called for a 
halfmile evacuation around the ruined plant friday night 
once the chemical containers near the one that was burning were 
removed the cordon was reduced to onequarter mile at 6 pm 
saturday allowing most of the 1500 affected residents to return 
home said mayor jeffrey maccarelli the remaining canister 
continued to burn saturday evening but appeared to pose no hazard 
he said 
neil mulvey coordinator for the state department of 
environmental protection said thursdays explosion had obliterated 
the lettering on at least one of the surrounding canisters which 
hampered their removal 
investigators said the plant burst into flames thursday after a 
cylinder exploded outside the facility and became a projectile 
shooting into the building 
dep spokesman jim staples said the canister that exploded had a 
potent combination of 70 percent silane and 30 percent nitrous 
oxide minutes before it blew up gollob officials had called 
liquid carbonic industries corp a chicagobased chemical 
distributor that had manufactured the compound to come and remove 
it 
after the explosion liquid carbonic alerted the gould 
semiconductor plant in pocatello idaho that similar canisters 
might be stored there 
pocatello police lt steve stuart said he was told the cylinder 
that exploded in new jersey had been shipped there from idaho after 
it failed to work properly when being used in manufacturing at the 
pocatello plant 
dan schroeder goulds plant manager would not comment except 
to confirm sandbagging and an evacuation of a nearby nursing home 
were going on saturday there is very little jeopardy of a major 
disaster happening he said 
in addition to the plant and a nursing home the idaho state 
university research park complex and a junior high school where a 
sports function was being held also were evacuated the nursing 
home housed 91 persons authorities said 
plant officials had placed 2800 sandbags around a suspect 
canister and a hazardous materials expert from carbondale colo 
was at the plant evaluating the situation

boris yeltsin who lost his job last fall as 
moscow communist party chief harshly criticized the soviet 
communist partys no 2 official in a dramatic speech before the 
central committee according to a published report 
the account of the speech in the march 28 issue of us news amp 
world report was written by seweryn bialer director of the 
research institute on international change at columbia university 
based on interviews with officials in moscow 
according to the account which was released saturday a visibly 
nervous yeltsin asked for permission to speak after soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev had finished a twohour speech oct 21 
yeltsin said he was resigning from his posts as head of the 
moscow party and as candidate member of the politburo then spoke 
for about 10 minutes the report said 
he accused the party leadership of misleading the soviet public 
about the extent of the nations economic problems overstating the 
potential of gorbachevs restructuring program called perestroika 
and showering too much praise on gorbachev then he criticized 
yegor ligachev the partys chief ideologist and no 2 official 
us news reported 
there is one top leader i cannot work with any more this man 
ligachev is an intriguer yeltsin told the central committee 
he is a false man who still adheres to the old and condemned 
style of leadership he compiles secret dossiers on all members of 
the leadership again and again he sabotaged my efforts to improve 
living conditions in moscow ligachev should be censured by the 
central committee 
according to the magazine yeltsin blamed ligachev for blocking 
steps to provide housing and food for an influx of workers to 
moscow 
i am no angel and make mistakes yeltsin said i can 
justly be blamed for at least part of the difficult situation in 
moscow but comrade ligachevs responsibility for this state of 
affairs is very great and he does not admit any of his 
wrongdoings 
gorbachev at one point interjected boris nikolaeevich 
withdraw your resignation and let us try to work together but 
yeltsin replied i sent my resignation and i stand behind it 
ligachev rose to speak and denied the charges according to 
bialer what yeltsin said about excessive praise for gorbachev is 
simply a disgusting and politically harmful insinuation we give 
the general secretary the respect that is clearly his due for his 
immense work and wise stewardship ligachev said 
after ligachev spoke 22 other colleagues turned on yeltsin over 
a threehour period the magazine reported 
yeltsin was given a chance to rebut his accusers and in a 
15minute speech he denied that he was charging gorbachev with 
creating a personality cult 
gorbachev then spoke again and called yeltsins action a 
bitter surprise and accused him of deserting the field of 
battle 
yeltsin was dismissed as moscow party chief several weeks later 
and removed from the politburo in february

the start of the jeffersonjackson dinner that he expected the 
party to have to go through a bitter convention fight to selects 
its nominee 
im just saying thats a reality simon said even the 
current front runner dukakis would have to win about 80 percent 
of the remaining delegates to wrap up the nomination on the first

but gore rejected that view saying some things that people 
think are inevitable turn out not to be the race for the

an author up for an oscar for 
cowriting the screenplay to full metal jacket was being sought 
for questioning after thousands of books from libraries as far away 
as australia were found in storage lockers police said saturday 
an estimated 10000 books were recovered from a pair of lockers 
rented in the name of jerry gustav hasford author of the novel 
the short timers said detective ray berrett of california 
polytechnic state university campus police 
the book was adapted into the 1987 vietnam war drama full 
metal jacket directed by stanley kubrick from a screenplay 
written by kubrick hasford and michael herr the three share an 
academy award nomination for the screenplay 
the raid was staged thursday by university police who were 
seeking 87 overdue books that had been checked out from the 
polytechnic university library in hasfords name fines totaled 
3000 
we found a lot more than we bargained for said wayne 
carmack another campus investigator 
in addition to books and periodicals from the university they 
found thousands of books marked as belonging to libraries as far 
away as england and australia some dating back to the 1860s he 
said also in the lockers were books missing from libraries in 
sacramento and st louis mo 
police said they had not yet contacted foreign library officials 
to confirm whether those books were stolen 
hasford who in recent years lived in nearby morro bay doesnt 
attend the university but got a university library card under a 
procedure open to state residents carmack said however the 
address and social security number listed on the card were false 
he said 
university investigators said they are seeking hasford for 
questioning but did not immediately seek an arrest warrant because 
they want to inventory the estimated 10000 books in 396 cardboard 
boxes berrett said 
the man who checked out the books was known to library workers 
and the operators of the storage locker as jerry hasford the 
author 
he told everybody where weve been that he is the author of 
the book the short timers berrett said copies of the book 
and the full metal jacket screenplay were in the lockers he 
added 
efforts to reach the author by telephone saturday through 
directory assistance in the san luis obispo area failed as did 
efforts to reach him through bantam books publisher of the short 
timers 
he didnt appear friday night at the writers guild of america 
awards ceremony where he was considered for a similar award but 
didnt win the oscar ceremony is set for april 11

two honduran warplanes bombed 
nicaraguan positions saturday afternoon in a rugged border area 
where president jose azcona hoyo was reinforcing troops to oust the 
sandinista soldiers 
the nicaraguan defense ministry said the raid was on nicaraguan 
territory and caused no damage azcona in a telephone interview 
with the associated press would neither confirm nor deny the 
attack but the honduran military said it occurred on the honduran 
side of the illdefined border 
honduras says the sandinistas crossed the frontier in the bocay 
region last week in pursuit of usbacked contra rebels thousands 
of us troops have been sent to honduras as a show of force but 
officials say they will not be sent to combat areas 
azcona threatened the sandinistas friday with air raids unless 
they pulled out of honduras nicaragua has denied its troops 
crossed the border but a sandinista military official has 
indicated nicaraguan troops entered honduras 
the honduran statement issued by military intelligence late 
saturday said the raid was ordered by the military high command 
with the objective of forcing the immediate withdrawal of the 
nicaraguan troops from our soil 
the statement said two usmade f5 fighter jets carried out 
the raid but it gave no further details of the attack 
the nicaraguan defense ministry statement issued in managua said 
the raid was in the same area where honduran jets dropped several 
bombs on thursday honduras has said that raid also was on its side 
of the border 
nicaraguan foreign minister miguel descoto sent a protest note 
to honduran foreign minister carlos lopez saying his government 
energetically and formally protests the attack which it called 
aggression against nicaraguan territory 
the nicaraguan defense ministry statement said two americanmade 
f5 jets staged a 10minute attack saturday afternoon in the bocay 
area about 65 miles northeast of managua dropping four bombs 
against sandinista army positions but causing no damage 
the ministry also said two f5 warplanes flew over sandinista 
positions saturday morning in the frontier sectors of mukuwas san 
andres de bocay waniwas and wayawas but dropped no bombs 
there was no immediate comment by honduras on the reported 
overflight 
both incursions were repelled by sandinista antiaircraft fire 
the ministry said 
azcona had announced he was sending more troops to the bocay 
region and also said he would not hesitate to seek more us help 
a few hours after azcona made the statements and before 
nicaragua reported its territory was being bombed the honduran

col manuel suarez benavides the armed forces spokesman said 
in a telephone interview their troops are withdrawing about 600 
sandinista soldiers are still inside our country and the rest have 
abandoned the area during the past 24 hours 
azcona had said before the armed forces announced the 
nicaraguans were withdrawing that the situation in the mountainous 
bocay region deteriorated when sandinista troops reentered 
honduras after having retreated to the nicaraguan side he 
estimated the nicaraguan strength in honduras at about 2000 by 
saturday morning 
the president told the associated press he was reinforcing the 
2000 honduran troops at the border with several more battalions 
a honduran military intelligence officer speaking on condition 
of anonymity said honduran troops surrounded the sandinistas and 
were to shoot or capture any nicaraguan soldiers found on the wrong 
side of the border 
about 3200 us troops have been sent to honduras at the 
request of the honduran government since thursday the pentagon 
said the troops would be in central america for about 10 days 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega has said his government is 
still willing to hold peace talks monday with the contras a rebel 
spokesman said the contras also are willing to negotiate 
nicaragua is thought to be trying to wipe out contra bases along 
the border and a large rebel supply depot in the jungle north of 
san andres de bocay 
ortega said he was appealing to the international court of 
justice for an injunction to prevent action that would heighten 
tension between the nations and he asked the united nations to 
investigate the border dispute 
the decisions of what is known as the world court a un agency 
based in holland are rarely enforceable unless both sides agree to 
its jurisdiction 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar decided to send a un 
team to nicaragua at nicaraguas request said un spokesman 
mahbub ahmad diplomatic sources said the team was likely to 
include two military observers and probably would leave on tuesday

editors note moscow chief of bureau michael putzel accompanied 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on his trip last week to 
yugoslavia and reports on the differences between the two communist 
countries 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in a downtown hightech shop a 
hungarian computer is connected to a japanese monitor and an 
american printer western news magazines virtually unatainable in 
moscow are sold openly at newsstands 
its typical of accommodations yugoslavia has made as it looked 
both east and west in building a nonaligned communist nation 
during a visit to three yugoslav cities last week soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev was introduced to contrasts between socialist 
societies in yugoslavia and the soviet union which has developed 
in relative isolation from the west 
in the heavily roman catholic city of ljubljana people rise to 
the clanging of church bells 
the the ruling yugoslav league of communists like the soviet 
communist party is officially atheist but the roman catholic and 
orthodox churches operate openly with little interference from 
authorities in contrast religious practice in the soviet union is 
severely restricted and the state long ago seized most church 
property 
kiosks throughout yugoslavia display and sell both domestic and 
foreign publications brassy color photos on foreign erotic 
magazines that are banned in the soviet union share newsstand 
windows with tracts on marxism 
the freewheeling local press ostensibly under the thumb of 
government and party officials is less inhibited than the most 
avantgarde soviet publications testing glasnost or the 
policy of opennness pushed by gorbachev 
shops in belgrade sell a wide array consumer goods and gadgets 
and farmers markets during the winter show off fresh fruits and 
vegetables that havent been seen in moscow for months 
in yugoslavia there are no apparent shortages in contrast to 
moscow where long lines form on the street at the first hint of 
something desirable like egyptian oranges or shoes from 
yugoslavia 
in slovenia the prosperous northern republic gorbachev visited 
most lines seem to be for state lottery tickets 
private restaurants abound in yugoslavia competing for 
customers with attentive service and local and foreign specialties 
in the soviet union such restaurants known as cooperatives only 
started springing up in the last year 
mcdonalds is scheduled to open its first outlet in the 
communist world in downtown belgrade this week crowds already 
gather at the door of a neatly renovated old building to examine 
the signs depicting a big mac french fries and other fare more 
familiar in the west 
the hamburger chain has been negotiating with the soviets for 
years but has so far been unable to satisfy itself that stores in 
the soviet union could maintain quality control and there remain 
sticky questions about how western investors could take their 
profits out of the country 
a holiday inn sign on a modern hotel in downtown ljubljana 
attests to the yugoslavs ability to make joint ventures work 
the soviets usually trade oil and other raw materials for prized 
finished goods from yugoslavia such as shoes clothing furniture 
and machine tools 
yugoslavs speak enthusiastically about their freedom to travel 
abroad a privilege accorded few soviet citizens 
many yugoslavs have visited relatives in the united states more 
than 1 million work abroad either because they could not find work 
at home or can get more lucrative jobs elsewhere 
the flight of growing numbers of workers is but one indication 
this socialist society is struggling with some problems of its own 
such as 15 percent unemployment tripledigit inflation and a 20 
billion foreign debt 
typical of price increases announced almost daily the airport 
tax in belgrade doubled the day gorbachev left 
on a street just off the main downtown square in belgrade a 
whitebearded old man rummaged through a trash bin a despairing 
yugoslav observer said such scenes have grown increasingly common 
in recent years as the nations economic crisis has dragged living 
standards down from the boom years of the 1960s and early 70s 
just outside the gates of a sleek modern factory gorbachev 
visited in slovenia one of the most prosperous regions in the 
communist world a pathetic shantytown bore grim testament to the 
inequality that persists even in this socialist society 
gorbachev a peasants son might find such deprivation all too 
familiar but the adriatic might also have reminded him of home 
the route to dubrovnik was reminiscent of the beautiful coastal 
drive to the crimean resort of yalta or the black sea tourist mecca 
of sochi in gorbachevs native southern russia 
the craggy coastlines are similar in all three places lined 
with cyprus and palm trees and defined by dramatic drops to lapping 
seas 
but in dubrovnik the stickers on the windows of every boutique 
and shop inviting visitors to pay with western credit cards is an 
unfamiliar sight to the soviet visitor

president corazon aquino said sunday 
that she does not plan to seek reelection in 1992 and told a radio 
audience that she lacks political ambition 
mrs aquino also announced on her weekly radio show that four 
manila policemen would answer charges before the human rights 
commission that they tortured captured communist rebels 
asked by a caller about her plans to seek a second sixyear 
term mrs aquino responded i said earlier that i had no 
political ambitions and i feel i really was meant for one term 
and so one term it will be she said but i want to thank 
the filipino people for having given me this opportunity to serve 
you at such a difficult time 
i was only meant for transition even now i consider this the 
transition period from dictatorship to full democracy she said 
mrs aquino said the pillars of democracy the executive 
legislative and judicial branches of the americanstyle government 
are already in place in the philippines 
but because of the economic problems there is no full 
democracy because we must also have economic freedom she said 
mrs aquino was swept to power in february 1986 by a popular 
revolt that ended president ferdinand marcos 20year authoritarian 
rule both she and marcos claimed to have won the fraudtainted 
presidential election earlier that month 
mrs aquino said in response to another question that four 
western district police officers would testify before the 
government human rights commission but did not specify when this 
would be 
the commission is merely an investigatory body but it could 
make its evidence available to a court of law if it finds 
wrongdoing 
she said commission chairwoman mary concepcion bautista has 
looked into the matter of recently captured communist insurgents 
authorities rounded up two dozen suspected communist rebels last 
month in sweeps throughout the capital seven were released for 
lack of evidence and 17 remain in custody 
shortly after their capture some of the detainees claimed they 
had been tortured three of them appeared before the house of 
representatives human rights committee and displayed marks on 
their bodies they said were the result of torture 
the committee chairwoman rep nikki coeseteng later told 
reporters the panel had found evidence of human rights abuse by the 
military and called the treatment given the detainees inhuman 
earlier this month the londonbased amnesty international and 
the local task force detainees charged there were widespread human 
rights abuses in the philippines 
the churchbacked task force said its investigation showed 7444 
filipinos were arrested illegally in 1987 eclipsing the 5967 
arrests in 1985 when marcos was president it said many of those 
arrested last year were tortured 
mrs aquino called the amnesty report onesided and said the 
body had relied on task force for its information she urged the 
two groups to bring their evidence to the rights commission

communist party chief zhao ziyang urged faster 
and bolder reforms of chinas government and economy in a major 
speech published sunday making clear his opposition to recent 
calls for caution 
the speech was zhaos last salvo before chinas parliament the 
national peoples congress begins a session friday during which 
opposing views are expected to be aired 
the head of the national peoples congress peng zhen and the 
head of government acting premier li peng both are more 
conservative than zhao in their approach to reforming chinas 
centralized economy and inefficient bureaucracy 
zhao urged increasing incentives to foreign businesses to trade 
and invest in china a thorough shakeup of the sluggish government 
bureaucracy more competition among factories and more openness in 
party and state affairs 
in the speechs only reference to opposition zhao said the 
party demands that all communist party members working in the 
state council especially highranking officials should contribute 
their bit in the reform the state council is chinas cabinet 
the speech was delivered to the partys 175member central 
committee which ended a fiveday meeting saturday the official 
xinhua news agency published a lengthy summary of the speech but 
did not say what day it was delivered 
chinese incomes have more than doubled in the 10 years since 
senior leader deng xiaoping began the campaign to decentralize the 
economy and government and restore market forces and economic 
incentives 
no top officials openly criticize the reforms but some 
conservatives have emphasized the need to move slowly 
among them is li peng who has emphasized the need to control 
inflation and other ills triggered by the reforms li is expected 
to be confirmed as premier at the national party congress 
in a speech marking the lunar new year on feb 17 li said the 
government may expand its subsidies of major commodities in order 
to reduce inflation which hit 75 percent nationally last year but 
reached 19 percent in some cities 
such a move would be a dramatic reversal of zhaos program to 
gradually reduce subsidies and allow supply and demand to set 
prices 
in his central committee speech zhao called for continuing 
price reform and said higher food prices would send a signal to 
farmers to produce more 
some officials have indirectly criticized the reforms by warning 
about growing materialism in china and corruption among government 
and party workers 
zhao acknowledged the problem and called for closer supervision 
of government employees and regular wage increases so they will be 
less tempted to engage in extortion 
said zhao communists should be the first to be concerned 
about their country and people and the last to enjoy themselves

the fourth parliament in bangladeshs 
17year history was sworn in sunday but allegations of a rigged 
election raise doubts about the legitimacy of the lawmaking body 
parliament speaker huda choudhury gave the oath of office to the 
new members although the 18 members of the combined opposition 
party failed to attend the ceremony there was no immediate 
explanation for their absence 
despite its name the opposition bloc consists of 76 small 
parties loyal to the government of president hussain muhammad 
ershad 
the parliament was chosen march 3 in an election where there was 
much evidence of vote tampering and little of voter turnout 
despite the governments claim that more than 50 percent of voters 
took part 
opposition parties boycotted the polling and charged that fewer 
than 1 percent of voters cast ballots 
no parliament in bangladesh ever has served its full fiveyear 
term the previous one elected in 1986 was dissolved by ershad 
last dec 6 in a move to compromise with opposition parties 
demanding the presidents ouster 
the main opposition coalition of 21 parties denounced the move 
however and boycotted the elections saying fair elections under 
ershad were impossible 
ershads jatiya party won 251 of the 300 seats the national 
socialist party got three the freedom party two and independent 
candidates won 25 seats election for one seat was postponed after 
a candidate was slain 
the president told a religious gathering on march 13 that he 
would offer legislation to amend the constitution to make 
bangladesh an islamic state the countrys population is more than 
90 percent moslem 
ershads party could easily adopt such legislation having well 
over the needed twothirds majority in the parliament 
but the opposition parties still carrying out a fourmonth 
campaign of strikes and rallies to oust ershad already have 
announced they will oppose the move 
even the leader of the fundamentalist moslem party 
jamaateislami abbas ali khan denounced the proposal this is 
a political gimmick by ershad to perpetuate his rule he said 
ershad a former general has vowed not to resign he took power 
in a bloodless coup in 1982 and was elected in 1986 in a vote that 
the opposition claims was rigged 
bangladesh became an independent state in 1971 after a civil war 
with pakistan

some years ago rating the nations federal 
judges american lawyer magazine praised the mental strength of 
gerhard a gesell but took off points because his arrogance is 
offensive to many attorneys 
as a judge who has dealt with watergate and other highly 
publicized cases in his 20 years on the bench 77yearold gesell 
is on the hot seat again he was handpicked by the capitals chief 
federal judge to try former national security adviser john m 
poindexter lt col oliver l north and two arms dealers in the 
irancontra affair 
american lawyer found gesell widely regarded as the most agile 
and powerful mind on the dc bench but it also had a 
suspicion that he is too sure of his own abilities that he is 
perhaps overbearing 
few lawyers who ever appeared before gesell would disagree with 
those assessments gesell is tough he was once described by a 
washington columnist as having a rosy trollkings face but 
more often than not its that of a storm king 
such things are not said publicly but the probability is gesell 
was tapped because he is the most likely to get the job done 
swiftly and cleanly it will be up to gesell to decide the 
politically absorbing question of the trials timing before the 
november election or afterward before reagan leaves office or 
after 
gesell is the emperor of his courtroom he makes things move 
longwinded lawyers quickly learn to change their ways 
when he is displeased everyone knows it 
gesell conducted the 1974 plumbers trial in which john d 
ehrlichman the former presidential domestic adviser was convicted 
of violating the rights of a psychiatrist by sending white house 
agents to burglarize his office 
ehrlichman found gesell obviously hostile he wrote later 
that a number of spectators at that trial gave us affidavits 
describing gesells facial reactions and gestures which seemed 
intended to indicate to the jury how he felt about me and my 
attorneys 
gesell called the case a shameful episode in the history of 
our country and he expressed a sentiment that may come into play 
in the irancontra trial it is impossible to preserve freedom 
anywhere when zealots take over and the rule of law is ignored 
four years ago gesell had a case that involved the language in 
the law that governs how federal commissions operate another 
example of unimpressive legislative drafting he grumped the 
courts do not welcome their role in such disputes he said 
in 1980 gesell ruled that the air force was wrong in ousting a 
decorated vietnam veteran because he was a homosexual gesell 
accused the service of perverse behavior 
but three years earlier he had dismissed the suit of another 
acknowledged homosexual to be reinstated to the service gesell 
concluded that an individuals right to privacy does not extend 
to homosexual conduct even when it occurs in private between 
consenting adults 
gesell is among a generation of americans whose parents used the 
book the child from five to ten as a guide to bringing them up 
in his case however the teaching was more direct the author was 
his father noted yale child psychologist and pediatrician arnold 
gesell 
a yale graduate himself gesell made a name as an antitrust 
lawyer with covington amp burling one of washingtons most renowned 
law firms he was named to the federal bench in 1968 by president 
lyndon b johnson 
he quickly developed a reputation as one of the most scholarly 
judges in the courthouse 
gesells opinions have ranged widely in 1970 he ordered the 
house internal security committee not to publish a report that 
listed 65 people as radical campus speakers it was a landmark 
decision limiting congressional power 
in 1968 he broadened the district of columbias law to permit 
abortions virtually at a physicians discretion the ruling was 
reversed by the supreme court 
and in 1971 he ruled that the washington post could publish the 
pentagon papers study on the origins of the vietnam war saying 
there is no proof that there will be a definite break in 
diplomatic relations that there will be an armed attack on the 
united states or on an ally that there will be war

outside toilets cornmeal for 
dinner and police visits in the middle of the night gave 170 white 
christians a taste of everyday life in this black township 
the event designed to bring whites and blacks together and 
break down apartheid barriers was organized by two christian 
groups and ended sunday with an emotional church service at a ymca 
hall 
hundreds of worshipers clasped hands and swayed in rhythm to 
hymns of christian fellowship said the rev nico smith one of the 
encounters organizers i thank god that this is still possible 
in south africa 
on saturday night while soldiers checked cars entering the 
township a few hundred yards away the black hosts and their white 
guests barbecued sausage and dipped cornmeal from a huge iron pot 
while discussing the fourday encounter at a picnic 
ten years ago if we did this the police would have just come 
and chased all the blacks away said smith 
murray hofmeyr 29 a white theology student was asked 
repeatedly to tell how police had come to the door at 330 am 
friday to arrest him and his host black churchworker sandy lebese 
he said they refused to say why and were very rude 
police freed hofmeyr a few hours later when i finally 
convinced them what was going on that there were 170 white people 
staying in the township that night they didnt believe me 
lebese who was imprisoned from 1977 to 1983 on a sabotage 
conviction remained in detention without explanation 
another delegate nick paton grandson of novelist alan paton 
said police came to his door also at 230 am asking what he 
was doing in the township 
its not normal to see a white man putting up in a black 
house said one of the hosts joe sekese who was not surprised 
by the police action i think its a breakthrough because in 
fact i expected something tragic to happen that the soldiers 
would break up the whole thing 
smith a white dutch reformed minister who moved into mamelodi 
with government permission two years ago said he believed the 
police action was just the way they harass you to let you know 
theyre there in control 
but hofmeyr said he thought police were looking for a white man 
they believed responsible for a carbombing thursday 20 miles 
southwest of pretoria 
jacques bosch 11 spent four days playing with 12yearold 
mandla mabena as their parents tried to get to know each other 
mandlas mother betty who works as a maid in a white home in 
pretoria said she was worred about having a white woman come to 
her house as a guest she said her employers treat me like 
family but they have never been to her home 
i was concerned about what food to serve what beddings i 
had said mrs mabena 
some delegates stayed in typical fourroom township homes with 
a toilet in the yard a zinc basin to bathe in and not enough beds 
to go around others stayed in the more modern homes that the 
government and private industry are building to combat political 
unrest 
some of the worst violence of the past three years occurred in 
mamelodi and soldiers still patrol the streets 
most of my black friends are mostly radical people 
fighting for a better south africa fighting their bitterness it 
was an experience to see the peace and quiet here said annemarie 
bosch 
when guests took their hosts out for dinner friday night some 
reported rude comments and noticed stares from other diners in the 
restaurants most said they had no trouble 
the delegates including about 40 blacks who stayed in white 
homes in pretoria tried to adopt a joint statement at the end of 
the encounter that would reflect their mutual experience but found 
they could not 
apartheid was very successful said smith it succeeded to 
divide the people to separate them from one another it eventually 
ended up with the whites fearing the blacks and the blacks being 
furious with the whites and you know anger and fear is a recipe 
for violence 
smith promoted a separate message from the whites to tell other 
whites what they had learned and urge an end to this forced 
separation of the races under apartheid 
david ramakgadi a church field worker read the blacks 
statement we are thrilled that at last after a struggle of more 
than 50 years you have come to our township not to tell us but to 
listen we see our communities as schools to educate people about 
the need to liberate south africa 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

emergency action by federal regulators to 
stabilize two big banking companies hit by deposit runs is sure to 
revive charges of a double standard for dealing with ailing 
financial institutions 
while small banks are closing at a rate unseen since the great 
depression the government in effect has declared large banks too 
big to fail the critics say 
the best known example of the toobigtofail syndrome is 
continental illinois corp which in 1984 required 45 billion in 
the largestever government bailout 
the federal deposit insurance corp the agency that insures 
deposits in commercial banks hopes to recover all but 17 billion 
of that by selling its stake in continental but nearly four years 
after the bailout the fdic is still the major stockholder in the 
bank 
two government moves last week to prop up institutions nearly 
identical in size to continental are renewing concerns 
the fdic on thursday pumped 1 billion into first republicbank 
corp of dallas which has lost nearly 2 billion in deposits since 
the start of the year with 332 billion in assets it is the 
nations 13th largest commercial bank holding company 
the agency also promised to protect all depositors and general 
creditors of the companys 73 subsidiary banks 
the federal home loan bank board which regulates savings 
institutions made a similar pledge on friday regarding the 337 
billion financial corp of america owner of the stockton 
califbased american savings amp loan association 
the second largest thrift holding company in the country fca 
had lost 493 million in deposits in january and february its 
request for 15 billion in assistance is under review 
the eventual price tag of solving the problems at first 
republicbank and fca isnt known for certain but analysts believe 
the bailouts ultimately could rival and possibly even surpass the 
continental illinois rescue 
the promises made by the fdic and bank board go beyond the 
agencies normal practice usually deposit accounts are protected 
only to 100000 and creditors are not protected at all 
when smaller banks fail as 184 did last year the fdic pays off 
depositors up to the insurance limit or arranges for the accounts 
to be transferred to a solvent institution 
big banks with their extensive ties to other banks present a 
more complicated problem the failure of a large institution could 
cause a chain reaction of insolvencies at smaller banks and end up 
costing the fdic more than the amount needed to keep the big bank 
operating 
using government aid to entice private investors to take over an 
ailing institution also is often cheaper than a straight payoff of 
depositors 
that logic doesnt make it any easier for executives who watch 
their small banks go under while their colleagues at large 
institutions stay in business 
beyond the big banksmall bank double standard there is what 
some regard as a dual standard in dealing with large regional banks 
like first republicbank and the even bigger money center banks 
deeply involved with shaky loans to third world countries 
paul getman a financial economist with the wefa group a 
philadelphia consulting firm said bankers at the large regional 
institutions whose loans are in real estate and energy believe 
regulators are much more reluctant to force money center banks to 
write down the value of overseas loans 
texas bankers feel the fdic is not clamping down as hard 
on new york city banks because the nature of their bad loans is 
such that they can get away with saying theyre worth 50 cents on 
the dollar for example getman said 
theres a lot of political play in how loans to third world 
countries are valued whereas everyone knows that loans on texas 
real estate are worth 15 cents on the dollar he said 
rep ferdnand g st germain dri chairman of the house 
banking committee said he plans hearings this spring on the 
criteria used to decide who survives and who fails among the 
troubled institutions 
st germain has voiced concern in the past about sweet 
failsafe deals for private investors 
fdic chairman l william seidman however has pointed out that 
government bank rescues bail out depositors usually not 
stockholders corporate debt holders or management 
bert ely a private financial institutions analyst in 
alexandria va defended bailouts as saving money for the 
insurance funds which are funded by premiums paid by banks and 
savings and loans and ultimately backed by the taxpayer 
ely argued that regulators ought to make bailouts far sooner 
than they usually do 
the important thing is that they end the tragedy every 
hour that goes by increases banks losses and the losses to the 
insurance funds it is so critical to get that assistance in there 
and stop the bleeding right away he said

liberal and conservative chinese leaders gather 
friday to wrangle over the future of the countrys economic and 
political reforms in a congress that could reveal how deep 
divisions are between the camps 
featured at the annual meeting of the national peoples 
congress chinas parliament will be communist party chief zhao 
ziyang and acting premier li peng who heads the conservatives 
zhao 69 the protege of semiretired senior leader deng 
xiaoping is the champion of rapid reform in a speech published 
sunday zhao urged faster and bolder reforms making clear his 
opposition to recent calls for caution 
li 59 a sovieteducated engineer is regarded as a cautious 
technocrat who supports the reforms but would limit their scope and 
slow their implementation 
zhao was the star at a major party congress last fall that laid 
down guidelines for china into the 21st century at the congress 
however li will be at center stage delivering a key report at the 
opening of the threeweek session that will define the nations 
immediate goals 
li is expected to sound several conservative themes that the 
government must pay more attention to the countryside following 
three straight disappointing grain harvests and that controlling 
doubledigit inflation must take precedence over further reform of 
chinas inefficient pricing system 
analysts also will watch how much support li gives zhaos 
ambitious proposal to turn factories along chinas coast into 
processing centers for exports the plan is controversial because 
it would allow coastal regions to develop faster than chinas vast 
interior 
some observers say open disagreement between zhao and li is 
unlikely both support chinas economic changes but they differ on 
the pace 
five years ago you could talk about reformists and 
conservatives said one asian diplomat but today nobody would 
come out against reform 
the first session of the 7th congress each congress sits for 
five years will be one of the busiest and most important in 
years it will confirm li as premier replace li xiannian as 
president and fill dozens of important government posts 
the 2970 delegates will approve a government reorganization in 
which several ministries are to merge or be eliminated they also 
will amend the constitution to legalize private businesses and pass 
several laws 
most important is the industrial enterprise law which will give 
legal definition to the governments attempts to separate the 
functions of the owner the state and the manager of businesses 
factory managers will be given the right to run their plants 
without undue interference from government and party officials 
they also will take responsibility for profits and losses 
the congress will also vote to make southern chinas hainan 
island a focus of zhaos coastal development plans a new province 
the congress will also enact important personnel changes 
several elderly leaders who have opposed most economic reforms 
will finally step down 
but conservatives who favor cautious change and not rapid 
reformers will probably take their place 
li named acting premier when zhao was appointed head of the 
party last fall will take over the post held for 27 years by his 
foster father chou enlai he will also head the commission for 
restructuring the economy giving him greater influence in 
determining and possibly slowing the course of reforms 
li xiannian 78 will end his fiveyear term in the largely 
ceremonial post of president and is likely to replace deng 
yingchao 84 chou enlais widow as chairman of the chinese 
peoples political consultative conference an advisory body 
tapped to be the next president is yang shangkun 80 a senior 
military officer member of the party politburo and friend to deng 
xiaoping 
yao yilin 71 a respected but somewhat conservative economist 
is slated to head a powerful economic planning commission 
the new defense minister replacing 78yearold zhang aiping is 
expected to be qin jiwei 74 former beijing military region 
commander and a politburo member 
peng zhen an 86yearold conservative curmudgeon will resign 
as chairman of the peoples congress with vice premier wan li a 
likely successor

dreaming of life in the circus a handful of 
wouldbe big top stars practiced slapstick skits laughed at 
pretend jokes and even took a shaving cream pie in the face at 
auditions for clown college 
for two hours saturday about 35 people including an actress 
a singer a history teacher and a retired dentist tested their 
mettle as clowns vying to get into the school in venice fla 
dubbed the yale of yucks and the worlds only institution of 
higher laughter 
in order to be a good clown you have to have a heart the size 
of alaska and be willing to give it away on a daily basis said 
steve smith director of the college run by ringling bros and 
barnum amp bailey circus 
you cant go out and flap your arms around and think thats 
clowning smith told the clown hopefuls you have to feel it 
and believe it 
with a videotape camera rolling smith tested the applicants 
abilities in mime acting movement and classic clown gags in a 
dance practice room at depaul university 
competition to get into clown college is nearly as keen as for 
the ivy league 
the school holds about 25 auditions a year around the country 
for a maximum of 60 openings last year 2000 people applied to be 
trained as clowns and only 50 were accepted smith said 
to make the cuts smith and ruth craddock a teacher at the 
college review audition videotapes and written applications 
submitted by the aspiring clowns 
the clown candidates pantomimed different emotions contorting 
their faces in anger drooping in sadness and beaming with 
happiness they acted out a simple slapstick skit and practiced 
laughing hysterically when a fellow auditioner pretended to tell a 
joke 
were giving a collective hug to 20000 people in the circus 
audience and are trying to make them forget for two hours that the 
toilet wont flush the bills are overdue and their kid needs 
braces explained smith wearing a clown suit of blue pants 
rainbow suspenders red polkadot bow tie yellow hair and red bulb 
nose 
for those who are accepted the 10week program in such skills 
as stiltwalking gymnastics and pantomime is free with a catch 
the students must agree to join the ringling bros circus as a 
clown if they are good enough 
we think of it as boot camp for the circus said smith the 
former host of a childrens television program in chicago were 
very serious about being silly 
jason stern a 46yearold retired dentist who runs an 
international contracting business tried out on his 23rd wedding 
anniversary because he said he harbors a secret desire to be a 
clown 
im at that stage in life where i want to really enjoy 
myself stern said id drop everything im doing to join the 
circus 
noah budin a 27yearold singer wearing a hawaiian shirt and a 
cleveland indians hat said he has dreamed of working as a clown 
since his childhood 
ive just never grown up he said i want to perform for 
people and make them laugh i want to feel that power 
were not looking for people who can juggle and ride unicycles 
because we can teach that said smith who went through clown 
college in 1971 and has been its director since 1985 what im 
really looking for are people who have a sincere desire to learn 
the craft and who have a big heart

countryside in their deepest push into southern lebanon this year 
in an apparent effort to knock out guerrilla bases there police 
said sunday 
their troops however met no resistance saturday as they 
pressed north several miles beyond the eastern end of their buffer 
zone toward the shiite moslem village of maydoun police said they 
withdrew about four hours later 
the ground assault followed increased guerrilla attacks on the 
security belt with sovietmade katyusha rockets israel said it 
needed the buffer area to deter such attacks when it withdrew most 
troops from lebanon in june 1985 after its 1982 invasion and 
threeyear occupation 
the israelis and militiamen from the mainly christian south 
lebanon army fought a sevenhour artillery duel with shiite amal 
militiamen on saturday before moving north

or hurt and one shiite fighter wounded in the exchanges engulfing

two days after the police chiefs father 
died authorities began digging in the chiefs front yard they 
kept digging until they found a skeleton 20 feet down that turned 
out to be the first husband of the chiefs current wife 
no charges have been filed and authorities have released few 
details of their investigation 
they have only confirmed from dental records that the skeleton 
was the remains of russell bean and that he had been beaten on the 
head and chest with an unidentified object 
bean was 25 when he was last seen in 1978 he and robert 
chambers who became the parttime police chief three years ago 
apparently met while working together at a factory in keene and 
became drinking buddies 
after bean disappeared chambers divorced his first wife and 
married beans wife sylvia about 35 
chambers 36 and other members of the family have said nothing 
publicly about the case 
chambers was parttime police chief in marlow and nearby gilsum 
he has resigned the marlow job and taken indefinite leave from the 
gilsum post he has also been suspended from the police force in 
winchester 
his wife has left her job as a schoolbus driver and their four 
children from former marriages have been taken out of school 
chambers former wife deborah living in jaffrey was 
hospitalized while authorities were digging in chambers yard 
authorities wont say why or disclose her condition 
the mystery began unfolding march 9 with the death of chambers 
father clifton chambers 61 
the keene sentinel reported that sources with detailed knowledge 
of the investigation said the elder chambers told his daughter 
melissa that bean died accidentally in a fist fight when he fell 
and hit his head on a rock and that the elder chambers had helped 
bury him 
melissa chambers reportedly told authorities the deathbed tale 
the next day and the digging began march 11 
on march 14 clifton chambers was buried hours later when the 
hole in robert chambers yard was 20 feet deep and 25 feet in 
diameter beans skeleton was found 
on thursday march 17 it was determined bean had been beaten 
with a blunt object 
chambers lawyer mark sisti of the public defenders office 
said he could not answer questions about how the body came to be 
buried there or whether chambers knew but he said my client had 
nothing to do with causing the death of mr bean 
sisti filed a motion friday to gain access to documents that 
persuaded a judge to issue the search warrant that allowed 
authorities to dig up chambers yard a lot of reports have been 
generated through rumors and speculation and wed like to see 
exactly whats in there he said 
the attorney generals office said it will try to keep the 
documents sealed 
all that has left the 600 residents of the rural community in 
hilly southwestern new hampshire speculating on what happened 
rumors spread rapidly from talk at the general store at vics the 
only restaurant in town or at private gatherings 
mabel champney who knew the elder chambers for 45 years and had 
been dating him the past three years since the death of his wife 
emphatically rejected any thought that he would hide a crime 
i dont think he knew a thing about it she said i dont 
think he would hold back anything if someone did something wrong 
harry briggs the elder chambers brotherinlaw said melissa 
chambers was very bitter against bob something that had 
built through the years they always fought back and forth 
bean helped chambers build the 1story cabin where he still 
lives one town resident said the house sits on two acres 
remaining from the 100 acres once owned by chambers father 
the union leader in manchester quoted people as saying chambers 
and his wife and bean and his wife were good friends 
but then robert and deborah chambers separated in 1978 and 
divorced in june 1979 
bean disappeared in september 1978 and sylvia bean won a 
divorce the next year she and chambers were married in september 
1979 
chambers was a trainee and was ready to become a fulltime 
policeman for winchester after passing a 10week course at the 
state police academy but the digging began the day he graduated

federal officials disappointed by lukewarm response to a 
yearlong amnesty program for illegal aliens hope a blitz of 
sideshowlike hoopla in the final weeks will spark a lastminute 
flurry of interest 
we are expecting to see a surge in applications immigration 
and naturalization service spokesman vern jervis said in 
washington dc 
our feeling is there has been a lot of procrastination but we 
already have seen an increase in recent weeks and we believe we 
will have good numbers between now and the end of the program as 
people realize time is getting short 
the last day illegal aliens can apply for amnesty to legalize 
their presence in this country and permit them to seek citizenship 
is may 4 the program began may 5 1987 
after an initial surge that saw illegal aliens standing in long 
lines for hours at ins centers around the country interest tapered 
off substantially 
when the amnesty program started officials estimated there were 
between 4 million and 6 million illegal aliens in the united states 
and that between 2 million and 4 million might apply for amnesty 
through march 16 the latest date for which figures were 
available 139 million undocumented aliens had applied for 
amnesty jervis said 
critics claim the government mismanaged the amnesty program by 
failing to adequately publicize it and failing to overcome illegal 
aliens ingrained distrust of the ins perceived in the past only 
as the agency that wanted to hunt them down and deport them 
in recent weeks ins officials have waged aggressive programs to 
spread the message that the amnesty program will end soon 
we have done everything except stand on our heads said 
william king who oversees the amnesty program for the ins western 
region including california arizona nevada hawaii and guam 
the efforts have ranged from sponsoring oldfashioned 
neighborhood block parties and participating in ethnic parades to 
speaking to community groups at catholic masses in the southwest 
and west and baptist services in the south and on radio talks 
shows nationwide 
some of the more unusual schemes include stuffing messages about 
the deadline inside packages of tortillas and in fortune cookies 
critics point out that most fortune cookies are eaten by 
middleclass caucasians 
ins workers also have donned sombreros at hispanic festivities 
hugged babies at chinese korean and southeast asian gatherings 
and swaddled themselves in polynesian costumes and roasted pigs at 
tongan night parties they have tried to reach sports fans by 
hiring planes trailing amnesty messages to fly over stadiums and 
have flashed messages on electronic stadium signboards 
in mcallen texas ins worker art zuniga wrote a song in spanish 
entitled amnistia and persuaded local radio stations to play it 
often in some neighborhoods boy scouts have been enlisted to go 
doortodoor handing out leaflets 
in recent weeks ins officials with much fanfare staged 
ceremonies to present temporary residency permits commonly known 
as green cards to a 98yearold woman in texas and a 
101yearold man in california in each case the person was billed 
as the oldest undocumented alien to receive legal status 
in other nations where similar amnesty programs have been 
offered 10 percent of all applications came on the last day not 
unlike the way people file their tax returns king said 
if that happens were going to be out there with mail bags 
accepting applications until 1159 pm may 4 king said 
to make it easier for people to get amnesty the ins announced 
friday it would accept applications that are simply filled out and 
signed by may 4 those applying will have an additional 60 days to 
supply the documentation required to suport the applications 
under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 illegal 
aliens who have lived in this country continuously since before 
jan 1 1982 are eligible to seek amnesty the process costs 
applicants 185 per person up to a maximum of 420 per family plus 
a 75 counseling fee and a 10 photo and fingerprint fee

the recent nato summit in brussels proved that the 
western alliance is trying to unilaterally disarm the soviet union 
so it can achieve military superiority a top soviet general said 
in an article published sunday 
gen sergei akhromeyev chief of the general staff of the soviet 
armed forces said in the defense ministry newspaper krasnaya 
zvezda that nato was unreasonably seeking cuts in soviet 
conventional military forces 
one draws an absolutely definite conclusion that the nato 
leadership is trying to impose unilateral disarmament upon 
socialist countries to break the existing structure of the soviet 
generalpurpose forces and in the final account attain military 
superiority akhromeyev said 
a march 3 declaration by leaders of north atlantic treaty 
organization countries called for cuts in soviet conventional 
military forces nato says the sovietled warsaw pact has a 21 
advantage in tanks and artillery 
but akhromeyev reiterated the soviet view that nato and the 
warsaw pact are roughly equal in strength while nato calls for a 
reduction in tanks and artillery it is superior in aircraft and 
sea power the general said 
akhromeyev also criticized nato for refusing to link 
conventional arms and reduction or elimination of tactical or 
longrange nuclear missiles 
the soviet union is willing to meet the west halfway but its 
initiatives should be reciprocated by the other side it is just a 
waste of time to demand unilateral disarmament from the ussr he 
said 
nato has not directly responded to a warsaw pact proposal made 
in june 1986 for a comprehensive plan to cut military forces 
throughout europe from the atlantic ocean to the soviet unions

michael dukakis chatting with laidoff 
steelworkers on chicagos east side was munching on a big messy 
danish pastry but not wanting to get his breakfast all over his 
crisp business suit he was eating it with a spoon to the 
amusement of the roughhewn onlookers 
this prim approach illustrated what the democratic presidential 
candidate from massachusetts freely admitted to chicagoans in a 
campaign ad narrated by bricklayers union chief tommy mcintyre 
hes not your shotandbeer kind of guy 
but in the course of dukakis campaign its often been easier 
to figure out what kind of a guy dukakis isnt than what kind he is 
in iowa dukakis crusaded against aid to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels in new hampshire he pushed his opposition to the seabrook 
nuclear plant and he spoke out against spacebased missile 
defenses and additions to a navy carrier task force 
but in the south dukakis said he would fight communist 
aggression in central america and he reminded voters that he has 
cut taxes and kept the state budget balanced 
in illinois he portrayed himself as a friend to labor while 
largely steering clear of substantive issues instead he spoke 
about the need to pick a candidate who can win in november 
the multiple portraits of the massachusetts governor reflect a 
conscious campaign strategy to seek the broadest support possible 
in some ways it has paid off 
on super tuesday for example dukakis won in all regions of the 
country and although he finished third in illinois last week 
dukakis did equally well among liberals moderates and 
conservatives according to exit polls 
when nbc news asked illinois voters which democratic candidate 
was more conservative the choices included tennessee sen albert 
gore and missouri rep richard gephardt on the mostliberal list 
were jesse jackson and illinois sen paul simon only one 
candidiate was on both lists michael dukakis 
dukakis has to have some image said pollster sheldon 
gawiser is he tough i dont know is he compassionate i dont 
know is he new i dont know is he old i dont know 
dukakis has promised not to reduce spending on social programs 
and to increase college scholarship programs for needy high school 
graduates he wants a 500 million partnership between the 
public and private sectors to invest in economically depressed 
areas he talks about protecting the environment 
more often though dukakis has stuck to a generalized stump 
speech that only touches lightly on his policy views his super 
tuesday victory speech delivered in chicago was filled with 
phrases like you dont have to be from chicago to want a 
president who will make america no 1 again and the best 
america isnt behind us the best america is yet to come 
even in massachusetts where dukakis has been in public life as 
a legislator and governor for 25 years labels dont stick fast to 
dukakis because his positions dont fit conventional pigeonholes 
dukakis was a reformminded liberal when he first won the 
governorship in 1974 he succeeded a popular republican chief 
executive and inherited an enormous budget deficit 
those deficits forced dukakis to break his promise of no new 
taxes a move some believe cost him his job four years later yet 
he also lost liberal support in that same race because he approved 
reuctions in welfare benefits 
1978 was the turning point in his political life wrote 
robert turner and charles kenney in their recent biography of the 
governor political pragmatism dictated what changed it was not 
an alteration in character but a shift in style approach a 
change he had to make if he was to be successful again in 
politics 
what dukakis calls an involuntary fouryear sabbatical at 
harvards kennedy school of government kept him in touch with 
massachusetts politics and exposed him to a pool of talent that he 
has since tapped for his presidential campaign the governors 
staff is dotted with former students and faculty members from the 
kennedy school 
in 1982 dukakis defeated archrival gov edward king in a 
bruising campaign in which dukakis made it clear he considered the 
king administration corrupt 
his second term was marked by its pragmatism and emphasis on 
encouraging business expansion the four years between 1982 and 
1986 found dukakis facing protests from welfare recipients who 
claimed their benefits kept them far below the poverty level and 
from gays and lesbians who accused him of discriminating against 
homosexuals by forbidding them from being foster parents 
in the south dukakis addressing his image as a cool 
problemsolver commented a tag many have been eager to pin on him 
i have a defintion of a technocrat he said a liberal who 
can balance a budget

texas playwright larry l king is scratching 
his beard in puzzlement 
his blockbuster musical the best little whorehouse in 
texas ran on broadway for 1588 performances to rave reviews 
spawned four national touring companies played on four continents 
became a hit movie and has grossed more than 175 million at last 
count 
but when he mailed the script of his latest play the night 
hank williams died to a big new york producer it was returned a 
week later stamped unsolicited materials not accepted 
other producers and theater directors responded with polite 
yawns broken promises excuses or no response at all 
fords theater in washington didnt bother to acknowledge 
receipt of his manuscript 
perhaps i should have sent them the night abe lincoln 
died king says 
after investing four years and an estimated 7000 in travel 
phone calls postage script copying and lawyers fees king 
finally got his play on the boards at washingtons small 
financially struggling new playwrights theater where it finished 
a successful fiveweek run in early march 
its something of a humbling and perplexing experience for king 
who already has 11 books five stage plays four television 
documentaries hundreds of magazine articles a tv emmy and 
nominations for tony and national book awards to his credit 
but the playwright shrugs off suggestions that new playwrights 
was a humiliating comedown after the bright lights of broadway 
during the day king hustled tickets by phone and delivered show 
posters to swank downtown restaurants where his pals dined without 
him 
on arriving at the 125seat theater near dupont circle his 
first job was to wash coffee cups for the cast and crew then he 
donned costume and makeup to perform a starring role in his own 
play seven times a week 
king has concluded that getting plays produced anywhere in 
america is a perpetual crapshoot no matter how famous the 
playwright 
this is not as good as billy dicks stuff king said in a 
recent interview using his downhome nickname for william 
shakespeare but i know this is not a bad play 
the critics agree and a new playwrights spokeswoman paige 
gold said it was the biggest ticketseller weve had this 
season 
the night hank williams died is not a play about the 
legendary country western singer its about the death of a 
dreamer in a dreamless land a former high school football star 
named thurmond stottle whos pumping gas in a small west texas 
town working on a beer gut and desperate to escape 
king tells the tale both funny and sad with dialogue as hot 
and spicy as threealarm chili and the indisputable truth of a man 
whos been there himself unlike stottle who was gunned down 
before he could flee with his guitar and his dream of singing fame 
in nashville tenn king made good his escape from west texas 
he began his writing career as a reporter on a string of small 
newspapers in texas and new mexico before he moved to washington in 
1954 as a congressional aide while working for rep jim wright 
dtexas now house speaker king finished his first book a 
political novel titled the oneeyed man 
today while trying to arrange future engagements for hank 
williams in texas theaters and a possible offbroadway run this 
fall king is finishing his 12th book a largely autobiographical 
antiwar novel called war movies 
at the same time hes working on another play the golden 
shadows old west museum which is tentatively scheduled to 
premiere next season at the arkansas repertory theater in little 
rock 
its a helluva hard way to make a living said king 59 as 
he lit another cigarette and brushed his blue jeans in the den of 
his comfortable home in a wooded section of northwest washington 
because of enormous production costs and limited financial 
resources he says most theaters play it safe in favor of proven 
hits there just arent that many theaters willing to do new 
plays he said 
he finds it very peculiar that the author of the wildly 
successful whorehouse would have so much difficulty finding a 
producer for his new play even in texas where he is immensely 
popular 
all i can figure is those folks dont have much imagination 
he said when you send in your manuscripts you just dont hear 
from theaters i dont know if they open their mail or even see it 
thats not good manners much less good business

after five years of debate about futuristic 
space weapons both supporters and critics of president reagans 
star wars system agree that the program will remain one of reagans 
chief legacies after he leaves office next year 
there is no way this program will die when reagan leaves 
office regardless of who is elected in november said john pike 
of the federation of american scientists a chief critic of 
reagans program 
theres a constituency for the program now and that means it 
is here to stay pike said the next president whether 
republican or democrat is going to have limited options he wont 
be able to significantly raise it because of budget restrictions 
but he wont be able to cut it deeply either 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee and another critic of the missile defense system agreed 
politically the star wars issue is here to stay its not going 
to go away aspin said 
and on the other side retired air force gen daniel graham who 
is one of reagans strongest supporters said i believe that it 
is almost inexorable that the program will continue to grow the 
debate has been changed 
we are making progress the debate now is about what kind of 
system not whether any defense at all is a good idea said air 
force lt gen james abrahamson head of the program 
the debate began almost as soon as reagan proposed the idea five 
years ago at the end of a nationally televised speech in the 
speech reagan referred to the current nuclear doctrine of mutual 
assured destruction which holds that each superpower is deterred 
from a nuclear attack against the other because of the threat of 
devastating retaliation 
science reagan said should be devoted to defense not offense 
and he laid out his dream of building a defensive system that would 
free the world from the threat of nuclear war 
reagan dubbed his plan the strategic defense initiative sdi 
although pike and other critics began calling it star wars 
after the hit movie a name that stuck 
one of the strongest supporters of the program was graham head 
of a private foundation known as high frontier and the chief 
advocate of deploying a system of orbiting garages full of 
rockets that could be readily fired at attacking soviet missiles 
the united states had been devoting hundreds of millions of 
dollars to defensive research before reagans speech but the 
presidents interest changed the program and set off a national 
debate about whether such a system could be built and what it would 
cost 
originally pentagon officials said the program would look at a 
variety of exotic futuristic weapons such as neutral particle 
beams electromagnetic rail guns and electron lasers 
but many of those technologies have not panned out and while 
research on them is continuing the program is now concentrating 
almost half its 42 billion budget on a socalled phase one 
defense that would at best be able to knock out less than half 
the soviet landbased nuclear missiles 
that would still leave hundreds of landbased rockets to attack 
the united states along with submarinebased missiles and soviet 
bombers 
they havent really come up with a successful technology 
yet pike said in fact theyve had a lot more success 
eliminating some things such as the rail guns and the really 
exotic stuff 
among the chief critics of star wars have been a succession of 
soviet leaders particularly mikhail s gorbachev the current 
soviet leader 
gorbachev has warned time and again that star wars is the major 
hurdle to a ussoviet treaty eliminating half the thousands of 
atomic weapons each side has aimed at each other but reagan has 
adamantly refused to agree to any limits on star wars research 
gorbachev has also warned that the soviets are working on a 
system to counter sdi at last decembers summit meeting in 
washington he said if the americans have a lot of money let 
them squander it on sdi we will look for a response along other 
asymmetrical lines that will be less expensive 
us officials no longer talk about the possibility of 
eliminating nuclear weapons instead they say sdi will make it 
more difficult for the soviets to be sure of knocking out american 
weapons in any attack thus making it harder for the soviets to 
attack 
defense secretary frank c carlucci in his annual report to 
congress said the deterrent value of strategic defenses derives 
from the effect these defenses would have on soviet calculations on 
the costs and benefits of launching an attack 
this type of defense would enable us to influence the soviet 
decisionmakers calculus by diminishing his confidence in the 
ability of his forces to execute an effective attack rather than 
by increasing the severity of our retaliation he said a 
strategic defense need not be leakproof to achieve this 
objective 
star wars also has been the subject of annual congressional 
fights over spending the democraticcontrolled congress has 
consistently reduced sdi spending 
reagan took aim at congress last week when he said capitol hill 
should realize its no longer a question of whether there will be 
an sdi program or not the only question will be whether the 
soviets are the only ones who have strategic defenses while the 
united states remains entirely defenseless 
while the debate goes on so does the research particularly on 
the socalled phase one system 
the plan is based on a system of 200 to 400 orbiting satellites 
each of which would have 10 socalled kinetic kill vehicles or 
rockets that would destroy a target by slamming into it at high 
speeds 
the pentagon declines to estimate the cost of phase one but the 
congressional research service recently said the bill could come to 
more than 200 billion 
pike said one of the main obstacles to sdi eventually will be 
the budget youve already seeing intense competition for defense 
department dollars and that will only increase in the future he 
said

antiapartheid activists 
pledged to defy authorities monday in the first nationwide protest 
since the government banned leading black opposition groups last 
month 
pamphlets urging a general strike were circulating through black 
townships in defiance of government regulations police have 
threatened action against strike organizers and promised to protect 
blacks wishing to work 
organizers called for the oneday strike to commemorate the 28th 
anniversary of the sharpeville massacre and protest banning of the 
united democratic front and other groups 
the front the countrys largest antiapartheid coalition 
coordinated previous nationwide protests during the 21monthold 
state of emergency emergency regulations outlaw calls for strikes 
and boycotts but hundreds of thousands of black workers and 
students have joined past protests by staying away from jobs and 
schools 
in soweto one major protest meeting was held sunday at a roman 
catholic church speakers from some of the organizations which have 
been restricted addressed a crowd of more than 1500 
police entered the church during the meeting to ask that the 
participants stop singing freedom songs but the songs resumed 
after the officers left according to people at the church 
services were scheduled monday in several cities and townships 
to mark the anniversary of the 1960 massacre in sharpeville a 
township south of johannesburg sixtynine blacks were killed and 
about 180 injured when police fired on thousands of demonstrators 
protesting pass laws repealed in 1986 those laws restricted 
freedom of movement as part of the national apartheid system of 
racial segregation 
several affiliates of the united democratic front that were 
unaffected by the ban took out newspaper advertisements announcing 
mondays protest 
the depth and extent of our peoples anger about the bannings 
has surprised even us said a statement issued by the affiliates 
not sated with the whole country under the state of emergency and 
hundreds filling the prison cells the regime is turning to 
blocking all avenues of peaceful protest 
the predominantly white university of cape town and mostly 
mixedrace university of the western cape were shutting down monday

six a musical with an antiapartheid theme playing to full 
houses in johannesburg was also canceled

killing of a black town councilor during antiapartheid riots in 
1984

president francois mitterrand on sunday promised to 
reveal this week whether he will seek reelection a question that 
has kept the country in suspense for months 
i hear you believe me it seems you want me to tell you 
today today about tomorrow mitterrand said in a videotaped 
message to a political rally of 20000 socialists and presidential 
supporters in the paris suburb of bourget 
political pundits predict mitterrand will announce his plans at 
a meeting of the socialist party in strasbourg on friday just four 
weeks before voters go to the polls 
guessing about the socialist presidents plans has become 
something of a parlor game in france sometimes the 71yearold 
president has hinted he would like to retire but on other 
occasions has left the impression he would seek another term 
the magazine parismatch has sponsored a contest asking readers 
to guess whether mitterrand will run the day of his decision and 
the exact minute it will be announced the winner will have income 
taxes paid by the magazine for the sevenyear term of the next 
president 
as the april 5 deadline nears for candidates to place their 
names on the ballot it seems increasingly likely mitterrand will 
run 
lionel jospin first secretary of the socialist party 
reinforced this impression in comments made to reporters before the 
presidents speech 
to win it is necessary that a candidate have the stature of a 
president we have it or in any case in some days i am convinced 
we are going to have it with francois mitterrand jospin said 
polls have consistently placed mitterrand ahead of the two other 
leading contenders for the presidency conservative premier jacques 
chirac and former premier raymond barre the other main 
conservative candidate 
in fact the first round of the election april 24 is regarded as 
a sort of primary election between the rival conservatives the 
winner would then face mitterrand if he runs in a decisive 
second round may 8 
a poll published in the journal du dimanche newspaper sunday 
showed 55 percent of the 1813 people polled were satisfied with 
mitterrand fortyeight percent were satisfied with chirac as 
premier 
a handful of minorparty contenders including andre lejoinie of 
the once powerful communists are expected to draw a total of 5 
percent of the vote or less jeanmarie le pen of the extremeright 
national front could get about 10 percent of the vote 
francois cornutgentille a political expert with the 
independent sofres polling firm said the right is divided 
between barre and chirac so mitterrand is the unifier he has the 
image of a man of state 
the image has led to a groundswell of support for the president 
who has enjoyed enormous popularity despite his national 
noncampaign independent campaigns have sprung up around the 
country gathering signatures and putting up posters for 
tonton mitterrands nickname an affectionate term for uncle 
chirac spokesman alain juppe said mitterrands strategy has been 
to remain outside the melee and continue to act like the father 
of the country on his little pink cloud 
some experts predict that when mitterrand enters the political 
fray his image may take a beating

carol pittas thought it was a little 
strange when a passing motorist asked if the lion on the hill was 
real but after a few more passersby asked the same question 
pittas and her fellow rip van winkle bridge toll collectors thought 
twice 
sure enough a fullgrown 200pound adult lioness was resting 
just 25 feet from the entrance to the upstate hudson river bridge 
friday night 
it was just lying there and all these passing cars were asking 
about it pittas said one guy asked if he could keep it if he 
caught it 
it seems the lioness was an escaped pet from a nearby river 
estate the owners were on vacation and somehow the lioness broke 
free and found its way to the bridge approach state trooper ron 
levin said 
police were called to the scene along with two animal handlers 
from the nearby catskill game farm to sedate the animal with a 
tranquilizing gun 
it wasnt too friendly levin said and it got really 
upset when it was shot 
when hit by the dart the lioness roared and ran into an 
adjacent wooded area and headed toward the river police and the 
animal handlers followed 
animal handler jurgen schultz used a flashlight to find the cat 
again and gave her another tranquilizing dart in the flank for

political wheels are turning in 
an effort to prevent the navy from bailing out of the famous 
nanaimotovancouver bathtub race 
the canadian armed forces has provided a communications network 
boats and emergency personnel free of charge for the race ever 
since it was first run in 1967 but organizers at the loyal nanaimo 
bathtub society were told this year they would have to foot the 
bill if the navy takes part 
the move has spurred a lobbying effort by nanaimoalberni 
legislator ted schellenberg who raised the issue in parliament 
last week 
the citizens of nanaimo call on the department of national 
defense to once again take part in tubbing and to sail with those 
who bail the progressive conservative member of parliament said 
bathtub society commodore john ruttan said the pullout is a 
serious concern for organizers of the summer event nanaimo mayor 
frank ney blamed the retreat on some bureaucratic paperslinger 
who interpreted department rules too closely 
im quite sure that when the message gets to the right person 
the navy will be allowed to return said ney they may even 
make someone walk the plank 
the race with motorized tubs is about 20 miles long from 
nanaimo on vancouver island to the mainland across georgia strait

watergate conspirator jeb stuart magruder 
says his past was the perfect prologue to his new post as the head 
of the citys commission on values and ethics formed after scores 
of people scooped up cash that fell from an armored car 
magruder now a presbyterian minister was a deputy director of 
communications in the nixon white house and spent seven months in 
jail for his role in the watergate scandal 
magruder 53 who calls watergate one of the greatest ethical 
scandals of modern times said in an interview that what he learned 
from watergate qualifies him to lead the 15member panel of 
business education and religious leaders 
watergate happened 15 years ago since that period of time i 
have spent most of my life in preparation for the ministry and in 
the ministry and in doing that i took on as kind of my issue 
because of watergate im sure the issue of ethics that 
automatically hit a responsive chord in me he said laughing 
magruder was ordained a presbyterian minister in 1981 and since 
has divided his time between his duties at first community church 
and speaking to groups around the state about ethics he is almost 
finished writing a book on the subject 
i do have a fairly unique kind of a pattern to discuss 
being involved in one of the great scandals of our country which 
was an ethical scandal he said and studying ethics from a 
theological viewpoint i have come to some conclusions about what 
is happening in this life 
those conclusions include a major change from his code of ethics 
in the watergate era 
if they havent changed then it has been a real waste of 
time hasnt it he said 
the commissions goal is to generate discussion of ethics and 
values by city residents to that end it is sponsoring a forum 
april 23 featuring sen mark hatfield rore plans presentations 
in schools and eventually will distribute a questionnaire posing 
ethical questions that it hopes will spur consideration of the 
issues 
it was the brainchild of mayor dana rinehart and others 
including magruder who have gathered monthly for informal lunch 
meetings since last fall their talk turned to values and ethics in 
october after the rear door of an armored car flew open and bags of 
cash spilled onto interstate 71 
an estimated 200 people converged on the freeway some to gawk 
but most to scoop up flying bills 
a telephone worker was given a mayoral proclamation and a reward 
for returning 57000 but many others kept the money 
how much cash was lost and how much was recovered has never been 
publicly released but published figures estimate that as much as 
1 million may have fallen from the truck 
i wasnt surprised people didnt return the money magruder 
said but that same week a poll came out that said something 
like 90 percent of the state wants honesty as its key factor in its 
elected officials yet when people were polled about whether they 
would have taken the money on the freeway 60some percent of them 
said they would 
when you have that kind of hypocrisy in the body politic 
youre going to have confusion 
rinehart said he wasnt surprised either but began to think 
more about values and ethics when he talked to his three children 
about it 
they didnt have a clearcut answer they said it probably 
didnt matter since the money was insured and then they said that 
nobody would know if they kept it rinehart said i couldnt 
believe it i said youd know 
thats why we have the commission to get a grip on where our 
values and ethics are and spark a little discussion to get rid of 
this myopic view some of have of reality i really dont think the 
rolex watch and bmw neighborhoods are fulfilling people anymore 
people need more in their lives

when strikes shut down the rest of 
the country panama canal employees went to work when flaming 
barricades blocked downtown streets roads to the canal were clear 
the crisis gripping the rest of the country has barely touched the 
waterway so vital to panamas economy 
even at the height of this weeks protests rioters demanding 
the ouster of strongman gen manuel antonio noriega avoided the 
canal zone just outside the capital 
canal officials said the most serious problem was a transit 
stoppage that made it impossible for many canal employees to get to 
work 
after last wednesdays failed coup attempt and street riots the 
joint uspanamanian commission that has governed the canal since 
1979 issued a reassuring statement 
we expect surface transit to continue without interruption 
said the canals marine director george hull 
but not everyone agrees 
capt john maher president of the 230member panama canal 
pilots association said continued political instability could 
sound the waterways death knell 
ship builders are already planning for the year 2000 when 
panama takes full control of the waterway he explained and they 
must decide now whether new fleets will be small enough to fit 
through the 110footwide lock chambers 
the association pilots guide ships large and small through the 
canal its locks and other installations 
maher fears that if builders have doubts about the canals 
future they will opt to build larger ships about 1800 ships 
worldwide are already too big to pass through the locks 
an average of 33 ships a day pass through the 50mile set of 
locks and lakes canal officials said 37 made the trip the day of 
the coup attempt and 39 passed through the next day despite work 
stoppages at ports on both sides of the waterway 
even the power outages that plagued the rest of the country did 
not affect the canal because the commission generates its own power 
the canal along with offshore banking a thriving reexport 
industry and a large us military presence has made panama the 
most prosperous country in central america canal revenues make up 
about 10 percent of panamas gross national product 
in 1987 the canal made direct payments of 781 million to 
panama from toll revenue of just under 330 million much of the 
rest of the revenue which goes to maintenance salaries and other 
expenditures also helped swell the national economy 
but years of deficit spending also piled up a 45 billion 
foriegn debt that led to civil unrest capital flight and loss of 
government income local banks have been closed for weeks because 
the government could not provide them with enough money to cover a 
run panama has no currency of its own and uses the us dollar 
the united states has been applying economic pressure in hopes 
of forcing noriega to resign it cut off military and economic aid 
and withheld 65 million in canal fees last week 
the canal commission is sensitive about the problems the chaos 
is creating for what it insists is a nonpolitical maritime 
waterway commission spokeswoman mercedes morris said the rioting 
and unrest have unfairly frayed the waterways reputation 
maher finds the cloud over the canal particularly galling 
because of its smooth transition so far to direct panamanian 
control under a 1979 treaty with the united states 
the panamazation of the canal has been a great success he 
saidand if the canal can come through the current problems 
unscathed the future is great 
the canal and the treaties returning it to panama evoke fervent 
nationalism 
in 1979 the united states turned the canal zone over to panama 
ending an era of american courts postal services police and even 
a company store 
but about 10000 american troops are still stationed in bases in 
panama home of the us southern command the nerve center for all 
american military activity in latin america the canal treaties say 
the us bases will go at the end of the century

national security adviser lt gen colin 
powell said sunday the fighting between nicaragua and honduras is 
basically over and the chance of involvement by us troops in 
combat is unlikely 
i dont expect that they the us troops will get anywhere 
near the combat zone powell said the combat zone is rapidly 
disappearing as the sandinistas appear to withdraw and i dont 
think there is any reasonable likelihood that they would be 
anywhere near the combat zone or getting themselves in a combat 
situation 
the reagan administration dispatched 3200 troops to honduras 
this week in response to the nicaraguan incursion across the border 
to destroy contra rebel camps and supplies the us troops were to 
participate in exercises far from the fighting 
powell who appeared on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley said the exercises should be completed shortly and the 
troops will return to the united states 
i would expect that in a short period of time the exercise 
will end and they will be on the way home powell said 
defense secretary frank c carlucci had said friday that us 
forces would remain in the region for 10 days and not take part in 
border fighting between the two central american nations 
powell said sunday that based on ground fighting the battle 
is pretty much over the sandinistas have withdrawn theyre 
apparently on their side of the border again they appear to be in 
a process of withdrawing or have withdrawn 
and our troops are 5060100 miles away from the site of 
action and no plans are being made to move them any closer he 
said i see no prospect of their entering into a combat 
situation 
ceasefire talks between nicaraguas sandinista government and 
leaders of the contra forces were scheduled to resume monday in 
managua but the possibility of negotiations seemed slim in light 
of the fighting 
secretary of state george p shultz who appeared on nbctvs 
meet the press said he was uncertain about the future of the 
peace talks 
i think the likelihood is they will resume but im not 
certain of that shultz said there seems to be a certain 
amount of maneuvering among the parties but i think a reasonable 
and sensible ceasefire would be a good thing and so were for 
it 
shultz also said the administration is examining a bipartisan 
congressional plan of 48 million in new aid to the contras 
including renewed authority for the cia to deliver previously 
stockpiled weapons 
its a very interesting plan were studying it shultz 
said it seems a little low on money but it is an interesting 
effort on their part and deserves careful study and i hope that 
something goes forward it should go forward 
powell denied published reports that the administration turned 
down honduran president jose azconas request that us helicopters 
be used to ferry honduran troops to the battle zone 
the new york times quoting an unidentified senior 
administration official reported sunday that the united states 
rejected the honduran proposal which was never made formally 
we did not say no powell said we were in the process of 
examining that request it had some funding problems and some 
policy problems and before we had to answer definitely yes or 
no or even get a formal request we found another way to 
exercise 
he did not specify what type of exercise but the times reported 
that us officials were able to persuade honduras to accept a 
joint training exercise in which us helicopters would carry 
honduran troops to about 30 miles from the nicaraguan border but 
100 miles from the battle zone 
we are not using us airlift to move honduran troops to the 
scene of the action at the bocay powell said referring to the 
major battle site 
powell denied that he had misled congress when he briefed 
legislators on wednesday and failed to mention that president 
reagan had decided in principle to send troops to honduras if 
azcona asked 
we did not go into the specific options because we did not 
want it all over the newspapers powell said 
house majority whip tony coelho dcalif in an interview on 
cbstvs face the nation contended the administration did 
mislead congress about plans to send us troops to honduras 
i think that what happened is that we were being briefed at 
430 in the afternoon on day and they had made a decision that 
morning to go down and they told us in that meeting that it was 
not even under consideration to send troops down to honduras 
coelho said 
i think that what is happening here is that we are being 
misled or we were being misled he added

the 1944 invasion of france as the high point of his career his 
son john eisenhower said as he helped launch the first navy ship 
named the normandy 
former ambassador to belgium john eisenhower the only surviving 
child of the world war ii military hero who went on to serve two 
terms in the white house said saturday the invasion demonstrated 
the need then and now for a naval fleet capable of delivering 
forces anywhere in the world 
a strong naval fleet keeps the american way of life viable 
he told the 4500 spectators who watched the 567footlong 
normandy an aegis guided missile cruiser slide down the ways at 
bath iron works shipyard 
i feel like i am representing my father who regarded his role 
in the normandy invasion as a high point in a long career of 
service eisenhower said recalling how he accompanied his father 
to the beaches of normandy nine days after the allies june 6 
1944 landing 
the allied expeditionary force of 9000 ships and landing craft 
headed by the late general carried 176000 troops 20000 vehicles 
and 1500 tanks across the english channel to reopen the western

a gunman opened fire at 
close range sunday on a reserve soldier standing guard near a 
palestinian refugee camp marking the first israeli army fatality 
in four months of unrest in the occupied lands 
the armys chief of staff st gen dan shomron said the 
shooting could augur greater use of guns by palestinian activists 
he stopped short of saying it signaled a major change in the 
tactics of protesters who have mainly hurled stones and bottles at 
israels occupation forces 
i dont think we can yet see this as a shift to an armed 
struggle he said 
but defense minister yitzhak rabin indicated stronger action 
would be taken to quell palestinian uprisings 
to the extent that extremist palestinian terrorist elements 
try to combine terrorist acts with the civilian disturbances we 
will have to adjust our operations and take harsher measures to 
cope with both he said 
the army identified the slain soldier as sgt moshe katz 28 
from the northern port city of haifa 
he was shot two or three times in the head at close range while 
guarding a government building facing the small beit jibrin 
palestinian refugee camp in this biblical city the military said 
troops immediately sealed off the road the main tourist route 
from jerusalem to the citys manger square the site of christs 
birth they also slapped a curfew on the refugee camp and rounded 
up everyone who was in the area for questioning an army 
spokesman said 
shortly after the killing a dozen israeli soldiers guarded 
about 100 palestinians in front of shops soldiers led them away in 
small groups for questioning 
rabin and shomron rushed to the scene 
its a painful day but we are determined to go on to make 
sure security will prevail in israel and the territories rabin 
said later at the western wall in jerusalems old city the most 
sacred site in judaism 
he told a group of supporters that the protests in the occupied 
territories had the same goal as the arab wars against israel 
the purpose is through the use of force to get rid of us 
bethlehem mayor elias freij said the situation in the 
territories will be aggravated by the shooting but he blamed 
the frustration of arab protesters on israels occupation of lands 
captured in the 1967 middle east war 
the key to calming down the situation is in the hands of the 
israeli minister of defense and the government he said 
freij said that the army had used welding torches during the two 
previous days to seal 20 shops that were following hours mandated 
by the palestine liberation organization he said souvenir shops on 
manger square had been shuttered for six days because of 
conflicting army and plo demands 
in gaza city troops closed the main vegetable market for three 
hours after firing tear gas to disperse arab youths who blocked a 
main street and hurled stones at troops arab reporters said 
israelis have been using economic pressure in addition to 
military force in trying to quell the unrest they have cut 
international telephone lines and blocked fuel shipments 
plo chief yasser arafat has said throughout the unrest that he 
ordered his followers to forgo use of guns against israeli forces 
the army has reported only scattered cases of arabs shooting at 
soldiers or civilians 
last thursday an israeli civilian was shot in the legs near a 
refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip 
israeli troops have killed 103 palestinians since dec 8 
according to united nations figures 
the arabrun palestine press service said two more palestinians 
died sunday of wounds suffered in earlier clashes with soldiers 
but these were not confirmed by the army 
katzs killing took place a day before what underground leaders 
were billing as potentially the most severe confrontations yet a 
recent communique circulated in the gaza strip and west bank called 
for major protests monday they were aimed at marking the 1968 
battle of karameh when plo fighters helped repel an israeli force 
that attacked a guerrilla base in jordan 
in other west bank violence the army said israeli troops shot 
and killed a 26yearold arab late saturday when their patrol was 
attacked with firebombs in the village of kfar dan about 50 miles 
north of jerusalem the arabrun palestine press service identified 
the victim as nameq milhem 
israel radio said the death resulted from new orders calling for 
soldiers to shoot at arabs who throw firebombs

the midgetman atomictipped missile is a 
good idea that can do more to improve us nuclear deterrence than 
putting mx nuclear missiles aboard trains according to a house 
armed services study released sunday 
the report by the democraticcontrolled panel was the latest 
round in a longrunning fight between the pentagon and congress 
over the best type of landbased nuclear weapons to build 
the report was critical of air force plans to put mx weapons 
aboard trains for transport on the nations railways during times 
of crisis 
the air force is assuming that because mx would be roaming 
commercial rail lines only in times of international crisis public 
resistance to launchready missiles in boxcars will evaporate 
said rep les aspin dwis chairman of the panel 
maybe thats true but the air force has no evidence to 
support the assumption on the other hand railbasing schemes have 
been shelved twice in the past because of public opposition he 
said 
but the air force was sharply critical of aspin 
there he goes again gen larry welch air force chief of 
staff said referring to previous aspin criticism of air force 
atomic weapons that the service says was unfounded 
in a statement the service said the railbasing plan has been 
subjected to a rigorous analytical and careful acquisition 
process and it said civilians would support the idea 
the dispute has its roots in the bitter fights during president 
reagans first term about whether the build the mx as a successor 
to the aging minuteman missiles which are the heart of the us 
landbased atomic deterrent force 
reagan wanted 100 of the 10warhead weapons but congress cut 
the total to 50 because of fears that the large number of warheads 
on each missiles combined with their placement in stationary 
silos would make them easy targets for soviet attack 
a presidential commission said the mx program should go ahead 
but should eventually be succeeded by a singlewarhead weapon 
dubbed midgetman aspin became one of the biggest champions of the 
midgetman and tentative plans were drawn up to build a force of 500 
of the weapons and put them in western silos 
but pentagon budget cuts in recent years have forced a revision 
of the plans to buy both the mx and midgetman and air force and 
pentagon officials have made clear that their choice would be 
purchasing more mx weapons 
in addition to the 50 mx weapons approved for landbased silos 
the air force wants to build 50 more and put two on each of 25 
trains 
defense secretary frank c carlucci told congress last month 
that he preferred to kill the midgetman program outright but 
consented to including 200 million in next years air force budget 
so it could be kept alive until a new administration makes a final 
decision 
the house panels study noted that a force of 500 midgetman 
weapons would cost an estimated 40 billion but pointed out that 
the figure has decreased from the 57 billion estimate when the 
program was first proposed four years ago 
by contrast putting the mx aboard railroads would cost an 
estimated 138 billion the study noted 
aspin said that the midgetman cost figures which would make it 
the most expensive weapons program in the pentagon could be 
reduced as part of the effort to cut defense spending 
giving each missile two warheads would cut the number of 
deployed missiles in half or it may be that the job can be 
accomplished with fewer than 500 singlewarhead missiles aspin 
said 
the report said the midgetman program appears to be operating 
under a sound acquisition strategy emphasizing risk reduction 
competition and a realistic schedule at a time when some strategic 
programs are experiencing severe difficulties 
but air force secretary edward aldridge noting the higher cost 
estimates for the midgetman said aspins report took an 
extremely narrow view of what is in the best interests of our 
country because the money to pay for the more expensive weapon 
would have to be taken out of the budget for onnuclear weapons 
the net result would be a decrease in our conventional 
deterrence posture aldridge said in a statement

florida sand from a barge in a developers effort to turn a stretch 
of brown gulf coast beach into a sparkling bit of paradise 
yes it is white said jay bottoms a spokesman for the 
company unloading the 5425 tons of sand saturday from the barge to 
the docks at galveston 
the sand amounting to a pile 200 feet long 20 feet high and 60 
feet wide will be moved this week to the site of a 
multimilliondollar resort development 
later this spring it will be spread over a threeacre area to 
be called palm beach after the posh florida community 
when completed the resort it will accommodate about 3000

a newspaper reported sunday that druse militia 
members in lebanon considered trying to rescue anglican church 
envoy terry waite from his abductors but dropped the idea because 
they thought it lacked us support 
the sunday telegraph said waite is alive and being held by an 
iranianbacked radical group blamed for other kidnappings in 
lebanon 
according to the newspaper waite was involved in an accident 
that required surgery but it did not give specifics 
the newspaper said its story was based on an unnamed lebanese 
source who played a key role in investigating waites disappearance 
in beirut in january 1987 
the newspaper said in a dispatch from washington that waite 48 
is being held captive by a shiite group headed by imad mugniyeh a 
member of the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella organization for groups 
blamed for many of the kidnappings of 22 foreigners held hostage in 
lebanon including nine americans the longestheld hostage is 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press who was captured march 16 1985 
waite special envoy of archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
disappeared while on a mission to help win the release of hostages 
no group has claimed to be holding him 
the sunday telegraph said for three days after his 
disappearance waite was kept in a house in the southern suburbs of 
beirut and was in frequent contact with the us embassy in lebanon 
it said waite was not really a hostage during this period 
but was driven around the southern suburbs under escort to visit 
people in the area 
the newspaper said waite was spotted by members of the druse 
militia who had served as his bodyguards it quoted the source as 
saying they found the house in which waite was staying tapped the 
telephone and monitored his calls to the embassy 
it quoted the source as saying the druse considered a military 
rescue but did not feel they had the full backing of the 
americans for this 
after three days of semicaptivity the negotiations broke down 
and mr waite became a fullyfledged hostage the newspaper said

drugs to relieve some of the 
devastating effects of alzheimers disease are still years off but 
there is at least a glimmer of hope for victims of the progressive 
brain disease a scientist says 
researchers from several nations met in springfield over the 
weekend at the first international symposium on the use of drugs in 
treating the disease 
no one would have dared to hold a symposium until now because 
there was no hope before said dr ezio giacobini an organizer 
of the conference at southern illinois university school of 
medicine in springfield he is a professor and the chairman of 
pharmacology at the school 
the disease was first discovered in 1917 but there was not 
even a glimpse of progress until five years ago he said in a 
telephone interview saturday 
alzheimers disease is an irreversible deterioration of the 
brain characterized by memory loss with no known prevention or 
cure an estimated 25 million people in the united states are 
afflicted 
one of the encouraging aspects highlighted at the symposium 
said giacobini is that about a dozen drugs which may relieve 
symptoms are in various stages of testing around the world 
for the first time were looking at a number of compounds that 
do what has not been done before improve memory he said 
however most of the drugs under investigation so far produce 
only minor modifications for short times 
one drug that does seem to work is tetrahydroaminoacridine or 
tha but it has severe side effects said dr serge gauthier of the 
mcgill center for studies in aging in montreal 
it is being tested in the united states and dosage levels have 
been reduced to lessen liver damage reseachers said results are 
not yet known 
experimental use of tha in canada has shown that while it 
improves memory as long as a patient takes it about 80 percent of 
the subjects experience extreme nausea and vomiting gauthier said 
if we could find something similar but a little easier on the 
liver and stomach that would be an improvement but theres 
nothing better so far he said 
giacobini said chinese investigators at the symposium told of 
identifying two drugs huperzine a and huperzine b from a plant 
called huperzia and testing them on 500 victims of various diseases 
with memoryloss symptoms 
they found that the drug increased the memory substantially 
said giacobini however the trials have only been done in china 
so far theyve never been replicated 
the chinese drugs also have not yet been synthesized and must be 
painstakingly extracted from plants 
tests of huperzine are planned outside china in switzerland and 
in giacobinis laboratory at southern illinois 
giacobini predicted that within five or 10 years some safe and 
effective drug should surface not to cure but to help a lot

parliament on sunday approved a threeyear 
extension of emergency laws passed in 1981 after the assassination 
of president anwar sadat by moslem fundamentalists 
the government said the laws were needed to combat terrorist 
threats 
the middle east news agency said the new extension would be in 
force from may 1 1988 to may 31 1991 
the emergency measures are conducted within the framework of 
legality and sovereignity of the constitution and are under 
complete judicial supervision and there is no reason to fear these 
measures which enable us to weed out plots mena quoted a 
parliamentary committees report as saying 
the emergency laws ban demonstrations unauthorized assembly and 
strikes and give the government wide powers of search without 
warrant and detention of people regarded as security risks 
they have been in existence since sadats slaying on oct 6 
1981 they were extended in april 1986 for two years 
in asking for the extension of the emergency laws prime 
minister atef sedki told parliament that the laws will be used in 
limited incidents and will not affect anyone with legitimate 
ideologies 
interior minister zaki badr who is in charge of police and 
internal security told parliament that in the past two years 
authorities had uncovered 227 cases of extremist action 
involving 1458 defendants 
he said these included cases such as the reconstruction of the 
jihad or holy war group about 300 jihad members were tried after 
sadats assassination and half of them were sentenced to varying 
prison terms for forming an illegal organization and attempting to 
overthrow the government 
in addition 20 members of the egypts revolution group were 
charged with carrying out four antiamerican and antiisraeli 
terrorist attacks between 1984 and 1987 no date has been set for 
the trial 
badr said that police had seized large amounts of explosives 
hand grenades automatic rifles and other weapons with the various 
defendants 
it does not take long to see the seriousness of the challenges 
and the amounts of dangers that surround us from every side he 
said 
i can honostely said that the emergency laws are a necessary 
measure that have no alternative they will secure the society and 
protect it from serious dangers badr said

his publishing credits include an article in the journal of 
correctional education and an essay in a college textbook

advocate than any of us said reffett who wrote topes

the sandinista government on sunday 
protested attacks on sandinista targets by honduran forces and 
prepared for its first direct ceasefire talks with contra rebels 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the mediator in previous talks 
and an observer to the monday discussions expressed a hint of 
pessimism about their outcome 
i see the situation as quite complicated he said during his 
sunday homily it is very difficult to reconcile two things that 
are completely opposite 
the negotiations were scheduled for the southern border post of 
sapoa 90 miles south of the capital near the costa rican border 
the honduran bombings thursday and saturday along the isolated 
northern border were aimed at retaliating for an alleged sandinista 
troop incursion last week into honduras to chase contra rebels 
there were no reported casualties in the air attacks 
the nicaraguan troops are now in nicaraguan territory in the 
border area deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said at a 
news conference sunday suggesting that the army had crossed the 
border we cant retreat from the border area because we cant 
abandon our right to defend our national territory 
he denied reports that the sandinista troops remained inside 
honduran territory calling them a lie by the reagan administration 
to obtain more money for the contras 
the rebels have been fighting the government since nov 1981 in 
a conflict that has killed more than 40000 people the ceasefire 
talks are included in a regional peace plan signed in august by the 
presidents of nicaragua el salvador guatemala honduras and costa 
rica the pact calls for amnesty democratic reforms and an end to 
support for insurgencies 
tinoco said mondays talks will center on finding a way for the 
rebels to lay down their arms the government delegation will be 
headed by the nations top military leader gen humberto ortega 
brother of president daniel ortega 
the contras say the talks should include political issues their 
top delegate will be the rebels leading political leader adolfo 
calero 
the sandinista newspaper barricada repeated its call sunday for 
nicaraguans to maintain a state of alert in the face of honduran 
bombs and american troops 
the way the honduran government borrows yankee planes to 
provoke an incident could serve as a pretext for a direct 
invasion the paper said in an editorial

some of gov bill clintons enthusiasm 
for the super tuesday 20state contest held on march 8 has 
apparently abated 
instead of such a largescale super tuesday clinton suggested 
smaller seven or eightstate primary elections separated by 
enough time for candidates to really go into the states and get 
to know the people and the issues 
a lot of the campaigning leading up to the march 8 voting the 
governor said in his weekly radio address on saturday consisted of 
airport news conferences and television advertising thus clinton 
said wellfunded candidates benefited unfairly 
the governor said he had hoped super tuesday would give southern 
voters a more personal identification with the candidates 
he said though that super tuesday accomplished some goals that 
had been his reasons for supporting the massive regional effort 
including bringing candidates to the south and giving the region 
more influence in the nominating process

atlarge delegates in saturdays 270 county and senatorial district 
conventions across the state 
those conventions determine the allocation of 64 atlarge 
delegates to the national convention but statewide results of 
saturdays meetings were not tallied 
with just over half of the 5288 delegates accounted for 
jackson had 41 percent and dukakis governor of massachusetts 36 
percent uncommitted delegates were running 10 percent tennessee 
sen al gore had 10 percent missouri rep richard gephardt 3 
percent and illinois sen paul simon 1 percent former colorado 
sen gary hart had one delegate from a district in houston 
i would just guess the state convention will be composed of 
onethird jackson onethird dukakis and about a third of the 
people either gore gephardt or uncommitted said state 
democratic party chairman bob slagle 
state democrats meet for their convention june 911 in houston 
where they will chose delegates to the national convention 
on saturday republicans met in senatorial district and county 
conventions many counties reported a record gop turnout at the 
meetings 
although vice president george bush won all 111 national 
delegates to the convention the gop battles were over delegates 
who will eventually write the partys platform and rules 
a pat robertsoncontrolled convention in nueces county adjourned 
when their alloted time ran out and reconvened in a church a short 
time later backers of bush tried to block the move to the church 
but were voted down 
that place was full of religious fanatics said nueces 
county bush delegate steve cobb they voted down everyone who 
voted against reconvening in a church out of concern for separation 
of church and state 
among the democrats supporters of dukakis and jackson wrestled 
in several areas dukakis finished first in the march 8 primary 
with jackson finishing second 
in the 9th senatorial district of dallas jackson carried the 
day by winning 153 delegates to only two for dukakis while 104 
remained uncommitted jackson also scored an upset in travis 
county which dukakis won in the primary jackson took 138 
delegates to dukakis 99 
texas democrats use a peculiar twotrack system of picking 
delegates with 119 chosen by state senatorial districts through 
the primary vote and the remaining 64 allocated statewide through a 
separate process of caucuses and conventions overall texas 
democrats were selecting 5288 delegates for their june state 
convention where the 64 atlarge delegates to the national 
convention actually will be chosen 
delegates to the state convention were picked from 63380 people 
selected at precinct conventions held when the polls closed on 
super tuesday saturdays conventions were held in each county and 
in state senatorial districts in counties that have more than one 
state senator the proportion for awarding of the 64 delegates was 
set at the more than 6000 precinct conventions on march 8

columbia to assist them in improving their crime reporting systems 
the bureau said sunday 
the federal aid ranging from 18000 for delaware to 373000 
for virginia will enable the states and district to upgrade their 
crime information systems and make the information they submit to 
the fbi more accurate the bureau said 
under the new system state and local law enforcement agencies 
will forward individual records to the fbi monthly for selected 
crimes and arrests rather than submitting monthly summary 
statistics as they currently do 
the bureau which is part of the justice department said the 
new system will enable police departments to describe the crimes in 
their area more accurately and could help them reduce the number of 
offenses 
the new information that will be forwarded to the fbi will 
include the time and location of the crime the victimoffender 
relationship the presence or absence of a weapon and the number 
and types of offenses that occurred during each criminal incident

crossreference arrests to the crimes that have been committed and 
distinguish between completed and attempted crimes the definition 
of rape also will be broadened to include all forcible sexual 
offenses 
alabama arkansas california delaware iowa kentucky maine 
massachusetts minnesota montana new york north dakota

production faltered in latin america last year 
after three years of growth the interamerican development bank 
reported sunday 
in the years 1984 to 1986 the official value of all production 
in latin america grew by an average of 38 percent a year the bank 
said in its annual report in 1987 the growth was only 2 percent 
since population also grew at about that rate the average income 
remained stagnant for the area as a whole 
there was a wide range within the average 
brazil is the biggest and most populous country and accounts for 
about a third of the areas total production in 1986 its growth 
was more than 8 percent and so was perus two of brazils 
neighbors guyana and trinidad and tobago saw declines in their 
production of more than 6 percent that year 
the report does not furnish figures for individual countries in 
1987 but says that none of the big four argentina brazil 
mexico and venezuela had a growth rate of more than 4 percent 
however about onethird of the 25 countries did achieve a 
growth rate of more than 4 percent with the dominican republic and 
peru recording the largest increase the bank said the others in 
that group were chile colombia honduras jamaica paraguay and 
uruguay 
meanwhile incomes of people in about half the countries dropped 
again in 1987 the bank said but did not provide any figure for 
that year it put average income in 1986 at 2145 the world bank 
estimated the us average at 16400 in 1985 
lack of jobs and social security protection for the unemployed 
led to a big increase in latin america of what the report calls the 
informal sector which refers to a huge portion of the economy 
never reported in the official statistics ranging from 
bootblacking to heroin production 
for example the international monetary fund reported colombias 
exports at 287 billion in 1986 according to estimates quoted by 
the manchester guardian weekly colombias medellin drug cartel 
grosses at least 7 billion a year 
the report says that in 1986 only 10 out of 25 countries 
increased their production faster than the labor force and that 
preliminary figures showed a similar picture for 1987 
this is a disquieting development it adds 
it explains that investment in new factories and equipment 
that is the capacity to produce more goods must grow faster than 
the number of working people if more jobs are to be created 
otherwise the prospect is poor for reducing unemployment 
with few exceptions the high levels of unemployment and 
underemployment which have prevailed in the 1980s show no signs 
of diminishing it says 
it notes that over the past 20 or 30 years there has been 
a massive shift of people to cities out of farming and into 
industry and services 
an explosive growth in the number of women working outside 
their homes 
a significant improvement in the level of education 
a slowdown in the overall growth of the labor force because of 
a declining birth rate 
money flowed out of latin america for the fifth year in a row 
reversing the historic trend new investment usually brings a net 
inflow of cash to poor countries from richer ones much of the 
outflow was in the form of interest payments and repayments on 
latin americas debt of more than 400 billion 
the bank itself owned by 44 govermnments disbursed 1919 
billion in new loans to raise living standards in 1987 and got 
back 2116 billion in repayments and interest it authorized 
2361 billion in additional loans down from 3037 billion in 
1986 
efforts to increase its lending were stalled by refusal of 
borrowing governments to accept a change in the voting system on 
new loans now borrowers control the lending the united states 
proposed shifting percentages needed to approve a loan so that it 
would have a veto over new loans whenever it could get canada to go 
along with it

chrysler corp officials who met with 
business leaders to discuss the citys future after the automaker 
closes its plant here say theyre being careful not to build false 
expectations 
chrysler vice president robert perkins said saturday that 
company chairman lee a iacocca cautioned him against making any 
promises about continued employment after the september shutdown 
iacocca was censured earlier this year by state and union 
officials who accused chrysler of breaking a 1987 pledge to 
continue kenosha production for at least three years chrysler 
denies making any written commitment 
perkins led a delegation of 15 chrysler executives who met with 
state city and county officials to discuss the companys plans to 
halt auto production in september putting about 5500 people out 
of work 
perkins said iacocca told the company delegation before the 
meeting dont repeat the mistake that chrysler management made 
building up an expectation that we cant deliver 
but the company is making a sincere effort to see if 
business can be sustained at the factory perkins said 
perkins also cautioned that government contracts sent to kenosha 
might not arrive soon enough to avoid the fall layoffs it would 
take time to gear the factory to a new product line he explained 
in the defense business there are long lead times in the 
auto business there are long lead times perkins said 
while pay for workers on the auto assembly line averages 27 an 
hour including benefits the department of defense contracts held 
by chrysler pay 15 an hour or less said rep les aspin who 
arranged saturdays meeting 
aspin chairman of the house armed services committee was asked 
if he would use his influence in washington to get military work 
for kenosha 
everyone who is in wisconsin doing defense work gets tender 
loving care from this congressman he said 
after saturdays meeting an aspin aide said the congressman 
wanted another meeting with chrysler scheduled in the next month 
perkins said however that no meeting had been scheduled yet 
although followups with individual companies would take place

chancellor helmut kohls 
christian democratic union won a major election test sunday 
retaining power in badenwuerttemberg state but with a smaller 
margin 
west germanys three other major parties also suffered 
percentage losses in the state balloting two small rightwing 
parties scored surprising gains apparently getting votes from 
dissatisfied farmers 
three hours after the polls closed at 6 pm computer 
projections by the national television networks gave the christian 
democrats about 49 percent of the vote 
they dropped under the 50percent mark for the first time in 16 
years but the party will maintain its absolute control of the 
state legislature 
its main opposition the social democrats had 32 percent down 
from 324 percent in 1984 
the environmentalist greens received 79 percent just under the 
8 percent four years ago while the free democrats who had hoped to 
force the cdu into a coalition suffered a blow getting 6 percent 
compared to 72 percent in 1984 
two farright parties acted as spoilers but neither won enough 
votes to gain any seats in the legislature the national democratic 
party of germany had about 2 percent and the republicans 1 percent 
several smaller parties shared the remaining vote 
according to badenwuerttembergs complicated election laws the 
number of seats in the state parliament can vary and the new 
legislature was expected to have 125 seats one less than the 
previous one 
led by lothar spaeth the governor for 10 years the christian 
democrats were expected to win at least 66 seats compared to 68 in 
the previous legislature 
social democrats had 42 a gain of one and the greens also 
gained one for a total of 10 
the free democrats lost a seat and will have seven 
spaeth 50 campaigned on badenwuerttembergs strong economic 
performance and kohl said the results were a great personal 
victory for the governor 
at 5 percent the state has the lowest unemployment rate in the 
country about four points under the national average 
spaeth has transformed the southwestern state from a 
predominantly rural area into a major base for the growing 
electronics and hightechnology industries 
the result was a welcome relief for kohls party which had been 
slipping since the national election in january 1987 
the christian democrats lost their majority in kohls home state 
of rhinelandpalatinate last may and were forced into a coalition 
with the free democrats the christian democrats and free democrats 
also are governing coalition partners in the federal government and 
in six of west germanys 11 states 
kohl speaking on national television said the two small 
rightwing parties apparently picked up votes from farmers who are 
unhappy with spaeths policies and want more aid 
i dont see a radical trend he said

a prosecutor says police officers 
misinterpreted an order to go on in when they broke down the 
front door of a house drawing gunfire from an 84yearold occupant 
who was then shot and killed by an officer 
police converged on the home of dillard free last christmas eve 
after getting a tip that a rape suspect was hiding there 
a grand jury on march 10 declined to indict the officer who shot 
free a georgia bureau of investigation report on the incident 
remains sealed because of indictments against two people who 
directed police to the house and are accused of making false 
statements 
but in an interview published sunday in the times of 
gainesville district attorney andy fuller said he had decided to 
discuss the gbis findings because the people of hall county need 
to know this information 
fuller said the gbi found that six law officers who planned the 
approach on the free home remembered that detective robert gable 
directed them to use the normal procedure for serving an arrest 
warrant that is knock and announce warrant 
but officers lee west gary lenderman and kirk williamson who 
took up positions in front of the house were not in the group 
given that instruction fuller said 
fuller gave this account of the subsequent walkietalkie 
conversation detective russell elrod told the officers go on 
in lendermen seemed surprised and asked you want us to go 
elrod answered 104 police parlance for yes 
elrod meant for the officers to knock on the door but the 
officers thought they were being told to enter the house fuller 
said 
west then knocked down the front door and he and williamson 
entered the darkened living room while sgt benny patrick rushed 
onto the front porch the district attorney said 
fuller said patrick saw a silhouette moving inside and shouted 
police but a shot was fired that narrowly missed his head he 
said west inside the living room also shouted police and the 
figure fired again this time striking a door frame 
west then fired two shots fatally wounding free 
frees wife agnes 73 was hospitalized suffering from shock 
she died march 5 three days after suffering a heart attack 
the grand jury expressed outrage about the shooting despite its 
decision not to indict west and called for a review of police 
procedures 
the free family has hired a lawyer who said a lawsuit is likely 
the rape suspect the officers were seeking was arrested on 
christmas day in texas

after three weeks tending to the dead and dying 
in india former california gov jerry brown says he has returned 
home with his mind on politics 
after all brown writes in the april issue of life magazine 
thats what i spent a good part of my life doing and while he 
never explicitly says so he hints that hell be returning to 
politics 
after a sixyear odyssey that took him to several continents and 
included an extended stay at a zen buddhist retreat in japan the 
48yearold brown volunteered for duty earlier this year at mother 
teresas clinic for the terminally ill in calcutta 
he said his routine included bathing and handfeeding men 
suffering from tuberculosis and malnutrition changing and washing 
blankets and receptacles for phlegm and holding the hands of the 
dying 
to work with the dying and destitute getting a person a 
glass of water helping with a bedpan is to encounter life at a 
very basic level he wrote people can be surprisingly happy 
and grateful when you help them with even the smallest things 
in calcutta i never escaped human suffering he added the 
most distressing thought of all was that much of this would be 
preventable or curable if nations could be mobilized to combat 
human suffering rather than to engage in national rivalries 
brown who sought the democratic presidential nomination in 1976 
and 1980 said he returned to the united states on the day of the 
iowa caucuses and watched the coverage on television 
as i watched i wondered how could i ever take the spirit of 
mother teresa and apply it to the ordinary world of business and 
politics 
noting the emphasis this year on the personal character and 
private lives of politicians he said people are not just 
looking for a program or a list of ideas they want virtue they 
want a leader they can trust

a federal study has found no 
suggestion that drinking alcohol increases a womans chance of 
breast cancer a result that clashes with recent research 
conclusive statements or general recommendations concering the 
relationship between alcohol consumption and breast cancer seem 
premature said susan chu of the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
perhaps some alcoholrelated factors rather than alcohol 
itself account for the effect shown by other test subjects she 
said we have difficulty explaining why our study differs from 
those other studies she said 
nobody has shown any biological reason why alcohol would raise a 
womans breast cancer risk she said 
at a meeting of science writers sponsored by the american cancer 
society chu described results of a study of 3252 women between 
the ages of 20 and 54 with newly diagnosed breast cancer and 2971 
other women chosen for comparison 
all the women were interviewed in their homes and asked about 
their alcoholdrinking habits in the previous five years if they 
drank they were asked to estimate how many days a week they drank 
and how much they consumed on each day 
when data from the two groups were compared chu said we 
found no relationship between drinking in the past five years and 
breast cancer risk 
two studies released in may that did find an increase in risk 
gained a lot of attention she said 
the studies directed by scientists at the harvard school of 
public health and the national cancer institute cited an apparent 
increase in risk with as few as three drinks a week 
but the principal authors of both studies said the data were not 
strong enough to recommend changes in drinking habits for american 
women 
the cancer society has no formal recommendation on alcohol and 
breast cancer 
lawrence garfinkel the societys vice president for 
epidemiology said sunday that several studies had shown no added 
breast cancer risk from moderate drinking 
the jurys still out he said if there is a risk he said 
it has to be very very minimal 
future studies should focus on the age that alcohol consumption 
began and how long it has lasted chu said 
in another paper presented at the science writers conference a 
researcher cited research data challenging the link others have 
found between dietary fat and cancer 
calories are the dietary villain rather than fat said david 
klurfeld of the wistar institute in philadelphia who studied rats 
that were chemically treated to encourage tumor growth 
the contention has been debated for some time among scientists 
whose findings have been mixed 
klurfeld said his studies showed the direct link to cancer risk 
appeared to be body mass because the rats that exercised enough to 
work off calories had a lower cancer risk than animals that were 
sedentary 
the cancer society says dietary fat may play a role in breast 
colon and prostate cancers it also says obese people run a higher 
risk of colon breast and uterine cancers klurfeld said he agreed 
with the second statement but not the first 
he said his research was funded by the national institutes of 
health the american institute for cancer research and several food 
companies that he did not name the source of the funding did not 
affect results he said 
the cancer societys garfinkel said the fatvscalories issue 
is an open question 
i dont know how soon we can get it resolved because of the 
difficulty of studying it in human populations he said

two british soldiers killed in 
a brutal attack by an angry mob had ignored orders to stay away 
from an irish republican army funeral procession the british army 
said sunday 
officials reported police fired plastic bullets sunday at youths 
who hijacked a bus in roman catholic west belfast the shots were 
fired when the youths tried to attack a riot squad police said 
no injuries were reported 
all soldiers in the british province had been told to stay away 
from saturdays funeral an army spokesman said he said an army 
investigation is under way 
the two corporals should not have been where they were and we 
are interested in examining how that came about said the 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity 
they would have been briefed about the route of the funeral 
procession and the two corporals were not expected to be there and 
had no requirement to be there 
corporals derek wood 24 and david howes 23 who were wearing 
civilian clothes were shot to death in belfast after people in the 
funeral procession dragged from their unmarked car beat them 
unconscious and stripped them naked 
the outlawed ira claimed responsibility for the deaths and the 
royal ulster constabulary northern irelands police force said it 
was questioning three people police said they were studying 
videotapes of the attack 
sinn fein the iras legal political wing blamed the british 
government for the violence and praised those who beat the soldiers 
for their bravery in protecting the cortege from attack 
there was a bomb scare sunday morning at a catholic church near 
the site where the soldiers were slain 
although it was a hoax the minister of st agnes church the 
rev thomas toner said at mass that the foul and bloody murders 
committed in our parish had put his congregation in the 
direct firing line of vengeanceseeking protestants 
the thought of these two soldiers being savagely beaten and 
then shot in cold blood will give rise to feelings of revulsion in 
every irish man or woman who has a spark of human feeling said 
cardinal tomas o fiaich head of the catholic church in ireland 
both soldiers belonged to the royal corps of signals a regiment 
often engaged in secret monitoring of communications wood joined 
the army in april 1980 and howes in august 1981 
the army spokesman said the two had been traveling in civilian 
clothes between the belfast battalions headquarters and near falls 
road and the british armys northern ireland headquarters 
there are a number of possible routes available to them but 
it is a matter of speculation how they came to be in a place they 
were not supposed to be in he said 
their restraint under the most hideous provocation was obvious 
to the entire nation the statement said

three ira guerrillas shot by british commandos in gibraltar on

children found playing with the lid to a 
radioactive device missing from the trunk of a stolen car were not 
exposed to radioactive elements in the gadget officials said 
sunday 
however because the lid had been removed from the device 
officials said there was a greater possibility for release of 
radioactivity 
as of sunday authorities were stymied in their search for the 
device which measures the density of moisture in soil and contains 
the radioactive elements cesium 137 and americium 241 said larry 
krieger a spokesman for the newark fire department 
both substances are considered extremely dangerous 
a much larger amount of cesium 137 killed four people and 
injured 121 in goiania brazil last year when a lead canister from 
a medical device was broken open at a junkyard and the glowing 
powder wase passed around 
but the amount of cesium in the missing device was only a 
fraction of the 17 grams of the substance involved in the brazil 
disaster officials said 
the device contains only 01 milligram of cesium and about 15 
milligrams of americium said karl abraham a spokesman for the 
philadelphia office of the federal nuclear regulatory commission a 
milligram is one onethousandth of a gram so the amount of cesium 
involved in brazil was 170000 times as much as is contained in the 
missing new jersey device 
the gauges lid was recovered saturday after police received an 
anonymous tip that the device was in a vacant lot where stolen cars 
are routinely abandoned krieger said 
authorities didnt find the device there but they did find 
about four or five youngsters playing with the lid he said 
the children gave conflicting stories about how they got the 
lid krieger said they tested negative for exposure to 
radioactivity he said 
the gauge can be carried safely but the nrc warned that any 
attempt to extract the gauge from the case could result in serious 
radiation exposure to anyone tampering with it 
on thursday authorities arrested four youths on charges of 
possessing the auto stolen march 10 while its owner a soil 
engineer attended classes at the new jersey institute of 
technology 
the bright yellow plastic box containing the device and labeled 
radioactive was missing from the trunk of the car when essex 
county police recovered the vehicle tuesday in the christopher 
columbus housing project

three hundred and sixty eggs did a delicate 
balancing act early sunday morning in a symbolic ritual attended by 
about 200 celebrators welcoming spring 
considering the hour more people showed up than i expected 
said donna henes the performance artist who helped organize the 
event 
the egg balancing took place on a long tablelike platform set 
up at the south street seaport in lower manhattan at 439 am the 
precise moment of the vernal equinox one of two points in the year 
when the sun crosses the equator and day and night are equal 
according to henes balancing an egg on its end is an ancient 
chinese custom that brings good luck to the successful balancer 
scientists are dubious whether eggs really do balance during the 
equinox because of changes in the gravitational pull but henes is 
convinced 
its funny because ive asked a lot of scientists about it and 
they say its impossible henes said however when i ask them 
to join in the ritual and they see it happen they become instant 
believers 
henes who has been observing the eggbalancing ritual for the 
past 13 years said eggs are ancient symbols of fertility and 
spring around the world easter is only one of many spring 
holidays where the egg is used as a symbol of rebirth she said 
participants began arriving at about 345 am and after 
balancing their eggs they enjoyed them at a breakfast prepared by a 
chef from one of the seaport tourist attractions restaurants 
according to betsy jordan hand a spokeswoman for the seaport

american jews must take a more active role 
in israeli affairs if they hope to affect the countrys policies in 
the occupied territories a former aide to president jimmy carter 
told the american jewish congress on sunday 
the congress which will consider resolutions calling for israel 
to withdraw from the riottorn west bank and gaza strip opened its 
biennial convention sunday with a keynote address by stuart e 
eizenstat former adviser to carter for domestic policy 
if we are only sideline kibitzers who throw darts at israeli 
policy from long range and then retreat to our comfortable everyday 
pursuits we will not deserve to participate in the political 
discussions in israel eizenstat said 
eizenstat told about 200 conventioneers that american jews must 
end the passive checkwriting mentality and become much more 
involved in the political religious and economic spheres of 
israeli life 
it is also our future they are debating he said 
he urged his fellow american jews to make investments in israel 
and to spend time in israel to understand the countrys 
perspective however he said they should keep their comments 
balanced to avoid the volatile domestic political cauldron 
the american jewish community should be full participants in 
the broad debate about the direction israel takes on political 
questions such as the future of the territories but it should 
carry on this debate to the extent possible in israel rather than 
the united states he said 
the discussions that do occur in the united states should take 
place in private he said 
public criticism will be used by israels enemies to drive a 
wedge between american jewry and israel he said 
the convention which will attract 400 to 500 delegates also 
will consider the peace plan proposed by secretary of state george 
p shultz in the face of arab rioting in the territories 
shultzs plan envisions that talks on selfrule would begin may 
1 between jordan israel palestinians and any other arabs wishing 
to take part under the auspices of the united states the soviet 
union china england and france the plan also calls for talks to 
start dec 1 about the future of the west bank and gaza strip that 
israel captured from the arabs in the 1967 mideast war 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who concluded talks with 
president reagan last week has said he was outraged by the united 
states suggestions of a withdrawal from the occupied territories 
shamir has rejected another us proposal for a fullscale 
mideast conference saying such a meeting would give the soviet 
union and its arab allies too much influence and might force israel 
to withdraw from the territories

sen bob dole kicking off a wisconsin campaign 
swing sunday flipped two coins into a wishing well thinking 
perhaps of a badly needed win in wisconsins april 5 primary 
as he strolled around a sports exposition at the citys 
convention center dole was asked by reporters about a milwaukee 
journal poll suggesting vice president george bush led him by a 
margin of nearly 31 among wisconsin voters considered likely to 
vote in the republican primary 
there are no secrets he said 
ive got a lot of hill to climb before april 5 he said 
later in an interview 
i met a lot of friendly people out there its tough when 
youre losing its a lot more fun when youre winning he said 
but i still have a lot of supporters out there and we want 
them to know bob dole is a fighter that were going to stay in 
this race 
the kansas senator said however that he would have to reassess 
his standing if he lost in wisconsin 
we shouldnt be into this game about are you going to run or 
are you going to drop out he said 
but he added that after wisconsin he would have to do some 
thinking about whether to stay in the race 
weve been hearing the end is near but people forget george 
bush stayed in eight weeks after he began losing to ronald 
reagan dole said eight weeks was enough for him to lose but 
i think eight weeks would be enough time for me to turn some things 
around 
at the sports exposition he was presented with a fishing rod 
and fisermens vest and viewed a tank that served as an artifical 
fishing pond containing trout a demonstrator cast a few lines but 
came up empty 
dole was also visiting a veterans administration hospital on 
sunday on monday he was attending a farm day in northwestern 
wisconsin visiting a vocational school in eau claire and touring a 
brewery in la crosse 
doles state campaign chairman michael grebe said he expected 
the senators visit to be the kickoff to a strong effort in 
wisconsin 
we expect to have a direct mail effort radio and television 
advertising and continuing volunteer effort and volunteer phone 
banks grebe said 
dole was trounced by bush on super tuesday and lost again last 
week in illinois he has indicated he intends to remain in the race 
at least through the wisconsin primary 
the milwaukee journal poll of 732 wisconsin residents showed 69 
percent of those planning to vote republican preferred bush 25 
percent chose dole and 6 percent chose pat robertson

a government commission announced it will 
begin an investigation monday into the death of a university 
student that sparked riots in the burmese capital 
guards protected government buildings in rangoon over the 
weekend following protests friday in which demonstrators wrecked 
cars set fire to a department store and chanted antigovernment 
slogans 
some rangoon residents said there were casualties and mass 
arrests by security forces but the governmentcontrolled news 
media was virtually silent on the disturbances 
open protests have been rare in burma since president ne win 
seized power in 1962 and instituted oneparty rule 
but over the past two years small demonstrations and outbursts 
of violence have occurred in reaction to worsening economic 
conditions 
last september hundreds of students in rangoon rioted to 
protest a government decision to invalidate three denominations of 
banknotes 
fridays demonstrations began in support of students at the 
rangoon institute of technology who had rioted march 12 
one student maung phone maw 23 was shot march 12 and the 
government panel was set up to investigate his death 
the rioting began after students clashed with local residents 
over whether to play a cassette tape in a tea shop and police then

the justice department is planning to file 
suit in federal court in new york to force the closing of the plo 
observer mission at the united nations a department spokesman said 
sunday 
were ready to go ahead and file the papers if they dont 
close the mission voluntarily said spokesman patrick korten 
the palestine liberation organization served notice last week 
that it planned to defy any us effort to shut the mission which 
is in a new york city townhouse 
sunday afternoon korten indicated that the department would 
file suit monday but sunday evening he said that such action might 
not occur until tuesday or wednesday due to possible delays in 
paperwork 
the chances are it would be within a day or two if they are 
not out korten said we are hoping those who walk into the 
office monday to look for them would find them gone if thats 
not the case then we would proceed with legal action 
the justice department announced march 11 that it planned to 
enforce the antiterrorism act of 1987 by going to court to close 
the mission that act takes effect monday 
korten said the department planned to seek a court order 
directing the plo to vacate its offices in new york and said he 
expected the court order to be immediately enforceable 
last year the state department closed down the only other plo 
office in the united states an information office in washington 
in what was a futile attempt to head off legislation ordering the 
un mission closed 
the united states and israel consider the plo a terrorist 
organization but the united nations recognizes it as the only 
legitimate representative for the palestinians

president jose azcona said sunday 
the 3200 us soldiers on an emergency mission in honduras 
probably wont be needed much longer because nicaraguan troops are 
retreating from honduran territory 
things are getting back to normal azcona said in an 
interview sunday a day after two honduran warplanes fired rockets 
at sandinista positions in a section of the disputed bocay region 
that honduras considers its territory 
if there are no more incidents the americans will leave 
azcona said 
he declined to give details on the sandinista pullback or be 
more specific on when the us troops that arrived last week would 
depart 
rep gv montgomery dmiss a member of a congressional 
delegation visiting honduras said he expects the us military 
personnel to pull out in about a week 
i think itll all be over by then said montgomery a member 
of the house armed services committee 
american soldiers practiced military maneuvers sunday at a 
honduran airstrip about 20 miles from the nicaraguan border 
these guys are not going to get involved in any sort of 
conflict said maj gary hovatter spokesman for us troops in 
the central american nation 
nicaragua formally protested the honduran air raid saturday as 
an unwarranted act of aggression it has denied that its troops 
crossed the junglechoked border between the nations 
the us house delegation observed a military exercise involving 
us infantrymen and honduran soldiers at jamastran a dirt 
airstrip about 55 miles southeast of tegucigalpa and 20 miles from 
the border 
the exercise was held about 80 miles south of the bocay border 
region 
honduran officials said saturdays air strike was carried out 
because about 600 sandinista soldiers were moving too slowly from 
the bocay area two honduran jet fighters carried out a similar 
raid thursday 
no one was hurt in either raid and no damage was reported in 
saturdays attack 
nicaraguan foreign minister miguel descoto sent a protest note 
to honduran foreign minister carlos lopez saying his government 
energetically and formally protests saturdays attack which it 
called aggression against nicaraguan territory 
honduras said the attack took place eight miles inside honduras 
nicaragua claims it was five miles inside nicaragua 
the nicaraguan ministry also said two f5 warplanes flew over 
sandinista positions saturday morning in the frontier sectors of 
mukuwas san andres de bocay waniwas and wayawas but did not 
attack 
the 600 sandinistas were part of a force estimated at 2000 that 
was believed to have entered honduran territory last week in 
pursuit of usbacked rebels known as contras 
the action prompted president reagan to send in us troops to 
noncombat areas for military exercises in a show of force to the 
leftist government 
in washington national security adviser lt gen colin powell 
said the fighting between nicaragua and honduras was essentially 
over 
powell who appeared on abctvs this week with david 
brinkley said the us military exercises should be completed 
shortly and the troops will return to the united states 
he said the sandinistas have withdrawn theyre apparently on 
their side of the border again they appear to be in a process of 
withdrawing or have withdrawn 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua has denied that the 
sandinistas were in honduran territory 
on sunday deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said 
reports that sandinista troops remained inside honduras territory 
was a ruse by the reagan administration to obtain more money for 
the contras 
tinoco also said mondays firstever direct talks with contra 
rebels inside nicaragua will focus on the mechanics of a 
ceasefire the contras want the talks to include political issues 
in new york the eightnation contadora and its support group 
issued a statement condemning the sending of additional american 
troops to honduras 
they also urged both the honduran and nicaraguan governments 
to reduce immediately tension in their border region and respect 
each others territorial integrity 
contadora is made up of mexico colombia venezuela and panama 
and is backed by a support group formed by argentina brazil 
uruguay and peru 
the group has been trying to negotiate an end to the contra war 
in nicaragua and leftist guerrilla wars in el salvador and 
guatemala for the past six years 
although it did not mention the united states by name the 
contadora statement expressed deep worry over the escalation of a 
forign military presence in honduras

crews on sunday removed two 
cylinders of explosive gas left in the rubble of a chemical plant 
where a blast killed three workers and forced 1500 people from 
their homes 
a gasfilled cylinder sent to the gollob analytical services 
plant for analysis exploded thursday fears of new explosions 
because another container of chemicals was still afire in the 
rubble of the plant prompted the evacuation friday 
most of the 1500 evacuees were allowed to return home saturday 
after seven cylinders near the flaming container were removed from 
the plant sunday the remaining 120 evacuees nursing home 
residents who lived closer to the plant than the other evacuees 
were allowed to return home and nearby businesses got the goahead 
to reopen 
meanwhile in pocatello idaho a container of what was believed 
to be the same gas that caused the original explosion in new jersey 
was vented at a semiconductor plant early sunday ninetyone 
residents of a nearby nursing home who had been evacuated saturday 
as a precaution were allowed to return home 
before the new jersey explosion workers at gollob became 
worried when tests showed the gas in the tank they were testing was 
not silane which they had expected to be inside but silane mixed 
with nitrous oxide a potent combination 
chicagobased liquid carbonic industries corp which apparently 
manufactured the gas was called to pick it up officials said 
new jersey environmental commissioner richard dewling has said 
the tank either was mislabeled or contaminated 
silane a toxic and highly flammable gas is used by the 
semiconductor industry 
investigators said the plant burst into flames thursday after 
the cylinder exploded outside the facility and became a projectile 
shooting into the building 
two cylinders containing the gas phosphine were removed sunday 
night said james staples spokesman for the state department of 
environmental protection the toxic flammable gas also is used in 
electronics manufacturing 
in pocatello idaho workers at the gould semiconductor plant 
safely vented a tank there to prevent a possible explosion said 
jerry corbett a spokesman for goulds offices in chicago 
the cylinder was purchased from liquid carbonic corbett said 
pocatello police lt steve stuart said he was told by company 
officials there that a cylinder from the gould plant had been 
shipped to new jersey after it failed to react properly in a 
manufacturing process at the pocatello plant but corbett would not 
confirm whether a tank from the idaho plant could have caused the 
new jersey explosion

the great us airline giveaway seems to be 
grinding to a halt 
worried about the potential financial impact of burgeoning 
frequentflier programs and triplemileage travel awards many 
major air carriers have imposed restrictions on the plans or are 
thinking of doing so 
the frequentflier plans which reward passengers with free 
tickets or upgrades to first class after they have flown a set 
number of miles were launched in 1981 to stimulate brand 
loyalty to airlines in a fiercely competitive climate 
the giveaway escalated to fever pitch at the beginning of this 
year when delta air lines introduced a new program to 
automatically triple the mileage accumulated by frequent fliers 
most big airlines quickly followed suit 
but the us airline industry is facing a staggering revenue 
loss if the estimated 8 million people enrolled in those programs 
start redeeming their bonuses and bumping paying passengers the 
accumulated value of those bonuses is around 124 billion reckons 
julius maldutis senior airline analyst for the investment firm 
salomon brothers inc 
that compares with total industry revenue of around 467 
billion in 1985 505 billion in 1986 and just over 60 billion 
last year 
the frequentflier programs have really gotten out of 
control said dan sheehy a spokesman for united airlines 
were concerned with the direction that the programs are taking 
john zeeman uniteds executive vice president for marketing and 
planning said in a speech early this month that the airline is 
considering imposing restrictions on its frequentflier programs 
he said the options under review include requiring that travel 
awards be redeemed by a certain deadline and even eliminating free 
trips and providing only firstclass upgrades instead 
if united decides to limit its program the changes would be 
announced in early may zeeman said 
many other airlines have recently slapped restrictions on their 
programs most notably by limiting the number of free tickets for 
any one flight but the limits being mulled by united a subsidiary 
of allegis corp and the nations largest airline are more 
farreaching and could be matched by the other carriers 
the last thing these airlines need is more damage on their 
balance sheets said peter tanous an editor of frequent a 
monthly newsletter on frequentflier programs published in colorado 
springs colo the airlines are scared stiff that they may be 
forced to take a hit against their earnings 
observers warn that the internal revenue service could decide to 
tax the programs sparking a mad rush by passengers to redeem 
their travel bonuses the irs indicated recently that it considers 
travel awards a form of reportable income when transportation costs 
for a frequent business flier are paid by an employer 
and the financial accounting standards board is expected to 
require airlines to provide for the liability of unredeemed awards 
in their 1988 financial statements 
the looming crisis has taken hold during an already turbulent 
period for the nations airline industry the business is coming 
off one of its worst safety performances in 1987 struggling with 
unions and threatened strikes against some big carriers and 
worrying about the possibility of a recession later in the year 
for now though many airlines are enjoying robust passenger 
traffic and earnings prompting them to raise fares recently and 
to eliminate some discount fares 
analysts say nearly all the major airlines except delta have 
started to limit their frequentflier largesse by instituting 
capacity control or reducing the number of freebies on a 
flight 
everyone else is doing it you have to control and manage your 
inventory said bob gibbons a spokesman for northwest airlines 
which will start capacity control on april 1 for bonuses issued 
after feb 15 
even holdout delta has blackout dates or certain peak 
travel periods when free tickets cannot be used delta the third 
largest airline also has the unique requirement that frequent 
fliers must charge their tickets on an american express card 
we want to remain competitive with the industry delta 
spokesman jim lundy said when asked what might happen if united 
instituted major restrictions 
some airlines also are looking at other approaches such as 
replacing free travel with merchandise awards or hotel and car 
rental premiums 
while they could significantly restrict their frequentflier 
programs the airlines are not about to eliminate them or 
triplemileage awards altogether observers say when the 
triplemileage plans were launched at the start of the year the 
carriers assured passengers that the popular gimmicks would be 
retained through 1988 
we recognize that there certainly is an economic impact 
associated with the triplemileage program said frank dinuzzo 
managing director of sales promotion for american airlines but he 
added american has no intention of canceling its program 
indeed some observers suggest the airlines may be caught in a 
sort of catch22 by their frequentflier programs forced to 
keep them because there is no way to end them 
i suspect that if the airlines had their druthers they would 
throw frequentflier programs into a bonfire because theyve just 
become so expensive said michael j friedman a vice president 
of shampe inc an aviation consulting firm 
however he noted it would be extremely difficult for a carrier 
to end its frequentflier program without all its competitors doing 
the same

us businesses might have to pay billions of 
dollars in additional state taxes if the us supreme court upholds 
louisianas taxation of a new orleans store for catalogs that it 
produced and mailed from other states attorneys say 
the case involves a disputed 4393703 tax assessment against 
the dh holmes co department store chain but lawyers for both 
sides agree the monetary ramifications go far beyond that 
i threw out the figure of 800 million at a meeting of the tax 
executive institute in new york people said that was a half or 
a quarter of the taxes it would raise william f grace jr an 
attorney for holmes said in a recent interview 
the case to be heard tuesday by the supreme court could be the 
most significant interstate commerce decision since the ll bean 
sales tax case in 1973 say grace and william pugh a private 
attorney representing the state of louisiana 
in the bean case the court ruled that mailorder companies 
dont have to collect sales taxes from customers in states where 
they have no employees or property 
use taxes such as louisianas are imposed on property brought in 
from another state for use consumption distribution or storage 
louisianas use tax as in most states equals the state sales tax 
minus any sales taxes charged to the purchaser 
the catalogs in question were designed in new york printed in 
three other states and mailed from those states to customers with 
holmes charge accounts 
we contend that holmes did not use these catalogs in 
louisiana there was no use by holmes because when the taxes were 
imposed the catalogs were being transmitted in the us mails 
grace said at that time they were not subject to tax they can 
only be taxed when they came into use in the state of louisiana 
if the high court upholds state court rulings against holmes 
grace said states could tax such things as flyers sent with credit 
card bills catalogs from national chains with stores in their 
states and telephone directories 
all of the states are starved for revenues theyre going to 
look wherever they can it could turn into big bucks said lee 
williams of the washingtonbased american retail federation which 
filed one of seven friendofthecourt briefs in the case 
we think it would be a tremendous burden on business and could 
be crippling to retailers who send tons of their advertising 
and catalog materials across state lines said williams the ara 
legislative counsel 
pugh said the case hinges on ownership 
i would contend and did contend and shall contend that holmes 
owned the catalogs when they were designed holmes owned the 
catalogs when they were printed holmes owned the catalogs when 
they were mailed and holmes owned the catalogs when they arrived 
at the post office boxes he said 
that kind of wording could mean big trouble for catalog 
companies said bob levering legislative counsel for the direct 
marketing association in washington dc 
if the supreme court agrees that a company possesses and is 
using something while it is being sent through the mail levering 
said it could bring taxes on all kinds of mailings 
they states could say your property is in our state 
therefore were providing police and fire protection for your 
property he said 
courts in tennessee illinois new york ohio south dakota 
wisconsin and the district of columbia have ruled the opposite of 
the louisiana courts in such matters said andrew rinker jr 
another lawyer for holmes 
since the louisiana decision missouri has gone against us 
based on the louisiana holding he said 
big guns have lined up on both sides of the argument 
one of two legal briefs supporting louisiana was filed on behalf 
of the national governors association national association of 
counties council of state governments international city 
management association national conference of state legislatures 
national league of cities and us conference of mayors the other 
was from the multistate tax commission 
in addition to the retail federation the direct marketing 
association the national association of catalog showroom 
merchandisers and the committee of state taxation of the council of 
state chambers of commerce have filed individual 
friendofthecourt briefs magazine publishers of america inc

trade ministers from 27 countries 
ended three days of informal talks sunday without an agreement on 
agriculture policy but issues a pledge to strengthen the 95nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
the deadlock on agriculture is seen as a crucial issue in 
current world trade talks which are scheduled to last four years 
there was no movement of positions at all australian trade 
minister michael duffy said after the meeting which included trade 
ministers from the united states japan and the european economic 
community 
the united states insists that all agricultural subsidies be 
abolished worldwide by the year 2000 the eec maintains it will 
join in substantial cuts in agricultural subsidies but rejects the 
longterm us proposal 
the third big party to the agriculture policy debate is the 
13country cairns group the nonaligned freetradeoriented group 
of agricultural exporters the cairns group is calling for 
shortterm measures to freeze subsidies and for longterm reform in 
farm policy 
duffy said he outlined the cairns group proposal to the 
ministers attending the meeting but said he got little response 
from the eec or the united states 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said the cairns group 
proposal focused too much on shortterm reforms 
thats not good enough for us yeutter said adding that the 
united states soon would release an official reaction to the plan 
willy de clercq the eec commissioner for external affairs said 
the cairns group proposal might present an opening for further 
negotiations there should be a way to find common ground he 
told reporters 
although on the substantive level no progress was made 
eveybody seems willing to continue working to resolve the issue 
de clercq said 
failure to reach some agreement on agriculture policy by 
december when trade ministers will assess progress at the halfway 
mark in the current round of trade talks would be disastrous 
duffy said 
west german economics minister martin bangemann described the 
mood among the ministers as excellent and said ministers had agreed 
that a number of issues would be ready for early harvest by the 
midterm review in montreal in december 
the ministers decided to meet for more informal talks early in 
october in pakistan bangemann said 
they agreed to improve gatts surveillance of world trade 
practices as well as its dispute settlement process and said gatt 
should encourage greater cooperation with the international 
monetary fund and the world bank 
one suggestion that won strong praise from the ministers was to 
introduce voluntary arbitration as an alternative to the regular 
dispute settlement process bangemann said 
the ministers also agreed that trade in textiles should again be 
governed by gatt regulations once the current multifiber agreement 
expires in 1991 he said

insurance companies should pay for 
efforts to detect cancer early in return for slightly higher 
premiums the head of the american cancer society said sunday 
insurance reimbursement would help primary care doctors to do 
screening and counseling against cancer society president harmon 
eyre told science writers at a societysponsored conference 
in an interview earlier eyre said he was talking about pap 
tests for cervical cancer stool blood tests for colon or rectal 
cancer visual examination of the lower colon called 
sigmoidoscopy and breast xrays called mammograms for breast 
cancer 
in addition he said insurors should provide reimbursement for 
health maintenance exams which include counseling about 
smoking evaluation of the mouth and lymph nodes for cancer and 
discussions about diet weight control and selfexamination for 
testicular or breast cancer 
when a smoker is treated with antibiotics for pneumonia or 
bronchitis resulting from smoking both physican and patient are 
reimbursed he said in remarks distributed to science writers 
but if that same smoker goes to a physician for counseling 
about that cigarette habit no one is reimbursed he said in the 
remarks it is obviously more productive to prevent health 
deterioration than to treat it after an illness has begun 
eyre said in the interview that insurance industry 
representatives have told the cancer society that expanded coverage 
would mean higher premiums 
some companies have experimented with such policies he said 
but people focus on a slight increase in the cost of their health 
insurance premiums and their first reaction is well im not 
going to buy that 
we havent convinced the american public they should buy that 
yet eyre said 
i think hes going to have a hard time making that sale 
said robert waldron spokesman for the health insurance association 
of america 
insurance premiums rose an average of 15 to 25 percent this 
year waldron said in a telephone interview medical costs right 
now are out of control and theres a lot of price resistance out 
there for the things that are covered now 
resistance comes both from individuals and from employers who 
buy 90 percent of the nations health insurance he said 
in the long run early detection should save money eyre said 
the cost of treating a cancer early is repaid with money saved from 
treating an advanced case five to 10 years later he said 
a mastectomy to cure an early breast cancer may cost about 
5000 while the cost of caring for a woman who eventually dies of 
advanced cancer is perhaps 65000 he said 
some health maintenance organizations and prepaid health 
programs have picked up some screening tests usually the pap test 
eyre said he said he supports congressional interest in 
legislation to require medicare to cover mammography and pap 
testing 
that would send a major signal to the insurance industry he 
said 
four states california maryland massachusetts and texas 
require at least some insurance policies to cover mammograms said 
kerrie wilson legislative representative for the cancer society 
the massachusetts law also includes pap tests she said 
the society recommends a single mammogram in women between ages 
35 and 39 then another mammogram every one or two years up to age 
49 and annual mammograms after that 
annual pap tests and pelvic examinations are recommended for 
women 18 or older or who have been sexually active pap tests can 
become less frequent after three consecutive satisfactory 
examinations 
for colon and rectal cancer the society recommends the stool 
blood test annually after age 50 and sigmoidoscopy every three to 
five years after that age following two annual exams with negative 
results 
a poll conducted by the gallup organization for the cancer 
society at the end of last year found increasing use of screening 
tests 
the poll found that 29 percent of respondents had had a stool 
blood test compared to 13 percent in 1976 for sigmoidoscopy the 
figure rose from 23 percent in 1983 to 28 percent in 1987 
when asked about mammography last year 52 percent of the women 
respondents had had a breast xray vs 41 percent in 1980 for the 
pap test 87 percent of the women reported having a test compared 
to 53 percent in 1970 
the poll included a nationally representative sample of 1549 
adults and had a margin of error of 4 percent the society said

the bridge loan is needed to meet interest payments owed to 
private banks on more than 68 million in debt for the second 
quarter of this year brazil declared a unilateral moratorium last 
year over payments for that portion of its debt 
last february brazil resumed payments after reaching a basic 
agreement with its creditor banks on a refinancing package that 
would include 5 billion in new loans 
brazil paid 994 million of its first quarter interest payments 
but still owes another 270 million to cancel the bill through 
march brazil owes another 15 billion for the second quarter da 
nobrega said saturday

development bank annual assembly said saturday that his country 
did not have the monetary reserves to cover interest payments for 
the second quarter

those payments while the new refinancing accord is ironed out 
brazil wants a 20year repayment accord plus a grace period of 
eight years he said 
yamaguchi told reporters that both the creditors and brazil are 
more realistic and look for an arrangement as soon as 
possible
