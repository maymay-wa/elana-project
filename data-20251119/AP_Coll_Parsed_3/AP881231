a plaque marking the apartment house where leonid 
i brezhnev lived for 30 years was removed on kremlin orders in the 
latest blow at the legacy of the disgraced soviet leader 
the plaque which called brezhnev a distinguished figure of the 
soviet communist party the soviet government and the world 
socialist and workers movements was hanging on the building at 26 
kutuzovsky prospekt when the kremlin issued its directive thursday 
evening 
by friday morning it had been removed leaving only a blank wall 
outside the sandcolored apartment building 
they took it away in the middle of the night i thought they 
would said an elderly woman who paused to look at the wall 
they did the right thing said the woman who did not want to 
be identified 
the kremlin decree ordered that everything still named after 
brezhnev and former leader konstantin u chernenko be renamed 
because the two were responsible for a period of stagnation and 
corruption it ordered that plaques marking the homes of both 
leaders be taken down 
brezhnev ruled for 18 years before he died in 1982 after his 
death a city streets city squares and staterun enterprises were 
named after him soviet officials started removing those names in 
january 
brezhnev was succeeded by yuri v andropov mentor of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev andropov lived in the same apartment 
building as did brezhnev and a plaque in his memory remained on the 
building friday 
chernenko ruled for 13 months between andropov and gorbachev and 
was ill much of the time 
the tv news program vremya said a city in the republic of 
moldavia and another in the krasnoyarsk region of siberia that had 
been named for chernenko would be rechristened

the 1988 business year was like the season after 
a television cliffhanger the plot twists that followed last years 
stock market crash never matched black monday for dramatic effect 
those expecting to see recession bread lines and massive 
business failures in the wake of the october 1987 crash were proved 
dead wrong 
like bobby ewing on tvs dallas the market emerged from the 
shower alive and well

off the biggest leveraged buyout in history and japanese officials 
learned what it was like to feel the heat of an insider trading 
crackdown 
while there was more than enough grist to run the business mill 
in the year just ended good news was certainly in short supply 
scores of savings and loans were added to the ranks of the 
insolvent retailers suffered through the second year of a sales 
slump the organization of petroleum exporting countries threatened 
to end consumers love affair with low oil prices and the dollar 
sagged again in foreign exchange trading 
the market for all its resilience was only a shadow of its 
former bullish self the dow jones industrial average of blue chips 
finished well below its precrash peak and remained mostly 
uninspired by the election of republican george bush to succeed 
president reagan as the champion of free enterprise 
still there were high points the baby bells turned 5 years old 
and the nation celebrated increased choice and higher technology in 
the unfettered telecommunications field 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev embraced a bit of capitalist

the rug out from under nabiscos johnson after the boss made an 
admittedly lowball offer to take the company private for 17 
billion after weeks of punch and counterpunch kravis scored a tko 
with a deal worth nearly 25 billion the biggest buyout ever 
kravis made headlines on the society pages while he was at it by 
keeping an ambitious social schedule along with his fashion designer 
wife carolyne roehm their jetset lifestyle on the party circuit 
set mouths to watering but the power couple flatly denied rumors

a record of malpractice suits and disciplinary 
actions taken against doctors and dentists will follow them from 
state to state as part of a new national computer data bank being 
set up by the federal government 
no longer will incompetent health professionals be enabled to 
move from hospital to hospital or from state to state while 
withholding adverse information dr otis r bowen secretary of 
the department of health and human services said friday 
his remarks came at a news conference announcing the award of a 
fiveyear 159 million contract to the unisys corp to operate the 
computer bank ordered by congress in 1986 
the system is expected to be up and running by midsummer said 
bowen but it will not contain files of actions taken against health 
care providers prior to its start 
the information will not be available to the general public but 
rather to state licensing boards and employers of medical personnel 
such as hospitals 
in fact hospitals will be required to check the data base before 
hiring a doctor not known to them and to routinely run their medical 
staffs names through the computer every two years 
the idea is not to create a consumer handbook but rather an 
inhouse tool to help the medical profession weed out incompetents 
that is not enough for one activist dr sidney wolfe who 
founded public citizen health research group with ralph nader 
congress must amend this legislation to require public 
disclosure of this vital publiclyfunded information about 
incompetent doctors which could save many patients from being taken 
care of by the small fraction of demonstrably dangerous doctors 
still practicing in this country said wolfe 
the lead authors of the legislation on the other hand praised 
their own handiwork and the health departments implementation of it 
with this contract we will finally have a national system to 
keep track of the disciplinary records of licensed health 
professionals said rep ron wyden dore in the past 
incompetents have been able to slip through the cracks and inflict 
poor medical care on the american consumer 
rep thomas j tauke riowa called the contract award both an 
end and a beginning 
we are taking the final step on what has been a long and 
difficult road to fully implementing the legislation said tauke 
we are taking a major step forward in protecting and strengthening 
the quality of health care in our nation 
the legislation requires state medical licensing authorities to 
report all their disciplinary actions to the federal computer file 
and also requires the reporting of malpractice suits lodged against 
doctors and dentists 
eventually the data bank is to be expanded to include nurses and 
any other health care providers that must be licensed in order to 
practice their trade 
bowen said it would not be fair for the barebones material in 
the data bank to be directly available to the public in a new 
location even though the case might have received extensive 
publicity where it originated 
he said the filing of a malpractice suit or even a malpractice 
judgment does not necessarily mean a physician is not fully 
competent to practice 
for example he used the case of a patient with a crushed elbow 
and a sharp lawyer 
no matter how good the doctor is and how good a job he does 
youre probably going to have a stiff elbow he said you wave 
that in front of a jury and youre the doctor probably going to 
lose the case 
at the same time bowen said there are a few incompetent doctors 
and that the data base is important because we doctors need to 
be sure we have our own house in order

while wellknown economists discussed weighty 
topics at a major economics convention this week the meetings real 
business took place in hotel suites rented by universities 
there doctoral students groveled before academic deans and 
professors resumes in hand trying to line up teaching posts once 
they receive their degrees this spring 
although what the press seems to be covering here are the 
meetings themselves those are really a minor part of what is going 
on here said george daly dean of the business school at the 
university of iowa 
its really a labor market daly said were all 
recruiting 
of the 8000 people who attended the american economic 
association convention 1500 to 2000 were seeking jobs said elton 
hinshaw the associations secretary 
demand for economists is strong boosted by the popularity of the 
major at universities and the competing demand for economists at 
corporations and government agencies hinshaw said friday 
there are a lot of vacancies he said 
and the annual convention scheduled during the collegiate 
christmas break has become the best place to look for a job for the 
700 or so doctoral students who graduate each year as well as for 
economists wanting to change positions said hinshaw and others at 
the gathering 
realizing the convention has become a labor market organizers 
set aside two large hotel rooms for jobs seekers one where 
employers list their vacancies on bulletin boards and in looseleaf 
notebooks and another lined with dozens of tables for interviews 
among employers listing jobs were schools ranging from dartmouth 
college to slippery rock university government agencies such as the 
federal deposit insurance corp and private employers such as 
bellsouth corp 
but interviews for the more prestigious jobs primarily 
assistant professorships at betterknown universities were held in 
suites scattered among the six hotels used for the convention 
most of those interviews were scheduled weeks before the 
convention based on applicants resumes research recommendations 
and where they are getting their degrees said hinshaw a professor 
at vanderbilt university 
they rent a suite and the kids go in there for three days one 
after the other he said 
saranna robinson a 30yearold doctoral candidate at 
carnegiemellon university said she managed to set up about a dozen 
interviews before the convention 
ms robinson who is seeking a professorship at a small 
prestigious liberal arts college said she was optimistic about 
her chances 
some of them the interviewers would wink as you went out the 
door and say theyd see you later she said 
she and others hope the colleges will call them back for a second 
round of interviews held on campus in which faculty and students 
grill the applicants on their research and teaching skills 
ms robinson said she squeezed in a few conference sessions 
during her four days at the convention but concentrated on finding 
a job a goal backed by her university which paid her convention 
fees 
but getting to the interviews was hard work 
youre running all around midtown manhattan from hotel to 
hotel she said i was here eight weeks ago for the new york 
city marathon i cant decide which one is more strenuous 
starting salaries for assistant economics professors vary little 
from college to college hinshaw said with most offering 35000 to 
40000 
ms robinson said she could double that salary by taking an 
economics job on wall street 
it was tempting for a minute she said but i love 
teaching

television viewers are ready with remote control 
channel changers and tv guides to find their favorite shows as five 
stations in south florida switch network affiliations sunday and a 
sixth makes its debut 
this is about as confused as a market can get said allen 
shaklan a cbs television vice president of programming sent from 
new york to run miamis wcix an independent station becoming a cbs 
affiliate 
the swaps have created enough mindboggling situations to fill a 
madefortelevision movie 
for instance standing amid the holiday decorations in the lobby 
of television station wtvj a cbs network affiliate since 1949 is a 
lifesize cardboard cutout of bill cosby the star of nbcs 
programming lineup 
meanwhile wpec an abc affiliate has rented billboards 
promoting bob newhart a cbs star 
just before the opening sequence of la law the popular nbc 
show beginning at 10 pm thursday miami station wsvn urges viewers 
to start watching the news at 10 pm 
confused just stay tuned 
industry veterans say this sundays network swaps are the biggest 
affiliation switch in history 
its absolutely incredible said robert ware vice president 
and general manager of palm beach gardens station wpbf which goes 
on the air sunday morning 
the changes in the miami metropolitan television area the 
nations 14th largest with 126 million homes with televisions and 
west palm beach the 50th largest with 490100 tv households 
affects more than the millions of viewers 
the two large stations keeping the same network affiliations are 
trying to capitalize on viewer confusion independents are planning 
improved programming to lure channelswitching viewers and cable 
companies are adding stations to make sure their subscribers have 
all of the networks 
making the new tv picture even fuzzier is the signal delivery 
problem for the new miami cbs affiliate wcix and the overlap of the 
two markets 
miami television station wplg keeping its abc affiliation may 
pick up viewers in palm beach county where it can be viewed in many 
homes for example while west palm beachs wpec changing from abc 
to cbs is stepping up the battle for the 522000 tv households in 
broward county broward lies between palm beach and dade counties 
and is counted as part of the miami market 
the announcement in january 1987 of the 275 million purchase of 
wtvj from private owners by nbcs parent corporation general 
electric set corporate wheels turning and the affiliation dominoes 
clicking 
that set the ball rolling this gives us the opportunity to do 
some of the things we always wanted to do said alex dryfoos jr 
ownerpresident of wpec in west palm beach 
the moves after the nbc purchase of cbs wtvj in miami were 
miamis wsvn the nbc affiliate couldnt work out a deal with 
cbs and became independent 
cbs instead bought wcix the leading miami independent for 59 
million 
wpec the palm beach area abc affiliate decided to switch to 
cbs so it could expand south into broward where new wcix has the 
signal problems 
wtvx a fort piercebased cbs affiliate becomes independent 
new station wpbf took the unusual step in an industry in which 
the networks court affiliates to carry their programs of going to 
abc and paying it a reported 1 million to become an abc affiliate 
after gaining abc programs the new station delayed plans to 
begin last oct 1 as an independent 
unchanged are the respective localnews rating leaders abcs 
wplg in miami and nbcs wptv in west palm beach 
the stations are taking different promotional approaches 
miamis wtvj which for the past year has been in the odd 
position of running cbs programs while being part of the nbc 
ownership family is most active with what promotions director linda 
button calls a saturation campaign built around the theme of 
dont worry be happy 
the operation peacock campaign costing at least an estimated 
3 million has nbc stars cavorting with wtvjs news team to bobby 
mcferrins special revision of his pop hit tune dont worry be 
happy wtvj has a tollfree viewer information line and ran a 
halfhour phonein special thursday night 
but television executives acknowledge programming confusion will 
scramble the television picture for many viewers at least for 
awhile 
the reality is we have a long hard road said cbs shaklan 
but were going to make it work its all going to shake itself 
out

mayor marion barry under federal investigation 
for visiting the hotel room of a man suspected of dealing drugs has 
acknowledged im guilty of poor judgment no question about it 
barry on friday denied he used drugs and said he would submit to 
a drug test under the right conditions but not a series of 
tests to try to end what he acknowledged is an embarrassment to 
the nations capital 
this human being stands here ready to say im sorry for the 
poor judgments that have happened to me barry told reporters in 
an interview on public television station weta 
the mayors contrite tone contrasted with a statement thursday 
blaming the media for much of his troubles i have been tried 
convicted sentenced and doing time by some members of the media 
barry said then 
the justice department announced it would aggressively 
investigate whether barry has committed a crime stemming from his 
relationship with charles lewis a former employee of the district 
of columbia government 
two detectives were recalled from a hotel as they were attempting 
to make an undercover drug buy from lewis last week at the time 
barry reportedly was visiting lewis in his room in a ramada inn in 
an area of the city plagued by drug dealing and prostitution 
lewis has denied involvement with drugs and apparently has 
dropped out of sight since last week 
barry said friday he made three or four visits to the hotel room 
of lewis a man he has known for eight or nine years out of 
compassion after lewis asked to see him 
i have a tendency to go to people rather than have them come to 
me barry said thats my sense of compassion he said a 
distressed lewis wanted to talk about job opportunities 
i have a tendency to get too close to people that obviously i 
shouldnt get too close to barry said 
police sources have said they investigated lewis after receiving 
complaints he offered to sell drugs to a hotel maid 
lewis who worked for the district of columbia government until 
1982 was fired last spring by the governor of the virgin islands 
after questions were raised about lewis use of government funds 
lewis served as coordinator of a 260000 contract awarded by the 
virgin islands to the district of columbia to improve the island 
governments personnel system 
barry without offering specifics said friday he has been guilty 
of poor judgment four or five times before 
there were allegations in 1982 he used cocaine at a nightclub in 
1984 there was an inquiry into whether barry bought drugs from 
former city official karen johnson who was convicted of cocaine 
dealing 
a young aspiring model said in 1987 that barry repeatedly tried 
to visit her at home against her wishes 
the mayor who is married vacationed in the bahamas a few months 
later with a woman who worked for a city contractor

the reagan administration is crediting the 
soviet union with significant progress in improving treatment of 
political prisoners and jewish refuseniks 
a state department spokeswoman said friday the soviets have 
released more than 600 political prisoners in the last two years 
including all the monitors of the 1973 helsinki agreement aimed at 
improving the human rights situation 
phyllis oakley the department spokeswoman said all prisoners 
charged with violating political or religious constraints are now 
free jewish emigration soared to 2400 last month and less than a 
dozen of 120 cases of soviet citizens denied permission to join 
family members abroad remain unresolved she added 
the soviets have stopped jamming ussponsored radio broadcasts 
and president mikhail s gorbachev in his speech dec 7 to the un 
general assembly pledged that laws bearing on human rights would be 
changed mrs oakley said 
they have made significant progress she said i think 
thats clear from the examples ive given 
on the other hand a us official said the soviets have not 
cleared up questions about the cases of some 30 citizens the soviets 
say are in prison as criminal offenders state department officials 
suspect the prisoners may be political victims 
but the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
were developing a process it just hasnt jelled yet 
the soviets also have given the united states a list of about 50 
jewish refuseniks who will be granted exit permits for israel 
the reagan administration has held off opening negotiations 
between the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
on cuts in troops and arms in europe until it is satisfied with 
soviet performance on human rights 
being held up as well is the completion of a 35nation 
conference in vienna reviewing compliance with the helsinki 
agreement 
also the reagan administration has withheld its consent to the 
holding of a review in moscow in 1991 gorbachev wants the 
conference held in his capital to demonstrate a new openness in the 
soviet union reviews are scheduled next year in paris and in 1990 
in copenhagen 
in palm springs calif where president reagan is spending the 
new years holiday white house spokeman roman popadiuk said no 
decisions have been made we are considering the moscow conference 
in light of improvements taking place in soviet human rights 
performance and soviet guarantees of access and openness to anyone 
who wants to attend such a meeting 
popadiuk said he was unable to say whether reagan would make the 
decision or leave it to be made by presidentelect bush 
once the roadblock is removed the eastwest arms control talks 
are expected to begin the goal is the reduction of conventional 
troops tanks and artillery across europe 
the soviet union has taken a number of significant positive 
actions on human rights in recent months mrs oakley said no 
decision has been made on whether we should agree to include the 
proposed moscow human rights conference as one of the three 
postvienna human rights meetings 
she added that it was premature to talk of closing the vienna 
meeting although the austrian government has tentatively invited 
foreign ministers to be on hand jan 1719

former republican presidential candidate pat 
robertsons campaign committee has agreed to pay 25000 in fines 
for violating federal election laws officials said 
federal election commission spokesman fred eiland said friday the 
robertson campaign had agreed to penalties assessed for three major 
violations 
the campaign had failed to file as a candidate in a timely 
fashion and had failed to file a statement of organization and had 
failed to file campaign finance reports in a timely fashion said 
eiland 
eiland said the commissions action came in response to a 
complaint filed earlier this year by harvey furgatch a california 
resident concerning a threehour washington dc rally in 
september 1986 attended by about 3000 people 
the complaint stems from the fact that while the campaign was 
claiming it was testing the waters robertson had a rally in 
constitution hall in which several millions of dollars were 
raised said eiland 
during the rally supporters made 100 and 200 contributions 
using a personal gift form supplied by rally organizers the 
event billed as an appeal for support for robertson was broadcast 
via closedcircuit television to 216 locations nationwide 
robertson didnt officially declared his candidacy until october 
1 1987 
that is where the problem was said eiland the very nature 
of the activity where prominent people referred to him as a 
candidate and asked support both financial and other for him is 
what raised the question about whether robertson was a candidate at 
the time of the rally 
a candidate is defined by federal law as someone who has raised 
or spent more than 5000 in a year toward his candidacy he must 
register a statement of candidacy within 15 days and a statement of 
organization of a principal campaign committee within 10 days 
said eiland they failed to do that

the year 14 percent higher on average than at the close of 1987 
according to government figures 
the agriculture departments agricultural statistics board said 
friday in its final report of the year that preliminary figures 
showed decembers prices were up 07 percent from november 
in part driven by the summers drought prices received by 
farmers rose throughout most of 1988 until september when the 
increase leveled off and then dipped in october before rising again 
in november and december 
officials said higher prices for hogs lettuce oranges and 
cattle in december were partly offset by lower prices for tomatoes 
turkeys sweet corn and strawberries 
hog prices increased substantially from last months relatively 
low levels while cattle milk broiler and egg prices each 
increased slightly the report said 
the allwheat price was at the highest level since may 1981

percent from their november average and were up 92 percent from

november and averaged 46 percent above the yearearlier level 
commercial vegetables were down 21 percent from november and 
averaged 21 percent less than in december 1987 sharp declines for 
tomatoes and sweet corn more than offset a large increase in the 
price of lettuce 
although the projections are subject to change usda economists 
say net cash income of farmers may be in the range of 55 billion to 
60 billion this year compared with the record level of 571 
billion in 1987 that is the difference between cash receipts and 
cash expenses during the calendar year 
preliminary figures show that 1988 retail food prices rose an 
average of about 4 percent and that a similar increase is expected 
in 1989 
the report said 
cattle averaged 6730 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally 
up from 6670 in november the price was 6220 in december 1987 
those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef 
hogs averaged 4050 per 100 pounds compared with 3620 in 
november and 4030 a year earlier 
corn at 254 a bushel was up from 251 in november and 172 
in december 1987

the state department has rejected a libyan 
offer to permit foreign inspection of a plant that the united states 
claims is designed to produce chemical weapons 
the united states said it has evidence that the factory which 
the libyans call pharma150 is on the verge of producing chemical 
weapons libya claims the newly built facility near rabta 50 miles 
southwest of tripoli is a pharmaceutical plant 
a onetime inspection could not be conclusive in this regard 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said friday in rejecting 
the offer made last week by libyan leader moammar gadhafi 
a cw plant could easily be modified to appear as a legitimate 
industrial chemical plant such as a pharmaceutical or fertilizer 
facility she said 
all traces of chemical weapons production could be erased from 
a plant on extremely short notice she added 
president reagan said last week that the united states had 
discussed with other nato members possible military action against 
the plant and had urged the allies to withhold from libya technical 
expertise that could be used for chemical weapons production 
companies from italy japan and west germany are believed to have 
helped libya build the plant or the adjacent industrial complex 
japan told the united states its nationals believed they were 
involved in the construction of a fertilizer plant 
cia director william webster said recently that the libyan plant 
is on the verge of production mrs oakley said friday it was not 
yet operational 
the united states also makes chemical weapons but says they serve 
only as a deterrent against a possible chemical attack from the 
soviet union us counterterrorism officials have expressed concern 
that gadhafi might give chemical arms to one of several terrorist 
groups which make their headquarters in tripoli 
the libyan plant will be discussed next week at an international 
conference in paris on plans to stem the proliferation of chemical 
weapons around the world the us delegation will be led by 
secretary of state george p shultz 
foreign ministers at the paris meeting also will discuss claims 
by south korea that north korea has chemical weapons capability 
mrs oakley said us information shows the communist north does 
have limited chemical weapons capability using equipment supplied by 
the soviet union 
but she said the united states could not confirm or deny the 
existence of production or storage facilities in the north because 
its most recent information was from 1986 
the united states does not have any indication that north korea 
plans to use chemical weapons against the south but the pyongyang 
government has a good defense system against chemical weapons mrs 
oakley said

the heir to irans defunct throne said that if 
iranian terrorists were responsible for last weeks bombing of pan 
am flight 103 it would show the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was 
frantic about opposition to his continued rule 
investigators probing the pan am wreckage in scotland have 
concluded that a bomb caused the dec 21 crash but they have 
reported no evidence that iran was involved 
reza pahlavi the oldest son of the late shah of iran issued a 
statement friday after several news organizations in london received 
anonymous telephone demands that the united states deport him or 
risk another terrorist bombing like the one that destroyed the pan 
am jet all 259 people aboard the plane were killed 
the caller claimed to represent a terror group known as guardians 
of the islamic revolution which in similar calls last week took 
responsibility for the air disaster over scotland 
if this is true it is clearly a fresh indication that 
khomeinis terrorist agents are still hard at work around the 
globe pahlavi said 
it is also another indication that the khomeini regime faced 
with growing popular resentment is becoming increasingly frantic 
about its future the statement said it cited a recent wave of 
executions of dissidents in iran as further evidence 
in a related development friday a us official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said an iranian intermediary has approached 
the united states offering to reopen diplomatic talks between the 
two countries the official said the state department was holding 
out for a substantive upfront proposal 
the official said the offer was channeled through an 
iranianamerican professor 
the united states and iran have had no diplomatic relations since 
1979 when militants seized and sacked the us embassy in tehran 
taking the americans there hostage 
iranian authorities appear uneasy about a recent campaign by the 
28yearold pahlavi seemingly designed to foment opposition to the 
khomeini government 
west germany recently denied pahlavi permission to enter the 
country for a speaking engagement after a request from iranian 
authorities to german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
earlier this month iran complained to the british broadcasting 
corp about a broadcast by pahlavi on dec 2 
i am confident that the united states government as well as 
other governments will stand firm and will never surrender to 
terrorist pressure pahlavis statement said 
pahlavi lives behind a veil of secrecy and security at a palatial 
home in suburban washington on the same street as saudi ambassador 
prince bandar and sen edward kennedy dmass it is also near the 
central intelligence agencys headquarters 
pahlavi a trained jet fighter pilot knows he is vulnerable to 
terrorist threats 
when you know you are the number one target of the number one 
terrorists in the world that doesnt make you really very 
comfortable said pahlavi in a recent interview 
the young prince left iran in 1978 eight months before his 
father was ousted by khomeinis islamic revolution pahlavi who 
declared himself the legitimate monarch of iran when his father died 
of cancer in 1980 has been rallying exiled supporters in recent 
months in the united states and europe 
if you believe in me as a leader then help me he told some 
1100 iranians at a world affairs council dinner in los angeles 
three months ago the time has come its time to move 
pahlavi who has a degree in political science wants to see the 
monarchy restored in his ancient land with himself as head of state 
rather than head of government he has cited spain as an example of 
how he would like to fashion the monarchy in iran 
pahlavi has been accused by opponents of being a tool of the cia 
which openly supported his father for many years 
pahlavis mother the empress fara diba and his three younger 
siblings also live in the united states the family fortune has 
been estimated as high as 15 billion including real estate in 
california

parliament approved a historic freetrade 
agreement between the united states and canada clearing the last 
legal hurdle for the pact between the worlds largest twoway 
trading partnership to begin at midnight tonight 
the senate vote on friday ended three years of often heated 
debate president reagan and prime minister brian mulroney signed 
the treaty last jan 2 but the pact required canadian legislative 
approval 
in between the freetrade issue became the focal point of the 
national elections won on nov 21 by mulroneys progressive 
conservatives opponents claimed the agreement would cost canadians 
their jobs and make them an economic underling to their financially 
stronger southern neighbor 
others claimed the pact would ultimately cost them their economic 
freedom 
even though we intend to acquiesce and the bill will become 
law our concerns have not disappeared allan maceachen the 
liberals leader in the senate said during the debate the 
government has chosen the hard discpline of the market we will have 
to monitor whether the market does its job 
mulroney who in 1983 called freetrade a threat to sovereignty 
touted the deal as assuring future canadian prosperity by 
guaranteeing access to the larger richer us market canada 
already has a 200 billion annual trade relationship with the united 
states 
the economic council of canada expects it will produce 250000 
jobs over 10 years 
years from now i believe it will be said of this generation of 
canadians that we made the right choice trade minister john 
crosbie said 
all that we cherish about canada all that makes us unique as a 
country will be enhanced as canadians excel and prosper under the 
freetrade agreement the senate leader of the conservatives 
lowell murray said in the final debate 
the approval in ottawa was by voice and not tabulated although 
senators abstained from the opposition liberal party 
over the next 10 years the deal will phase out tariffs and 
border restrictions on banking investment energy and services 
the actual start of the agreement will be marked only by an 
exchange of diplomatic notes few signs of it will be visible 
immediately to travelers or consumers 
the us congress completed its legislation in september for the 
agreement but the opposition in canada delayed it 
the conservatives used their majority in the house of commons to 
impose rare limits on debate and approve the legislation 141111 in 
a special session dec 24 several members of the opposition liberal 
party sang the national anthem o canada as they cast their 
losing votes 
the liberals control the nonelected senate and had tied up the 
legislation there last fall forcing mulroney to call the election 
they promised however not to repeat their action if he won a 
majority government

oliver north is trying to get president reagan 
and presidentelect bush to testify at his trial an unprecedented 
legal maneuver reagan reportedly considers another attempt to get 
him to pardon the former marine charged in the irancontra scandal 
white house and justice department officials said the subpoenas 
were received friday and that until a thorough review by 
administration attorneys it would be premature to speculate how 
reagan and bush will respond 
north the fired white house aide charged with conspiracy for his 
role in the irancontra affair called for testimony from the 
nations two highestranking elected officials in subpoenas 
delivered to the justice department 
norths trial is scheduled to start jan 31 or 11 days after 
bush takes over for reagan 
while declining to state directly whether they would contest the 
subpoenas spokesmen for the white house and bush signaled they 
would not automatically accept them the washington post today 
quoted unidentified justice department and white house officials as 
saying they would fight them 
the post also quoted a white house official as saying that reagan 
viewed the subpoena as an attempt to prod him into pardoning north 
but reagan urged by some conservatives to pardon north has not 
changed his view that the case should be decided at trial the 
newspaper quoted the official as saying 
the newspaper quoting sources it did not identify further said 
state department and national security agency officials have also 
received subpoenas from norths attorney 
statements from the white house and bushs office called it 
unprecedented for a sitting president to testify in court said 
they were reviewing the legal issues and noted that historical 
precedent would call for the witnesses to testify in writing rather 
than take the stand 
in palm springs calif where reagan is on vacation a white 
house statement acknowledged norths subpoena seeking the 
presidents testimony at the criminal trial of oliver north the 
subpoena also seeks the discovery of certain personal records of the 
president 
the subpoenas were anticipated it said aides to both reagan and 
bush told them friday morning that the documents would come that 
afternoon their spokesmen said 
white house spokesman roman popadiuk said reagan had known of the 
likelihood since wednesday 
it raises significant legal and constitutional questions which 
are currently being reviewed by the department of justice and 
counsel to the president the white house said in language similar 
to a statement released by bush spokeswoman sheila tate 
it would be unprecedented for a president to appear as a 
witness at a criminal trial and its premature to speculate on the 
final decision that will ultimately be taken but historical 
precedent suggests any relevant information could be provided 
through written questions and answers 
north a retired marine lieutenant colonel who worked for reagan 
as an aide to the national security council faces trial jan 31 for 
charges stemming from the us arms sales to iran and diversion of 
proceeds to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
he is charged with conspiring with former national security 
adviser john poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired 
air force maj gen richard secord to illegally divert more than 12 
million in usiran armssales profits to the contras 
justice department spokesman loye miller said the subpoenas were 
received at midafternoon one for the president and one for the 
vice president by robert ross executive assistant to attorney 
general dick thornburgh 
tate said bush legal counsel boyden gray was reviewing the 
matter but that the vice president was going ahead with a long 
weekend of relaxation at camp david md and planned no meetings to 
discuss the trial matter bush and his wife barbara arrived at camp 
david on friday and planned to stay until late monday 
bush takes office as president on jan 20 and could claim 
executive privilege to avoid testifying on matters of national 
security which much of the north case involves 
norths attorney brendan sullivan appearing on abc news on 
friday was asked why he issued the subpoenas he said a defense 
lawyer has an obligation to issue a subpoena for every person who 
has relevant information about a matter in court the president 
himself has indicated he has relevant information 
in 1973 president nixon received a subpoena to turn over white 
house tape recordings in the watergate scandal he was not required 
to testify but the supreme court ordered him to release the tapes 
the subpoena could force bush to disclose information he 
previously has kept secret 
bush repeatedly has refused to discuss his private discussions 
and advice to reagan on the irancontra affair other than to say he 
expressed reservations about us arms sales to iran 
the congressional irancontra investigating committees concluded 
last year that there was no evidence bush knew of the diversion plan 
bush also said he was unaware of norths secret operation to 
supply the contras during the congressional ban on aid although his 
national security adviser donald gregg was well informed on the 
matter and bush met three times with felix rodriguez a north 
operative in the operation 
other questions continue on how much bush knew about the 
armsforhostages aspect of the iran matter he has said he did not 
know about it until late 1986 but his chief of staff indicated that 
israeli operative amiram nir briefed bush on the matter in may 1986 
bush said he was told about what the israelis were doing not the 
us participation

the reagan administration did not adequately 
study the protections needed for migratory wildlife before adopting 
a plan last year for offshore oil and gas leasing through 1992 a 
federal appeals court says 
the us circuit court of appeals on friday ordered the interior 
department to conduct a more thorough study the ruling does not 
immediately impede the leasing program 
the wildlife at issue include the gray whale and salmon that 
migrate in the north pacific between california and alaska and 
various migratory birds 
the appeals courts unsigned 64page opinion rejected all other 
aspects of a challenge against the fiveyear plan adopted by 
interior secretary donald p hodel in july 1987 
the previous fiveyear plan survived all court challenges 
the latest plan was challenged by the national resources defense 
council other environmental groups and the states of california 
massachusetts oregon and washington 
an interior department spokesman said the agency welcomed the 
ruling and would comply with it 
the first possible lease offering that could be affected is 
scheduled in alaska for december 1989

assessed because its 1986 cars guzzled too much gasoline the

gallon short of meeting that years required fleet average minimum 
mileage 260 mpg said tim hurd spokesman for the agency

manufacturers may apply credits earned by doing better than the 
minimum in other years but mercedes exhausted all its credits in

an administrative law judge has proposed to fine the company 
about 55 million for 1985 when the companys us fleet averaged 
236 mpg and the requirement was 275 mpg without credits the 1985 
fine would be nearly 18 million hurd said

for 1984 cars

sculptor isamu noguchi whose work bridged east 
and west and included delicate paper lamps massive boulderlike 
sculptures and serene gardens has died at age 84 
noguchi the son of a japanese poet and an american writer died 
early friday at new york university medical center of heart failure 
he was a paramount and essential figure in the evolution of 
20thcentury sculpture said martin friedman director of the 
walker art center in minneapolis he was a person of incredible 
vitality and restless curiosity constantly seeking to generate new 
projects and ideas 
noguchi caught a bad cold in italy early this month and suffered 
complications said allen wardwell director of the isamu noguchi 
garden museum in new york which opened in 1984 and where the artist 
maintained a studio 
noguchi was best known for his distinctive sculptures often of 
smooth rock in natural shapes that recall primitive crafts and for 
some surrealistic paintings 
isamu noguchi stood for perfection said thomas messer the 
retired director of the solomon r guggenheim museum in new york 
his art deeply rooted in tradition kept reiterating the 
underlying wisdom and the verities of life 
in his sculpture noguchi maintained a reverence for the 
materials with which he worked whether designing furniture and 
lamps stage sets for modern dance gardens fountains or 
playgrounds his sensitivity to surroundings was legendary 
for me it is the direct contact of artist to material which is 
original and it is the earth and his contact to it which will free 
him of the artificiality of the present and his dependence on 
industrial products he wrote in 1985 
his works included the spacious hart plaza on detroits 
riverfront the unesco garden in paris the billy rose sculpture 
garden in jerusalem and two bridges for hiroshimas peace park 
in new york his works include a 28foot red cube that stands on 
its corner in front of a lower manhattan bank the sunken garden at 
chase manhattan plaza and the stainless steel bas relief of five 
journalists installed above the door of the associated press 
building in rockefeller center 
noguchis work is included in the permanent collections of many 
of the worlds major museums 
at the time of his death he was working on several large marble 
sculptures and other projects including the bayfront park in miami 
a memorial to the challenger astronauts 
noguchi was a new yorker but spent much of his time in japan 
including his formative years 
he was born in los angeles on nov 17 1904 but two years later 
went to tokyo with his family he returned alone to the united 
states in 1918 and went to school in indiana 
after studying briefly with gutzon borglum the sculptor of mount 
rushmore noguchi entered columbia university as a premedical 
student in 1922 but dropped out in favor of sculpture studies at 
the leonardo da vinci art school now defunct 
he moved to paris in 1928 and worked as a studio assistant for 
constantin brancusi for six months noguchi returned to new york in 
1929 and had his first oneman show at the eugene schoen gallery 
later fellowships allowed him to travel to japan and china where he 
studied drawing inkbrush painting and pottery 
he designed the first set used by the martha graham dance company 
in 1935 beginning a lifelong collaboration ms graham once said 
whatever he did in those sets he did as a zen garden does it back 
to the fundamental of life of ritual 
during his long prolific career noguchi worked in many 
materials including wood ceramic iron bronze and galvanized 
steel but his major sculptures are made of stone basalt granite 
and marble 
noguchi was married briefly in the 1950s to japanese actress 
yoshiko yamaguchi they had no children he is survived by a sister 
ailes spindem of santa fe nm and two halfbrothers michio 
noguchi and tomiji noguchi of japan

a homemade firecracker exploded in a 
home killing a us serviceman and a 10yearold filipino boy 
police and us officials said today four others were wounded 
col cecil ross spokesman for the usrun clark air base said 
the accident occurred late friday just outside the base about 50 
miles northwest of manila 
ross would not release the name of the 29yearold serviceman or 
his hometown pending notification of next of kin 
but police in angeles city adjacent to the base identified the 
dead as sgt michael kaleda assigned to clarks aircraft 
generations squadron and gilbert gaspar a relative of the 
servicemans filipino wife 
the wounded included the servicemans 7yearold son kevin and 
three of his wifes relatives police added 
police lt col cesar ocampo said kaleda was making a firecraker 
at home apparently for use during new year celebrations when it 
exploded prematurely ocampo said the firecracker packed with 
gunpowder was about three inches in diameter and a foot long 
on thursday an explosion at a clandestine firecracker factory in 
the nearby province of bulacan killed 11 people and injured dozens 
more 
earlier this month fire engulfed a ferry boat with more than 200 
people aboard after a cargo of fireworks exploded one woman was 
killed officials said 
the manufacture and sale of firecrackers were banned in 1966 
after a fire that started in a fireworks factory killed 26 people in 
the bulacan town of meycauayan 
despite the ban the manufacture and sale of fireworks continue 
openly officials say they cannot enforce the ban because the use of 
fireworks is a tradition among filipinos to usher in the new year 
and celebrate other feasts

the government must rely on more than 
undocumented suspicions before testing for drug use said a judge 
who barred a federal testing program for 3 million interstate truck 
and bus drivers 
us district judge marilyn hall patel on friday said she found 
no conclusive evidence of drug use to support the broad sweeping 
intrusive random testing that was to become mandatory next 
december 
the mere fact that theres a perceived problem doesnt mean the 
government can use a scattershot approach that isnt narrowly 
drawn to attack documented misconduct patel said she said the 
governments only evidence of drug use was anecdotal and 
impressionistic reports plus one flawed study 
she issued a preliminary injunction against plans for random drug 
testing and mandatory testing of drivers involved in accidents she 
did not block other regulations that will require preemployment 
testing drug testing at periodic physical examinations and testing 
based on a reasonable suspicion that a driver is using drugs 
patels order does not immediately forbid any drug testing 
because mandatory testing under the department of transportation 
program was not to take effect until dec 21 1989 before then her 
ruling may be tested in the 9th us circuit court of appeals and 
could also be affected by pending supreme court decisions in two 
other drug testing cases 
but the judge also blocked some of the departments regulations 
from taking effect and lawyers for truck drivers said the action 
would have a shortterm impact on testing programs set up 
voluntarily by trucking companies 
for example said attorney jeffrey king under department rules 
that were to take effect last week any trucker who refused to take 
a drug test under a company testing program would be prohibited from 
driving for any interstate hauler those rules were blocked by 
patels order he said 
justice department lawyer brian kennedy had a different 
interpretation telling reporters that any voluntary program that 
would have been authorized by the new federal rules was already 
permitted under previous law 
the programs cover the majority of more than 4 million 
transportation workers who would be affected by drug testing 
programs announced nov 14 by transportation secretary james burnley 
the remaining 1 millionplus workers are in the airline railroad 
and maritime industries along with instate bus drivers railroad 
unions have filed a separate suit against their testing program 
the programs for interstate truck and bus drivers were challenged 
by the owneroperator independent drivers association of america a 
group of 9000 owners and drivers of heavyduty trucks and small 
truck fleets 
as in other suits against drug programs the truckers contended 
that testing without evidence that an individual driver is impaired 
by drugs violates the constitutional ban on unreasonable searches 
we are most concerned with random testing because random 
testing assumes that a person is guilty said michael oconnell a 
lawyer for the owneroperators

bowing to pressure from humanitarian 
groups authorities agreed to reconsider their order to expel eight 
turkish kurds seeking political asylum refugee officials said 
amnesty international and the finnish red cross joined appeals on 
behalf of the kurds who were on a hunger strike in jail 
finnish television and several newspapers said friday that the 
authorities agreed to study the case again refugee officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the report but declined 
to elaborate 
the eight kurds would face certain persecution if sent back to 
turkey said tuula kojo spokesman for a group formed to keep the 
kurds in finland which has one of the strictest immigration 
policies in europe 
kojo said all had a history of trouble at home which should 
justify their asylum requests he did not say if the kurds were 
members of the outlawed kurdish labor party which has fought a 
fouryear guerrilla war to set up an independent marxist state in 
parts of eastern and southeastern turkey 
kurds are a stateless minority of about 20 million living mainly 
in iraq and turkey 
the eight kurds arrived in helsinki by ferry from poland on nov 
1 they were allowed to stay in a suburban refugee center until 
tuesday when the aliens office decided to deport them the kurds 
refused to leave the center and were jailed 
seppo tiitinen head of the security police which reviews all 
asylum applications said earlier this week the kurds had not 
been able to demonstrate in any way that they had reason to fear 
persecution if returned to their own country 
the director of the aliens office matti backman refused 
comment saying it could endanger the persons in question 
leading finnish politicians and public figures have been critical 
of finlands refugee policy in the past last year the archbishop of 
the finnish lutheran church john vikstrom accused the government 
of being twofaced over the issue of refugees 
the finns a people of 49 million in a country the size of 
britain have granted political asylum to four cases from 60 
applicants this year eleven were given residence permits 13 cases 
were pending and the rest were rejected or withdrawn the aliens 
office said 
neighboring sweden by contrast gave political asylum to 16000 
refugees

airports across asia have tightened 
security after a warning that palestinian terrorists plan to attack 
a commercial airliner in the region by jan 10 officials said today 
the heightened security follows the dec 21 bombing of pan am 
flight 103 over scotland that killed 270 people suspicion has 
centered on radical palestinian or proiranian groups

south asian leaders today ended a 
threeday summit pledging to remedy some of the worlds worst 
poverty while talks between leaders of rivals pakistan and india 
raised hopes of regional peace 
the seven nations of the south asia association on regional 
cooperation with a combined population of 11 billion took aim at 
spiraling military costs growing protectionist sentiment among 
developed nations and a burgeoning drug trafficking problem 
the group released a declaration on a regional plan of action 
that promised visible results by the year 2000 on these issues 
including the harsh poverty that affects much of the impoverished 
area 
dominating the summit however was the meeting between 
pakistans benazir bhutto and indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
one indian official said the two were getting along famously 
but few details emerged from their talks 
gandhi is the first indian leader to meet a pakistani prime 
minister in pakistan since his grandfather jawaharlal nehru met 
president ayub khan in 1960 
relations between the two nations have been volatile since 
partition in 1947 they have fought three wars since then and 
maintain tens of thousands of soldiers along their border 
ms bhutto 35 promised to move islamic pakistan and mainly 
hindu india onto friendlier footing through trust and goodwill 
i dont doubt the intentions of my neighbor and in fact i think 
that there is a wonderful opportunity for giving peace momentum 
she said before the summit began 
the indian official speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
two leaders agreed not to attack each others nuclear facilities 
the official also said they agreed to increase cultural exchanges 
and reduce trade barriers 
the pakistanis had no comment on the talks 
indias known nuclear weapons program and pakistans suspected 
nuclear arms capability have been a major stumbling block to 
friendlier ties 
the alliances declaration supported an end to the nuclear arms 
race and elimination of nuclear weapons but it did not refer to 
india and pakistan by name 
the statement also urged rapid completion of studies such as one 
on the causes of natural disasters and the environment 
bangladeshs president hussain muhammad ershad called for 
regional efforts to cope with natural disasters such as the floods 
and cyclones that killed an estimated 3000 people in his country 
this year 
your personal role and contribution to this process cannot be 
overemphasized ershad said 
the seven nations in the alliance are bangladesh bhutan india 
the maldives nepal pakistan and sri lanka

supporters of jean harris the headmistress 
serving time for the 1980 murder of scarsdale diet author dr herman 
tarnower vowed to fight on for her release despite a denial of 
clemency by gov mario cuomo 
if she doesnt die of a broken heart or have another heart 
attack well be back again next year begging for mercy said 
michael kennedy harris manhattan attorney 
harris 65 has suffered at least one heart attack while serving 
15 years to life for slaying her lover 
kennedy said he talked to harris friday afternoon shortly after 
she learned her clemency plea had been denied 
oh my god michael im so sad he quoted her as saying 
but the lawyer said harris was determined not to give up 
friends and relatives of the former director of an exclusive 
virginia girls school had mounted a 25000signature petition 
appeal on her behalf 
cuomo who regularly grants clemencies during the christmasnew 
years season received 526 applications and granted clemency for 
two state prison inmates both serving 15 years to life on drug sale 
charges 
cuomo spokeswoman anne crowley declined to discuss the harris 
case except to say clemency had been denied harris is eligible to 
reapply for clemency in one year 
i feel bad for her said russell leggett the retired state 
supreme court judge who sentenced harris and had recommended her for 
clemency 
she committed one violent act in her whole life and it was 
committed under extreme emotional disturbance society does not 
gain a thing by her continued confinement he said 
harris has maintained she meant to kill herself and not tarnower 
on march 10 1980 upset because he had taken up with a younger 
woman harris wound up shooting tarnower four times and said it was 
an accident 
during her almost eight years in prison harris has been active 
in its childrens center has taught fellow inmates and has written 
two books 
david harris the eldest of her two sons called cuomos denial 
a political decision connected to what he said were the 
governors presidential ambitions 
i think when he sees her name he sees willie horton the son 
said if hes going to be president from a political standpoint 
she could be a liability 
horton is the massachusetts state prison inmate who while out on 
furlough raped a maryland woman and beat her husband vice 
president george bush used the horton furlough issue in his 
presidential campaign against massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
alice lacey secretary of the monroe nhbased jean harris 
legal defense committee said harris was deeply discouraged when 
they spoke after news of the denial 
well work with all our hearts for the next time lacey 
pledged

michigan home of the big three automakers 
will no longer invest state pension funds in two of the automobile 
companies because they have business ties to south africa said 
state treasurer robert bowman 
bowman said general motors corp and ford motor co are among 172 
firms from which 5 billion in state pension funds must be withdrawn 
over the next five years because of a state law restricting 
investments in companies with ties to south africa 
ford and gm have both taken large steps in the last few months 
to move closer to disassociating themselves with the republic of 
south africa but it will indeed curtail our investments both in gm 
and ford he said friday adding he hopes the law will lead the 
firms to change their practices 
we are adding our voice a large voice to a growing chorus of 
those who say something has got to change over there 
bowman said the third automaker chrysler corp has no 
operations in south africa 
general motors spokeswoman karen longridge said the company would 
have no comment until tuesday 
ford spokesman tom foote said the company would not have any 
reaction to the states announcement 
a sponsor of the new law downplayed the impact on the two large 
employers and the states economy 
the fact is by and large those companies have been moving jobs 
out of michigan decreasing employment in this state said rep 
perry bullard dann arbor adding that state funds will be freed 
for investment in other michigan firms 
the state currently has 125 billion invested in ford and 
general motors which must be sold over the next five years because 
of the law bowman said 
in addition to requiring divestiture of current investments the 
law which takes effect sunday also bans new investments in firms 
doing business in south africa until the companies drop their 
associations in south africa or the country ends its apartheid 
policy 
besides general motors and ford bowman said michiganbased 
kellogg co unisys and upjohn co are on the list of firms known to 
have south african ties but he said state investments in those are 
small 
bowman said state officials will urge the companies to end 
operations in south africa 
were not telling them they are doing something evil or 
malicious were telling them wed like them to change and until 
they do change were not going to be able to invest in them he 
said

a leading newspaper today criticized 
premier branko mikulic saying his vacilliating policies led to 
economic ruin and political unrest 
mikulics 31member cabinet tendered its resignation earlier 
friday in reaction to increased opposition to its handling of a 
crisis that has sent annual inflation soaring to 250 percent and the 
foreign debt to 21 billion 
the demise of the government unprecedented since the communists 
came to power after world war ii came two days after parliament 
refused to pass a law that would have sharply curbed public spending 
the government had actually lost the support of the political 
structures from which its premier had emerged said radio 
ljublijana on friday 
the belgrade daily politika in todays editions offered a harsher 
assessment 
mikulics vacillating policies have led to the impoverishment 
of the economy and have thrown a significant segment of the 
population to the edge of intolerable poverty it said 
politika customarily reflects the views of serbias communist 
leader slobodan milosevic a man hailed by supporters as the strong 
politician yugoslavia needs to get it out of its present crisis 
the annual inflation rate has tripled from 84 percent in 1986 
when mikulic came to power the real value of the average monthly 
salary has dropped and living standards have plummeted to half the 
1980 level 
a record number of strikes have plagued mikulics term in office 
in yugoslavias complicated political system the federal 
government is generally responsible for economic policy while the 
presidency which appoints the premier dictates defense and foreign 
policies 
in order to fend off raising public discontent the leaders of 
yugoslavias six republics have increasingly taken to attacking 
mikulic and his cabinet and blaming them for economic ills 
numerous public statements by political officials have offered 
the public a way out of the crisis through the resignation of the 
governmentsaid mikulic in his departing address to parliament on 
friday 
but what programs do the others have to offer he asked

some homeless people could face arrest after a 
federal judge rejected an american civil liberties union contention 
that police were selectively enforcing misdemeanor laws to get the 
poor off the streets 
the police are going to do their duty and follow the law 
said assistant city attorney leon firtel who argued against the 
aclu in court if they have probable cause to arrest someone they 
will go ahead and do that 
the aclu had argued that the homeless were being harassed by 
police before weekend orange bowl activities so that the city would 
look good for tourists and on national television for the orange 
bowl parade today 
aclu attorney valerie jonas had sought the injunction to block 
police from enforcing misdemeanor laws she said were being used 
selectively 
when someone is sleeping on a piece of cardboard they can be 
arrested for littering she said 
but us district judge c clyde atkins denied the injunction 
friday 
firtel said the decision probably did not allow time for an 
appeal before the weekend 
an estimated 10000 homeless people live in miami and the city 
offers no public shelters though a new miami rescue mission 
building is preparing to open in january with beds for 250 men

president hosni mubarak was quoted in an 
interview published today as saying israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs position on middle east peace rules out an egyptianisraeli 
summit 
but mubarak was also quoted in the state newspaper al messa as 
saying he would be prepared to go to israel should shamir change his 
stance 
mubarak cited shamirs opposition to an international conference 
as a framework for arabisraeli peace talks and his refusal to 
relinquish any part of the territories israel captured from egypt 
and jordan during the 1967 war as the obstacles preventing such a 
visit 
in kuwaiti and japanese newspaper interviews this month mubarak 
said he was prepared to go to israel if this would help solve the 
palestinian problem he did not at that time detail what he believed 
israel should do 
in todays interview he was more specific 
i still say that i am ready to travel to israel on condition 
that this leads to real progress in the process to resolve the 
middle east issue he was quoted as saying 
for the visit to israel to take place prime minister shamir 
must say clearly what he will give to solve the problem there 
must be flexibility in the israeli position and agreement on 
convening an international conference 
shamir opposes a proposed international conference with the 
participation of the five permanent members of the un security 
council he contends such a parley could force israel into too many 
concessions 
shamir has said no to an international conference and 
declared his country will not give up an inch of the territories it 
occupies mubarak was quoted as saying in al messa on what 
basis then shall i go to israel i cannot possibly go to concur in 
the israeli prime ministers statements 
mubarak noted however that egyptianisraeli contacts at lower 
levels are in existence and the dialogue has not been ruptured 
the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979 the first 
between an arab country and the jewish state mubarak has not 
visited israel since taking office in 1981 
israel conquered the west bank and gaza where 17 million 
palestinians presently live in the 1967 war the west bank included 
east jerusalem which israel has annexed 
the palestine liberation organization last month proclaimed an 
independent state but the boundaries were never specifically noted 
state minister for foreign affairs butros ghali in a statement 
to reporters last week made a mubarak visit to israel also 
conditional on the jewish state agreeing to open talks with the plo 
something israel has vowed never to do because it says the plo is a 
terrorist group 
mubarak did not mention the plo in todays interview but the 
egyptian position always has been that the organization should 
participate in any peace talks 
recognition of israels right to exist and renunciation of 
terrorism by plo leader yasser arafat this month resulted in the 
united states agreeing to open a dialogue with the plo israel 
condemned the american move

an anthem used to defeat 
rightwing president augusto pinochet of chile has been copied by 
salvadoran rightists for march elections without the permission of 
its creators 
the use of elements from the campaign to defeat pinochet are 
completely unauthorized said andres zaldivar vicepresident of 
the chilean christian democratic party 
the republican nationalist alliance or arena modified the 
lyrics of were going to say no to fit the salvadoran 
context asking voters to reject five more years of christian 
democratic rule but it appropriated the tune and the catchy refrain 
without the slightest change 
zaldivar objected to the change more so because arena and 
presidential candidate alfredo cristiani have clear connections 
and sympathies with the pinochet regime 
the song was the broadcast in the heart of the campaign to 
prevent pinochet from retaining chiles presidency until 1997 
chileans rejected pinochet in the november referendum 
we never thought they the christian democrats would get so 
upset about that the copying christiani said 
arena which is leading the incumbent christian democrats in 
polls before the march 19 presidential election also copied a 
chilean opposition video which shows people shaking their heads and 
wagging their finger to indicate dissent 
the arena version used local citizens but in poses and 
situations virtually identical to those employed in the original 
christiani said his partys use of the chilean material was a 
satire to demonstrate the christian democrats lack of creativity 
cristiani said the salvadoran christian democrats routinely used 
foreign ideas with slight changes in local campaigns 
it is intellectual political and ideological theft said 
roberto viera salvadors communications minister 
salvadoran political parties traditionally incorporate popular 
songs into their campaigns by changing the tunes lyrics both arena 
and the christian democrats have engaged in the practice 
viera made a distinction between the use of pop songs and arenas 
use of the chilean jingle 
the no song is one of definite ideological and political 
commitment it can be used only by those who have the same political 
and ideological commitment he said 
cristiani has held up pinochets chile as a model of economic 
development that el salvador would do well to emulate 
viera contended that because the christian democratic party is 
an an international organization local christian democrats were in 
effect part owners of the song arena was now using against them 
the christian democrats have for the past two nights broadcast 
television spots denouncing the copycat propaganda 
the chilean and arena versions are presented one after the other 
with a legend flashed across the bottom of the screen reading no 
to pinochet equals no to cristiani no to the robbery and 
plagiarism of arena

a 41yearold suspect in the killing of 
swedish premier olof palme was ordered kept in detention today for 
further questioning 
the stockholm district court approved the prosecutors request 
that christer pettersson be held until jan 13 awaiting formal 
charges he was arrested dec 14 and arraigned two days later 
bringing hopes that a hunt lasting almost three years had finally 
produced a murder suspect 
the hearing this morning was delayed almost 90 minutes when the 
suspect refused to leave the jail in osteraker about 25 miles 
outside stockholm 
defense counsel arne liljeros said his client told him he did not 
want to appear in front of the media 
pettersson who has pleaded innocent asked to be released 
but after a hearing lasting less than 10 minutes behind closed 
doors the court said it approved chief prosecutor anders helins 
request for formal charges to be postponed two weeks while the state 
completes its case prosecutors can extend his detention further by 
showing cause 
liljeros said after the hearing that he felt the prosecutors 
evidence at present was not strong enough for them to go to trial 
the national news agency tt said 
palme a fourterm prime minister was killed feb 28 1986 
while walking home unguarded with his wife lisbet from a late movie 
in central stockholm 
according to accounts in the swedish press witnesses including 
his wife have picked pettersson out of a lineup as the man who was 
loitering outside the movie theater and then followed the couple 
down the street and shot the premier at close range 
but press reports indicate police have been frustrated in their 
search for more proof including the missing murder weapon believed 
to be a 357caliber magnum revolver 
public records show pettersson has a history of psychatric 
treatment drug and alcohol abuse and other troubles with the law 
his record includes a manslaughter conviction he stabbed a drug 
addict to death with a bayonet on a stockholm street in 1970

a commission on selfesteem that gave 
the nation another reason to poke fun at california when the panel 
was created two years ago is finally getting some respect 
research a growing mailing list and testimony by educators 
counselors police aids victims and gang members are lending 
legitimacy to the commissions founding premise 
poor selfesteem is closely linked with alcoholism drug abuse 
crime and violence child abuse teenage pregnancy prostitution 
chronic welfare dependency and failure of children to learn 
since the laughter died over garry trudeaus doonesbury comic 
strip naming the boopsie character to the panel in early 1987 
the task force has started a series of public hearings nurtured the 
formation of 42 local commissions and served as a clearinghouse for 
information on selfesteem 
a survey of research by seven university of california professors 
has been accepted for publication by the university press 
i think were now gaining a great deal of credibility said 
bob ball executive director of the threeyear 750000 california 
task force to promote selfesteem and personal and social 
responsibility 
fortytwo of californias 58 counties have formed local 
selfesteem task forces including conservative rural counties in 
the sierra nevada and the farm belt of the central valley 
trudeaus boopsie called the task force the first official 
study of new age thinking 
but legislation forming the task force received the blessing of 
republican gov george deukmejian a former state attorney general 
with a toughoncrime and common sense administration 
republicans comprise a slight majority of the task forces 25 
members 
the task forces second annual report to the legislature is due 
jan 15 its final report in january 1990 will make public policy 
recommendations 
wilbur brantley a sacramento real estate agent former police 
officer and one of 13 republicans on the task force said the panel 
has no illusions about curing all social ills but may recommend new 
policies and programs that address low selfesteem as a cause of 
many problems 
youre going to find a lot of people who say we knew that all 
along but if we really knew it why do we keep pouring money down 
the socalled rat holes he said we keep spending money on 
crime and violence we keep spending money on drug abuse 
the panels hearings have drawn testimony by smallbusiness 
owners in the timberfishing town of eureka near the oregon border 
aids patients in san francisco and masked members of rival street 
gangs in los angeles 
backers of the task force talk about its mission in a combination 
of selfhelp psychology social reform and bottomline economic 
terms 
to settle for simply treating symptoms is to abandon 
hope assemblyman john vasconcellos said when he sponsored 
legislation to create the task force 
according to the 1986 bill the states 2 million adult 
alcoholics and its 3 billion illicit drug trade cost the state 
millions of dollars in medical expenses lost productivity law 
enforcement and corrections 
the state attorney general estimated that crime cost californians 
6 billion in 1985 california has the nations second highest 
teenage pregnancy rate of 14 percent and highest teen abortion 
rate 69 percent 
susie lange a state education department representative to the 
panel said even task force members were skeptical about its 
usefulness until the divergent group agreed on a definition of 
selfesteem 
were not talking about selfishness lange said if you 
hate yourself youre going to have real trouble being helpful to 
anyone else if you reduce it to a much more simple understanding of 
selfesteem then you can get over that initial hurdle

former president leonid i brezhnevs soninlaw 
has been convicted of bribery but his lawyer expressed satisfaction 
with the 12year sentence saying the soviet union is on the way 
toward being a society based on law 
the nearly fourmonth trial of yuri churbanov and eight of his 
cronies focused on sensational allegations of wrongdoing stretching 
all the way to the kremlins former first family 
the tribunal on friday found churbanov guilty of taking nearly 
145000 in bribes but dismissed some charges spared him the 
firing squad and sentenced him to 12 years in a labor camp 
churbanov 52 declined to talk to reporters afterward but his 
lawyer andrei makarov expressed satisfaction with the decision 
you can agree or disagree with the sentence but in substance 
the throwing out of most of the charges leveled by the prosecutors 
is indisputable the lawyer told reporters 
makarov said the courts decision showed that the soviet union is 
on the way to a society based on law in an apparent reference to 
trials under dictator josef stalin in which trumpedup charges were 
used to get rid of real or perceived enemies makarov told reporters 
this case proved that politics no longer has a place in the soviet 
courtroom 
the trial rejected attempts to create a political trial from a 
criminal case and to replace evidence with hullaboo around the case 
and attempts artificially to fire up public opinion makarov said 
churbanov served as first deputy soviet interior minister which 
put him in the ranks of the few officials in charge of the nations 
police for two years before brezhnev died in 1982 he continued in 
the job until 1984 and was arrested in january 1987 
under president mikhail s gorbachev brezhnev has been harshly 
criticized for fostering corruption and economic and cultural 
stagnation during his 18year rule on thursday the kremlin took 
another swipe at brezhnev by ordering that a plaque be removed from 
his former home and that factories and schools be stripped of his 
name 
churbanov married brezhnevs daughter galina in 1971 and was 
accused of using his family ties to advance his career and extort 
bribes 
churbanov originally faced the death penalty on charges he 
accepted bribes of more than 11 million 
but the military tribunal threw out some of the charges and 
reduced the amount of bribes churbanov was accused of taking to 
about 145000 the court also convicted churbanov of siphoning more 
than 16000 in interior ministry funds to construction of a cellar 
in his summer home 
prosecutors had recommended a 15year sentence 
churbanov had pleaded guilty to abusing his office but innocent 
to bribetaking in his one day of testimony he said he kept a 
briefcase handed to him stuffed with 160000 because he felt 
awkward about returning it 
churbanovs eight codefendants were police officials from the 
central asian republic of uzbekistan the focus of many reports of 
rampant corruption 
six of the codefendants were sentenced to labor camp terms 
ranging from eight to 10 years

mayor edward i koch said he thought it was 
necessary to punish drexel burnham lambert inc after it pleaded 
guilty to securities fraud charges so the city barred the firm from 
comanaging a 500 million bond sale 
the announcement came friday one day after a federal judge in 
boston stalled a drexelfinanced 970 million takeover effort of 
prime computer inc because of what he called the disturbing 
implications of a firm facing a 650 million criminal penalty acting 
as investment banker for such a huge debtladen deal 
koch told reporters at city hall that when a financial firm 
that we do business with has been convicted because of financial 
dealings we ought to take some kind of action to show displeasure 
and have them lose some money by being omitted from dealings with 
the city on a onetime basis 
after that theyre back in contention like anybody else 
koch said weve done it before and were doing it now 
drexel was to have been one of 16 participants in the new york 
city bond sale tentatively scheduled for february 
the suspension is expected to cost drexel about 300000 in fees 
and commissions but the impact could be greater if other cities 
follow new yorks example 
drexel spokesman steven s anreder called the action a 
temporary suspension that was in keeping with city policy and 
said there was no indication other cities would follow suit 
drexel received the first blow to its business in the wake of its 
plea bargain on thursday when us district judge a david mazzone 
in boston said the 650 million proposed settlement of fraud charges 
raised questions about drexels financial condition and its ability 
to assist mai basic four incs bid for prime 
anreder said that drexel was confident it could allay mazzones 
concerns 
last week drexel agreed to plead guilty to six counts of mail 
wire and securities fraud to avoid a more serious indictment for 
racketeering stemming from its relationship with the now imprisoned 
financier ivan boesky 
the company had said it had already lost 15 billion in business 
and spent 175 million because of investigations by the securities 
and exchange commission and the us attorneys office

maria desillers says a nightmare is behind her now 
that the state has dropped its criminal investigation into her 
alleged misuse of almost 700000 donated for her late sons liver 
transplants 
the state looked at charity solicitation statutes as well as 
grand theft and embezzlement laws and decided ms desillers could 
not be prosecuted said dade county state attorney janet reno 
we cant prove that when she solicited the funds she intended 
to defraud anyone ms reno said and she and her exhusband are 
the legal heirs 
ms desillers son ronnie died last year at childrens hospital 
of pittsburgh while awaiting a fourth liver transplant his 
condition and news that money collected for him was stolen from his 
school quickly put the 7yearold into the national spotlight 
but controversy ensued as allegations surfaced that ms desillers 
had spent the money collected on behalf of her son for jewelry 
clothes and a 1985 bmw car as well as 79000 in cash and payments 
directly to herself according to prosecutors 
i might have made mistakes nobodys perfect ms desillers 
said friday but its the end of a nightmare 
ms reno said that the case shows that new laws are needed to 
prevent misuse of such donations 
the laws just simply dont cover the situation that occurred 
here said ms reno who has urged for tough criminal penalties 
and better procedures for cases like that of ronnie desillers 
ms desillers attorney roy black welcomed the decision saying 
there had never been any evidence that ms desillers had tried to 
defraud contributors to her sons fund 
thats the end of the matter black said now you wont 
hear from maria desillers for a while 
the prosecutors closing memo showed that ms desillers withdrew 
322000 of the funds between ronnies death in april 1987 and march 
1988 
along with the 79000 in payments to herself ms desillers 
spent 35500 on cash and payments to friends 19000 on 
autorelated payments 3100 on a mobile telephone 10800 on 
jewelry 8900 on clothes 5500 on furniture and 5100 on her 
apartment rent the memo said 
the memo also said she made 42700 in payments on behalf of the 
ronnie desillers foundation 43400 to sick children or their 
families 25000 in legal fees and various other expenses 
after ronnie died ms desillers refused to pay childrens 
hospital some of its bill and her alleged misuse of the funds 
became public 
in subsequent civil actions she was forced to relinquish many of 
the items bought with the funds including the car and pay the bulk 
of the hospital bill

the soviet union announced today its troops will 
join a ceasefire in afghanistan on new years day but usbacked 
rebels vowed to keep fighting 
president mikhail s gorbachev had called for the truce in an 
address to the united nations but the united states rejected it 
on friday alexander bessmertnykh a first deputy soviet foreign 
minister met us ambassador jack matlock in moscow to make another 
push for us support 
the hope was expressed that the american side will look with 
utmost attention at the new opportunities opening for afghan 
settlement the official tass news agency said of the meeting 
tass said bessmertnkh also made the pitch to the ambassador from 
pakistan which with the help of the united states supplies arms to 
rebels fighting afghanistans marxist government 
afghan president najib on friday offered the anticommunist 
guerrillas a truce beginning jan 1 and the soviet foreign ministry 
said today in a statement carried by tass that moscows troops will 
follow suit 
the soviet union fully supports this peace move of the afghan 
leadership and is stating for its part that all units of soviet 
troops that still remain in afghanistan will cease fire from the 
same date the foreign ministry said 
a rebel spokesman in islamabad pakistan dismissed the truce 
we did not start our fight because he asked us to said 
masood khalili and we wont stop because he asked us to 
the statement did not make clear how long soviet troops would 
hold their fire if the rebels dont stop shooting najib however 
said moslem insurgents will be given four days to accept the truce 
if they refuse government troops will start shooting again he said 
khalili belongs to the jamiateislami guerrilla group whose 
leader burhanuddin rabbani met in december with soviet deputy 
foreign minister yuli vorontsov 
the usbacked guerrillas have been fighting kabuls troops for 
10 years in december 1979 soviet troops marched into afghanistan 
to bolster their allies 
the soviet foreign ministry said both sides should stop aiding 
their allies in the war 
addressing specifically the united states the soviet side 
again reaffirms its readiness on the basis of reciprocity to 
discontinue all supply of arms to the warring sides in afghanistan 
from jan 1 the statement said 
secretary of state george p shultz has rejected the proposal 
noting that the soviets rejected prior us offers for mutual 
cessation of outside aid he said the rebels were justified in 
trying to seize territory as the soviets withdraw because the 
people of afghanistan broadly speaking do not accept the fact that 
the puppet regime is entitled to hold certain areas of that 
country 
a senior western diplomat said the soviets poured a huge amount 
of military supplies into afghanistan in preparation for the new 
years aid cutoff and ceasefire 
the sevenparty afghan guerrilla alliance whose headquarters are 
in pakistan rejected a ceasefire when gorbachev offered it dec 7 
in new york 
najib also declared a ceasefire that began jan 15 1987 but 
the insurgents ignored it and fighting continued 
on may 15 the soviet union began withdrawing its estimated 
100000 soldiers from afghanistan under a unbrokered agreement 
half of the soviet troops have left the country and the remaining 
half are to pull out by feb 15 
but soviet officials say they have suspended their troop 
withdrawal temporarily because of continuing us and pakistani aid 
to the rebels

whats expected to be the last edition of the miami 
news rolled off the presses this morning after no lastminute deals 
were made to keep the citys oldest daily newspaper alive 
its over said howard kleinberg the news editor and an 
employee for 38 years i think we gave it a good effort 
farewell miami said the banner headline and that was the 
champagne toast led by publisher david kraslow as corks were popped 
in the newsroom when the lastedition copies were distributed to 
dozens of staffers who gathered for the end shortly after 7 am 
the only apparent way to give the news a reprieve would be a us 
justice department injunction the department hadnt sought such an 
injunction but the newspaper in a story on its own situation 
quoted spokesman mark sheehan as saying anything we can do today 
we can do tomorrow 
the afternoon daily publishes its saturday editions in the 
morning and has no sunday edition kraslow said nearly twothirds of 
the newsroom staff had new jobs or other commitments to go to next 
week the newsroom staff numbered a little more than 100 in the 
papers final weeks 
the owner of the news cox enterprises of atlanta announced in 
october that the afternoon newspaper would be closed dec 31 if it 
was not sold cox cited finacial and circulation losses 
a cox official friday defended efforts to sell the 92yearold 
paper 
we sent out prospecti to 50 people said david easterly who 
heads atlantabased coxs newspaper division we made 
presentations to 34 
easterly said friday there was no deal made with a chicago 
newspaper consultant representing a group of investors 
us district judge stanley marcus on friday also denied a 
request for a preliminary injunction to keep the paper open 
meanwhile a justice department investigation was under way 
focusing on a joint operating agreement since 1966 between cox and 
knightridder inc owner of the miami herald in which profits were 
shared even if the news shut down 
that amendment would make it financially beneficial to both 
parties if the news goes out of business wrote charles f rule 
head of the antitrust division therefore the investigation deals 
not only with how vigorous a search was made for potential buyers by 
cox but how seriously negotiations were conducted once a potential 
buyer was found 
a conclusion that serious efforts by cox would have resulted in 
the sale of the miami news could provide the basis for an antitrust 
suit his memo said 
press releases are not law easterly said what theyve 
said is theyre continuing to look into it he said he had no 
objection to that 
knightridder officials said they were going over rules memo and 
had no immediate comment 
a lastditch federal lawsuit to keep the paper open failed friday 
when marcus rejected arguments from community newspapers who claim 
closing the news will result in a monopoly for the herald the 
plaintiffs also include readers and distributors of the news 
the question is whether the government has the power to compel 
a newspaper to publish if it wishes to be silent marcus said 
during a twohour hearing the judge also questioned whether the 
plaintiffs could show they stood to lose because of the papers 
closing 
im disappointed the judge didnt see our point said michael 
miller editor of the community newspapers its going to be a 
pretty sad day come tomorrow 
since the joint operating agreement began the news circulation 
has dropped from 112000 to 48000 under the agreement the morning 
herald provides printing circulation advertising and promotion 
services for the news

sudanese ended a bloody fourday general 
strike and returned to work today after the government canceled 
steep price increases up to four people were reported killed during 
the unrest 
the sudanese workers trade union federation with about 2 
million members ordered the return to work late friday 
the federation had demanded revocation of price increases of up 
to 500 percent and a 15 percent acrosstheboard sales tax imposed 
monday it also demanded that salary increases of 50 percent to 300 
percent decreed last week for public and privatesector employees 
be retroactive to july 1 instead of dec 1 as the government wanted 
in an emergency session thursday prime minister sadek mahdis 
cabinet met the demands but the demonstrations and strike continued 
and spilled into friday 
western military and diplomatic sources cited reports of up to 
four dead and more than 26 wounded the most serious incident was an 
unexplained shooting in which witnesses said four men fired 
submachine guns from a roof into a protesting crowd 
no arrests were reported 
the focus of the unrest turned to mahdis failure to endorse a 
tentative peace accord that the democratic unionist party a junior 
partner in the coalition cabinet signed with southern rebels nov 
16 
the agreement called for a constitutional peace conference to be 
convened dec 31 with an immediate ceasefire in the 5yearold 
civil war and suspension of islamic law 
the prime minister refused to bring the accord before the cabinet 
or the parliament fearing it would lead another coalition partner 
the fundamentalist national islamic front to quit the government 
the front opposes any tampering with islamic law which is 
opposed by many of the rebels 
electricity water and air and land transportation services were 
down during the general strike markets were empty and bread and 
vegetables disappeared both state television and radio were off the 
air and telephone and telex communications were cut 
as the dusty streets of the capital slowly returned to normal 
signs of the turmoil remained glass shards from smashed car 
windshields pieces of cement blocks and blackened remains of burned 
tires 
khartoum international airport reopened friday telex lines were 
restored this morning but international telephone operators in 
cairo egypt said telephone lines were still down 
a western military source said the army rejected a request by 
elmahdi that army troops join riot police in quelling the 
disturbances 
there are many angry and frustrated generals in the army 
because the constitutional peace conference has not been held as 
scheduled the military source said even in the heat of the 
demonstrations they refused to intervene 
besides khartoum rioting and the general strike hit other 
provincial centers including port sudan gedaref kassala wad 
medani and atbara

communist china and the united states are 
beginning a second decade of diplomatic relations in which exchanges 
in every field have become routine but cultural and ideological 
differences remain acute 
it was jan 1 1979 that washington switched its recognition 
from the nationalist chinese in exile on taiwan to the communists in 
beijing 
the result has been an avalanche of exchanges from dance to 
trade to military consultations 
chinese now line up outside the us embassy visa office and 
inside the kentucky fried chicken on tiananmen square dramatizing 
the extent to which the united states more than any other country 
has come to represent the outside world 
taxi drivers are more likely to be playing tapes of madonna than 
peking opera high officials are rumored to be fans of the american 
television show hunter shown thursday nights on chinese 
television 
tens of thousands of chinese students have caught english 
fever and most try to cultivate american accents 
the united states has an influence not matched by any other 
country said zi zhongyun director of the institute of american 
studies at chinas academy of social sciences 
the fascination runs both ways 
more than 300000 american tourists came to china in 1988 along 
with one high school marching band two alaska musk oxen dozens of 
tradehungry governors and mayors and more than 100 santa clauses 
from an american volunteer group 
but the terms of the relationship are changing even as the united 
states gains in george bush a president who chinese hope will 
understand them better than his predecessors bush was us liaison 
officer in china in 1974 and 1975 
china is rapidly mending its nearly 30yearold quarrel with the 
soviets ending any us thoughts of playing one communist power 
against the other 
chineseus disputes over taiwan human rights and trade reveal 
a deep residue of cultural misunderstanding and nationalistic 
resentment 
on the us side there is what i would call the superpower 
mentality ms zi said the united states always thinks it is 
the final judge of what is right and what is wrong 
she and other chinese scholars say most americans dont 
understand china 
but whatever ill feelings linger are slight compared to the 
mutual hostility before president richard nixons visit to china in 
1972 ms zi said china and the united states had fought in the 
korean war and most chinese accepted chairman mao tsetungs 
appraisal of the united states as an imperialist threat 
mutual fear of the soviet union brought the former enemies 
together 
mao didnt want to have two enemies at once so he decided that 
the soviets were more dangerous and that relations should be 
improved with the americans said ms zi 
the united states wanted to discourage healing of the 
chinesesoviet rift and use better relations with china to press 
moscow to open detente 
under president mikhail gorbachev however the soviet union has 
tempered its aggressive stance and increased friendly exchanges with 
both washington and beijing 
the first chinesesoviet summit since 1959 is likely to take 
place in 1989 
us ambassador winston lord said improved chinesesoviet 
relations are no threat to the united states 
they have racial and historical tensions and geopolitical 
competition in asia and elsewhere lord said at best their 
relationship is going to be an ambivalent one 
he and ms zi said china and the united states still need one 
another even without any threat from the soviets 
the chinese want us technology investment and cooperation in 
keeping peace in asia so china can focus on development not defense 
washington has a stake in helping china become more modern and 
moderate 
the greater role the united states plays in chinas 
modernization the easier it will be for the united states to 
exert its influence in the fastgrowing asiapacific region ms 
zi said 
certain problems can be expected to persist 
china wants the united states to end military sales to the 
nationalists on taiwan and promote reunification with the mainland 
lord said the united states wont help or hinder reunification 
trade also is a perennial problem with each side accusing the 
other of protectionism 
human rights issues have aroused the greatest emotion 
washington has criticized chinas violent suppression of 
independence protests in tibet and has withheld dues from the united 
nations that it says would support chinas strict birth control 
policies including reported forced abortions 
mei renyi an associate professor at beijing university of 
foreign studies said such quarrels illustrate the limits of 
uschinese ties 
we are friends not allies he said our systems are 
different our ideologies are different our expectations should be 
realistic

americans and chinese have carried out exchanges 
in hundreds of fields over the past decade from alligator research 
to choreography here are a few examples 
trade twoway trade totaled 104 billion in 1987 with a us 
deficit according to us figures chinese figures say the total 
was 78 billion with a chinese deficit the discrepancy arises from 
goods that pass through third countries the united states chinas 
secondlargest trade partner after japan buys mainly clothing and 
textiles and sells mainly machinery 
investment us businesses have set up more than 500 joint 
ventures with committed investment of about 325 billion the 
largest is the occidental petroleum corps antaibo coal mine in 
northcentral china china has set up more than 140 enterprises in 
the united states most of them traderelated 
education more than 56000 chinese students and scholars have 
gone to the united states for varying periods over the past decade 
the us embassy estimates more than 1000 americans are studying in 
china 
culture hundreds of exchanges have occurred affecting millions 
of people for example a chinese government loan of hundreds of 
imperial treasures in 1987 was expected to draw more than 1 million 
viewers in seattle and colombus ohio 
thousands of chinese saw the massive abstract canvases of 
american artist frederick j brown in a show at the national museum

advocates of the canadaus free trade agreement 
taking effect sunday believe the pact will bring major benefits and 
eventual changes to both countries 
but canadian critics who almost succeeded in scuttling the deal 
remain just as convinced that arguments over it will last as long as 
the agreement 
squabbling over the agreement continued as the senate on friday 
passed the legislation removing the last remaining trade barriers 
between the two nations the pact was approved by the house of 
commons on dec 24 
prime minister brian mulroney believes the pact ardently 
supported by canadian business looking to the larger export market 
will produce a net increase of about 250000 jobs in canada in the 
next 10 years 
but it also will bring restructuring in some industries and plant 
closings proof to the agreements critics that the need to compete 
will force canada to abandon its traditions of social protection for 
its people 
how is it international trade minister john c crosbie was asked 
by a legislative opponent that canada and the united states are 
still arguing about trade after completing such a landmark deal 
crosbie replied with a touch of irritation that the agreement 
was never intended to eradicate all disputes between the two 
nations it just means we will have a better way of defending 
ourselves in the future he said 
the agreement signed by mulroney and president reagan on jan 2 
1988 phases out all remaining tariffs between canada and the united 
states over a 10year period starting sunday 
the two countries already form the worlds strongest bilateral 
trade relationship about 150 billion each year of which 80 
percent already was tarifffree before the agreement 
the trade pact also frees up investment barriers and trade in 
energy and services and creates canadianus panels to settle 
disputes it dismantles special protections that had been provided 
for such areas as the us sugar industry canadian brewers and 
canadian cultural industries 
supporters of the agreement believe that moving toward a north 
american trade zone of more than 275 million people will prove an 
important counterpoint to the european economic communitys 1992 
target for a unified market 
canadian critics failed to stop mulroney from winning his second 
consecutive majority government in nov 21 elections which gave him 
the madate to go ahead with the agreement but they still fear that 
canadas 26 million people could be overwhelmed by the nearly 10 
times larger american market 
if the process of rationalization and harmonization takes place 
at a relatively quick pace then it may be too late to reverse it 
said mel hurtig publisher of the canadian encyclopedia and one 
of the agreements most ardent opponents 
supporters say the criticism will die down as benefits become 
clear just as those who spoke against the auto pact between canada 
and the united states in 1965 watched it bring increased prosperity 
the auto agreement which remains in place under the free trade 
agreement helped boost the canadian automotive industry to its 
current level of employment more than 130000 people 
the canadian government has been giving special training to 
customs agents on handling any changes that take place under the new 
agreement although little will be visible to the typical traveler 
or consumer 
we doubt very much the average consumer will notice very much 
in january or even over the next decade bob best policy adviser 
to the consumers association of canada told the toronto star daily 
among the few items whose tariffs will be lifted immediately are 
yeast calculators furs motorcycles skates and telephones 
tariffs on most items covered by the agreement generally higher in 
canada than in the united states are to be reduced in stages over 
five or 10 years 
the announcement by gillette co just after the election that it 
was closing two canadian plants employing 600 people produced a 
firestorm of criticism although the company denied the changes were 
related to the trade pact 
the canadian government has said current retraining programs are 
adequate to handle displaced workers 
ross johnson the canadian who rose to prominence as the head of 
rjr nabisco inc is one of the supporters of the pact 
well have fewer and bigger plants he said in an interview 
in the january issue of report on business published by torontos 
globe and mail daily 
youve got to take risks or you dont get anywhere he said 
and after all free trade is not armaggedon

an associated press writer recently returned to 
new york from frankfurt via london on pan am flight 103 here is her 
report on the new security precautions 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the pan am checkin counter was cordoned off with 
rope a west german officer in khaki and green stood by cradling a 
submachine gun next to him a colleague sported a sidearm 
none of the other counters at the frankfurt airport resembled 
battle stations the previous week boarding an austrian airlines 
flight from the same airport for salzburg i encountered no armed 
officers no itembyitem inspection of my hand luggage 
but this flight thursday was special it was pan am 103 
originating in frankfurt with a brief stop in london then on to 
john f kennedy international airport in new york eight days 
earlier flight 103 made it only as far as lockerbie scotland 
where it exploded in the air killing all 259 aboard and an 
estimated 11 persons on the ground and the previous day 
authorities announced that they had concluded that the explosion was 
the work of a bomber 
just to reach the frankfurt checkin counter i had to get past 
two airline security guards backed up on their left by the german 
police officers and on their right by three other unidentifiable 
observers 
did you pack your own luggage 
yes 
do you have any gifts or packages whose contents are unknown to 
you 
no 
where are you going where have you been 
as i tried to check in it was discovered that a checked bag had 
been mistakenly sent from munich only to frankfurt instead of 
through to new york this was enough out of the ordinary to cause 
someone wearing an officiallooking plastic badge to lean over the 
clerks shoulder and read about my reservations 
my hand luggage was gone through out came my house shoes the 
white ski hat then the cosmetic kit that everything falls from as 
soon as the zipper is touched 
the day had only just begun we went through the usual 
walkthrough metal detector and xray check as we entered the 
international boarding area along with a personal frisk with a 
handheld detector 
we were quizzed again at the boarding gate about what we were 
carrying and who had packed for us 
at londons heathrow airport the 26 of us continuing on flight 
103 to new york aboard a boeing 747 jumbo jet were walked in a group 
to a holding area with british security guards leading walking 
alongside and bringing up the rear 
at an xray machine guarding that area my giant handbag didnt 
pass muster out came the blue house shoes the slippery cosmetic 
kit this time my nail brush clattered out onto the counter it was 
decided the metal hooks of my apresski boots had sounded the alarm 
the guard who escorted me to the next boarding area seemed 
uncomfortable with questions about the extraordinary security 
lightning usually doesnt strike twice in the same place he 
said reassuringly 
five minutes after my handbag was searched item by item and a 
security guard had escorted me to the new area he english and a 
gentleman carrying my bag the bag was gone through again 
out came the blue house shoes this time my nasal spray was 
opened the pages of my paperback copy of prince of tides were 
riffled my datebook was examined and i had to show the guard how 
to work the spring on my leather coin purse 
finally we boarded as we began to lift off i opened my book 
and wondered how long it would take us to be over lockerbie 
authorities there were still identifying the bodies and collecting 
the wreckage of clipper maid of the seas that other flight 103 
blown out of the sky dec 21 by a bomb apparently brought aboard in 
luggage

ten years ago returnees from the 
khmer rouge killing fields emaciated diseased dressed in black 
scoured the streets for scraps of food phnom penh was a virtual 
ghost city and in its suburbs one stumbled across bones of victims 
from the reign of terror 
today the citys population approaches 1 million markets brim 
with domestic produce from record harvests and imports shipped up 
from singapore on the mekong express private restaurants thrive 
and business ventures are being launched with japanese and overseas 
chinese investors 
but despite evident progress the phnom penh government has yet 
to answer its most crucial question can it prevent a second victory 
by the khmer rouge without the vietnamese military shield it has 
enjoyed over the past decade 
people are asking themselves is this the end of the khmer 
rouge or are we in the eye of the hurricane said one western 
relief official with several years experience in cambodia 
as the internationally shunned prohanoi government prepares to 
mark its 10th anniversary jan 7 leaders express confidence that a 
peoples war in the countryside can keep the tough guerrillas at 
bay even if ongoing negotiations for a political solution fail 
vietnamese assistance is considered very important but 
final success depends on the cambodian people prime minister hun 
sen told foreign reporters recently we still have another two 
years before a total vietnamese withdrawal which we think is 
reasonable to build our forces 
analysts say phnom penh would like to preserve the current 
peoples republic of kampuchea prk but invite participation by 
prince norodom sihanouk head of the threeparty guerrilla coalition 
that includes the khmer rouge the princes group and another 
noncommunist group the inclusion of the internationally 
prestigious prince phnom penh believes would bestow legitimacy on 
the government and undermine the khmer rouge 
but cambodian officials indicate phnom penh may gamble on being 
able to go it alone as hanoi moves to a promised total military 
pullout by 1990 
the prk has some grounds for optimism western aid officials here 
say cambodia which in 1979 barely warded off famine thanks to a 
major international relief effort is approaching selfsufficiency 
in food with an annual production of 2 million tons of rice and 
supplementary crops 
vietnamese ambassador ngo dien says not a single village in 
cambodia has fallen under full guerrilla control and that only about 
5 percent are under partial influence of the khmer rouge or their 
allies 
in 1979 when the khmer rouge fell to a vietnamese invasion 
force cambodia had fewer than 50 doctors and the education system 
had been obliterated the phnom penh government says its schools now 
are attended by more than 2 million and that health care although 
often woefully inadequate extends to the grass roots 
cambodia is still one of the worlds poorest nations but the 
economy appears to have been spurred by what one soviet diplomat 
calls silent perestroika a reference to moscows efforts to 
restructure its economy away from dogmatic marxism phnom penh has 
virtually abandoned all attempts to communalize farming and is 
debating the restoration of private land ownership taxes on 
mushrooming private businesses and trade are low 
for the past year and a half the battlefields have been 
relatively quiet and security has improved for the prk side the 
khmer rouge operate in small groups strike in remote areas and in 
1988 killed about 100 mostly lowerranking government officials 
according to phnom penh sources 
vietnam and phnom penh say this low level of activity mirrors the 
weakness of the guerrillas but some western analysts believe it 
means the resistance is focusing on political organization and 
stockpiling weapons for a showdown 
from most accounts the phnom penh army said by western 
diplomats to number about 44000 troops has proved a lackluster 
fighting force 
im worried disciplined armies win wars and the only 
disciplined ones around are the khmer rouge and the withdrawing 
vietnamese said a western aid official 
vietnam says it has only 50000 troops left in cambodia from a 
high of 200000 the khmer rouge strength is estimated at 30000 to 
40000 while the noncommunist groups field about 27000 fighters 
in addition to combatting the guerrillas the government is 
threatened by problems that helped bring the khmer rouge to power in 
1975 corruption inefficiency and a widening gap between prospering 
phnom penh and the impoverished countryside 
phnom penh officials say they are aware of the problems 
some decisionmaking has been decentralized and emphasis 
reportedly placed on a 50000member militia whose members would 
defend their own villages against the khmer rouge over the past 18 
months the government has tripled the price at which it buys rice 
from farmers both improving their lot and making it harder for the 
guerrillas to purchase food in the countryside 
the murderous record of the khmer rouge and evidence that they 
remain brutal extremists plays into the hands of the government as 
does the fact that the guerrillas will lose their key propaganda 
thrust if hanoi leaves cambodia a withdrawal of the vietnamese may 
force the army to get tougher 
negotiations and debates are continuing in beijing bangkok 
paris moscow and jakarta that could decide the future of cambodias 
8 million people 
those hoping for a peaceful solution see some welcome signs 
including an apparent desire for normal ties between china and the 
soviet union china has recently indicated it would reduce its 
supply of weapons to the guerrillas as the vietnamese withdrew 
moscow the major arms supplier to vietnam and phnom penh has 
repeatedly said it wants to see a resolution 
the cambodian conflict cited as the chief stumbling block for 
normalized ties will come up for discussion in 1989 at the summit 
between moscow and beijing

fighting broke out between police and 
african students when authorities came to arrest a ghana student 
today in connection with a dec 26 brawl with chinese students 
sources said 
african student sources said there were injuries among both 
students and police when officers arrived at an isolated guest house 
outside nanking where the students were being kept following a wave 
of racial violence the extent of the injuries was not known 
the official xinhua news agency said police arrested alex dzabaku 
dosoo of ghana a student at hehai university for an attack on 
university employee zhang jitao 
xinhua said three other foreign students presumably african had 
been summoned for interrogation in connection with the dec 26 fight 
in which 11 chinese and two africans were injured 
zhang the only person to sustain serious injuries in the fight 
remains in intensive care according to sources in nanking 
the fight was followed by two days of violent and often racist 
demonstrations in which thousands of chinese youths destroyed 
property in the african students dormitory and marched through the 
streets chanting such slogans as beat the black devils 
the brawl at nankings hehai university began when the african 
students tried to bring chinese women to a school dance 
meanwhile african students in the eastern city of hangzhou 
locked themselves in their dormitory to protest allegations they 
were carriers of aids students said officials denied the 
allegations 
kong xiangyou vice president of zhejiang agriculture university 
said in a telephone interview it also was untrue that the africans 
were not being allowed to leave hangzhou he urged the africans to 
return to classes 
the africans locked themselves in their dormitory on monday after 
learning a university switchboard operator was telling incoming 
callers the africans were infected with the deadly disease 
vincent ongas of kenya told the associated press today that the 
students would not end their boycott of classes until the university 
promised it would stop spreading propaganda against us 
in nanking about 140 african students were still being kept in 
isolation a week after a fight between africans and chinese sparked 
large antiafrican demonstrations 
chinese authorities have confined them to a guest house about 50 
miles outside the city but have refused to connect phone calls to 
them or let foreign reporters speak to them 
liang ruiju president of nankings hehai university said today 
that the africans had established an independent kingdom at the 
guest house 
the action of the students has gone completely beyond the 
limits of the law he said 
there are an estimated 1500 africans from 40 nations studying at 
chinese universities china has long provided scholarships for 
africans in a show of solidarity with developing african states but 
social tensions which africans attribute to ingrained racial 
prejudices against blacks have on occasion flared into violence 
in hangzhou about 140 miles southeast of nanking the africans 
say they are victims of pervasive discrimination against black 
africans 
they are trying to isolate us completely ongas said in 
explaining why university officials were allegedly accusing them of 
having aids 
one african student at the school was sent home in november after 
testing positive for aids but all other africans there tested 
negative martin ayuk of cameroon said friday 
ongas said 56 africans were participating in the boycott

ringing in the new year are dozens of changes 
in federal laws and regulations many of them aimed at quenching 
americans thirst for security and a few that will make life a 
little more expensive 
among the most significant of the jan 1 changes are a vast 
expansion of medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses faster 
pension fund vesting that will benefit millions particularly women 
and tax changes reducing the governments subsidizing of purchases 
on credit 
others occurring slightly before the end of 1988 or scheduled 
early in 1989 include a ban on lie detector tests by private 
employers 60 days advance notice of plant closings and large 
layoffs and a new law prohibiting landlords from discriminating 
against the handicapped and families with children 
a few of the changes are a little more esoteric but their impact 
eventually may be felt by the entire population 
for example environmental protection agency regulations 
implementing the 46nation ozone treaty take effect jan 1 the 
regulations dont require chemical companies to actually do anything 
until next july but then they must cut their production of 
chloroflourocarbon or cfc compounds by an estiamted 20 percent back 
to 1986 levels 
the treaty is aimed at halting the depletion of the ozone layer 
15 to 25 miles up protecting the earths surface from ultraviolet 
rays cfc compounds also contribute to the greenhouse effect 
that is warming the planet 
as a result of the regulations consumers may notice fewer 
plastic food containers from fastfood outlets thicker insulating 
panels and possibly even slightly harder seat cushions 
the biggest of the immediate changes is the jan 1 expansion of 
medicare coverage for 32 million medicare beneficiaries to include 
catastrophic health care costs 
prior to passage of the measure last summer by congress the 
first major expansion of medicare in its 22year history the 
program paid full hospital bills for no more than 59 days a year 
with the changes going into effect sunday the beneficiary still 
will have to pay the firstday deductible of 560 but that charge 
will be assessed no more than once a year no matter how many times 
the patient has to be hospitalized the other 364 days are fully 
paid 
that fundamental change in the hospital benefit was the 
cornerstone of the medicare expansion set in motion by president 
reagan in his 1986 state of the union message 
let us remove a financial specter facing our older ameicans 
the fear of an illness so expensive that it can result in having to 
make an intolerable choice between bankruptcy and death he said 
then 
medicare enrollees will pay for the new benefits through a flat 
increase in the premium deducted from their monthly social security 
checks and an additional sliding scale premium for approximately 40 
percent of the elderly who pay federal income tax 
the flat increase will be 4 a month effective immediately 
climbing to 1020 monthly in 1993 the sliding scale premium is 
projected to rise from a maximum of 15 percent of regular income tax 
liability in 1989 to about 28 percent in 1993 
many of the jan 1 changes grow out of the 1986 tax reform act 
the biggest new benefit from that law going into effect sunday is 
faster vesting in pension plans 
the maximum waiting period for employees to become fully invested 
in a pension is being cut in half from 10 years to five years 
however employers can adopt an option that denies full vesting 
until seven years to do so they have to offer 20 percent vesting 
after three years and an additional 20 percent vesting annually 
until the seventh year when it reaches 100 percent 
the employee benefit research institute estimates that the 
pension changes will provide a retirement stake to 2 million more 
workers a year 
well especially see more women being vested than in the past 
because they tend to be in the workforce or with the same employer 
for shorter periods said stephanie poe a spokeswoman for the 
institute 
another tax change is that only 20 percent of personal interest 
payments on everything from car and student loans to credit card 
charges will be deductible in 1989 compared with 40 percent last 
year 
and while the government is now raising tax brackets exemptions 
and standard deductions to keep costofliving raises from bumping 
people into higher brackets it also is taking more social security 
taxes 
the 751 percent social security tax took a maximum 3380 out of 
employee paychecks in 1988 this year the maximum amount of income 
subject to the tax rises from 45000 to 48000 raising the 
maximum social security tax that can be collected from an individual 
employee to 3605 
the latest change came about just last thursday when the federal 
aviation administration ordered airlines effective jan 1 to 
either inspect by hand or xray all luggage checked aboard us 
airline flights from western europe and the middle east 
the new inspections prompted by the bombing of a pan am jet over 
scotland on dec 21 are expected to delay passenger checkins by 
about an hour 
other changes taking effect slightly before or after new years 
day include 
the use of polygraph or lie detector tests by private employers 
to screen job applicants was outlawed with some exceptions 
effective last tuesday the american civil liberties union estimates 
the law will effectively eliminate about 80 percent of the 2 million 
polygraph exams now administered annually 
a 47yearold ban on homework in five apparel trades is being 
removed on jan 8 unless unions which support the prohibitions win 
a court stay first affected are an estimated 50000 to 75000 
workers in fields such as mittens and gloves embroideries buttons 
and buckles handkerchiefs and some jewelry trades they will be 
able to work legally at home for the first time if their employers 
obtain a certficate from the labor department after pledging to 
abide by minimum wage and other federal labor standards 
a law requiring employers to provide 60 days advance notice of 
plant closings or layoffs affecting 50 or more people officially 
takes effect feb 4 however there are different interpretations on 
whether companies are required to have provided 60 days notice 
beforehand if they close a plant on that date the labor department 
advised in early december that to avoid potential liability they 
should 
regulations implementing a law passed by congress last summer 
forbidding landlords from discriminating against the handicapped or 
families with children take effect march 12 violators can be fined 
up to 10000 for a first offense 25000 for a second violation in 
a fiveyear period and 50000 for two or more violations within a 
sevenyear period

in the nations capital where the federal 
governments war on drugs is mapped out young washingtonians 
fighting over drugs pushed the number of murders in the city to a 
record one a day during 1988 
the district of columbias drug problems dramatize the two 
different washingtons the capitol the white house and other sites 
visited by millions of tourists each year and the squalid 
neighborhoods tucked away from the traditional seats of power 
there a more vicious power struggle is contested among teens drawn 
to the status and money that come from selling drugs 
in 1988 366 people had been killed in the nations capital as of 
dec 30 far surpassing the previous high total of 287 set in 1969 
police blame drugs particularly the arrival of crack cocaine for 
about 60 percent of the slayings as recently as 1986 drugrelated 
killings accounted for just onethird of the citys homicide total 
although final population and homicide figures have yet to be 
compared washington and detroit had the two highest percapita 
murder rates in america in 1988 meaning the nations capital could 
earn the dubious honor of being the nations murder capital as well 
the absence of organized crime in washington may be a factor in 
the citys murder rate officials say law enforcement officials say 
that in cities where organized crime factions control the drug 
market there are fewer drugrelated slayings 
what you have here is a lot of young entrepreneurs fighting 
among themselves for drug turf said police chief maurice t 
turner they are just working for themselves 
stemming the citys drug tide has become an increasingly tough 
battle for turner and his 3800 officers 
earlier this year police decided they will switch to 9mm 
semiautomatic handguns out of fear that weapons commonly found on 
the street were outclassing the standard 38caliber sixshot 
revolver officers have been carrying 
the new weapons which allow officers to fire an extra 10 shots 
before reloading were ordered after drug raids frequently resulted 
in the seizure of uzi submachine guns and other sophisticated 
weaponry surveying the weapons at a march news conference turner 
called the districts streets something out of the wild wild 
west officers will have their new guns by 1990 
and police have learned that simply arresting more drug suspects 
hasnt sated the citys appetite for narcotics a highlytouted 
antidrug program operation clean sweep has produced more than 
46000 arrests since its august 1986 inception 
however turner has complained that the program which sends 
swarms of officers through druginfested neighborhoods to make 
arrests has done little more than further clog the citys already 
overcrowded jail and court systems 
for each drug dealer arrested another springs forward according 
to turner 
a lot of these kids are high school dropouts with few skills 
turner said they can make up to a 1 million a year selling 
drugs what would you do 
jay b stephens us attorney for the district of columbia who 
can prosecute both local and federal crimes announced in december 
that he is assigning five senior prosecutors to work solely on 
drugrelated killings in the district 
turner also has called on city officials to spend more money on 
drug education prevention and treatment programs currently a 
threeweek wait is common for people wanting to enroll in the citys 
treatment centers 
as for the future police believe that as markets are more firmly 
established for crack a highlyaddictive cocaine derivative the 
murder rate will decrease 
this is one of the last major cities in this country to have an 
infusion of crack turner said when crack arrived in other 
cities like new york murder rates went up there too

after spending seven months reviewing 4200 
military properties a commission found 86 that could be closed for 
savings that amount to one fifth of a penny on every dollar spent by 
the pentagon 
there was no dollar goal for savings said hayden bryan the 
executive director of the 12member base closings panel which said 
its recommendations would save the government 693 million a year 
or 56 billion in current dollars over two decades 
much of the annual savings will take up to six years to be 
realized because of the cost of transferring personnel cleaning up 
and disposing of the facilities 
the base closings are expected to be approved by outgoing defense 
secretary frank c carlucci and congressional leaders say congress 
is not likely to stop them by law neither carlucci nor congress 
can reject specific closures without scrapping the whole package of 
recommendations 
cutting more bases than those recommended would be politically 
tough and likely would not make much more of a dent in the 300 
billion pentagon budget bryan said in a telephone interview last 
week 
however the commission report and the chairmen of the house and 
senate armed services committees both urged the next defense 
secretary former texas sen john tower to press for further base 
closings 
i would like to have seen more said sen sam nunn the 
georgia democrat who heads the senate armed services committee 
rep les aspin dwis nunns counterpart in the house called 
the list too modest and said it could have been a third again as 
large 
aspin said he thought that members of congress could not be 
persuaded to go along with another independent commission to order 
mass base closings for at least another decade 
instead he urged the incoming administration of george bush to 
use a 1985 law and submit as part of its annual defense budget a 
list of bases to be closed 
the reagan administration never made use of the law said an aide 
to aspin caspar w weinberger president reagans defense secretary 
until late 1987 submitted several lists of bases to be closed but 
could not reach an agreement with congress over procedure or which 
bases should be included 
i would hope that the next secretary of defense would take this 
job very very seriously theres is money to be saved said 
abraham ribicoff cochairman of the commission and a former 
democratic senator from connecticut 
the base closing commission that submitted its report to congress 
and the pentagon on thursday was appointed by carlucci on may 3 
1988 he has until jan 15 five days before he leaves office to 
approve or reject the whole package 
congress last oct 24 passed legislation designed to insulate the 
commission from the type of political pressure that has prevented 
the federal government from closing any major bases since 1977 to 
block the package both houses must pass resolutions against it the 
closings would begin january 1 1990 and be completed by september 
30 1995 
the government is not likely to repeat the commissions effort 
which was designed in part to break a logjam caused by passage of a 
law in 1977 giving congress the power to block closure of any base 
with 300 or more defense department civilian employees 
instead the commission urged the pentagon to take a close look 
at military bases with fewer than 100 employees or those used by 
reserve units or as military laboratories the commission did not 
have the time or the authority to review those facilities said 
bryan the executive director 
in the defense department the real savings come through the 
reduction of personnel said bryan and reducing the number of 
people in the armed force he said is a matter to be settled by 
congress and the administration the commission recommendations 
include transfers of personnel from closed facilities to those that 
will remain in operation altogether 145 facilities would be 
affected by closure partial closure or realignment 
we did not get into force structure bryan said 
for the commission the main guideline for closing a base was 
whether it served the national security ribicoff and panel 
cochairman jack edwards told reporters 
and if a base had a military value then we didnt bother it 
said edwards a former republican congressman from alabama 
the main criteria for determining whether it was economical to 
close a base that does not have military value was whether the 
government could save as much in six years shutting it as it would 
cost to relocate the employees clean up any toxic waste or 
munitions and dispose of the site 
the biggest constraint is the sixyear payback said 
edwards we found a lot of facilities that had 10year paybacks 
12year paybacks even 20year paybacks where we could have made 
some major savings over a longer period of time 
the commission had been expected to recommend the closing of fort 
monroe va commissioned in 1823 and now virtually abandoned but 
found that it would take too many years and too many dollars to 
clean up munitions there 
i personally went to fort monroe to look at it said edwards 
and i saw the moat and the old historic buildings 
i also saw what would amount to around 900 million in cleanup 
costs to get rid of the old shells that had been lobbed on that 
fort for the last 200 years or however long it was he said it 
was more like a 20year payback at best

the dream of overthrowing fidel castro remains alive 
for many cuban exiles here even as the communist leader sunday marks 
the 30th anniversary of his takeover of the island 90 miles south of 
florida 
but the strategies for dumping castro have been changing for all 
but a few diehards since the early years of invasion plots hatched 
in miami restaurants and guerrilla training in the everglades 
many cubans interviewed here in recent weeks see their role as 
lobbying us politicians to keep up the pressure on castro and if 
his communist rule ends helping reconstruct postcastro cuba 
without actually moving there 
the cuban community is more pluralistic today said jaime 
suchlicki cubanborn university of miami director of interamerican 
studies some people want relations some people dont some 
people want visas to travel there some people want no travel there 
its natural people have new lives here there are people who 
have grown up here another generation that was born here said 
suchlicki 
the nearly 1 million cubans who left their homeland comprise one 
of the most successful immigrant groups in us history some 
560000 have settled in the miamidade county area a third of the 
population 
they transformed miami into a hub for latin american commerce 
culture and politics cubans own an estimated 25000 businesses and 
are represented heavily in nearly every occupation miamis mayor 
was born in cuba as were the miami city manager and dade county 
manager and visitors to many sections of miami are more likely to 
hear spanish than english 
the issue of how to deal with castro still stirs emotion here 
although not like that of the late 1970s when some cuban exiles who 
established a dialogue with castro were labeled communist 
sympathizers and were subject to threats and even bombs 
andres nazario sargen is among the holdovers from early 1960s 
anticastro intrigues who stick to the hard line 
there is no change the struggle continues for cuba said 
nazario sargen head of alpha 66 a militant anticastro group 
active for nearly three decades castro has the power and the 
military force but cuba is its people and he has lost control of 
the cuban people 
in the years after the disastrous usassisted cuban exile 
invasion at the bay of pigs in 1961 and the 1962 sovietus 
agreement ending the cuban missile crisis us backing of exile 
militants ended but nazario sargen said his group which he says 
has as many as 2000 supporters includes members within cuba and 
keeps up military training here so it can help if armed rebellion 
breaks out 
but nelson diaz who came here in 1981 said he sees no benefit 
in continuing efforts to isolate castro with a trade embargo and a 
refusal to establish full diplomatic ties its the cuban people 
such as the 16yearold daughter he left behind who suffer most 
diaz said 
a gallup poll conducted in early 1988 for an independent policy 
research group indicated continued strong feelings against castro 
among cubanamericans with 96 percent of those polled saying castro 
is a bad thing for cuba but 41 percent said they would favor 
uscuban talks on normalizing relations with 47 percent opposed 
in the polls sampling which had an 8 percent to 9 percent margin 
of error 
in this decade influential cuban exiles led by miami businessman 
jorge mas canosa have built the cuban american national foundation 
which has fulltime lobbyists in washington and pushed there for 
radio marti since 1985 the us radio station has broadcast news 
and other programs into cuba 
many cubanamerican leaders hope that television marti will 
follow this year and they reject calls for improving cuba 
relations suggested last november by senate foreign relations 
committee chairman claiborne pell of rhode island after he visited 
castro 
establishing relations would help castro at a time when i think 
hes having a lot of problems internally said mayor raul martinez 
of the heavily latin dade county city of hialeah 
the cubans have rebuilt their lives in miami while building a 
generation of cubanamericans who see themselves as interested in 
cuba but with no aspirations for moving there 
the united states is my home my future said maria 
fernandez a 17yearold student i would love to go visit to see 
where my parents grew up but i cant see myself living there all 
my friends say the same thing we cant do anything to change what 
happened 30 years ago 
still the mayor of hialeah said cubanamericans have a 
responsibility to their homeland he compared to the support many 
americans jews give to israel 
you should never forget your roots martinez said i would 
not move there but i would go there to help reconstruct cuba

india and pakistan agreed saturday not 
to attack each others nuclear facilities a move hailed by their 
prime ministers as the first step toward easing their countries 
often hostile relations 
i think that in both our countries there is a groundswell for 
peace prime minister benazir bhutto of pakistan said an 
extremely important step has been taken toward improving relations 
between india and pakistan 
prime minister rajiv gandhi of india said he hoped this weeks 
talks with ms bhutto will help normalize things to come 
the two leaders who met for eight hours spoke to reporters 
after indian and pakistani officials signed the noattack pact the 
two nations also agreed to cultural exchanges and to end double 
taxation in bilateral trade 
a momentum for peace has begun ms bhutto said 
gandhi turning to ms bhutto noted the agreements were the 
first to be signed between india and pakistan since 1972 when 
your father and my mother signed an accord calling for a gradual 
normalization of relations 
ms bhutto is the daughter of zulfikar ali bhutto the former 
pakistani prime minister who was hanged in 1979 gandhi is the son 
of indian prime minister indira gandhi who was assassinated in 1984 
by her sikh bodyguards 
the meeting between ms bhutto and gandhi offers the hope that a 
new generation of leaders can ease the hostility between their 
nations which have gone to war three times since gaining 
independence in 1947 moslem pakistan and predominantly hindu india 
were created out of british colonial india and were partitioned 
along religious lines 
for a very long period the relations between india and 
pakistan were flawed said ms bhutto who took office dec 2 
after pakistans first free elections in 11 years 
the main sticking points between india and pakistan have included 
wariness of each others nuclear capabilities the dispute over 
their border in kashmir and violence by sikh extremists in the 
indian state of punjab 
india contends the sikh separatists blamed for the deaths of 
more than 2400 people in punjab in 1988 have obtained arms and 
training in pakistan pakistan has repeatedly denied the accusation 
the agreement not to attack each others nuclear installations 
was reached verbally in 1985 when pakistani president mohammed zia 
ulhaq visited new delhi the cultural and taxation agreements were 
drafted and initialed a year ago 
the nuclear agreement proclaiming a commitment to durable 
peace said pakistan and india will refrain from undertaking 
encouraging or participating indirectly or directly in any action 
aimed at causing the destruction or damage to any such nuclear 
installations or facilities in the other country 
the agreement covers nuclear power and research facilities as 
well as uranium enrichment plants and other nuclearrelated 
facilities india operates nuclear power plants and has also 
conducted a nuclear test while pakistan says its nuclear 
installations are for energy uses 
india along with foreign experts has long believed pakistan is 
working to develop nuclear weapons although pakistan has denied 
this 
the agreement says india and pakistan will notify each other 
annually on jan 1 of the exact location of their nuclear facilities 
both gandhi and ms bhutto have spoken in public this week of 
pakistans new era of democracy as offering hope for better 
relations 
the nov 16 elections that enabled ms bhutto to form a 
government were pakistans first multiparty elections since 1977 
when her father was prime minister zia an army general ousted 
prime minister bhutto in a coup later that year bhutto was 
subsequently hanged after being convicted of what he said was a 
trumpedup charge of conspiracy to murder a political opponent 
gandhi was the first indian prime minister to meet a pakistani 
leader in pakistan since 1960 when his grandfather prime minister 
jawaharlal nehru met president ayub khan

the 101st congress opens for business this week 
with majority democrats pledging cooperation with presidentelect 
bush while insisting he take the politically risky first steps on 
budget cuts and other contentious issues 
the first largely symbolic sign of accommodation will come 
shortly after lawmakers are sworn in on tuesday when incoming senate 
majority leader george mitchell of maine clears the way for 
committees to begin confirmation hearings on the republican cabinet 
appointees before inauguration day on jan 20 
the fireworks wont be long in erupting president reagan is 
expected to propose a congressional pay raise of as much as 45000 
annually a few days after congress formally convenes 
the partisan wrangling will come later as the democratic 
majorities in the house and senate and the new republican president 
tackle the deficit and legislation dealing with the pentagons 
purchasing system minimum wage clean air health care and ethics 
we both know there will be things on which we cant agree 
says jim wright dtexas embarking on his second term as speaker of 
the house 
one obvious candidate is the deficit bush spoke during his 
campaign of using a flexible freeze to reduce the red ink he 
favors increasing pentagon spending to keep it current with 
inflation and has said repeatedly he wont stand for higher taxes 
we look forward to receiving his plan says mitchell leader 
of a 55member democratic caucus in the senate 
wright presides over a huge democratic majority in the house 
260175 after a gain of two democratic seats in last novembers 
elections the partys leaders are waiting to see how bush converts 
his campaign rhetoric into legislative proposals 
we welcome his getting on the wagon on issues such as child 
care and the environment jabbed democratic whip tony coelho of 
california and we intend to see what he wants to do 
minority republicans already have signaled their intention to be 
more aggressive than in the past 
i believe we must clearly define our ethics rules and then we 
have to enforce them house gop leader bob michel of illinois said 
last month the record of enforcement in this house is a national 
disgrace he added in remarks widely viewed as directed at a probe 
into alleged ethical lapses on wrights part 
mitchell represents change for democrats in the senate their 
first new leader in a dozen years 
sen robert c byrd of west virginia stepped down from his 
leadership and becomes chairman of the senate appropriations 
committee in one of the numerous switches that occurs each time 
congress begins a new session 
both houses will have new budget committee chairmen rep leon 
panetta of california in the house and sen jim sasser of tennessee 
in the senate the two already have made their dissatisfaction known 
with bushs campaign pledge to avoid new taxes to reduce the 
deficit you have to raise revenues says panetta who has 
immersed himself in the budget for years 
sen don riegle of michigan and rep henry gonzales of texas are 
new democratic chairmen of the banking committees their panels will 
grapple with legislation dealing with the ailing savings and loan 
industry changes designed to address corporate buyouts and most 
likely many of the elements in a conservative war on poverty that 
hud secretarydesignate jack kemp has promised 
the house includes 33 newcomers and the freshmen senators number 
11 they most likely will walk into a situation that most employees 
can only dream of with reagan expected to propose pay raises of as 
much as 45000 the figure recommended by a federal commission 
whatever reagan recommends would take effect automatically 30 
days later barring a vote to overturn it in congress wright is 
expected to try to avoid having the roll called on the issue but 
has said he would seek an immediate vote on legislation prohibiting 
honoraria for members of congress 
despite the changes in key leadership positions many of the 
issues that congress grapples with this year are well known 
the deficit aside mitchell lists minimum wage child care 
health care environmental bills and affordable housing as part of 
his legislative agenda 
many bills dealing with those issues died when the old congress 
expired last fall but mitchell says he intends to try again 
one ought not to be discouraged by the fact that legislation 
wasnt enacted within a few months after it was first proposed he 
said

honolulu hospital 
mrs aquino who became president after the popular and military 
uprising that ousted marcos in february 1986 has remained steadfast 
in her refusal to allow him to return 
there are reports that the former president would like to 
return to the philippines in the light of his alleged failing 
health mrs aquino said 
considerations of national welfare and interest caused her to 
reject a return for marcos who ruled the philippines for 20 years 
for my part i offer my prayers for his good health and 
wellbeing mrs aquino added 
vice president salvador laurel said saturday in a radio interview 
that marcos wife imelda telephoned him friday to ask that he 
intercede with mrs aquino to allow the former president to return

i think marcos should be allowed home every filipino 
should be allowed to return home laurel said 
marcos entered a honolulu hospital thursday for the second time 
in three weeks 
joe lazo president of the friends of marcos group said the 
former president was administered last rites by a roman catholic 
priest and that his followers would urge president reagan to allow 
him to return as a dying wish 
assistant us attorney debra livingston said thursday that a 
hearing was been set for jan 19 to decide whether marcos was 
healthy enough to travel to new york and face arraignment on us 
racketeering charges 
tomas gomez iii the philippine consul general in hawaii said 
honolulu reporters were informed in advance about marcos plan to 
enter the hospital 
gomez repeatedly has accused marcos of faking poor health in an 
attempt to gain public sympathy and stall the case against him

reported in guarded but improving condition friday after suffering 
the second severe episode of congestive heart failure in a 
month according to norma kop spokeswoman for st francis 
hospital

pneumonia were wrong a marcos spokesman said he was expected to 
remain hospitalized for several days for more tests 
marcos spent nine days at st francis this month after having 
trouble breathing results of his medical tests were not released 
marcos and his wife face us racketeering charges accusing them

federal regulators brushing aside charges of 
giant government giveaways announced the takeover of three more 
insolvent savings and loan institutions today as regulators 
completed a final batch of rescues 
working against a midnight deadline when tax breaks for the 
purchasers of the sick sampls will be cut in half the federal home 
loan bank board announced takeover of three insolvent institutions 
in the san francisco area bringing to 213 the number of failed sampls 
which have been closed this year 
by midnight tonight the bank board said it expected to have 
committed a total of about 38 billion in government funds to assist 
in rescuing the largest number of sampls declared insolvent in 50 
years 
the newest deals involved 2433 million in government aid 
provided to home federal savings and loan a large sampl based in san 
diego to acquire the three sampls 
home federal put up 25 million in new capital to make the 
purchases of the insolvent columbus savings and loan san rafael 
cal american savings and loan walnut creek and first security 
pleasant hill the institutions will be reopened tuesday as branches 
of the new columbus savings 
the board which regulates the nations 3100 sampls saved some of 
the biggest bailouts for last including three billiondollarplus 
packages announced late friday night one of those deals will result 
in the formation of the nations second largest sampl business owned 
by a subsidiary of ford motor co 
federal regulators and prospective buyers rushed to beat a 
yearend deadline after which the tax breaks for purchasers of sampls 
would be effectively cut in half that proved to be a powerful 
inducement to reach agreement but it has led to mounting criticism 
of the bank boards handling of the sampl mess 
critics charged that the deals involving some of the biggest 
insolvent institutions had been unnecessarily generous to the 
buyers who have included such wealthy investors as texas 
billionaire robert bass 
various members of congress complained that the deals were 
saddling taxpayers with billions of dollars in openended 
obligations specific objections were raised to the tax provisions 
which in many cases will give the investors more in tax breaks than 
they are putting up to purchase the sampls 
rep toby roth rwis called on attorney general dick 
thornburgh to investigate whether the bank board was acting 
responsibly in carrying out the latest round of sampl deals 
its incredible that a federal agency would enter into the 
biggest sweetheart deal in history roth said in a letter to 
thornburgh what we have are multibilliondollar savings and loans 
being sold for 1 percent cash down coupled with tax breaks that are 
worth even more 
but lawrence white a member of the bank board defended the 
agency 
we are not squandering the taxpayers money he said friday 
i think we are being exceedingly responsible in the way we are 
looking at the transactions 
bank board chairman m danny wall had hoped to complete 222 deals 
by midnight saturday but bank board officials late friday scaled 
back the estimate to 216 or 217 
that would still far surpass the 48 institutions which were 
closed in 1987 and approach the alltime record of 277 set in 1938 
during the great depression 
among the institutions closed on friday were sampls in colorado 
florida illinois iowa montana ohio oklahoma and texas and the 
deals included three of the largest bailouts the bank board has 
agreed to 
one of those involved 16 billion in government aid to first 
nationwide financial corp a ford motor subsidiary to assist it in 
purchasing two failed sampls in colorado and one each in chicago and 
cleveland 
the four insolvent institutions have assets of almost 8 billion 
and they will be merged eventually into fords huge savings and loan 
subsidiary the first nationwide bank of san francisco 
the completed deal will give the automaker the nations second 
largest savings and loan business with assets exceeding 34 
billion ford will put up 170 million to acquire the four sampls 
in another large bailout the bank board said it was providing 
137 billion to assist in the purchase of united savings 
association of texas one of the states largest sampls with 44 
billion in assets it was being sold to hyperion partners an 
affiliate of a new york investment firm which agreed to put up 200 
million to make the purchase 
in the third large package announced friday the bank board said 
it was providing 1 billion in assistance for golden west financial 
corp of oakland calif to manage two insolvent florida sampls 
under the agreement golden west will manage the institutions and 
will have the option to buy one of them beach federal savings and 
loan of boynton beach at a later date the other sampl which will be 
managed by golden west is new metropolitan federal savings and loan

an italian interior designer says the 
prospect of aiding science is what prompted her to volunteer to 
spend up to five months in a cave out of the sunlight and away from 
the sound of another human voice with only 400 books to keep her 
company 
if she succeeds stefania follini 27 of ancona italy will set 
a womens duration record for isolation in a cave but her interest 
is in the scientific value of the experiment that nasa officials 
will monitor to draw parallels with the isolation experienced in 
lengthy space flights 
i understand there will be a lot of scientific interest in 
this and i want to add my contribution she said friday through 
an interpreter 
ms follini was scheduled to enter the 21footdeep lost cave in 
southeast carlsbad on sunday morning but problems in getting 
computers through italian customs has pushed back the starting date 
about a week project organizer maurizio montalbini said 
the purpose of the cave marathon is to find out how a womans 
body and psyche will react to the prolonged isolation the only 
voice ms follini will hear will be her own and she will not have a 
clock or calendar 
montalbini once spent seven months in a cave and other men have 
spent up to six months underground but ms follini who is hoping 
to stay at least four and possibly five months would be the womans 
record holder if she succeeds the current cavesitting record for a 
woman is one month 
ms follini said she was fascinated by news of montalbinis 
sevenmonth underground stay and decided to volunteer when she 
heard that his frontier explorations and researches group wanted to 
send a woman into a cave 
ms follini who will not be paid for her role in the experiment 
said she likes the ambience of caves the way she feels far away 
yet secure 
i feel very excited and i want to go down there she said 
she is bringing along 400 books histories novels and a book of 
english grammar the holder of a brown belt in judo plans to keep 
fit by practicing judo lifting dumbbells and doing gymnastics 
although she wont be able to see or hear another human 
scientists will be able to monitor her via a video camera and 
microphones 
but she wont have much chance to engage in her profession 
interior design because her living quarters will be a 
100squarefoot plexiglasenclosed module at the end of the 
250footlong 50footwide cave

the man who wept after the committee he led 
voted articles of impeachment against former president richard nixon 
wants to be remembered for one quality during his 40 years in 
congress fairness 
no one wants to pull down a president there was only one thing 
we needed to do and that was to assure that our system of 
government worked recalled retiring rep peter rodino of new 
jersey at a time when our country was in crisis it was rodino 
that was at the helm upholding the constitution 
packing up memorabilia in his newark office recently the 
79yearold democrat who is stepping down after 40 years in the 
house proudly displayed photos of himself with john and robert 
kennedy lyndon johnson and the rev martin luther king jr 
on his desk last among the items to be packed were hefty bound 
transcripts of the 1974 impeachment hearings of president richard 
nixon which rodino chaired 
i believe in fairness and decency the 79yearold democrat 
said he gives credit to two inspirations his immigrant father and 
the constitution his father a tradesman insisted that fairness be 
a part of my life rodino recalled 
rodino who makes a habit of quoting the preamble to the 
constitution said in those 52 words we have captured the 
framework of a society that not only is strong and great but is 
caring and compassionate 
he was a drafter of the watershed 1964 civil rights act and 
helped secure house passage of immigration reforms in 1965 and a 
fairhousing law in 1966 rodino has served as chairman of the 
influential house judiciary committee since 1974 
he sets an extraordinarily high standard for all who aspire 
to public service sen bill bradley of new jersey said when 
rodino announced his retirement 
but not all legislators would agree with rodinos assessment of 
himself 
some accused him of a common congressional trick when he didnt 
like a bill before his committee he refused to act on it 
yet rodino still sees himself in some ways as the young lawyer 
from this citys north ward who was just back from the war in 1948 
when fate and the votes of his fellow italians put him into congress 
as you look back you have to wonder why me rodino said 
rodino had failed two years earlier to oust veteran rep fred 
hartley coauthor of the tafthartley labor law when hartley 
retired a term later rodinos dream became a reality 
four decades later rodino is stepping down in the face of 
another reality just as italians once held power here the city now 
belongs largely to its black and hispanic voters 
the emerging minorities pressured rodino to retire but he 
resisted he was challenged in a 1986 primary election and the rev 
jesse jackson came to the state to campaign for rodinos black 
opponent he won the nomination easily hinting he would step down 
after a final two years in congress 
rodinos successor democrat donald payne will be new jerseys 
first black congressman when he takes office this month 
while sometimes seeming bitter about pressure to retire rodino 
says he has been ready his official reason for staying has been to 
counter the presence of his ideological opposite president reagan 
the centerpiece of rodinos long career came in 1974 when just 
months after he became chairman the judiciary committee was called 
upon to hear charges on nixons role in the watergate coverup 
he recalled the admonition from sen john stennis of mississippi 
who told him fate called on you 
i said dont tell me that thats terrifying rodino 
recalled 
he also remembers the chaotic moment right after the judiciary 
committee voted articles of impeachment rodino fought his way past 
reporters into a cubbyhole office he telephoned his wife and wept 
but though the hallmark of his reputation watergate was only 
several months out of 40 years in congess 
immigration has been a key rodino issue rooted in his own past 
in helping pass the 1965 reforms rodino said he ended the 
nationalitybased quota systems he had seen as a boy keep families 
apart 
rodino has accepted a visiting professorship at the seton hall 
university school of law here which will name its new library in 
his honor he said his first priority will be to write a book of 
memoirs hell also join his sons new jersey law firm

here is the text of president 
reagans radio address saturday 
my fellow americans tonight we celebrate the coming of a new 
year a time of expectation and promise i believe its going to be 
a very good year indeed our economy is healthy our defenses our 
strong and our policy of peace through strength is paying off in 
spades 
in six weeks time the soviet union is due to pull its remaining 
forces out of afghanistan im confident the soviets will stick to 
their timetable and be out by the 15th of february which will then 
be a great day for world peace 
im also confident about 1989 because in just three weeks 
george bush will be sworn in as the 41st president of the united 
states and a superb president hes going to be he has handled 
skillfully the selection of his cabinet and the transition process 
is proceeding well and smoothly 
so the news is good this new years eve of course we still 
reel in shock and horror from the bombing of flight 103 over 
lockerbie scotland and we extend our sympathy to the bereaved 
now if it seems likely our terrorists have crawled out of their 
hole to threaten american lives i can promise them this the 
pledge we made to seek out the truth and punish the guilty is a 
sacred one which george bush shares 
indeed presidentelect bush knows as thoroughly as anyone in the 
world today the nature and problem of terrorism as chairman of this 
administrations task force on terrorism he oversaw a report that 
is the toughest statement to date on the need for strong action 
including when warranted military action against terrorists that 
report ought to be giving some people sleepless nights right about 
now 
that crime aside however there is little to disturb us about 
the overall state of the nation as we join together to make merry 
and sing auld lang syne but still during these days when you 
turn on the television or read through the newspaper you might get 
the idea that what faces george bush upon his assumption of the 
responsibilities of the presidency of the united states will be 
nothing but a series of impossible choices heartaches and just 
general trouble 
now im sure most of this talk is simply evidence that were 
about to go through a change of leadership a moment in time that 
does funny things to people particularly in washington for some 
this is a time to put in their bids on the agenda of the future for 
others this is a time for the jitters because they try to imagine 
what the future will bring and find it a little confusing 
these jitters have been overcome with courage and vision in both 
the united states and canada as the way has been cleared for an 
historic new free trade agreement to take effect tomorrow and i 
want to assure you as we do take this time together to look ahead 
that there is not a single major problem facing this country today 
that cannot be solved when we come together to solve them what it 
takes is the political will to solve them rather like a successful 
new years resolution 
now here are a few new years political resolutions i think could 
be accomplished in 1989 i think we should resolve to keep within 
the grammrudman targets and eliminate the deficit entirely by 1993 
ill be telling you more about our budget for the next fiscal year 
over the next few weeks but let me just say that this new budget 
represents a serious and dedicated effort to produce a realistic 
plan for meeting our responsibilities to reduce the deficit 
maintain our defenses and help the needy ive said it before and 
ill say it again all this can be done without raising taxes 
higher taxes mean slow economic growth and economic growth combined 
with budget realism is the key to eliminating the deficit 
george bushs lips have been eloquent on this subject and it 
sure would be a great new year if we continue the progress we made 
this year putting an end to those mammoth continuing resolutions 
and work with a real budget again 
we can continue to improve relations with the soviet union in 
1989 if we remember that the key to improved relations thus far has 
been our strength and resolution we must remain sober in our 
estimation of our negotiating partners and without illusion we know 
about their goals and aims whether were talking about bilateral 
relations with the soviet union or efforts to achieve a negotiated 
settlement in the middle east the lesson is the same 
to achieve further reductions in international tensions the 
incoming administration will need appropriate levels of defense 
spending not to mention support from congress for their foreign 
policy initiatives trust me i know 
have a very happy new year and until next week thanks for 
listening and god bless you

garland who was born frances gumm in this northcentral minnesota 
town in 1922 
townspeople have celebrated garlands june 10 birthday for about 
15 years but want to make the 67th anniversary of her birth special 
because it coincides with the 50th anniversary of the release of 
the wizard of oz 
organizers say theyll have parades of oz characters daily 
and local actors will stage a nightly production of the musical a 
talent contest celebrity dinner and free film festival also are 
planned

garland was the third daughter of frank and ethel gumm 
performers and theater managers who moved from grand rapids to 
california when judy was 4 
growing up i always heard judy garland lived here when she was 
young but nothing special had been done to remember her said 
jackie dingmann a grand rapids resident who got the judy garland 
celebrations going in the mid1970s i believe shes one of the 
greatest entertainers that ever lived i think this is really 
good for grand rapids 
not everyone in the town appreciates garland who died in 1969 
some recall her once saying that the town was a nice place to go 
for a laugh but dingmann said garland also referred to grand 
rapids as a beautiful town

a mustard yellow paint job on the house 
considered the birthplace of the episcopal church in the united 
states has been a sore point for years new gray paint may have 
finally quelled the dispute 
its a compromise said kate sawyer director of the historic 
glebe house 
the new paint job on the building which was in progress off and 
on throughout the fall is an attempt to strike a balance between 
historical realism and modern taste she said 
the focus is still that its an 18thcentury site she said 
the switch back to a more popular color allows that focus to come 
across while giving the best presentation to the public 
in 1783 when congregationalism was virtually the law of the 
land priests of the church of england risked the wrath of 
revolutionminded neighbors and secretly met there to elect the rev 
dr samuel seabury the new nations first episcopal bishop 
the house was owned at the time by the rev john rutgers 
marshall the first episcopal priest to live in woodbury 
in 1980 the group that maintains the historic house commissioned 
an analysis of the coats of paint worn by the house over the years 
the goal was to learn what color the house was when marshall lived 
there in order to make the site as authentic as possible 
with the first strokes of yellow that followed the analysis many 
residents had a big negative reaction said mary beth baker who 
was the museums curator at the time 
critics said the mustard yellow was garish and too conspicuous in 
the historic neighborhood known as the hollow 
the gray paint job will be completed in the spring clapboards 
near the roof peak are still mustard yellow

president reagan on saturday 
authorized an exchange of diplomatic notes to put the uscanadian 
free trade agreement into effect and called it an example for the 
world on how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples 
the president telephoned canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
from the estate of publisher walter annenberg where he is 
vacationing to congratulate him on the final approval of the pact 
friday by canadas senate 
reagan also took action under the law through an executive 
order to permit the export to canada of up to 50000 barrels per 
day of crude oil the order affects oil that has been transported by 
pipeline and oil from the naval petroleum reserves 
deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said the 
exchange of diplomatic notes would put the agreement into effect as 
of sunday 
the free trade agreement established the worlds largest free 
trade zone involving two countries popadiuk said 
the united states and canada are each others principal trading 
partners with twoway trade of nearly 150 billion in 1988 
the agreement eliminates all tariffs between the two countries 
over a 10year period and eliminates or reduces many nontariff 
barriers 
the agreement will also enhance energy security improve the 
investment climate and significantly increase opportunities in the 
services sector including financial services popadiuk said 
while the free trade agreement will not eliminate all trade 
issues between our two countries it gives us the framework to 
manage them and the basis for expanding our economic relations 
the white house spokesman said 
popadiuk quoted reagan as saying in his telephone call to 
mulroney together our governments have set an example for the 
world on how eliminating trade barriers can benefit all peoples

the soviet union said saturday its troops in 
afghanistan will cease fire on new years day and appealed to the 
united states to support the truce but usbacked rebels vowed to 
keep fighting 
the foreign ministry said all units of soviet troops that still 
remain in afghanistan will lay down their arms on jan 1 and the 
soviets also are ready to stop supplying weapons to the kabul 
government afghan president najib on friday committed his forces to 
the truce 
the soviet union fully supports this peace move of the afghan 
leadership the foreign ministry said in a statement 
president mikhail s gorbachev called for the truce in a dec 7 
address to the united nations but the united states rejected it 
on friday alexander bessmertnykh a first deputy soviet foreign 
minister met with us ambassador jack matlock to make a bid for 
washingtons support 
the official tass news agency said bessmertnykh also made the 
pitch to the ambassador from pakistan which with the help of the 
united states supplies arms to rebels fighting afghanistans marxist 
government 
hope is expressed in the soviet union that the afghan 
opposition and all countries first of all the united states and 
pakistan will choose peace and through concrete actions respond to 
the peaceful intentions of the republic of afghanistan and the 
soviet union the foreign ministry said in saturdays statement 
the statement carried by tass did not make clear how long 
soviet troops would hold their fire if the rebels dont stop 
shooting najib however said moslem insurgents will be given four 
days to accept the truce if they refuse government troops will 
start shooting again he said 
afghanistans first deputy defense minister lt gen mohammad 
nabi azimi noted in a tass interview saturday that the rebels had 
not adhered to previous truces 
if the opposition does not agree to the ceasefire once again 
the army will deal powerful strikes at extremists in several areas 
of the country after jan 5 azimi warned 
a rebel spokesman in islamabad pakistan dismissed the truce 
we did not start our fight because he asked us to said 
masood khalili and we wont stop because he asked us to 
khalili belongs to the jamiateislami guerrilla group whose 
leader burhanuddin rabbani met in december with soviet deputy 
foreign minister yuli vorontsov 
the usbacked guerrillas have been fighting kabuls troops for 
10 years in december 1979 soviet troops marched into afghanistan 
to bolster the kabul government 
the foreign ministry said both sides should stop aiding their 
allies in the war 
addressing specifically the united states the soviet side 
again reaffirms its readiness on the basis of reciprocity to 
discontinue all supply of arms to the warring sides in afghanistan 
from jan 1 the statement said 
secretary of state george p shultz has rejected the proposal 
noting that the soviets snubbed prior us offers for mutual 
cessation of outside aid 
he said the rebels were justified in trying to seize territory as 
the soviets withdraw because the people of afghanistan broadly 
speaking do not accept the fact that the puppet regime is entitled 
to hold certain areas of that country 
a senior western diplomat explaining why the united states will 
not go along with the aid cutoff said the soviets poured in a huge 
amount of military supplies to afghanistan in preparation for the 
new years peace moves 
on may 15 the soviet union began withdrawing its estimated 
100000 soldiers from afghanistan under a unbrokered agreement 
half of the soviet troops have left the country and the remaining 
half are to pull out by feb 15 
but soviet officials say they have suspended their troop 
withdrawal temporarily because of continuing us and pakistani aid 
to the rebels

bobbing and prancing pumping their elbows 
cakewalking in goldpainted shoes 22000 marchers will strut their 
sequins and silks in a timehonored city funfest the new years day 
mummers parade 
they are mostly men these merrymakers in their costumes and 
dresses of many colors and their fancy wigs unless weather pushes 
back the parade a day they will preen and parade for more than 12 
hours sunday much of the time to the tune of oh dem golden 
slippers 
mummery the prancing and wearing of masks and costumes for the 
sheer fun of it traces its origins back 2400 years to the greek 
god momus in philadelphia the first formal parade was in 1901 but 
neighborhood parades go back to at least 1877 
the parade which will include all ages from children pushed in 
decorated carriages to folks in their 80s follows a 2mile route 
up broad street to city hall 
a total of 286470 in city prizes will be awarded to the best 
funniest and most handsome costumes and to string bands with the 
sweetest music in 1901 the city put up 1725 
the money then and now doesnt come close to covering costume 
costs which under mummer rules must be new every year except for 
outfits worn by comics who may reuse materials from past years 
a string band with some 60 members spends nearly 50000 for 
their outfits far short of the 7030 first prize these days such 
outfits are made mostly by professional costumers 
clubs make up the difference by fundraising events like 
raffles cake sales and dances throughout the year said fred 
calandra president of the new year shooters amp mummers association 
the string bands travel the country performing and thats how 
they pay their costs 
if the weather cooperates a million people are expected to crowd 
the sidewalks to watch the cavorting mummers 
special attractions are the 24 string bands and the 18 fancy 
brigades and the thousands of comics who do their special strut in 
goldpainted shoes as they satirize and ridicule mimic and jeer 
mostly to the parades theme music oh dem golden slippers 
until a decade ago the mummers parade was allmale under threat 
of a lawsuit women were allowed on the street some of the gals 
are still the female impersonators who brave the generally freezing 
temperatures in barearmed evening dresses and fancy wigs 
over the centuries the spirit of mummery has been adapted latin 
laborers marched masked while exchanging gifts the celts used 
trickortreat variations 
the british swedes and germans among the early american 
immigrants brought the heraldry to this birthplace of independence 
they would powder or blacken their faces beat on pots to chase away 
the devils in the new year 
now rich and poor lawyers doctors and teachers all join in 
even priests brother john this year portrays an egyptian before 
that he was a jungle dancer and an indian and boasts proudly im 
a pretty good dancer 
my religious life comes first brother john says but this 
mummery is for relaxation

plo chairman yasser arafat declared 
saturday he expects results from his talks with the united states 
soon but a marxist palestinian faction warned him not to make too 
many concessions 
the statement from the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine underlined the fragility of arafats peace initiative even 
within the palestine liberation organization 
radical factions within the movement have stressed they do not 
believe that moderation will succeed in persuading israel to accept 
the independent palestinian state proclaimed in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip 
arafat boasted in a statement broadcast by the baghdadbased 
voice of the palestinian revolution radio we were able to 
impose our will on the united states to recognize the palestinian 
reality 
we are looking for the results of this dialogue in the region 
shortly he stressed 
arafats statement broadcast on the eve of the 24th anniversary 
of the first attacks against israel launched by his fatah guerrilla 
movement jan 1 1965 did not elaborate 
but the plo is seeking through the talks which began dec 16 in 
tunisia to pressure israel to negotiate a peace settlement at an 
international middle east conference and win wider recognition by 
the americans 
washington lifted a 13year ban on talks with the plo only after 
arafat explicitly recognized israel and renounced terrorism in 
geneva dec 15 despite reservations by radical plo factions and 
opposition from extremist syrianbacked dissident groups 
arafats statement hailed the yearold palestinian uprising in 
the west bank and gaza strip where the plo has called on the 15 
million palestinians there to mark fatah day with violent 
actions stones firebombs and demonstrations against the 
israelis who captured the territories in 1967 
arafat said the uprising will continue until the occupation is 
ended and an independent state is established 
he declared there would be no peace in the occupied zones until 
the national rights of our people are recognized 
the leader of the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine nayef hawatmeh called for an escalation in the uprising 
but in a statement telexed by the factions headquarters in 
damascus to the associated press in cyprus hawatmeh said that 
maneuvers to stop the uprising under slogans of a partial truce or 
deals with occupation forces will never succeed 
he added we warn the plo to beware of becoming a victim of 
this trap 
another major plo faction the marxist popular front for the 
liberation of palestine led by george habash split from arafat with 
other radical factions in a syrianbacked mutiny to protest arafats 
increasing moderation 
but the two factions reconciled with the plo leader in algiers 
last year seriously weakening a damascusbased opposition front 
these two factions and arafats mainstream fatah group make up 80 
percent of the plos guerrilla force 
habash reluctantly went along with a resolution passed last month 
by the palestine national council the plos parliamentinexile 
implicitly recognizing israel 
but he said he did not believe moderation will pay and told 
arafat that if his initiative collapsed the council would be 
convened to endorse a more militant policy

talk about an inequality 1988 was the year 
that a postdepression record number of banks failed with hardly 
anyone taking note while virtually the same number of savings and 
loans failed with a thud that is shaking the walls of the oval 
office 
the answer to that puzzling disparity is really the story of two 
insurance funds the federal deposit insurance corp and the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp the fdic and the fslic 
those letters are emblazoned at the entrances of thousands of 
financial institutions across the nation as a beacon of assurance 
for the institutions depositors it wasnt always that way 
before there was federal deposit insurance economic downturns 
were not called recessions but panics because that is often what 
worried depositors did at the first whiff of trouble they would 
form long lines at the teller windows to withdraw their money 
during the great depression of the 1930s hundreds of banks 
closed wiping out not only depositors who couldnt get to the bank 
in time but bank stockholders as well for that reason congress 
stepped in and created the fdic to insure deposits at commercial 
banks and the fslic to do the same at savings and loan 
associations 
the mission of both agencies is the same to put the governments 
backing behind deposits now insuring up to 100000 in each account 
but while the mission is identical the economic fortunes of the 
two funds are not 
l william seidman chairman of the fdic noted in a yearend 
message that the banks insurance fund had handled a postdepression 
record of 221 bank failures and assistance packages in 1988 up from 
203 in 1987 
that figure is very close to the 216 sampls that the federal home 
loan bank board which oversees the fslic expected to close by 
midnight saturday 
but while the fdic closings have proceeded in a businessasusual 
atmosphere largely out of the limelight despite the large number 
the fslic closings have grabbed headlines and triggered a spate of 
congressional investigations the problems is also occupying a good 
deal of the time of presidentelect bushs transition team 
the difference is a disparity in the two funds ability to pay to 
mop up the problems 
the wave of failed banks translated into an estimated loss for 
the fdic of between 3 billion and 4 billion in 1988 the first 
year the funds assets have failed to grow but even with that 
decline the fund is expected to end the year with a tidy nest egg 
of 15 billion down from 183 billion a year ago 
and seidman predicted that the fdic fund would begin growing 
again in 1989 as the number of bank failures start declining what 
that means is that the turmoil in the banking industry caused by 
financial deregulation in the 1980s can be handled by the insurance 
fees assessed on the industry without the need to resort to tapping 
general revenues it also means the fdic can shut down insolvent 
banks on a timely basis 
thats not the case with the fslic fund which has been forced to 
keep hundreds of insolvent sampls open because it did not have the 
money to deal with the problem which keeps growing at a rate of 1 
billion a month 
presently the estimates of the ultimate cost of cleanup for the 
sampl crisis range from a low of 50 billion made by the federal home 
loan bank board to a high of 112 billion the latest projection 
from the general accounting office the auditing arm of congress 
but the expectations of revenues the fslic will be receiving to 
deal with the crisis primarily from assessments on healthy sampls 
amount to only about 30 billion 
that means that even under the most optimistic assumptions 
congress and the incoming bush administration will have to find a 
way to bridge a gap of about 20 billion 
the bush team led by treasury secretary nicholas brady who is 
staying on in the new administration and incoming budget director 
richard darman is already focusing on the problem 
reports indicate that the new administration is currently 
focusing on proposals that would limit the impact on the budget by 
resorting to various offbudget financial schemes and other 
accounting gimmicks 
however many believe that this would be the wrong approach to 
take compounding problems created by the reagan administration when 
it delayed facing up the full extent of the sampl crisis 
the bush administration will be committing political suicide if 
it doesnt candidly address the problem immediately after taking 
office said bery ely a financial consultant in alexandria va 
but crafting a politically acceptable solution will not be easy 
given the magnitude of the final cost to taxpayers 
the bailout to come will be the largest ever in the history of 
the united states it will be far bigger than the combined cost of 
the assistance given after intensive congressional scrutiny to 
chrysler lockheed and new york city retiring sen william 
proxmire observed in a recent speech to make the bad news even 
worse the longer congress waits to appropriate the money the 
greater the ultimate cost will be to the nations taxpayers

air travelers worldwide welcomed 
stringent security checks imposed after the bombing of pan am flight 
103 and took a better safe than sorry attitude saturday when 
faced with brief delays resulting from extra precautions 
some even complained that security wasnt strict enough while 
others boarded with a more fateful attitude that no matter how 
tight security is it cant always prevent a terrorist attack 
light traffic was reported at most airports new years eve and 
few complaints about inconvenience were heard by airport workers 
ordered to carefully check all luggage and passengers 
closer security checks were ordered at airports around the world 
in response to the dec 21 bombing of pan am flight 103 which 
killed all 259 people on the jet and left about 11 people on the 
ground in lockerbie scotland missing and presumed dead 
better safe than sorry said american traveler paula hampton 
when asked about short delays reported at frankfurt airport the 
wife of an american serviceman stationed at baumholder ms hampton 
said she had expected even longer waits 
a twa employee said on condition of anonymity that the airline 
took extra precautions at frankfurt but she could not discuss them 
she said little change was needed because of existing policies on 
baggage and passenger checks 
airports across asia tightened security after a warning that 
palestinian terrorists plan to attack a commercial airliner in the 
region by jan 10 
at tokyos narita airport an airindia official said on 
condition of anonymity that the information came from indian 
intelligence sources 
stricter security measures also were reported at airports in new 
delhi calcutta bombay madras manila hong kong taipei taiwan 
and dhaka bangladesh 
at romes leonardo da vinci airport a policeman standing guard 
at an entrance to the international departures terminal did random 
checks on entering passengers and visitors 
it doesnt matter what they look like i search men women and 
children i make them open their bags he said putting a finger 
on the trigger of his automatic weapon when approached by a young 
man 
an associated press reporter wandering the airport to interview 
people was questioned by a policeman who wanted to know what he was 
doing 
nevertheless american businessman frank nicosia of los angeles 
said he was disappointed by the the level of special security 
measures at rome i was routed through madrid where i find 
security is tighter these days he said 
officials at many airlines said security has long been tight 
you cant maximize the maximum said aqel biltaji senior 
vice president for airport services at jordans queen alia 
international airport 
most passengers at british their airports have been very 
cooperative according to airline officials 
only one or two have complained but they became very 
embarrassed when it was pointed out that we are trying to prevent 
another disaster like lockerbie said a pan am agent at londons 
heathrow airport 
businessman peter meyer of detroit flying from london to new 
york on pan am said the airlines should do whatever is necessary to 
protect passengers 
if that means delay at the checkin or more inconvenience so 
be it no one wants a repeat of the disaster he said before 
leaving london 
american student cassie howell 19 returning to berkeley 
calif after spending christmas in england said she was glad the 
checks were so thorough 
they wanted to know all about my itinerary where i had been 
and where i was going they also asked if i had any gifts in my 
luggage that other people had given me to pass on or if i had 
packed all my bags myself she said 
officials at israels bengurion airport near tel aviv said no 
new security measures were necessary because of already stringent 
measures 
at madrids barajas airport director francisco garcia also 
reported little change from what he described as already strong 
antiterrorist measures 
he said security surrounding arrivals and departures of us jets 
has long been tight with xrays of all luggage prohibition of all 
nonpassengers from boarding areas and restrictions around planes 
loaded with baggage 
security was visibly stepped up at glasgow airport in scotland 
according to travelers there with close inspection of all hand 
luggage 
airports in the persian gulf region have long had some of the 
tightest security measures but travelers at bahrain airport said 
they noticed even closer checks are being made of baggage now 
one passenger said on condition of anonymity that restrictions on 
carrying appliances or equipment using drycell batteries would 
complicate travel for those who use laptop computers 
in rome a 22yearold american woman looked nervous as she 
clutched her us passport while waiting for a flight to paris 
if i were going to the states i wouldnt fly an american 
airline she said refusing to give her name 
william heller of boston was taking british airways from rome to 
london where he planned to take a flight on northwest airlines to 
the east coast 
i cant be too worried because no matter how good the security 
is it terrorist attack can still be done he said

despite a reputation as one of the 
nations rising young conductors and guest appearances with the new 
york philharmonic and other major orchestras raymond harvey says 
strangers still ask what railroad he works for when he is introduced 
as a conductor 
there are times when you just wish peoples minds were more 
open said the 37yearold director of the springfield symphony 
who calls it an embarrassment that he can still count the number 
of black symphony conductors on the fingers of one hand 
it just takes a confidence in your own abilities and courage to 
do what you think is right and what you are talented for whether or 
not there are a lot of role models around he said 
harvey who holds a doctorate from yale was associate director 
of the buffalo philharmonic before coming to springfield 
i consider myself a conductor who happens to be black and not 
a black conductor harvey said i have a rule that the first 
time i appear with an orchestra it will not be in a martin luther 
king or black history month concert i like doing those kinds of 
concerts but not for the first time i appear with an orchestra

a report overseen by presidentelect 
bush advocating possible military action against terrorists ought 
to be giving some people sleepless nights in the wake of the 
bombing of pan am flight 103 president reagan said saturday 
in his weekly radio talk broadcast from the estate of publisher 
walter annenberg in nearby rancho mirage reagan said he believes 
1989 is going to be a very good year indeed 
our economy is healthy our defenses are strong and our policy 
of peace through strength is paying off in spades he said 
nevertheless said the president we still reel in shock and 
horror from the bombing of flight 103 
if as seems likely our terrorists have crawled out of their 
hole to threaten american lives i can promise them this the pledge 
we made to seek out the truth and punish the guilty is a sacred one 
which george bush shares 
indeed presidentelect bush knows as thoroughly as anyone in 
the world today the nature and problem of terrorism he said as 
chairman of this administrations task force on terrorism he oversaw 
a report that is the toughest statement to date on the need for 
strong action including when warranted military action against 
terrorists 
that report ought to be giving some people sleepless nights 
right about now the president said without elaboration 
reagan also said that he is confident the soviet union will meet 
its feb 15 target date for withdrawing all of its troops from 
afghanistan 
he renewed his commitment to having a balanced federal budget by 
1993 and said the budget he will submit on jan 9 will be a step in 
that direction 
giving the democratic response to reagan was new york sen daniel 
patrick moynihan who said changes undertaken together by congress 
and the reagan administration have put social security on a strong 
financial footing contrasting with early 1980s predictions that 
the system was going bankrupt 
social security is the most successful program for fighting 
poverty ever devised in our land moynihan said contending that 
without social security almost half the elderly would be poor 
the president and first lady nancy reagan planned to see the new 
year in as usual at a party attended by about 100 guests at the 
annenberg estate other invited guests included secretary of state 
george p shultz and his wife helena and others from reagans 
official family 
in the afternoon the president and shultz scheduled a round of 
golf with the legendary golfers lee trevino and tom watson on the 
private course at the annenberg estate sunnylands

here is the text of the democratic response to 
president reagans weekly radio address delivered saturday 
this is senator pat moynihan of new york wishing all of you a 
happy new year and asking you to join me in a very special wish for 
president and mrs reagan 
he and i have been having at each other in these saturday 
broadcasts on and off for eight hears now they have been fair 
fights from first to last and well mr president im going to 
miss them come to think our first goaround had to do with social 
security which is what id like to talk about today 
back in the beginning of the 1980s many people thought social 
security was finished the new budget director said it would soon be 
bankrupt a lot of people new to government simply panicked and in 
april 1981 huge benefit reductions were proposed 
well there is no need for that and the senate put a stop to it 
the system did need some changes and two years later we agreed to 
them let me be clear mr president you share the credit for those 
changes theyve been in place now long enough to measure the 
results let me give you then a yearend report on your social 
security finances 
i can report that the trust funds are in fine shape in great 
shape they are rising by 109440000 the day the actuaries tell 
us they will continue building up for the next 40 years and thats 
the good news so much that of a sudden we are hearing there is too 
much money in social security and that much of it goes to people who 
dont need it 
happily this week a revolutionary new study by the bureau of 
the census put an end to this proposition the census counted every 
penny of personal income and government benefits for the whole 
population enabling us to judge just how well off people are with 
social security and how badly off they would be without it pretty 
bad is the answer without social security almost half of the 
elderly would be poor today with social security medicare and 
other government programs the number of elderly poor has all but 
disappeared 
let us then hear no more about middleclass entitlements 
social security is the most successful program for fighting poverty 
ever devised in our land 
i wish i could report that the new census study concluded the 
same for children it did not save for those who receive survivors 
insurance government benefit programs hardly touch child poverty 
the new census report tells us what we have suspected for a long 
time but never seen actually computed this is that there are two 
kinds of children in america and they live in two kinds of 
families children in twoparent families as near as makes no 
matter will never be poor by contrast children who live in 
singleparent families will almost always be poor sooner or later 
and their numbers are staggering as many as onethird of our 
children live this way today 
weve become the first industrial nation on earth in which 
children are the worst off group this has become a fact which 
distinguishes america from other democracies in some of those 
countries they would no more allow a child to remain poor than they 
would allow one to remain sick when there was a cure for the 
illness that is why leaders such as governor mario cuomo have 
declared a decade of the child it is the great challenge before 
us if we get to work it will really be a happy new year 
this is senator pat moynihan and thank you for listening

and 10 people were wounded at his funeral arab reports said 
nine more people were reported hurt in clashes with soldiers in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip where residents observed a 
general strike called by moslem fundamentalists 
the army imposed a curfew on the occupied gaza strip confining 
650000 palestinians to their homes in anticipation of increased 
violence on fatah day sunday is the anniversary of the first 
attack against israel by the palestine liberation organizations 
fatah faction on jan 1 1965 
the army brought reinforcements into the occupied lands and 
ordered nearly 1200 west bank schools closed for a week 
in gaza city and the west bank towns of bethlehem and nablus 
residents shot off firecrackers and chanted allahu akhbar in 
early celebrations of fatah day arab reporters said 
in nablus four soldiers in uniform commandeered a mercedes with 
local license plates and later opened fire from the car on youths 
gathered on the street outside the home of 22yearold saki teeti 
witnesses told an arab reporter 
the shots struck teeti in the chest and he later died at the 
citys al ittihad hospital arab doctors said 
an army spokeswoman said the incident was under investigation 
in arab east jerusalem 14yearold anwar buhti of the west bank 
village shuweikah died at mukassed hospital doctors and army 
officials said buhti was shot in the head during a clash with 
troops dec 7 
in shuweikah hundreds of residents some masked joined buhtis 
funeral procession they marched behind the body wrapped in an 
outlawed palestinian flag and a blackandwhite keffiyeh headdress 
both symbols of palestinian nationalism

leftwing israeli legislator yossi sarid said troops killed 31 
palestinians and wounded more than 400 in december in what he said 
was a monthly record for the uprising

of plastic bullets he demanded that the army no longer use the 
ammunition introduced in august to help reduce fatalities 
soldiers use it more freely than standard ammunition said 
sarid of the citizens rights movement 
under army orders soldiers may use plastic bullets only if their 
lives are in danger or to disable organizers of violent protests 
said defense ministry spokesman eitan haber 
haber denied sarids charges the bullets are used according to 
the law there are a lot of limitations haber said 
streets were deserted and stores shuttered in the occupied lands 
as residents complied with a general strike called by the moslem 
fundamentalist group hamas a rival of proplo unified national 
leadership of the uprising hamas called the strike to express 
solidarity with detainees and deportees 
the compliance marked a victory for hamas which has repeatedly 
challenged the proplo uprising leaders

staff members of the miami news bid farewell 
miami with their final banner headline and a newsroom champagne 
toast saturday morning as miamis oldest daily older than the city 
itself shut down 
its over said howard kleinberg the news editor and an 
employee for 38 years i think we gave it a good effort 
this isnt just another newspaper dying it has a rich and 
proud history publisher david kraslow said our influence far 
exceeded our circulation 
along with sadness there was relief from the uncertainty of 
lastminute efforts to sell the newspaper or get a court injunction 
to block its closing 
its been real stressful said bonnie anderson a news 
columnist this is a very dignified 92yearold woman and she 
deserves to die with some honor not to keep her on lifesupport 
systems 
the circulation of the crusading newspaper winner of five 
pulitzer prizes had declined 57 percent in a little more than two 
decades to about 48000 the owner cox enterprises inc of atlanta 
said it was unable to sell the news and was losing about 28500 a 
day 
the justice department has said its antitrust division will look 
at the closing and whether cox made a serious effort to sell the 
newspaper but a federal judge friday denied a private coalitions 
effort to get an injunction against the closing 
the only apparent way to give the news a reprieve would be a 
justice department injunction the department hadnt sought such an 
injunction but the newspaper in a story on its own situation 
quoted justice spokesman mark sheehan as saying anything we can 
do today we can do tomorrow 
cox announced in october that the newspaper would be closed dec 
31 if it was not sold under a recent amendment to a 1966 joint 
operating agreement with the miami herald cox would have become 
responsible in 1990 for the news operating losses 
but cox will continue to share in profits of the herald a 
knightridder newspaper with circulation of more than 400000 
through 2021 even with the news closed cox will earn an estimated 
300 million through the agreement the news reported saturday 
the news staff which numbered about 105 in recent weeks is the 
main staff affected by the shutdown since the business operation is 
shared with the heralds under the joint agreement more than half 
of those people already have other jobs officials said 
a cox official friday defended its efforts to sell the paper 
we sent out prospecti to 50 people said david easterly who 
heads coxs newspaper division we made presentations to 34 
but chicago newspaper consultant john r malone representing a 
group of potential buyers and an earlier wouldbe buyer michigan 
attorney gary frink both criticized cox for not trying harder 
cox has made sure theres no way anybody can save that paper 
frink said calling its efforts to sell the publication a sham 
a federal lawsuit to keep the paper open failed friday when us 
distirct judge stanley marcus rejected arguments from community 
newspapers who claim closing the news would give the herald a 
monopoly the plaintiffs included readers and distributors of the 
news 
since the 1966 joint operating agreement the news circulation 
dropped from 112000 to 48000 under the agreement the herald 
provided printing circulation advertising and promotion services 
for the moneylosing news which gave up its sunday edition 
the heralds circulation has grown from about 250000 to more 
than 400000 since then 
kleinberg said while many news veterans blame the operating 
agreement for strangling us for 22 years it kept us alive for 22 
years 
the news was born may 15 1896 two months before the city was 
incorporated as the miami metropolis it lost some readers in the 
1960s with its early vigorous criticism of the vietnam war 
even with its employees jobhunting the news broke several 
stories in its final days and was in the lead in reporting the 
justice department investigation and criticism of its own parent 
company 
it was a damn good newspaper said columnist mort lucoff 
cleaning out his desk at age 59 after 25 years he was hospitalized 
twice for chest pains blamed on the stress of the last two months 
its pretty wrenching i put a quartercentury of life into this 
newspaper

the fbi questioned the father of a 
lebaneseborn man killed in the crash of a pan am airliner over 
scotland about reports his son unwittingly carried a bomb that 
destroyed it the father said 
newspapers in washington and london have quoted unidentified 
sources as saying khalid jaafar 21 of suburban detroit may have 
carried the bomb in his luggage without knowing it 
his father nazir jaafar who filed a 50 million suit against 
pan am on thursday said two fbi agents questioned him friday about 
reports that members of his family believed someone may have placed 
the bomb in his sons luggage 
jaafar said friday he told the fbi agents he had no idea where 
the report came from and that the agents told him they had no leads 
either 
they havent found anybody who made that statement he said 
they also said they have no evidence against my son they didnt 
have any indication he was involved 
he said his son did not check any luggage at the airport and 
carried only two bags both onto the plane with him there were no 
packages no briefcases jaafar said 
he said he knows this because he telephoned a friend of his sons 
in frankfurt immediately after hearing about the sons death and was 
told by the friend that no one gave jaafar any packages to take with 
him 
nobody sent anything with him jaafar said i know the 
friend and his family they are nice people 
jaafar said his son was also smart enough to avoid being used by 
terrorists he was very careful very careful jaafar said 
the fbis detroit office declined to comment on the reports about 
the younger jaafar as did a spokesman on duty saturday at fbi 
headquarters in washington 
the boeing 747 bound from london to new york exploded and 
crashed in lockerbie scotland dec 21 all 259 people aboard 
flight 103 were killed and 11 others on the ground are presumed dead 
on thursday nazir filed a 50 million lawsuit in us district 
court in detroit accusing pan am of carelessness and negligence 
in the crash 
the suit which seeks 15 million in actual damages and 35 
million in punitive damages contends the airline knew of a threat 
to blow up a plane but withheld news of the danger from the public 
on thursday nazir said the report that his son may have had a 
role in the crash shocks me more than my sons death its false 
fabricated nobody from the family would say such a stupid thing 
thursdays editions of the washington times quoted an 
unidentified relative of khalid jaafar as saying the young man had 
been living in frankfurt west germany with several other lebanese 
expatriates who may have alerted terrorists about his planned trip 
home to detroit on flight 103 
several british papers including the daily telegraph the times 
of london and the daily express reported saturday that the fbi was 
investigating whether the young man may have been the unwitting 
carrier of the bomb 
american news agencies received a call friday repeating a claim 
that the guardians of the islamic revolution terrorist group bombed 
the plane

the english language would be 
considerably improved if the terms catastrophic health 
insurance forced relaxation and spin doctor were 
banished 
thats according to a list put out saturday by lake superior 
state university which gathers expressions annually for its 
dishonour list of words banished from the english language 
language watchers submit terms they consider misused overused 
and generally useless the universitys statement saturday 
george bushs read my lips quote prompted michael locke of 
mount clemens to write if it had been banned last year we would 
not have had to listen to this throughout the 1988 campaign in the 
interest of forging a kinder and gentler nation i am withdrawing my 
1987 suggestion that the lips of all political candidates be 
fattened up for easier reading 
others objected to expressions they thought should be shortened 
softwheel infrastructure system is bureaucratic lingo gone 
mad said chris thompson of duluth minn why not call them what 
they are highways 
though australia may be growing in popularity among tourists one 
canadian contributor to the list saw fit to issue an aussie

terms such as mate spark up the barbie and too 
right are creeping like crocodiles into north american 
english said susie odonnell of willowdale ontario 
keith krahnke of paradise decided to battle the media industry 
singlehandedly by pointing out terms he thinks should be eliminated 
krahnke thinks the word infotainment an 
informationentertainment program sounds like a government policy 
to stem the spread of communism by flooding third world countries 
with free copies of readers digest 
dramedy a hybrid of a comedy and drama sounds like a camel 
with the shingles he added 
m dechant of newberry thought spin doctor more appropriately 
describes a terrific slam dancer with a medical degree or a nifty 
move to the hoop by julius erving than a person who determines the 
slant of news coverage

geraldo and oprah may heat up their tv talk 
shows with controversial guests but many cable channels are aflame 
these days as white supremacists use publicaccess channels for 
their own programs 
dubbed hate tv by some shows such as race and reason 
with host tom metzger a former grand dragon of the ku klux klan 
are popping up on public access cable channels nationwide 
the programs usually featuring guests with the same views as 
their outspoken hosts are triggering debates on free speech and 
race relations according to a recent study by the baltimorebased 
national institute against prejudice and violence 
race and reason is seen in 55 cities said metzger a 
southern california tv repairman and a leader of the white american 
political association 
other groups such as the kkk are also trying to move from the 
soapbox to the tube using cable access channels set aside to be 
theoretically open to anyone and causing chagrin among local cable 
operators and government officials 
in kansas city mo the city council shut down its publicaccess 
channel rather than show klansas city a local kkk program that 
was proposed after race and reason was rejected 
in response the american civil liberties union will represent 
the klan in a lawsuit challenging termination of the channel said 
the aclus dick kurtenbach 
in florida the klan unsuccessfully sued a local cable system for 
2500 after company officials refused to show the kkkproduced 
florida klan news said tony pupo of storer cable communications 
near orlando 
the show opened with pictures of a burning cross 
derogatory terms like nigger honky spook and cracker may be 
used tony bastanzio grand wizard of the knights of the ku klux 
klan said of the show but we wont allow any profanity 
its not a debate they are advocacy programs there is no 
controversy at all said j allen moran grand dragon of the 
missouri white knights of the ku klux klan who has seen 53 race 
and reason tapes 
metzger who began race and reason in 1984 calls it a 
small island of free speech in a sea of controlled and managed 
news 
moran said the missouri kkk is turning to cable because the day 
of the street walk is over if were on the street and are attacked 
it seems that the news media like to take pictures of us defending 
ourselves under the headline klan violence 
with electronic media those who oppose us cannot physically 
attack us moran said in a telephone interview cable allows us 
the unique opportunity to present our side of the story 
lorraine meyer of the american jewish committee in cincinnati 
said such groups dont need a lot of members to get their message 
across the use and abuse of technology to spread extremist hate 
rhetoric has a disturbing potential 
human rights and cable access groups coalesced in cincinnati 
after the white american skin heads cablecast a video bulletin 
board message join the american nazis and smash red jew and 
black power the national institute against prejudice and violence 
reported 
moran terms his views racialist not racist 
we chose the term racialist because the word racist in the 
dictionary is one who hates moran said a racialist loves we 
love our race we are proud of our heritage 
he advocates a separate country for whites adding the 
pacific northwest is what we have our eyes on 
the northwest knights of the ku klux klan have a cable program in 
spokane wash race and reason and ernest zundel on national 
socialism are shown on the publicaccess channel 
in pocatello idaho counterprograms were used said randy ammon 
access coordinator for pocatello cablevision 12 
the very first installment of race and reason was followed by 
a film of bill cosby on stage in an antiprejudice film that was 
followed by a live callin discussion said ammon the community 
spoke out against the racism advocated in race and reason and for 
the first amendment 
likewise in sacramento randy van dalsen of the sacramento cable 
foundation said the controversy served as a sparkplug as an 
instigator for other programming 
sacramento and pocatello each utilized the access channel to 
invite everyone in the community to answer the hatred of the klan 
said michael meyerson a university of baltimore communication law 
professor when you censor them klan members you make their 
argument correct

president reagan and soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev said in an exchange of new years messages 
saturday that problems remain in the relations between their 
countries but great progress is being made 
despite our disagreements we have been able to find some 
common ground reagan said in a speech to be broadcast with a 
voiceover translation on soviet television 
americans seem to be rediscovering the soviet union and we 
are rediscovering america gorbachev said in a message made 
available to us television networks on the same basis 
an englishlanguage text of gorbachevs message along with the 
text of reagans was distributed by the white house as reagan 
vacationed at the estate of publisher walter annenberg near this 
desert esort 
it was the third exchange of televised new years greetings by 
the two leaders they started the custom in 1986 skipped it in 
1987 and renewed it last year as relations between their two 
countries again improved 
reagans message was taped on dec 15 in the white house map 
room which was used as a staff room where key agreements were 
reached during the reagangorbachev summit in washington in december 
1987 
i am confident that relations between our two countries will 
continue on the positive course they have followed in the year just 
ending the president said 
reagan said he and gorbachev had advanced our mutual 
understanding on the vital issues of human rights arms reductions 
regional problems and bilateral relations 
in all of these areas these improvements represent only the 
beginning of a long difficult road to better understanding and 
cooperation he said 
reagan added we are ready to continue moving along this road 
important differences remain between our two counties and will 
continue for years to come 
looking forward to the inauguration of presidentelect bush on 
jan 20 reagan said the american people have chosen him in part 
because he represents continuity in the policies foreign and 
domestic that the united states has pursued over the past eight 
years i know that mr bush will continue on the same course with 
equal commitment 
gorbachev speaking also of ussoviet relations said we 
have become closer and we have come to know each other better 
fears and suspicion are gradually giving way to trust and 
feelings of mutual liking the soviet leader said 
we in the soviet union are in favor of the most wideranging 
ties between our peoples he said 
gorbachev said the treaty on reduction of short and mediumrange 
nuclear missiles that went into effect in 1988 was a great turning 
point in world affairs 
in addition he said the afghan issue is close to a 
settlement hostilities have ceased between iran and iraq real 
opportunities are emerging for resolving painful and complex issues 
in southeast asia and southern africa 
but the soviet union and the united states also have some 
common problems he said i am convinced that today on the 
basis of growing mutual understanding and trust we can solve them 
better than we could yesterday 
gorbachev made no reference to central america where the reagan 
administration has accused the soviets of fostering communist 
rebellions 
reagan on the other hand told the soviets perhaps your 
country will join ours in the effort to bring peace democracy and 
security to central america

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on saturday 
stripped some powers from a highranking council established in 
february to speed up irans decisionmaking process tehran radio 
reported 
following criticism from parliamentary deputies and other 
radicals that formation of the 13member expediency council was 
unconstitutional khomeini declared that it will no longer be 
allowed to legislate independently of parliament 
the official radio monitored in nicosia said khomeini urged a 
return to constitutional law now that the need for a speedy 
decisionmaking process has decreased since the aug 20 ceasefire 
in the war with iraq 
the mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors the main iranian 
opposition movement said in a statement that khomeinis move 
underlined that the ruling cliques internal conflicts are 
intensifying 
khomeini set up the expediency council 10 months ago while the 
war was still raging to resolve differences between the 
radicaldominated parliament and the 12member council of guardians 
which is dominated by conservative clerics and screens legislation 
to determine if it conforms to islamic law 
the expediency council a mix of reformists and conservatives 
included senior political figures such as president ali khamenei 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and prime minister hussein 
musavi as well as six members of the council of guardians 
the council of guardians had repeatedly blocked sweeping reforms 
that would give the government tight control of the economy and 
redistribute land much of it held by the clergy 
soon after it was formed the expediency council began 
independently ratifying a number of laws on its own including one 
ordering the death sentence for drug traffickers 
it takes effect jan21 
the radio said khomeini decreed that bills already passed by the 
expediency council will remain in force 
beyond that action must only be taken in cases where there are 
differences between the majlis parliament and the council of 
guardians khomeini said 
he called on the council of guardians composed of six clerics 
and six legal experts to be more broadminded in vetting majlis 
legislation so that it would not require further consideration by 
the expediency council 
while the guardians must prevent any unislamic bills from 
becoming law they should make full efforts to ensure that in the 
economic military social and political realms islam is not 
discredited and accused of being unable to manage the world he 
said

here is a white house text of soviet 
president mikhail gorbachevs new years message to the people of 
the united states 
on this first day of the new year i am pleased to have the 
opportunity to convey on behalf of the soviet people and on my own 
behalf our best wishes to the american people and to every 
american family 
seeing out a year gone by and ushering in a new year is always a 
moving experience each time we take stock of the past year happy 
about some things sad about others and hoping that many of our 
concerns will be left behind as we cross the threshhold of the year 
and that our wishes will be fulfilled in the coming year 
last year was rich in momentous events it also brought many good 
changes in relations between our people and countries today they 
are more dynamic and more humane we have become closer and we have 
come to know each other better 
americans seem to be rediscovering the soviet union and we are 
rediscovering america fears and suspicion are gradually giving way 
to trust and feelings of mutual liking 
i could see all of this for myself in my meetings with americans 
in washington and quite recently in new york we regard the warmth 
and goodwill shown to the soviet delegation during those days as 
something very important for our relations 
i think president reagan too will remember his meetings with 
soviet people during his visit to the soviet union 
we in the soviet union are in favor of the most wideranging ties 
between our peoples i hope you are too and that means we can look 
ahead with optimism to the future of our relations this is what we 
talked about with presidentelect bush 
1988 is memorable for all of us as a year when we began reducing 
the most terrifying weapons nuclear weaons that alone is enough 
for it to go down in history as a landmark a great turning point in 
world affairs 
many other facts too prove that changes for the better very 
important for all of us are taking place in the world the afghan 
issue is close to a settlement hostilities have ceased between iran 
and iraq real opportunities are emerging for resolving painful and 
complex issues in south east asia and southern africa the situation 
in the middle east is also changing all this is very encouraging 
and let me mention one thing in prticular 
you know how much misfortune and suffering was caused by the 
earthquake in armenia how great was the human tragedy it wrought 
i went to see the ruins of the devastated armenian towns you 
cant even look at what the forces of nature have done without 
shuddering 
all soviet people took the misfortune of the people of armenia as 
their own in this hour of grief they extended a helping hand to 
them as brothers the devastated towns and villages will be reborn 
that is the will of all the peoples of the soviet union 
armenias tragedy has evoked great sympathy throughout the world 
we are grateful to the american people and to all peoples who have 
come to our aid 
seeing all this one cannot help thinking that all people who 
live on this earth all of us however different are really one 
family 
i am sure we will find enough wisdom and goodwill to establish 
together a true period of peace for all humankind 
if we are capable of a new way of feeling then we must surely be 
capable of a new way of thinking 
if we are capable of a new way of thinking then instead of 
merely surviving we can live in a new way on the basis of equal 
rights justice trust humanism and wideranging cooperation 
this is the message i wanted to convey in addressing the united 
nations in new york 
there are of course still many problems in the world and they 
are intricate and complex but that only heightens the need to solve 
them together as we say in our country with everyone pitching in 
it is good that we understand this and moreover that we are taking 
the first steps in that direction 
both our countries have a lot of problems quite naturally you 
know your problems better and we know ours we intend to solve our 
problems in the course of perestroika 
but the soviet union and the united states also have some common 
problems i am convinced that today on the basis of growing mutual 
understanding and trust we can solve them better than we could 
yesterday 
once again i salute you citizens of a great nation once again i 
wish all of you peace good health and well being 
may there be more happiness and joy in your life may your best 
hopes be fulfilled 
may our common achievements shine brighter and brighter filling 
every soviet and american home and all our planet with an abiding 
will for peace development and construction 
a happy new year

a treasured item among cubas dissident community 
these days is a recent speech by a leading figure not normally 
identified with counterrevolutionary thoughts mikhail s gorbachev 
elizardo sanchez president of a small independent human rights 
group here proudly displayed to a reporter several copies of the 
speech the soviet president gave last month to the un general 
assembly 
sanchez said the cuban press gave perfunctory treatment to the 
speech highlighting only passages that coincided with the official 
view eager for a complete account sanchez obtained copies of the 
speech from the soviet embassy 
although his opinion cant be corroborated sanchez said he 
believes the government here felt uneasy about calling attention to 
a speech that once again underscored sovietcuba differences during 
the gorbachev era 
while playing down the gorbachev speech cubas 
governmentcontrolled television provided full coverage of remarks 
last month by pik botha south africas foreign minister and 
normally the leading villain in cubas pantheon of enemies botha 
spoke on the recent agreement calling for the withdrawal of cuban 
forces from angola 
gorbachevs speech was notably nonideological in tone 
contrasting sharply with president fidel castros emphasis on 
revolutionary purity marxist sloganeering was almost totally absent 
from the speech 
sanchez expressing a view shared by western diplomats here said 
castro is disquieted by gorbachevs policy of open discussion 
because pressures for official candor could emerge in cuba as well 
in his speech gorbachev said that given current international 
realities it is highly unlikely that closed societies can be 
preserved 
the comment could be taken as a slap at cuba with which the 
soviets have been closely aligned for two decades 
gorbachev also endorsed the principles of the un human rights 
declaration a document not held in high esteem by cuban authorities 
because of its stress on civil liberties 
cuba has always maintained that few countries do a better job of 
fulfilling aspects of the declaration dealing with economic rights 
including the right to employment 
no latin american country employs a higher percentage of its work 
force than cuba castro maintains insisting that any system that 
has produced as much social progress as cuba has in the past 30 
years should not be tampered with 
but sanchez who works out of a small cramped office at his 
havana home accused the government of violating at least 25 
provisions of the un declaration 
dec 10 was the 40th anniversary of the human rights declaration 
and this weekend is the 30th birthday of the triumph of castros 
revolution 
it was on new years day 1959 that castro ousted a rightist 
dictatorship in a revolution remarkable for both its durability and 
the magnitude of the changes it wrought 
castro is expected to mark the anniversary with an appearance 
sunday night in the east coast city of santiago 
until recently independent human rights groups in cuba have been 
virtually unknown now there are several all of which sanchez 
claims are closely monitored by the government 
sanchez whose group is known as the cuban commission of human 
rights and national reconciliation said international pressure has 
induced the government to pay more heed to human rights issues 
as an example he said there are no known cases of cuban 
political prisoners having been executed for at least two years 
according to western diplomats more than 200 cuban political 
prisoners have been released over the past year 
international public opinion is probably what most protects 
us sanchez said

a gunman who took eight hostages in a beauty 
salon releasing all but one before he was killed by a police 
sniper had a bomb that could have put the whole building in 
flames police said saturday 
michael fane 21 of iowa city iowa was shot and killed by a 
swat team sniper friday afternoon as the last hostage darla 
lordemann was bending over to pick up a package police left in the 
salon doorway 
the explosive that fane warned police he had in a suitcase during 
the 24hour siege turned out to be a firebomb authorities said 
after the device was dismantled 
that bomb could have put the whole building in flames police 
spokesman joe crinklaw said saturday 
fane did not get a chance to detonate the bomb which was 
controlled by a switch and a walkietalkie crinklaw said the 
hostages were unharmed police said 
debbie mcqueen a beautician who was one of the hostages said 
she was cutting a friends hair when fane entered the salon thursday 
afternoon 
he yelled im taking over then i saw he was swinging a gun 
and we all hit the floor she said 
fane then told four of the hostages including a 5yearold boy 
to leave 
mrs mcqueen who was held until 8 am friday said fane pulled 
a small suitcase from the bag and ordered mrs lordemann and denise 
rue 26 to attach their wrists to the suitcase handle and lie on 
the floor 
police would not disclose what fanes demands were but mrs 
mcqueen said he told hostages he was building a machine for god 
he said god sent him there god showed him the way mrs 
mcqueen said he said there was no message i just have to build 
a machine its something god wants done and i will do it 
police said their negotiations with fane deteriorated around 6 
am friday when they discovered he could have a bomb or the makings 
of a bomb 
police said they also believed fane had a 9mm pistol but later 
discovered he had a 9mm lookalike pellet gun police said fane 
probably could not have killed anyone with it 
fane who had been under psychiatric care began to have severe 
mood swings after ms rue was released in exchange for a pack of 
cigarettes about 3 am friday according to mrs mcqueen 
when negotiators told fane they would have to cut the phone heat 
and gas lines if he didnt release more hostages fane became angry 
mrs mcqueen said 
she said he warned negotiators if they killed him were all 
going to go up 
at about 8 am friday negotiators apparently said they would 
meet his demands including plexiglas a saw duct tape and arc 
welder and insulation if he would release two hostages 
fane agreed and the three women decided who would be freed by 
drawing different colored perm rods used to wave hair as if 
they were drawing straws 
mrs lordemann pulled the rod with the lightest color and 
remained as the lone hostage as sherri kuhlmann and mrs mcqueen 
escaped mrs mcqueen said 
london would not say what the package sent in to the gunman had 
in it but said it contained one of his demands 
fanes family said they blamed drugs for the actions of their 
son who had dropped out of the university of iowa his father dr 
larry fane of el compo texas said that his son recently received 
psychiatric treatment 
his mother kathy fane said she was in nebraska in early 
november to ask the sarpy county mental health board to commit her 
son for psychiatric treatment but the board declined to act

said i dont but age is creeping up on me i guess 64 years is 
long enough in the milk business 
stremsterfers father charles was a dairy farmer who started 
distributing his milk locally in 1909 by the time stremsterfer was 
8 he was working at the family dairy when he was in high school 
he would get up at 3 am deliver his milk then begin classes at 
745 
during my dating days said stremsterfer i used to get up 
at 130 in the morning and start delivering at 2 oclock 
sometimes id just take my date home and go back out on the milk 
route i was tired all the time 
stremsterfer dairy wagons were pulled then by two horses named 
kate and molly each horse knew the route so well that when there 
was a change the driver had a tough time keeping the horse from 
going the way she was used to 
we had those horses trained stremsterfer said my brother 
took one side of the street i took the other then wed whistle for 
the horses and theyd come to the end of the block 
in 1933 horsepower of a different kind replaced the kates and 
mollys of earlier years a new truck came to stremsterfer dairy the 
dairy had grown more customers were added and the job was getting 
too big for the horses 
i wore three of them out stremsterfer said 
being on the streets regularly in the middle of the night a 
milkman sees all sorts of things after the dairy got its truck 
stremsterfer frequently gave people rides as he made his rounds 
a lot of times youd meet couples out late walking along id 
take them home it used to be a saying about being out late we 
rode home with the milkman that was true 
as the dairy grew stremsterfer gradually took over for his 
father at its biggest stremsterfer dairy had three drivers and put 
out 75 cases of milk a day it also bottled milk for two smaller 
dairies in the area 
the customer who goes back the farthest with stremsterfer is hb 
hollis who has been in the insurance business as long as 
stremsterfer has delivered milk 
i started to take milk from him before i was married and i was 
married in 1937 hollis said i dont think we got over six 
gallons of sour milk in 50 years we always left the house 
unlocked and hed come in and put the milk and things in the 
refrigerator for us 
but after so many years the hollises will have a new milkman 
they said theyd probably get some young guy now 
stremsterfer said i said he may be younger than me but he wont 
be as goodlooking

union was largely missing tass reported saturday

gifts from father frost and santa claus from all over the world and 
never before was this favorite childrens holiday so sad the 
official soviet news agency reported in a dispatch from the armenian 
capital yerevan 
tass said its reporter asked one boy whose mother was killed in 
the quake in the city of spitak what he wanted from father frost 
the plump bearded man who brings gifts during new years 
let him return my mother replied armen kazaryan 8 who was 
hospitalized for a concussion 
an undetermined number of children were orphaned by the dec 7 
quake that ravaged northwestern armenia a 40day period of mourning 
was declared so the traditional new years spirit is missing tass 
reported 
thousands of people come these days to yerevan hospitals and 
clinics bringing for the quake survivors toys jams fruit sweets 
and clothes the news agency said 
an international red cross official reported from yerevan to his 
home office in geneva that volunteers made sure all 4500

more than 125 activists demonstrated 
saturday to protest the restart of the pilgrim nuclear power plant 
which the federal government once called one of the worstrun in the 
country 
plymouth police capt george madsen said 27 protesters were 
arrested on trespassing charges 
the plant shut down nearly three years ago 
on friday the nuclear regulatory commission cleared the way for 
the lowpower testing of the 670megawatt reactor for up to 5 
percent of its capacity and the plant started lowpower testing it 
should be at full power in four months 
the protesters members of the groups citizens for responsible 
energy and pilgrim alliance gathered at duxbury high school on 
saturday morning and positioned themselves at the entrance to one of 
two main gates around noon 
it was a symbolic show of our frustration of our determination 
not to go away said protester donald muirhead theres a lot of 
anger and frustration here with local and federal government 
families and teenagers wearing signs reading wheres the 
duke and mr edison will be back sang god bless america 
as the crowd listened to several speakers 
why are they still making these wasteful products with no place 
to dump them asked protester priscilla dean hatton of west 
yarmouth 
the demonstrators who were arrested were to be relased later 
saturday police said 
state officials have called pilgrims plan to be at full power 
within four months inadequate the state has vowed to do everything 
possible to keep the plant from operating 
pilgrim had been shut since april 1986 at which time the nrc 
called the reactor one of the worstrun nuclear plants in the 
country 
state officials including gov michael s dukakis and attorney 
general james shannon have maintained evacuation plans for those 
living near the plant are inadequate despite utility revisions and 
have said the plant should not reopen until a new study of leukemia 
rates in the population surrounding the plant is complete 
boston edison has spent about 200 million since the shutdown to 
replace nearly all of the plants top management remedy mechanical 
problems and fight skepticism by the nrc and a growing antinuclear 
movement among nearby residents 
last month massachusetts voters rejected a referendum question 
that would have permanently closed pilgrim and the yankee plant in 
rowe by outlawing commercial production of nuclear waste in the 
state 
if the plants restart schedule is followed consumers can 
receive power from pilgrim when it hits 10 percent operating 
capacity sometime next month 
by the end of january the plant should be at about 25 percent of 
power producing 100 megawatts daily or enough electricity to power 
160000 homes said boston edison spokeswoman elaine robinson 
the pilgrim plant must undergo another review by the nrc before 
it is granted permission to operate at full power a process that 
could take months

the food and drug administration has approved a 
test that can detect the sexually transmitted virus believed to be 
linked to the development of cervical cancer a baltimore newspaper 
reported saturday 
the test the first of its kind to gain fda approval screens for 
the presence of the human papilloma virus and is expected to be used 
by physicians and medical laboratories along with the pap smear 
which detects precancerous and cancerous cells on the cervix the 
sun reported 
the test has been awaited in the medical field where surveys 
indicate as many as 50 percent of the 40 million pap smears 
conducted each year are either misread or yield incorrect results 
sales of virapap could bring in as much as 35 million for its 
maker life technologies inc of gaithersburg md which makes 
diagnostic equipment and other supplies analysts say 
company officials have declined comment on the fda approval but 
have scheduled a news conference wednesday in new york city 
charles h kyper director of the premarket approval staff of 
the fdas office of device evaluation confirmed friday that final 
approval was sent to the company dec 23 
some physicians estimate as many as 10 percent of american women 
may be infected by hpv which causes venereal warts in both men and 
women and has been linked to cancerous cell changes of the genital 
tract 
right now we cant detect this virus readily and in an easily 
accessible fashion said dr gay m guzinski chief of benign 
gynecology at the university of maryland medical center if we 
could detect this virus early then we would have a group of 
patients that we ought to pay very close attention to 
the company expects to sell the tests to physicians and 
laboratories for 9 each patients probably will pay 35 to 40 for 
the test

here is a white house text of 
president reagans new years message to the people of the soviet 
union 
on behalf of the american people i send you greetings on the 
coming of the new year 
in your country and mine the new year is a time of hope and 
renewal never have these qualities of the spirit been more 
necessary than now as soviet armenia begins to heal from its wound 
you have our deepest sympathy you have our prayers and you have a 
personal hope from my wife nancy and me that in the effort to 
rebuild what was shattered you will find your solace 
i am confident that relations between our two countries will 
continue on the positive course they have followed in the year just 
ending and despite our disagreements we have been able to find 
some common ground when i visited moscow and met with president 
gorbachev we advanced our mutual understanding on the vital issues 
of human rights arms reductions regional problems and bilateral 
relations 
although much remains to be done we are making progress in all 
of those areas in moscow we signed the documents of ratification 
for the treaty eliminating an entire class of us and soviet 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles and the implementation of that 
historic treaty has proceeded smoothly 
soviet and american negotiators continued to discuss a 50 per 
cent reduction in strategic nuclear weapons and we are preparing to 
enter into new negotiations about conventional military forces in 
europe president gorbachev during his recent speech to the united 
nations announced significant reductions in soviet conventional 
forces this is certainly a step in the right direction of 
correcting the imblanaces in the european military situation but 
much more remains to be done thus while much has been accomplished 
in the areas of arms control and reductions we must continue 
efforts to ensure a lasting peace 
in human rights progress is being made in reunification of 
families freedom of people to travel as they please and in other 
areas the cessation of jamming is also a positive step for if we 
are to understand each other better we must be able to talk freely 
with each other and listen freely as well 
in bilateral relations for example in cultural and educational 
exchange improvements mean that the barriers that artificially 
separated our peoples are slowly being lowered 
and in regional issues from afghanistan to the persian gulf and 
southern africa solutions are being found to conflicts of many 
years standing perhaps your country will join ours in the effort 
to bring peace democracy and security to central america 
in all of these areas these improvements represent only the 
beginning of a long difficult road to better understanding and 
cooperation we are ready to continue moving along this road 
important differences remain between our countries and will continue 
for years to come but i am confident that we have been witness in 
1988 to progress that if we are careful and diligent can continue 
next year and during the years to come 
president gorbachevs visit to new york cut short by the 
catastrophe in armenia gave us a chance to meet once more during 
my term as president on january 20 george bush will be sworn in as 
my successor the american people have chosen him in part because he 
represents continuity in the policies foreign and domestic that 
the united states has pursued over the past eight years i know that 
mr bush will continue on the same course with equal commitment 
this is my final message to you as president and so let me 
close by saying this i believe the world is safer than it was a 
year ago and i pray it will be safer still a year from now i wish 
you the soviet people well in the new year thank you and may god 
bless you and keep you all the days of your life

talks aimed at creating a un force to 
monitor southwest africas transition from south african rule to 
independence bogged down saturday in a dispute over the estimated 
700 million cost 
the un security councils five permanent members including the 
united states and soviet union tried to slash the budget for the 
9500member force the permanent members will pay most of the 
peacekeeping bill 
but the nonaligned movement with six members on the 15nation 
council objected to the move and said the force should remain as 
proposed to prevent south africa from interfering in elections 
rebels fighting south african forces in southwest africa also 
known as namibia say the force should be increased and not reduced 
a week of negotiations to create the peacekeeping force to be 
known as the un transition assistance group were snarled saturday 
but are to continue tuesday 
the force is to be in place before april 1 when a sevenmonth 
transition period leading up to elections begins 
the five permanent members of the security council argue that a 
force of 7500 soldiers backed by 2000 civilians and police is 
unnecessary because tension has eased since the signing earlier this 
month of regional agreements among angola cuba and south africa 
under those pacts south africa will grant independence to 
namibia in 1991 in exchange for withdrawal of about 50000 cuba 
troops from angola to be completed the same year 
the un peacekeeping force will be the biggest since a 
19800man un contingent was deployed in the congo from 1960 to 
1964 
the five permanent members include britain china and france all 
with veto power over any resolution the other council members are 
italy japan west germany argentina and the nonaligned nations of 
brazil algeria nepal senegal yugoslavia and zambia 
us ambassador patricia m byrne deputy represenative said the 
five permanent members were ready to adopt a resolution directing 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to identify 
tangible costsaving measures in the force 
but then the nonaligned group presented new amendments she 
said without elaborating 
other diplomats said the amendments countered efforts at 
costcutting 
ms byrne said the amendments will be considered tuesday 
hidipo hamutenya information secretary of the southwest african 
peoples organization which has been fighting south african forces 
said if there ever was a need for a strong un military presence 
it is now 
jeremy shearar the south african un ambassador said 
costcutting was very important because anything we can save 
would better be used for the benefit of the inhabitants of namibia 
shearar also said that the namibian force will not be 
peacekeepers in the strict sense because namibian police forces will 
keep law and order before and during the elections planned for nov 
1 
the five permanent council members are assessed 57 percent of 
peacekeeping costs the united states which is assessed onequarter 
of the regular un budget would be expected to pay about 30 
percent for namibia and other operations

prime minister noboru takeshita accepted blame for 
the resignations of four cabinet ministers and acknowledged his 
scandalscarred government has lost public confidence in new years 
comments released sunday 
takeshita also said he wanted to expand relations with the soviet 
union and other asian countries and hoped soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev will visit japan in 1989 
two of the ministers resigned in a major stock scandal that has 
roiled japan and prompted the resignations of more than a dozen 
government and business leaders 
i am solely to blame for four ministers resigning takeshita 
said in a new years news conference held friday but embargoed until 
sunday somehow we have to regain the publics trust 
he did not make specific proposals 
takeshita has apologized indirectly for the scandal before 
saying every politican must conduct himself ethically however this 
was the first time he has laid the blame solely and explicitly on 
himself 
takeshitas cabinet has taken a beating in recent weeks despite 
the prime ministers success last month in pushing sweeping tax 
reform legislation through parliament 
justice minister takashi hasegawa resigned friday only three 
days after he was appointed in a cabinet shakeup after it was 
revealed he received political donations from a company embroiled in 
the stocktrading scandal he was appointed to investigate 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa stepped down early december 
after repeatedly changing his explanation of a close aides purchase 
of unlisted shares of the companys real estate subsidiary at 
bargain prices 
the director of the national land agency stepped down in may 
after he created a controversy by claiming japan was not responsible 
for world war ii and the chief of the defense agency resigned to 
take responsibility for a navy submarines collision with a fishing 
boat in july which left 30 people dead 
in foreign affairs takeshita pledged to keep usjapanese 
relations at the center of his foreign policy but he said he would 
extend japans diplomacy toward the soviet union asia and the 
pacific region 
tokyo and moscow never signed a peace treaty officially ending 
hostilities after world war ii largely due to a territorial dispute 
over a group of sovietheld islands off northern japan 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze visited japan last 
month the two sides did not reach agreement on the occupied 
territories but vowed to discuss the matter further 
takeshita said at the news conference that he hoped soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev will come to tokyo this year for the 
first visit to japan by a top soviet leader 
he also said he was looking forward to an early meeting with 
presidentelect bush in washington but he gave no date 
earlier plans for takeshita to visit washington in january were 
canceled ostensibly because of domestic political scheduling 
however the stock trading scandal and 87yearold emperor 
hirohitos prolonged illness may have been additional factors 
at his news conference takeshita did not mention the emperor 
who has been bedridden since sept 19 with internal hemorrhaging

a tanker trailer carrying thousands of 
pounds of a hazardous chemical burst into flames along an interstate 
highway forcing the evacuation saturday of several hundred people 
officials said 
no one was injured interstate 12 was closed officials said the 
evacuees were allowed to return home late saturday 
two hospitals in the area had been put on standby for possible 
evacuations but patients were not moved 
the truck carried 43000 pounds of a granular form of sodium 
hydrosulfite which is used as a commercial cleaner it burst into 
flames on interstate 12 about 25 miles north of new orleans about 
midnight said state police sgt john adams 
the cause of the fire was not immediately determined 
sodium hydrosulfite can produce irritating or poisonous gas as it 
burns adams said he said the material even when it is not on 
fire can burn the skin and is harmful if inhaled 
at midafternoon the fire had ebbed but was still smoldering 
adams said the cleanup was not expected to be finished until late 
saturday 
they brought in a frontend loader theyll wash the remaining 
chemical into the median dam it up and then vacuum it into tanker 
trucks that will haul it away he said 
state police said the two lanes of the interstate which were 
closed about 1230 am would probably not be opened before early 
evening or later the interstate runs eastwest north of lake 
pontchartrain 
we arent going to open it until we have the area cleaned up 
and are sure theres no danger adams said were routing 
traffic onto state highways so far its not causing any problems 
the driver of the truck richard c blanton of nashville tenn 
said he was headed west on the interstate about midnight when a 
motorist flagged him down and told him the trucks trailer was on 
fire blanton pulled over and unhitched the trailer leaving it 
beside the highway 
i looked back and saw flames shooting out of both sides of the 
trailer it seemed like instant fire i hadnt seen anything before 
the lady hollered at me blanton said 
blanton said the rig was owned by chattanooga orient express a 
trucking company out of chattanooga tenn 
it took me about 30 seconds to unhook and get out of there i 
went about a quarter of a mile down the highway i didnt know if 
that would be far enough i dont think a full state is far enough 
away right now blanton said as he watched his burning rig 
blanton said he had hauled hazardous chemicals before but never 
sodium hydrosulfite 
i saw a training film while it was being loaded he said 
the chemical belonged to the virginia chemical co of 
portsmouth va and was loaded at the bucks ala terminal adams

nazir jaafar of dearborn mich said the fbi told him they 
have no evidence against my son they didnt have any indication he 
was involved 
the times of london reported that sophisticated explosive 
equipment similar to that believed used in the bombing was found 
during a raid in west germany

missing from the crash in lockerbie scotland that killed 259 
people on the plane and left 11 people on the ground missing and 
presumed dead 
a police spokesman said helicopters and coast guard teams turned 
up nothing 
the times reported that investigators told scottish police the 
bomb that destroyed the boeing 747 was placed on board the flight in 
frankfurt the times did not name its sources 
the flight originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 and switched

being blamed for the lockerbie disaster the paper said 
in response to the reports west german interior ministry 
spokesman michael a butz said there is no indication that the 
explosives could have been put on board at frankfurt airport 
he said investigators described the times report as 
contradictory to evidence gathered 
the telegraph said some members of khalid jaafars family 
suspected he may have been used to plant the bomb and had provided 
details of his background and movements in europe to the fbi 
in washington the fbi refused comment on the report 
in his weekly radio message broadcast saturday from a friends 
estate in palm springs calif president reagan talked of the 
shock and horror of the jetliner bombing 
he made reference to a report overseen by presidentelect bush 
that advocates military action as an option against terrorists he 
said the report ought to be giving some people sleepless nights 
but did not elaborate 
an unidentified associate of the jaafar family was quoted as 
saying jaafars mother who lives in damascus is a first cousin of 
syrian president hafez assad the telegraph also said jaafar lived 
in frankfurt with some lebanesearab expatriates whom he did not 
know well 
his are exactly the type of relationships that we will be 
analyzing neil gallagher head of the fbis counterterrorism 
section was quoted as saying 
they asked me if i knew the guy who made that rumor the 
elder jaafar said of the fbi agents who interviewed him he said he 
told the fbi agents he had no idea where the report came from and 
that the agents told him they had no leads either 
jaafar filed a 50 million lawsuit against pan am on thursday 
alleging negligence 
czechoslovakia offered to send experts to help identify the 
explosive that blew up the jet following suggestions it might have 
been semtex semtex is an orangecolored plastic explosive 
manufactured in czechoslovakia 
the czechoslovak foreign ministry also denied czechoslovakia ever 
provided explosives to terrorists 
airports across asia tightened security after a warning that 
palestinian terrorists plan to attack a commercial airliner in the 
region by jan 10 
about two weeks before the pan am crash a caller claiming to 
speak for a terrorist group led by abu nidal warned the us embassy 
in helsinki finland that a pan american world airways jetliner 
flying from frankfurt to new york would be attacked however us 
officials have said the call was a hoax and its timing was a 
coincidence 
in seattle a boeing co spokesman said the plane that crashed 
carried 950 pounds of slightly radioactive depleted uranium in 
its tail section 
spokesman craig martin responding to reports in london that the 
plane contained uranium said the heavy metal used as a 
counterweight in 550 747s could have given off some airborne 
radiation for a short time if it oxidized in a fourhour fuel fire 
he said such a fire would be exceptionally unusual and did not 
occur in the crash of flight 103

president mikhail s gorbachev said in his new 
years message to the soviet people that his reform program is 
proceeding slower than hoped and told them not to expect manna 
from heaven 
in a televised address delivered 10 minutes before the kremlin 
chimes struck midnight gorbachev cited improvements in national 
income labor productivity housing food supply and in making 
soviet society more democratic 
the 57yearold kremlin leader said perestroika the russian 
word for restructuring used to describe his reforms improved the 
countrys economic political social and spiritual life 
but he added economic reform did not yet come into full play 
and the results cannot satisfy us shortages and other difficulties 
in our daily lives are still making themselves felt demand still 
outstrips supply especially when it comes to quality goods 
overall he said his reform program was sluggish 
perestroika gave rise to great expectations in society but 
changes are not coming as fast as we all would like them to the 
bespectacled gorbachev said as he sat at a desk with four white 
telephones and a lamp in what appeared to be his office 
we are not awaiting and are not promising manna from heaven 
knowing well that the burden of unresolved issues is heavy and our 
road is difficult he said 
in a new years message to the american people gorbachev said 
americans seem to be rediscovering the soviet union and we are 
rediscovering america fears and suspicion are gradually giving way 
to trust and feelings of mutual liking 
he cited global movement toward peace saying that 1988 is 
memorable for all of us as a year when we began reducing the most 
terrifying weapons nuclear weapons according a text released by 
the white house he said progress was made in the afghan civil war 
in the persian gulf war in the middle east and in other parts of 
the world 
the soviet leader also thanked the american people and others 
around the world for help in relief efforts after the december 
earthquake in soviet armenia 
in the message to his own people gorbachev after a year at the 
helm of a country that faced ethnic unrest political trouble in the 
baltics and other domestic problems took a deep breath and paused 
he said the end of 1988 was darkened by anguish over the 
earthquake in armenia which leveled dozens of villages and cities 
and is estimated to have killed about 25000 people he said the 
dec 7 quake was our common misfortune and promised the 
devastated area will be rebuilt 
the communist party chief said improvements in the nations 
economy will come in 1989 with expansion of a system in which 
factories and other businesses must become financially 
selfsufficient and widening of the nationwide network of 
cooperative or privately run businesses 
gorbachev and the kremlin leadership launched a major campaign in 
midyear to improve the supply and quality of food and consumer 
goods shortages of these items have led to notoriously long lines 
at shops to hoarding and corruption 
gorbachev got a taste of the peoples anger over the shortages 
during a trip to siberia in september residents shouted complaints 
to him about shortages of everything from meat to hot water 
the shortages were still felt acutely at new years the most 
joyous of soviet holidays when people try to prepare lavish feasts 
and exchange gifts among the hardtofind staples of holiday meals 
were chicken coffee sugar yeast and candy soviets were having a 
hard time finding certain toys cheap bath soap and other consumer 
goods 
angry soviets flooded newspapers with complaints one angry woman 
wrote to the literaturnaya gazeta newspaper on thursday that the 
absence of some goods in stores is clear sabotage and said those 
responsible should be put on trial 
gorbachevs new years message was quite similar to the last one 
on the eve of 1988 gorbachev said immense and hard work lay 
ahead in his drive for economic change 
on international affairs gorbachev said the cold war is winding 
down and that the soviet union has learned to listen to the opinions 
of other countries 
in his message to the soviet people he did not mention any 
specific accomplishments in world affairs in 1988 such as the 
agreement with the united states to destroy all medium and 
shorterrange nuclear missiles or goals for 1989 such as working 
out an agreement with the united states to slash arsenals of 
longrange nuclear weapons by 50 percent 
soviet television followed gorbachevs speech by shots of the 
kremlins spassky tower as its chimes rang 12 times at midnight 
1989 flashed on the screen in pink and the camera panned a 
snowy red square where the temperature was 18 degrees 
president reagan was scheduled to address the soviet people on 
television sunday

venezuela declared a moratorium on much 
of the nations 35 billion foreign debt saturday and announced new 
refinancing talks beginning in january 
president jaime lusinchi in his traditional yearend speech 
said amortization of the nations foreign bank debt included in a 
2034 billion refinancing pact will be suspended as of january 17 
he said new talks will begin in the first days of january 
the president said his decision was due to continued low oil 
prices and the broken promise by creditor banks to provide 
venezuela with voluntary new loans 
the move came a day after colombia for the first time suspended 
payments on its 165 billion foreign debt for three months while it 
awaited a new loan to help meet the payments 
i gave precise instructions to the finance minister dr hector 
hurtado to officially notify creditor banks that from january 17 
1989 onwards we will suspend amortization payments on all the 
foreign bank debt outstanding as of 1983 lusinchi said in his 
halfhour televised address 
the president also said he asked hurtado to schedule 
restructuring talks so that it can be repaid by venezuela without 
affecting its development needs 
venezuela latin americas fourthlargest debtor nation is 
scheduled to pay 700 million in principal next year under its 
current refinancing agreement its second since its debt crisis 
began in 1982 
it is one of the few major debtors to pay capital as well as 
interest and one of the few to avoid adopting an international 
monetary fund austerity program 
in 1988 it paid around 5 billion in principal and interest on 
public and private foreign debts while its total foreign exchange 
income is estimated to reach just 101 billion including 815 
billion from oil industry exports 
lusinchi placed venezuela among those debtor nations which 
consider themselves incapable of repaying their foreign debts under 
the current plan promoted by the united statess in which debtors 
adopt marketoriented economic reforms in return for financial help 
in paying off old debts 
the fall in oil prices the failure of the refinancings done up 
to now by debtor nations and the selfish lack of understanding on 
the part of creditor nations has put us all in an unsustainable 
situation which we cannot tolerate any longer he said 
the debt can never be repaid with more debt he said 
presidentelect carlos andres perez who will be inaugurated in 
february has called for a common latin american framework for 
future debt talks which would link debt payments to exports 
perez advisers have called for a new refinancing pact that would 
stretch out payments over up to 25 years and include several years 
of grace under its current 14year agreement venezuela would have 
to pay back its debt by 1999 
regarding the national economy lusinchi said venezuelas total 
output of goods and services in 1988 grew by 42 percent a 
onepercent increase over 1987 growth 
he said unemployment fell to 7 percent inflation which was 
running at 268 percent for the first 11 months of the year remains 
one of the fundamental problems of the venezuelan economy he 
said

president reagan and presidentelect bush will 
likely fight having to testify in oliver norths defense by using a 
separationofpowers argument and by contending that their testimony 
is not relevant sources said saturday 
bushs legal counsel boyden gray said he expects motions to 
quash norths subpoenas will be filed soon with legal briefs 
stressing the separationofpowers issue and the precedent that no 
us president has ever been required to take the stand in court 
i think thats going to happen he said when asked if the 
white house would fight the subpoenas that were delivered to the 
justice department on friday 
he said the issues of executive privilege and protection of 
classified materials would be part of the arguments if the decision 
for a motion to quash is made much of the information in the case 
involves national security matters and the governments desire to 
protect that is seen as a plus for norths case 
in addition government attorneys who have been preparing for 
the likelihood of the subpoenas for several months would also 
contend that testimony from reagan and bush is not relevant to 
norths defense according to sources who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
in palm springs calif where reagan was spending new years 
eve deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk would say 
only that the subpoena is currently under review he said he did 
not know whether attorneys were conferring on the subject over the 
holiday weekend 
popadiuk said reagan staying at the desert home of publishing 
magnate walter annenberg was told by his chief of staff kenneth n 
duberstein on friday that the subpoena had been served he said 
reagan had been told in advance that it was coming and therefore was 
not surprised 
the washington post quoted a white house official as saying 
under the condition of anonymity that reagan viewed the subpoena as 
an attempt to prod him into pardoning north before he leaves office 
jan 20 
popadiuk asked about this said i will not speculate on mr 
norths counsels motives 
one north attorney saturday told cbs news that other prominent 
figures in the irancontra affair also would be subpoenaed to 
testify 
asked if he would name former national security advisers john 
poindexter and robert mcfarland as among those likely to be called 
the unidentified lawyer said no i can not but theyd be the 
obvious ones that are involved in this matter 
during the congressional irancontra hearings north and his 
superior poindexter said they had no direct orders from reagan or 
bush then vice president to carry out the secret contra aid plan 
however one white house official close to the case acknowledged 
it would be very useful for north to have ronald reagans 
testimony to say that he wanted the contras supported 
constitutional expert laurence tribe of harvard university said 
that in calling reagan norths challenge would be to show he was 
carrying out specific orders of the president in his secret contra 
supply operation 
norths trial is to begin jan 31 on charges stemming from the 
us arms sales to iran and diversion of proceeds to the contra 
rebels in nicaragua 
he is charged with conspiring with poindexter and arms dealers to 
illegally divert more than 12 million in armssales profits to the 
contras 
white house legal counsel ab culvahouse jr declined comment on 
the matter saturday 
reagan remained out of reporters range as he vacationed in 
california where he traditionally spends new years eve partying at 
the rancho mirage estate of publisher walter annenberg his longtime 
friend 
bush also was in seclusion spending a long holiday weekend with 
his wife barbara at the presidential retreat of camp david md 
spokesmen for the two declined comment on the personal reactions 
of bush and reagan to the subpoenas 
bush press secretary sheila tate said attorneys were looking at 
some very serious legal and constitutional issues and there would 
be no comment the white house said friday it would be premature to 
respond 
written questions and answers however apparently would not be a 
problem for reagan and bush the white house statement said 
historical precedent would point in that direction rather than court 
appearances 
tribe contended that bush who will be president by the time the 
trial starts would have a better chance than reagan to fight off 
the subpoena 
bushs argument could be fairly plausible on two fronts 
tribe said in a telephone interview from denver 
first reagan was norths boss while bush has said he was out 
of the loop on most of the matters in question 
second as a sitting president bush might invoke an executive 
privilege stating that involvement in the trial would interfere with 
his national duties 
regarding bush tribe said north would have to make a very 
strong showing which i think is very unlikely 
almost anything he would have to prove through bush could be 
shown through preexisting documents or written answers and second 
any alleged need to crossexamine the president would necessarily be 
quite speculative in light of the presidentelects own assertion 
that he was out of the loop 
reagan on the other hand will no longer be president when the 
trial begins and thus would have a harder time making the executive 
privilege argument 
i think theres a very good chance hell have to testify 
tribe said 
a white house official told the washington post that reagan 
viewed the subpoena as an attempt to prod him into pardoning north 
reagan has said however that justice should be allowed to take its 
course and the case should be decided at trial 
one attorney close to the case said the institution of the 
presidency and the reticence to set a precedent of having a 
president testify are central to arguments against the subpoenas 
the case could pose a nettlesome issue for bush early in his 
presidency reviving questions that dogged him through much of his 
presidential campaign 
the congressional irancontra investigating committees concluded 
last year that there was no evidence bush knew of the diversion plan 
but questions have continued to crop up on how bush could not 
have known about norths secret operation to supply the contras 
during the congressional ban on aid when his national security 
adviser donald gregg was informed on the matter 
the irancontra committees concluded gregg was told of norths 
operation in august 1986 but he testified he did not consider the 
matter worthy of bushs attention even after a supply plane piloted 
by americans was shot down by the nicaraguans and the us 
government disavowed any connection with it 
in addition bush met with former cia operative felix rodriguez 
a gregg associate and an operative of norths in the contra 
operation according to committee testimony but they said they 
discussed rodriguez activities in el salvador not the contras

of oil spilled from a damaged barge a us fish and wildlife 
service official said 
the growing numbers and worsening condition of some birds at a 
treatment facility in the ocean shores convention center may require 
that more be euthanized said don kane of the fish and wildlife 
service 
searchers had found more than 220 live oilcoated birds by 
midday saturday bringing the total number of birds awaiting or 
receiving treatment to about 1500

daily basis to see if more should be euthanized spokesman mark 
stewart of the state division of emergency management said 350 birds 
were euthanized friday 
kane said they considered not just the condition of the birds 
but how sensitive each species is to oil and the resources available 
to treat them at the center he said 348 of the birds were murres 
and two were grebes 
at the center volunteers were scrubbing the birds with detergent 
to remove the oil those that regain their buoyancy eventually are 
returned to the wild 
more than 1000 other birds that had already died from the spill 
have been collected along 200 miles of coastline from newport 
ore to jefferson county wash including wilderness beaches of

a hospital overrode a jehovahs witnesses 
objections to a blood transfusion despite protests that it went 
against her religion her lawyer called the hospitals action 
medical rape 
the hospital said it was in the patients best interest 
three people were arrested at the womans bedside when they tried 
to stop the transfusion 
jehovahs witnesses base their objection to blood transfusions on 
a passage in the book of leviticus that reads whatsoever man 
eats any manner of blood i will cut him off from among his people 
denise nicoleau delivered a healthy girl on thursday but 
developed complications later the family had requested prior to 
the caesarean delivery that no transfusions be performed even as 
a lifesaving measure 
the brookhaven memorial hospital obtained a court order to give 
the transfusion 
don ridley an attorney for the nicoleau family called the 
hospitals action medical rape 
ed kornrieche a lawyer for the hospital said the welfare of the 
mother and child prompted the hospital to seek the order

we obtained a court order granting that he said 
mrs nicoleau who is in her 30s and lives in moriches was in 
critical condition saturday said hospital spokesman richard semple

federal regulators working against a midnight 
deadline wrapped up the final rescue packages for insolvent savings 
and loan associations saturday completing bailout deals for all of 
1988 that will likely cost the government in excess of 38 billion 
in just the final 48 hours of frenzied negotiations the federal 
home loan bank board accepted packages that provided almost 6 
billion in assistance the bulk of that coming in 4 billion 
bailouts involving some of the sickest sampls in the country 
the final tally of insolvent sampls closed by the government and 
taken over by new investors totaled 217 for the year that put the 
number of failed sampls at a 50year high exceeded only by 277 
institutions that were closed in 1938 during the great depression 
by contrast only 48 institutions were closed in 1987 
five of the institutions closed on the final day of 1988 were in 
california one was in florida and another was in south dakota 
negotiators wrapped up the final bailout only hours before a 
midnight deadline that would effectively cut tax breaks in half for 
purchasers 
the final sampl closed in 1988 was one of the largest the beverly 
hills savings and loan association a giant california institution 
which had plagued regulators for years 
beverly hills had been the first institution placed in the 
agencys management consignment program where the sickest 
institutions were warehoused because the agency could not find 
buyers but did not have the funds to close the institutions and pay 
off depositors 
the bailout packaged called for the government to provide 983 
million in assistance in the sale of beverly hills to michigan 
national corp a bank holding company in farmington hills mich 
for its part the michigan bank agreed to put up 52 million to 
purchase the giant sampl 
attorneys representing the government and the michigan bank had 
haggled for most of the day over details of the complex sale in 
another buyout which had taken several hours to complete the 
government agreed to inject into a florida deal 1511 million in 
aid for the purchase of the insolvent broward federal savings and 
loan of sunrise fla by a subsidiary of the los angelesbased 
california savings and loan association 
bank board chairman m danny wall said he believed the deadline 
had been a good thing for the government in its effort to finally 
close the books and stop the hemorrhage of funds at sampls that have 
been technically insolvent for years 
he said the shutdown of the sick sampls should have a beneficial 
effect on the industry as a whole by lowering the cost of funds for 
healthy institutions that had been competing against the high rates 
weak sampls were forced to pay to attract depositors 
wall defended his agency against charges by critics that the 
agreements represented sweetheart deals that had been 
unnecessarily generous to the buyers who have included such wealthy 
investors as texas billionaire robert bass revlon cosmetics 
chairman ronald o perelman and the ford motor co 
these are not precipitous actions he said this has been a 
very extensive and exhaustive process culminating in the final 
decisions 
wall said the cost of simply closing down the sampls and paying off 
depositors up to the 100000 insurance limit would have been far 
more xpensive than the 38 billion in projected costs for all the 
agreements reached in 1988 
but the sampl crisis will present presidentelect bush with one of 
its first headaches as he is forced to come up with ways to boost 
government spending to clean up the mess while at the same time 
trying to fulfill his campaign pledge of lowering the budget deficit 
without raising taxes 
the bank board saved some of the biggest bailouts until last 
announcing commitments within a space of two hours on friday night 
that will transfer close to 4 billion in government aid to three 
investment groups 
in the largest transaction first nationwide financial corp the 
sampl subsidiary of the ford motor co received 16 billion in 
government assistance in the purchase of four failed sampls in denver 
chicago and cleveland 
the failed institutions had assets of 8 billion and when they 
are merged into the first nationwide network the automaker will 
have the countrys second largest sampl business with assets 
exceeding 34 billion 
the largest sampl is home savings of america based in irwindale 
calif 
the other two big takeovers announced late friday involved the 
purchase of the insolvent united savings association of texas one 
of the biggest troubled texas sampls by a group headed by new york 
investment banker lewis ranieri who received 137 billion in 
government assistance in making the purchase 
the third megadeal involved a pledge by the government to provide 
1 billion to assist golden west financial corp of oakland calif 
in managing two large insolvent florida institutions beach federal 
savings and loan in boynton beach and new metropolitan federal 
savings and loan of hialeah

president daniel ortega blamed the 
united states capitalism and hurricane joan for nicaraguas 
shattered economy in his yearend speech to the nation saturday and 
rejected new talks with the rebels 
ortega also was quoted saturday as saying astronomical inflation 
will get worse before it gets better 
nicaragua suffers 21000 percent inflation one of the highest 
rates in the world ortega was quoted as saying while we are in 
war the inflation will continue to rise ortega told barricada 
the official newspaper of the ruling sandinista party 
usbacked rebels known as contras have been trying to oust the 
leftist government of nicaragua since 1981 two years after the 
revolution in which the sandinistas took power from the rightist 
somoza family dictatorship 
most of the sandinistas promises of a more just society remain 
unfulfilled because of poor economic management and the war which 
ortega says has killed 29113 people and done more than 12 billion 
in economic damage 
a ceasefire and cutoff of us military aid to the rebels have 
reduced fighting to small skirmishes most of this year but talks on 
a permanent peace broke down in september 
in his nationally broadcast speech to diplomats state workers 
and others at a military school in the capital ortega rejected the 
latest contra proposals for peace talks including one for a january 
round in washington 
this is an unburied monster he said of the rebels it 
gives off a stench in all directions it tosses out one reeking 
proposal here and another there one cant tell which is from the 
united states which ultimately is the one that arms this monster 
and doesnt know where to bury it or how to bury it 
but he also said the sandinistas were unilaterally extending the 
ceasefire another month and that nicaragua is ready to look for 
ways to coexist with the enemies of the revolution 
bosco matamoros a contra spokesman called ortegas speech 
lamentable 
we thought that with the new year we could open the hopes for 
peace and democracy in nicaragua he said in a telephone interview 
in washington apparently mr ortegas concern for the process of 
negotiation seems to be once again only his desire to remain in 
power 
the sandinista government and the contras agreed march 21 to 
suspend offensive operations but talks aimed at a permanent end to 
the 7yearold war stand at an impasse 
ortega said the united states is still arming the contras despite 
the official end to overt military aid in february the month before 
the ceasefire agreement was signed 
he blamed the sustained aggression of the united states the 
capitalism of developed nations and the devastating october 
hurricane for nicaraguas worsening economic crisis 
hurricane joan which ortega called the most dramatic moment of 
his presidency struck the atlantic coast destroying several cities 
and scores of villages before sweeping across the country ortega 
said it did 828 million in direct damage 
ortega ended his twohour speech with a tirade against president 
reagan describing him as a terrorist and obsessed he 
repeated his assertion that the united states might invade nicaragua 
he said the 1989 sandinista economic policy would use continued 
subsidies on rice beans and sugar for government workers and 
military families 
the average nicaraguan worker earns about 10 a month which is 
insufficient even for basic food needs 
ortega also promised a cut in defense spending which is about 60 
percent of the national budget in 1989 the vast majority of 
nicaraguas military and economic aid comes from the soviet union 
and its allies 
he said imports will be severely restricted in a moneysaving 
measure we arent going to import even one more typewriter 
ortega vowed 
in the barricada interview ortega said nicaraguans must wait for 
prosperity until the government is secure against the rebels 
official sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said ortega 
is going to cuba for the 30th anniversary celebration of the cuban 
revolution the sources did not say when he was leaving the 
anniversary is sunday

a recently discovered 1964 memo concerning 
leaks at a federally owned uranium processing plant throws all the 
plants data into doubt a scientist said 
the memo written by the staff of the feed materials production 
center at fernald ohio said a study by plant operators in 1961 
found emissions of up to 1000 pounds each month that year 
possibly 12000 pounds from fernalds plant 8 
that total is nearly 24 times the us department of energys 
estimate of 462 pounds of uranium emissions from plant 8 in 1961 
the memos discovery follows the governments admission in 
october that the complex had released 54000 more pounds of uranium 
than its estimates showed after those estimates already had been 
revised upward in 1985 1986 and 1987 
lawyers representing fernaldarea residents said friday they 
found the memo among 30000 documents submitted by the federal 
goverment 
this is a truly extraordinary document said arjun makhijani 
a maryland environmental scientist his 1987 study of fernald 
emissions concluded that government reports severely underestimated 
the problem 
the memo was written by the engineering staff of national lead of 
ohio the plants operator from 1951 through 1985 as part of an 
internal investigation of unexplained losses of uranium from one 
part of the complex 
the plant which national lead operated under contract with the 
federal government processes uranium for the us nuclear weapons 
program 
us rep thomas luken dohio said he would hold more 
congressional hearings on the plant because of the discrepancy 
between the newly discovered data and the most recent federal 
figures 
james reafsnyder doe site manager at fernald since 1985 said 
the memos numbers may be included in revised estimates that will be 
released in the next few months he declined to comment on the memo

the turmoil remained glass shards from smashed car windows pieces 
of cement blocks and blackened remains of burned tires 
leaders of saturdays opposition rally which also marked the eve 
of the anniversary of national independence in 1956 said the strife 
stemmed from the peoples desire for peace not just from

sales tax it also wanted salary increases of 50 percent to 300 
percent decreed a week ago for all public and private employees to 
be made retroactive to july 1 instead of dec 1 
in an emergency session on thursday prime minister sadek mahdis 
cabinet met the two requests

sudans civil war demonstrators protested mahdis failure to 
officially endorse a tentative peace accord the democratic unionist 
party a junior partner in his coalition cabinet signed with 
southern rebels on nov 16 
the agreement called for a peace conference to be convened on 
dec 31 with an immediate ceasefire in the 5 yearold war and 
suspension of islamic law which the christian and animist rebels 
oppose

more than 6000 students in chicagos elementary 
and high schools attended classes without instructors on an average 
day this fall due to teacher absenteeism and a lack of substitutes 
according to a published report 
the average of 6540 students in classrooms without teachers each 
day during the first four months of the school year is a drastic 
increase over the average found in the early months of the 198788 
school year when 2340 students were without regular teachers or 
substitutes on a typical day the chicago tribune reported in 
sundays editions 
chicago teachers take an average 11 sick days a year one more 
than is provided under their labor contract without losing pay 
nearly double the national average the tribune said 
chicago teachers union spokesman chuck burdeen disputed those 
figures saturday but acknowledged there is a high level of sick 
leave if its higher in chicago thats something wed have to 
look at 
the solution is to find out what causes the illnesses and to 
recognize too that teaching as a profession has a high level of 
illness that goes with the territory burdeen said 
one of the problems is the chicago school board has not been 
able to develop a substantial daytoday substitute base he said 
youre dealing with a situation thats just characteristic of 
teaching in chicago with salary disputes and other friction with 
the school board burdeen said substitutes say why should i 
teach in a city where they dont respect teachers 
school board president frank gardner promised to look into the 
problem when it was disclosed in a series of tribune articles this 
past spring 
but gardner said last week the investigation into classrooms 
without teachers has taken a back seat to more pressing matters 
like the recently enacted school reform package the newspaper said 
the tribune said its investigation found that about 6 percent of 
the districts approximately 28000 teachers missed school on any 
given day this fall compared with 55 percent last fall 
gardner said that by working with representatives of the teachers 
union we might be able to strengthen the program where teachers 
are rewarded to teach and lessen the need for sick time 
officials say the problem is aggravated by substitutes ability 
to refuse assignments to specific schools 
but the tribune said sharon goldberg director of the public 
schools substitute teacher center and her boss assistant 
superintendent charles d almo were off work last week for the 
holidays and unavailable to explain the increase in absenteeism

am flight 103 it would show the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini was 
frantic about opposition to his continued rule 
investigators probing the pan am wreckage in scotland have 
concluded that a bomb caused the dec 21 crash but they have 
reported no evidence that iran was involved 
reza pahlavi the oldest son of the late shah of iran issued a 
statement friday after several news organizations in london received 
anonymous telephone demands that the united states deport him or 
risk another terrorist bombing like the one that destroyed the pan 
am jet all 259 people aboard the plane were killed 
the caller claimed to represent a terror group known as guardians 
of the islamic revolution which in similar calls last week took 
responsibility for the air disaster over scotland 
if this is true it is clearly a fresh indication that 
khomeinis terrorist agents are still hard at work around the 
globe pahlavi said

parliament approved a historic freetrade 
agreement between the united states and canada clearing the last 
legal hurdle for the pact between the worlds largest trading 
partners to begin at midnight tonight 
the senate vote on friday ended three years of often heated 
debate president reagan and prime minister brian mulroney signed 
the treaty last jan 2 but the pact required canadian legislative 
approval 
in between the freetrade issue became the focal point of the 
national elections won on nov 21 by mulroneys progressive 
conservatives opponents claimed the agreement would cost canadians 
their jobs and make them an economic underling to their financially 
stronger southern neighbor 
others claimed the pact would ultimately cost them their economic 
freedom 
even though we intend to acquiesce and the bill will become 
law our concerns have not disappeared allan maceachen the 
liberals leader in the senate said during the debate the 
government has chosen the hard discpline of the market we will have 
to monitor whether the market does its job

president reagan and presidentelect bush will 
likely fight having to testify in oliver norths defense by using a 
separationofpowers argument and by contending that their testimony 
is not relevant sources said saturday 
bushs legal counsel boyden gray said he expects motions to 
quash norths subpoenas will be filed soon with legal briefs 
stressing the separationofpowers issue and the precedent that no 
us president has ever been required to take the stand in court 
i think thats going to happen he said when asked if the 
white house would fight the subpoenas that were delivered to the 
justice department on friday 
he said the issues of executive privilege and protection of 
classified materials would be part of the arguments if the decision 
for a motion to quash is made much of the information in the case 
involves national security matters and the governments desire to 
protect that is seen as a plus for norths case

the dream of overthrowing fidel castro remains alive 
for many cuban exiles here even as the communist leader sunday marks 
the 30th anniversary of his takeover of the island 90 miles south of 
florida 
but the strategies for dumping castro have been changing for all 
but a few diehards since the early years of invasion plots hatched 
in miami restaurants and guerrilla training in the everglades 
many cubans interviewed here in recent weeks see their role as 
lobbying us politicians to keep up the pressure on castro and if 
his communist rule ends helping reconstruct postcastro cuba 
without actually moving there 
the cuban community is more pluralistic today said jaime 
suchlicki cubanborn university of miami director of interamerican 
studies some people want relations some people dont some

taking effect sunday believe the pact will bring major benefits and 
eventual changes to both countries

the agreement 
squabbling over the agreement continued as the senate on friday 
passed the legislation removing the last remaining trade barriers 
between the two nations the pact was approved by the house of 
commons on dec 24 
prime minister brian mulroney believes the pact ardently 
supported by canadian business looking to the larger export market 
will produce a net increase of about 250000 jobs in canada in the 
next 10 years

when the black widow went down in a sheet of 
flame luck was riding along 
thats the consensus at a strategic air command base in northern 
michigan where base personnel have survived two fiery plane crashes 
in three months 
theyre saying gods area code is 906 said terry prout a 
civilian who manages the airfield at the ki sawyer air force base 
black widow was the nickname of the b52h stratofortress bomber 
that crashed dec 6 on sawyers main runway the plane the 
militarys largest bomber is designed to carry nuclear bombs but 
the air force said no weapons were aboard 
all eight sawyer airmen survived the explosive crash though six 
remain hospitalized with broken bones and related injuries 
on oct 11 at a sister sac base wurtsmith in michigans 
northern lower peninsula a kc135 stratotanker refueling plane 
crashed killing six crewmembers based there but 10 others aboard 
all from sawyer escaped from the burning wreckage 
for all 10 from sawyer to survive wurtsmith and for all to 
survive here somebodys looking out for us prout said 
although in the words of col eldon joersz commander of the 
410th bombardment wing at sawyer the base pressed on without a 
hiccup the crashes affected everyone its a very personal 
thing he said 
on a snowy afternoon at sawyer recently six men being briefed 
for a b52 flight were headed out for a routine twohour mission 
but what about the crash just a few weeks before 
lt col gordon platt shrugged in his heavy flight jacket 
the best thing to do is to get back up in the air he said 
otherwise its hard to get your feelings squared away 
personally the flight crew leader was unconcerned 
i like to be flying again part of our job is to fly he said 
over and over people at the base repeat that philosophy 
if they were scared theyre certainly not showing it theres 
an importance of getting back into the saddle prout said from his 
office in the control tower 
master sgt david derouin agreed the airfield manager has seen 
many crashes in 17 years with the air force he said the b52 crash 
was the worst 
it occurred at 115 am as a flight crew came back from a 
sevenhour mission that had taken them west most likely through 
montana wyoming or the dakotas and back to their home base by lake 
superior they practiced touchandgo landings before calling it a 
night 
as the 160foot stratofortress swooped into the air it exploded 
witnesses say the b52 burst into flames and broke apart about 50 
feet off the ground 
any higher the fall to the runway would have killed the 
crewmembers derouin said any lower the explosion would have 
crushed them he said 
he was at the scene within 20 minutes as crew members still were 
being pulled from the wreckage the b52 was scattered along 
thousands of feet of runway much of it was burning 
that surprised me that they were alive derouin said 
the air force listed the value of the plane at 541 million 
my first comment was everyone was alive so that airplane means 
nothing derouin said 
those who saw the crash say it was preceded by a brilliant flash 
of light then the blast from the explosion before the bomber 
dropped to earth 
they said it was a large plume of flame moving down the 
runway derouin said 
the crash sent waves throughout the strategic air command which 
keeps the bombers on alert to respond to any nuclear attack 
sac officials temporarily grounded the nations b52 fleet of 
about 250 planes for extensive fuel system checks sawyers wing 
remained idle for nine days while military investigators poked 
through the charred wreckage scattered on the runway 
there is no official word on the cause of the crash but sawyers 
b52 flight crews have been ordered to watch for overheating fuel 
pumps 
undamaged is the confidence among sawyer pilots in the b52 even 
though the 26yearold plane is older than many of those aboard 
i enjoy flying the b52 its a venerable old lady said lt 
col john walther the assistant deputy commander of operations at 
sawyer as he sat in his flight suit ready to go out 
but he too saw the wreckage and knew the people who had been 
aboard i couldnt believe anyone lived walther said i 
realized we in fact had a miracle

dinosaurs are a kiddie rage these days there are 
dinosaur toys books tshirts games party favors 
the great dinosaur hunt tonight on pbs the infinite 
voyage and next week in syndication is not a kids show though 
some dinosaurcrazy youngsters might find it interesting 
this fascinating documentary is taken up not with childish 
fantasies but more adult considerations such as the history of 
dinosaur study and presentday scientific methods that have produced 
remarkable new theories about the excritters 
the new theories rather than drying out the subject give new 
life to the dinosaurs of childhood imagination according to various 
scientists the vast array of dinosaur species were active hunters 
aggressive fighters nurturing mothers sociable herd members 
scavengers and sophisticated communicators 
natures special effects they are called by museum curator 
robert bakker a harvard phd scientist and author of the 
dinosaur heresies whose waistlength hair and a beard symbolize 
his maverick ideas bakker believes that contrary to longheld 
popular and scientific belief dinosaurs were not stupid 
coldblooded reptiles but a unique warmblooded active animal 
bakker supported his theory by studying dinosaur tracks 
discovered in a riverbed near glen rose texas by comparing the 
estimated height of the animals leg with the distance between the 
tracks bakker concluded that it traveled at a brisk 8 mph or so 
faster than a pack of wolves not at the sluggish speed of a 
coldblooded reptile lazily foraging for food 
their world was not one of the coldblooded shuffle but of the 
hotblooded cruise he says 
phillip currie studied mysterious bone beds in alberta 
canada and developed the theory that they were the remains of 
members of a dinosaur herd who died trying to ford a river en masse 
as herding animals still sometimes do today later another species 
of dinosaur fed on the remains currie found bite marks on the 
bones and added more fossils to the bone beds 
paleontologist jack horners study of dinosaur eggs revealed that 
some species emerged fully developed and ready to run off in search 
of food while others needed lengthy nurturing in the nest they 
later became predator and prey 
david weishampel studied the unexplained hollow crest that topped 
the heads of some dinosaur species and concluded that it provided an 
amplification tunnel between vocal box and snout by reconstructing 
the crest with plastic tubing he produces a lowfrequency bellow 
that the animals probably used more than 70 million years ago to 
communicate with each other a lowfrequency noise not unlike the 
bellow of an elephant would have carried a long distance but been 
difficult for a predator such as tyrannosaurus rex to locate 
bakker believes that rather than dying out completely dinosaurs 
were the predecessors of todays 8400 species of birds by studying 
a species of dinosaur closely related to t rex as he 
affectionately calls the megalizard bakker concluded that the 
structural similarities between dinosaurs and modern birds made them 
obvious relatives 
so when you look at your canary youre seeing a bit of t 
rex bakker says 
the demise of the dinosaurs remains a mystery they could have 
died of a widespread virus or they might have been the victims of a 
sudden cataclysm such as a collision between earth and a giant 
meteor 
evolutionary biologist stephen jay gould of harvard university 
says the dinosaurs ruled the earth for 140 million years while 
mammals were small creatures that occupied the nooks and crannies of 
their world so theres no reason that they might not have continued 
their reign another 60 million years leaving mammals to be inferior 
and dominated 
lest we look back with pity on the poor longdead dinosaur 
gould cheerfully points out all species eventually become 
extinct

for stock market investors 1988 was a sort of 
scavenger hunt 
traditional investment profits were harder to come by during the 
year than they had been all through the great bull market of 198287 
but picking among the debris left by the crash the previous 
october traders were able to find some profitable bargains 
to no ones surprise the list of the years biggest winners is 
dominated by stocks that attracted takeover and buyout bids 
for example bormans the detroit supermarket chain that caught 
the fancy of the great alantic amp pacific tea co tripled in price 
rjr nabisco subject of the biggest bidding competition ever in 
this country doubled from 45 at yearend 1987 to around 90 in the 
waning days of 1988 as the buyout firm of kohlberg kravis roberts amp 
co prepared to take the company over 
pennwalt holly farms and del webb corp chalked up gains ranging 
from 103 to 133 percent 
and any compilation of winners from the list of stocks that are 
still trading does not show issues of companies swallowed up before 
yearend such as kraft and federated department stores 
takeover news and speculation helped the overall market finish 
the year sporting some respectable numbers 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials after slipping 036 to 
216857 in the past week closed out 1988 with a net gain of 22974 
points or 1185 percent 
that marked the first time the average finished a year above 
2000 although it remains far below its aug 25 1987 reading of 
272242 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 20 at 15626 the nasdaq composite index for the 
overthecounter market up 404 at 38138 and the american stock 
exchange market value index up 379 at 30601 
volume on the big board averaged 11415 million shares a day 
against 14057 million the week before 
the dows 1988 rise qualified as above average since it 
topped the longterm standard benchmark of 9 percent a year but 
that showing failed to inspire many investors who had been scared 
off by the crash 
for the first time since 1977 trading volume declined in all the 
major markets 
on the nyse activity was off nearly 15 percent from its record 
pace in 1987 at the amex the decline was about 29 percent 
that went a long way toward explaining the lack of enthusiasm 
most brokers felt about the markets performance 
for the vast majority of us in the investment business 1988 
has been far from above average said edward nicoski at piper 
jaffray amp hopwood in minneapolis 
the financial community which has endured periodic bouts of 
layoffs ever since the crash is braced for more job losses if 
business doesnt pick up early in 1989 
the yearend forecasts of several leading brokerage houses lack 
their usual upbeat sparkle focusing on prospective trading 
ranges for stock prices and slower growth in the economy and 
corporate earnings 
it doesnt help wall streets morale much that in the tokyo stock 
market the bulls are still thriving japans nikkei index climbed 42 
percent over the year passing a milestone at 30000 and closing at 
a new peak of 3015900 
still amid the gloom in the us markets some analysts see 
opportunities for a pleasant surprise 
as long as investors are nervous expect higher prices 
declares norman fosback editor of several investment advisory 
letters published in fort lauderdale fla 
heres why when investors are rampantly bullish everyone is 
most likely to have bought and with buying power exhausted stock 
prices have nowhere to go but down but when everyone is nervous and 
afraid to buy buying power builds by the day 
stocks are on the soundest fundamental footing in several 
years fosback concludes he recommends buying and owning stocks 
to profit from the bull market rally that is still to come
