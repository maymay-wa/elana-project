the connecticut senate on friday approved 
a bill guaranteeing a womans right to choose abortion even if the 
us supreme court overturns its 1973 roe vs wade decision 
legalizing abortion 
the bill effectively codifies into state law much of roe vs 
wade making connecticut the first state to take such action it 
now goes to democratic gov william a oneill who has said he 
will sign it 
even if the supreme court were to reverse roe v wade this 
statute would be the governing standard for the state of 
connecticut said sen richard blumenthal the democratic 
vicechairman of the judiciary committee and a cosponsor of the 
bill 
i think what the supreme court is saying in effect to the 
states is were going to turn this issue over to you 
connecticut has taken the gauntlet and said were ready to face 
that issue and were going to be prochoice he said 
the legislature was spurred to address the issue in part because 
of last summers supreme court decision in webster vs reproductive 
health services of missouri which gave states greater latitude to 
restrict abortion 
the measure which also repeals the states unenforced 
antiabortion statutes requires girls 15 and under to get 
counseling before an abortion and encourages them to tell their 
parents 
because the bill contains the counseling provisions the 
prolife council of connecticut as well as prochoice activists 
have claimed victory with its approval 
a similar bill approved by the new hampshire legislature was 
vetoed earlier this year by gov judd gregg and an effort to 
override the veto failed last week 
proponents argued the new hampshire measure merely wrote into 
state law the guidelines of roe vs wade but judd said the measure 
would have gone farther allowing abortions until the point a 
womans doctor determined the fetus could survive outside the womb 
the connecticut bill in a slight variation on the roe vs wade 
decision allows abortions late in pregnancy when the fetus is 
capable of living outside the womb only when the life or health 
of the mother is in danger 
now that weve placed roe vs wade in connecticuts law books 
we need to fight hard to protect it said betsy wacker of the 
connecticut branch of the national abortion rights action league 
which lobbied for portions of the bill 
a naral statement said last summers supreme court decision 
sounded an alarm which woke up the prochoice majority 
the senate vote came after about 45 minutes of debate and was 
witnessed by numerous house members who had endured five hours of 
debate on the bill last week 
the senate easily rejected three republican amendments one of 
which would have restored criminal sanctions against anyone 
performing an abortion and permitted the father or grandparent of 
the fetus to sue for 10000 in damages that was rejected 314 
another amendment rejected 278 would have required minors to 
notify parents before an abortion could be performed the bill as 
approved requires girls 15 and under to get counseling before an 
abortion but it only encourages them to talk with their parents 
beforehand 
its a sad day in the state of connecticut when we would 
intervene to deny parents fundamental rights said sen thomas 
scott republican sponsor of the parental notification amendment 
allowing a child to make such a decision on her own scott added 
is unconscionable 
but sen lee scarpetti also a republican said that all the 
laws in the world wont change family relationships

thousands of riot police firing tear 
gas stormed the worlds largest shipyard at dawn saturday to expel 
striking workers armed with steel pipes propane gas tanks and 
homemade cannons 
the crushing of the strike at the hyundai shipyard sparked a 
massive street protest by thousands of workers militants hurled 
rocks and firebombs and fought police in handtohand combat 
two police buses were torched and burned one armored van used 
to fire tear gas was destroyed and at least 10 other police 
vehicles were damaged in the fighting on streets near the shipyard 
major streets were closed and air flights were canceled into 
ulsan 
some estimates said as many as 20000 workers were involved in 
the protests many from affiliated hyundai companies in the ulsan 
area 
initial police reports said about 300 workers were arrested and 
at least 20 people were injured in the storming of the shipyard 
there were no immediate casualty figures from the street fighting 
the threedayold strike had shut down the hyundai heavy 
industries co shipyard in this city about 200 miles southeast of 
seoul and was threatening to spread to other industries 
talks to try to end the strike which centered on worker demands 
to free four jailed labor leaders had broken down hours earlier 
authorities said the strike was illegal 
police bulldozers ripped down steel barricades the workers had 
erected at the gates to the sprawling shipyard and an estimated 
10000 riot police rushed in wearing gas masks and helmets and 
carrying clubs and shields 
they were backed up by at least 10 armored vans firing clouds of 
choking tear gas at the same time about 600 riot police stormed 
the seaside complex by boat 
a company guard inside the yard said tear gas was so dense he 
could hardly see and black smoke was billowing from several 
workers tents which had been set afire 
about 100 workers on or around a giant 240foot crane erected on 
the docks taunted police shouting insults and threats 
the workers hurled firebombs rocks and pices of metal and 
combatclad police retaliated with volleys of tear gas witnesses 
said 
about 2000 workers in the shipyard overnight had maintained a 
vigil around blazing bonfires said munhwa broadcasting co many 
were seen fleeing as police launched their attack 
before the assault began a police helicopter hovered overhead 
dropping leaflets calling on workers to leave peacefully police 
using loudspeakers shouted three times before storming the gates 
disperse disperse disperse 
last year about 12000 police firing tear gas stormed the 
shipyard to end a 109day strike 
at one point friday 43 busloads of riot police drove past the 
shipyards main gate as strikers jabbed their fists in the air 
shouting insults 
we have no choice but to fight one union leader said after 
a rally attended by about 10000 workers 
steel ladders and other iron fixtures and parts were piled at 
the main gate to create a 9foothigh wall hundreds of workers 
wearing helmets and armed with steel pipes patrolled the shipyard 
in small groups 
gas and power supplies to the shipyard were cut and about 4000 
management workers withdrawn after lastminute negotiations between 
union leaders and company executives broke down thursday night 
about 20000 of the shipyards 24000 employees are unionized 
according to the japan shipbuilding industry association the 
hyundai shipyard is the worlds largest capable of building 14 
large ships simultaneously sales last year totaled 15 billion 
workers are demanding the release of four labor leaders arrested 
in earlier protests that were deemed illegal the company maintains 
that judicial matters are out of its domain 
government officials say the strikes are illegal because workers 
have not gone through the required legal steps including a 
coolingoff period union leaders say the complexity of labor laws 
makes it virtually impossible to stage a legal strike 
hyundai has 32 subsidiaries in ulsan including the shipyard 
and union leaders issued a joint statement saying workers at all 
hyundai companies would begin a general strike if police moved into 
the yard 
in seoul radical students hurled firebombs at four showrooms of 
hyundai motor co a sister firm of the hyundai shipyard no one 
was hurt but several windows wee broken police said 
radical students held antigovernment rallies friday on two 
campuses in seoul and burned an effigy of jung jooyong chairman 
of the hyundai group vowing to support striking workers 
also in seoul workers of the staterun korea broadcasting 
system staged sitin protests for the 16th day friday to demand the 
resignation of the networks governmentappointed president 
about 5000 of the networks 7000 workers have been staging 
peaceful protests since april 12 they claim the new president suh 
kiwon a former government official will give the government 
greater control over tv and radio broadcasts and stand in the way 
of press freedom

leaders of the greyhound bus drivers union have 
condoned permitted or ratified acts of violence against the 
company during their 8weekold strike a judge ruled friday 
a greyhound spokesman said the ruling shows that the company 
suspicion of a coordinated union effort at intimidation is correct 
but a union spokesman said leaders of the phoenixbased 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions have been solidly 
opposed to violence 
in a lawsuit filed by dallasbased greyhound lines inc against 
the union and related defendants cook county circuit judge thomas 
j obrien issued an injunction to set limits on picketing in 
chicago and to bar union members from any direct or indirect acts 
of violence 
the strike against greyhound began march 2 
since then several incidents of shootings at buses have 
occurred nationwide 
as part of the text of his injunction obrien wrote he had 
enough evidence to believe 12 instances of violence or intimidation 
cited in the lawsuit and directed at greyhound its employees or 
passengers had occurred in chicago since the beginning of the 
strike 
he also wrote he found union members or officials to have direct 
or indirect blame 
the judge wrote that union president edward m strait of 
phoenix as well as named officials of union locals 1150 1303 and 
1126 had condoned permitted andor ratified the acts of 
violence intimidations andor harassment 
while the case is local and specifies picketing rules at two 
greyhound facilities in chicago gravley said the ruling backs up 
what greyhound officials have been saying that violence aimed at 
greyhound buses and facilities nationwide are not sporadic 
events 
union spokesman nick nichols said from washington dc that he 
couldnt comment on fridays opinion because he hadnt seen it but 
the union has been opposed to violence 
obviously we would take issue with the judges view on 
this nichols said 
the union and the union leaders involved at the national and 
the council level have made it very very clear that under no 
circumstances do they condone violence 
he added that just thursday bulletins were sent to all locals 
asking members with information about any violent acts involving 
greyhound to contact the fbi 
in addition to enjoining union members from any violence or 
intimidation obriens ruling limits to two the number of pickets 
at any vehicle or pedestrial entrance or exit at the two main 
greyhound facilities in chicago 
nonpicketing demonstrators must be at least 20 feet away 
fridays injunction follows a similar temporary restraining 
order issued by circuit judge anthony scotillo march 2 and 
extended march 8 by obrien 
on april 9 greyhound filed a 30 million civil lawsuit against 
the amalgamated transit union and 20 union officers and members 
claiming the unions have campaigned to cripple greyhound 
financially and have cost the company at least 10 million triple 
damages are being sought

while astronomers rejoice that the hubble 
space telescope is finally circling earth some of them are busy 
building new instruments that will make the worlds best 
observatory even better 
three orbital replacement instruments under development will be 
added to the telescope years from now by astronauts making orbital 
service calls 
rodger thompson of the university of arizonas steward 
observatory is principal investigator in development of the 80 
million near infrared cameras and multiple objective spectrometers 
or nicmos which he expects to be taken up to the hubble in about 
six years 
our particular part of it is scheduled for 1996 launch 
february 10th 1996 if you want to believe a shuttle manifest that 
goes out that far said thompson who heads the projects 
20astronomer team 
nicmos with three cameras and three spectrometers will 
concentrate on different wavelengths in the nearinfrared portion 
of the light spectrum which none of the five instruments now 
aboard the 15 billion hubble can view infrared also is invisible 
to the human eye 
astronomer richard green of the tucsonheadquartered national 
optical astronomy observatories is a coinvestigator on another 
secondgeneration instrument being developed the space telescope 
imaging spectrograph or stis 
he said the hubble originally scheduled for launch in 1983 is 
flying technology thats really out of date 
the stis is intended to replace the telescopes two present 
spectrographs that will separate light into different wavelengths 
like a prism the new device will be able to capture an entire 
highresolution spectrum of light from a star in one exposure 
versus about 25 that the instruments now aboard the hubble will 
require green said 
in addition he said were working now to fly in 96 more 
modern optical light detectors solidstate imagers and new 
lightgathering equipment that will just make massive improvement 
in the performance of the telescope he said 
the third instrument to be installed in orbit is a wide 
fieldplanetary camera 2 which will take advantage of advances in 
electronics that were not available when the current wide field 
camera was installed on the hubble its principal investigator is 
john trauger of jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
each of nicmos three cameras will look at different portions of 
the field of view and at different resolutions said thompson he 
described it as like having three different lenses on your 
camera very highresolution that sees only a small part of the 
field intermediate and a wideangle view 
similarly each spectrometer will examine different parts of the 
spectrum and all six instruments will operate at the same time 
greatly increasing efficiency he said 
the spectrometers and cameras each loaded with an array of 
light detectors called charged coupled devices will show how much 
light is coming at each wavelength that will enable astronomers to 
identify the composition of the source objects temperature 
physical conditions under which the objects are being created even 
pressure density and velocity he said 
thats why spectroscopy is such a powerful instrument said 
thompson it allows you to learn a lot of detail about the object 
that youre looking at 
infrared sightings will shed new understanding on the birth of 
stars and makeup of gas clouds planets and planetary atmospheres 
nicmos is expected to help determine whether the center of our 
galaxy is a black hole or an extremely dense star cluster 
it allows us to see new objects being formed new galaxies 
new stars and perhaps new planets thompson said he said it will 
let astronomers see through clouds of galactic dust and gas right 
down into lets say the stellar nurseries where new stars are 
being born new galaxies are being born 
nicmos is in its final design stages with construction set to 
start next year 
the launching of the hubble was just the first step for us 
thompson said 
we will not be sitting on our hands by any means we have so 
much to do we will learn a lot from how the telescope operates 
that well be able to use in putting our instrument together in the 
best possible way 
its a learning experience we hope we learn very fast he 
said

president bushs cautious policy on lithuania 
so unsettled the leader of the breakaway baltic republic the other 
day he charged bush with another munich 
the allegation by vytautas landsbergis coupled bush with neville 
chamberlain the british prime minister who struck a deal with 
hitler before world war ii permitting germany to dismember 
democratic czechoslovakia 
chamberlain and his black umbrella became modern historys 
symbol of appeasement when hitler invaded poland in 1939 and set 
the world on fire 
millions died on battlefields and in concentration camps and 
even the victory of the allies in 1945 did not return democracy to 
czechoslovakia 
lithuania latvia and estonia meanwhile lost their 
independence in another notorious nazi pact the one in 1939 with 
moscow that precipitated the soviets absorption of the baltics a 
year later 
and how did bush merit this badge of dishonor pinned on him by 
the lithuanian president 
by deferring economic sanctions against the soviet union while 
waiting to see if the kremlin and lithuanians agree on terms for 
negotiations to settle their dispute peacefully 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii repeatedly have 
asserted their support for lithuanian independence publicly and 
privately 
the people of lithuania must not be denied their rights 
baker said in testimony wednesday to a senate appropriations 
subcommittee we support the aspirations of the lithuanian people 
for freedom and selfdetermination 
that same day landsbergis was on the telephone to members of 
congress complaining that the west doesnt want to help 
lithuania he said our reaction is one of discouragement and 
disappointment it feels as if our worst fears are being realized 
the soviets have set a precondition for dealing with the 
lithuanians that they withdraw their march 11 declaration of 
independence 
two western leaders president francois mitterrand of france and 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany on thursday urged lithuania 
to take that step 
if they do the soviets are willing to permit lithuanian 
independence under a new legal procedure it could take up to five 
years and the lithuanians would be required to negotiate financial 
and territorial terms with moscow 
but in the end they stand to regain their independence 
czechoslovakias prospects after munich were horrendously 
different 
chamberlain with the acquiescence of france had signed an 
agreement with germany in september 1938 guaranteeing peace within 
days germany occupied the germanspeaking sudetenland the 
following march hitler made a protectorate of bohemia and moravia 
slovakia proclaimed its independence with germanys support 
independent czechoslovakia was no more 
soviet troops entered the country in 1944 and in 1948 
communists seized control of the country it is only now reverting 
to the democracy proclaimed in 1918 and lost at munich 
chamberlain proclaimed peace in our time when he returned to 
london from munich he had widespread support from the british 
people they turned to winston churchill who had opposed the pact 
with hitler only after the nazis real intentions became apparent 
bush responding to lithuanias landsbergis declared on 
wednesday the policies and decisions ive taken have had strong 
support from the american people and thats who i work for 
but that is where the parallel with chamberlain reasonably 
should end 
both leaders enjoy public support but the american president 
and lithuania are on a vastly different course from the one 
chamberlain and czechoslovakia traveled a halfcentury ago

those yellow and black federal labels that 
give the octane rating on gas pumps should be torn off because of 
cheating by gas stations and lax enforcement the american 
automobile association says 
reacting to a congressional report thursday that estimates 
octane cheating could be costing motorists 150 million a year aaa 
spokesman william berman said car owners have only a 5050 chance 
of getting the octane they pay for 
the report by the general accounting office found cheating by 
more than half of the service stations tested in detroit and st 
louis last year although it said only suspected cheaters were 
tested and that those results could not be projected nationwide 
car owners shouldnt have to take pot luck when they fill up 
their tank berman said those aging octane stickers out on the 
gas pumps are essentially meaningless and should be removed 
a representative of service station operators accused berman of 
exaggerating the problem and criticized the report as too sweeping 
an indictment of an industry that sells 113 billion gallons of gas 
a year 
service station operators have investments of 100000 or 
more and theyre not going to jeopardize that said joseph 
koach executive director of the 60000member service station 
dealers of america but he acknowledged that there are some 
flybynight cheaters 
if the consumer wants to be protected he can be protected by 
buying gas from qualified members of associations koach said 
a report by the general accounting office the investigative arm 
of congress said that motorists who are buying higheroctane gas 
to get the ping out of their engines may be paying a premium 
price for gas that sometimes comes from the same storage tank as 
cheaper regular fuel 
federal law requires that uniform labels on gas pumps show the 
octane rating of each type of gas 87 for regular unleaded 89 for 
leaded regular and midgrade unleaded and 91 to 94 for premium 
grades 
the higher the octane the more ability the gas has to get rid 
of ping or metallic knocking in the engine 
a lowoctane gasoline can reduce engine efficiency mileage and 
emissions in highpowered engines the gao said 
the gao said the federal government has done little to stop the 
deception although nearly half the states have testing programs 
that have curbed cheating 
rep philip r sharp dind who released the report with rep 
charles schumer dny said the studys estimate of 150 million 
in losses is conservative he said the figure could reach as high 
as 600 million through growing mislabeling of octane ratings at 
the pump 
unfortunately consumers cannot determine octane ratings 
visually or in other ways that allow them to know if they are 
getting what they are paying for the report said 
it said problems were found in seven nontesting states visited 
by gao investigators mainly at the distribution and retail levels 
frequent octane mislabeling was found in onetime tests 
conducted in michigan missouri oregon and tennessee the gao 
said and investigators also found concern about octane cheating 
from officials interviewed in indiana montana and washington 
in 1989 michigan tests conducted primarily in detroit 519 
percent of stations had inflated ratings averaging 23 octane 
points and in st louis 526 percent had mislabeled an average of 
22 points the report said 
in tests conducted in 1988 218 percent of samples in oregon 
and 222 percent in tennessee were mislabeled the gao said 
states that now handle their own tests and enforcement are 
alabama arkansas california colorado delaware florida 
georgia illinois iowa louisiana maryland massachusetts 
missouri new york north carolina north dakota oklahoma south 
carolina south dakota tennessee virginia and wisconsin

its too late for angela carder to claim 
victory but her parents say they hope theyve helped others by 
winning a court ruling that affirms the right of pregnant women to 
control their own medical care 
carder 27 a terminal cancer patient who was 26 weeks pregnant 
died two days after a courtordered caesarean section at george 
washington university hospital here her baby died less than three 
hours after the operation which was listed as a contributing cause 
in carders death 
her parents say she did not want the surgery and did not give 
informed consent 
we really thought all along that angie would be vindicated in 
some way said daniel stoner her father its too late for her 
now but i guess it will help somebody else if theres ever 
another case like this it should really help 
the closely watched case was resolved thursday when the district 
of columbia court of appeals said a lower court was wrong to weigh 
carders rights against those of the fetus when the heavily sedated 
patients wishes were unclear 
the appeals court said the lower court should have tried harder 
to figure out what carder would have wanted done given her goals 
values prognosis and attitude toward her pregnancy 
in any case the opinion said a pregnant womans decision to 
refuse medical treatment is almost always paramount even when 
survival of a fetus is at stake 
a fetus cannot have rights superior to those of a person 
who has already been born the court said in a 71 decision that 
took nearly two years to emerge it said only in a rare 
exceptional circumstance would it be legal to override a pregnant 
womans decision 
the appeals court ruling is binding only in the district but 
there are so few precedents in the area that other courts are 
expected to look to it as they wrestle with questions of maternal 
versus fetal rights 
more than 100 groups backed the american civil liberties union 
in the quest to reverse the lowercourt ruling they all declared 
victory as did the hospital and the lawyer who represented the 
fetus 
aclu attorney lynn paltrow who brought the case faulted the 
lower court judge for failing to visit carders bedside to see if 
she were competent to make a decision she contends the woman could 
have 
he treated her as if she were already dead paltrow said 
the bottom line is you cant deny women their civil rights you 
cant treat women as dead just because theyre pregnant 
dawn johnsen legal director of the national abortion rights 
action league called the case a significant precedent that could 
stem a trend toward government interference on behalf of socalled 
fetal rights she said the interference has ranged from ordering 
caesarian sections to jailing pregnant women so they dont drink or 
take drugs 
since there are so few decisions on this issue i would expect 
it the dc ruling to be extremely persuasive in other areas of 
the country johnsen said 
vincent burke the attorney for the hospital agreed that the 
decision would be valuable for doctors lawyers and families facing 
such situations 
the main reason we went to court was that it was a difficult 
issue and there was no precedent he said we werent seeking a 
specific outcome we wanted guidance and the courts now given us 
guidance 
the path laid out by the court involves a procedure called 
substituted judgment in which a court tries to extrapolate 
from a patients values and goals what kind of decision he or she 
would make the primary factor in such a judgment would be a 
patients previously expressed wishes the court said 
barbara mishkin who represented the fetus said she was happy 
with the opinion and agreed that its her life its her right 
its her body its her medical decision 
however she asserted that carder would have wanted the 
operation and that is what a substitutedjudgment proceeding would 
have concluded as for the opposition of carders parents mishkin 
said they did not believe carders husband would bring up the child 
and they didnt want to be stuck taking care of a baby 
in a dissenting opinion judge james a belson said he agreed 
with the lower courts decision to weigh the interests of carder 
against those of her fetus 
the judge said an unborn childs interests and the states 
interest in preserving human life are entitled to substantial 
weight when they are in conflict with a patients decision on 
medical treatment 
the stoners have filed a civil suit against the hospital 
charging their daughter did not get proper care because the 
hospital feared the effect of treatment on the fetus

the bush administration is hailing a new 
agreement to normalize trade relations with the soviet union for 
the first time in nearly a halfcentury but the proposal is 
expected to encounter stiff opposition in congress 
one congressional critic said the administration couldnt have 
picked a worse time to negotiate the agreement because of the 
soviet crackdown in lithuania 
the pact if ratified by congress would clear the way for 
significantly lower tariffs on soviet products while expanding 
business opportunities for us companies in the soviet union 
while president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
had made signing a trade agreement a top priority for their 
upcoming summit bush was urged by some in the administration to 
cancel the talks to protest soviet actions in lithuania 
however the president announced tuesday that he had decided 
against imposing economic sanctions for fear that such an action 
would imperil the progress being made in pulling eastern europe 
away from soviet control 
this decision cleared the way for the trade talks to proceed in 
paris deputy trade representative julius katz head of the us 
delegation said at the end of thursdays discussions that both 
sides had reached basic agreement 
katz predicted the document would be ready for signing at the 
may 30june 3 summit in washington he said all that remained was 
resolving wording disagreements in four relatively minor areas 
fundamentally we have reached agreement on the text katz 
said in a telephone conference call from paris 
under us law the new economic agreement cannot be signed 
until bush certifies that the soviet union is allowing the free 
emigration of jews and other dissidents 
bush has said he will sign such a waiver once the soviet unions 
more liberalized emigration policy is written into law by the 
soviet legislature 
the trade agreement must be approved by congress before it can 
take effect however some members unhappiness over the soviets 
refusal to grant independence to lithuania is certain to be an 
issue raised by opponents 
there couldnt be a worse time for the agreement said sen 
alfonse damato rny were selling at a cut rate the rope that 
would be used to hang the lithuanians 
sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee 
which would have jurisdiction over the pact has warned that he 
would work to block senate approval because of an unrelated trade 
issue 
bentsen dtexas is unhappy because the administration 
apparently has decided not to target japan as an unfair trader 
under a tough section of the 1988 trade act 
he said such a decision would poison the well in congress 
not only for the soviet trade agreement but for other 
administration trade initiatives 
bush has expressed the hope that normalizing ussoviet trade 
relations would give a boost to the ailing soviet economy and 
bolster gorbachevs political reform efforts 
the agreement is needed to grant the soviet union 
mostfavorednation status qualifying it for the lowest tariffs 
granted to any other country 
currently soviet products sold in the united states bear duties 
as much as 10 times higher than imports from other countries by 
one estimate the price of soviet vodka could drop by 125 per 
bottle 
the higher tariffs were the result of the 1974 jacksonvanik 
amendment which was passed by congress in retaliation for soviet 
emigration restrictions in effect at the time 
us officials have predicted that trade between the soviet 
union and the united states could double or even triple over the 
next three years with a new trade agreement private economists 
doubt that assessment given the numerous troubles plaguing the 
soviet economy 
last year trade between the countries totaled 5 billion us 
export sales which totaled 43 billion reflected primarily grain 
shipments soviet sales in this country totaling 703 million 
included petroleum and consumer items such as vodka and furs

the navys 44 billion seawolf attack 
submarine program is moving ahead despite serious deficiencies in a 
computer program that guides the craft and its weapons a 
congressional oversight panel reported thursday 
the congressional investigation turned up an internal navy memo 
pointing out problems in the computer system rep john conyers 
jr dmich who headed the probe questioned whether the navy can 
produce a submarine that can hunt and kill enemy submarines as it 
is supposed to do 
without the computer software the seawolf submarine is just 
so much metal floating around out there said conyers chairman 
of the national security subcommittee of the house government 
operations committee 
the probe conducted by the subcommittee and the general 
accounting office congress investigative arm focused on the 
bsy2 computer system referred to colloquially as the busytwo 
the highly sophisticated system is built for the navy by general 
electric it is designed specifically for the seawolf which is 
built in groton conn by general dynamics corp and in newport 
news va by the newport news shipbuilding and drydock co 
it has recently come to my attention that serious deficiencies 
in the busytwo software development program have been identified 
by department of defense software experts conyers said 
however it is by no means clear that corrective actions have 
been taken 
at thursdays hearing top navy officials in charge of seawolf 
said they were unaware of a march 19 internal navy memo detailing 
problems in the computer software conyers had copies of the memo 
but did not release it to the public 
the navys top acquisition official assistant secretary gerald 
a cann said he would respond to the memo as soon as it could be 
studied but he said there was little risk that any technical 
problems would significantly delay delivery of the system to 
groton where the first seawolf is under construction 
i dont think we have a flaming disaster here cann said 
a spokesman for ge said he would seek a response to the issues 
raised at the hearing from experts familiar with the computer 
system 
according to conyers the memo listed a number of problems 
including the navys failure to program all of the computers 
complex function in a single computer language developed for 
sophisticated weaponry 
the memo written by a navy software expert questioned the 
reliability of the computer systems which govern virtually all of 
seawolfs movements and weaponry the bsy2 is specifically 
designed to enable seawolf to detect and locate targets faster than 
existing submarine combat systems and to allow operators to detect 
and attack multiple targets 
frank conahan who headed the gao investigation of seawolf 
called the bsy2 system one of the most technically challenging 
and complex software development efforts ever undertaken for a 
submarine 
the navy has no alternative to the bsy2 system under 
consideration conahan warned and problems in development of the 
computer could lead to costly delays in completion of the 
submarines 
rep frank horton rny the ranking republican on the 
subcommittee noted that there has already been a 10 million cost 
overrun in completion of the first two bsy2 systems 
pending congressional approval the navy plans to buy 29 
seawolfs by the year 2000 at an estimated cost of 44 billion ge 
was awarded a 18 billion contract to develop the bsy2 in 1988 
assuming the entire run of submarines is built the computer 
equipment alone would account for 74 billion of the cost 
according to conahan 
it is far more likely conyers said that the pressure to reduce 
defense spending will scale down the size of the seawolf program 
significantly defense secretary dick cheney is conducting a 
detailed review of the need for seawolf and is expected to present 
findings next month conyers said the problems with the seawolf 
program discovered by the subcommittee and the gao will be a part 
of cheneys review

costa ricas congress has approved a 
recommendation to bar from the country john poindexter oliver 
north and others involved in the irancontra scandal 
thursdays vote is not legally binding however 
the legislature voted 511 with five abstentions in favor of the 
recommendations of a commission that also said former us 
ambassador lewis tambs and businessman richard secord should not be 
allowed to enter the country 
the commission said costa rica was used during the irancontra 
affair as a supply route for the nicaraguan contra rebels 
president oscar arias who hands over power to presidentelect 
rafael angel calderon on may 8 has not commented on the 
recommendations 
poindexter north and secord have been convicted in the secret 
operation during the reagan adminstration to sell arms to iran and 
use the profits to support the rebels fighting the thenleftist 
nicaraguan government 
poindexter was national security adviser and north a white house 
aide during the reagan administration secord is a retired air 
force major general 
tambs was accused of having knowledge of norths activities but 
was never charged 
the commission found that poindexter and north supported sending 
supplies to the contras through costa rica in violation of the 
central american nations neutrality it also alleged that tambs 
and rancher john hull were involved in contra operations in costa 
rica 
this network allowed colombian and panamanian drug traffickers 
to transport drugs to the united states in exchange for arms for 
the contras the commission said in a statement 
it recommended that hulls costa rican nationality be annulled 
the indianaborn hull 70 took costa rican citizenship while 
living 20 years in the country as a rancher 
earlier this year costa rica began seeking his extradition from 
the united states where he fled last year while out on bail on 
charges of aiding the contras hull has denied the charges 
the congressional vote came two days after former president 
daniel oduber was suspended from participation in his political 
party for a year the governing national liberation party banned 
oduber for having accepted campaign contributions from an american 
accused of drug trafficking 
lionel casey who allegedly donated 12000 to oduber in 1985 
is in jail in costa rica awaiting extradition to the united states 
on drug charges

australias thirdlargest city 
brisbane could soon face smog as bad as the pollution in los 
angeles scientists said today 
the researchers warned in a report that without action the city 
of 1 million could become an environmental disaster within a 
decade 
like los angeles the capital of queensland state is especially 
vulnerable to pollution because of its geographic location and 
atmospheric conditions they said 
the brisbane area is the fastest growing in australia and the 
citys population is expected to more than double in the next 10 
years 
the study by scientists at griffith university called for a 
reduction in the number of private cars in the city and better 
emission control for trucks it also called for better public 
transport and stricter controls on industry without such measures 
the report said brisbane could find itself choking in a 
petrochemical smog caused by an extremely unpleasant mixture of 
gases that could lead to health problems including respiratory 
disease heart failure and eye irritation

radon gas long known to cause lung cancer may be 
linked to a variety of other cancers as well british researchers 
said today 
in an article in the lancet a respected british medical 
journal three physicists from bristol university said they had 
found a connection between radon levels and the incidence of 
certain nonlung cancers 
the study used data from 15 countries including the united 
states 
margo oge director of the radon program at the us 
environmental protection agency said that previously researchers 
have failed to link radon and nonlung cancers 
studies purporting to do so havent been able to pass 
scientific scrutiny she said thursday in a telephone interview 
ahead of the articles publication she said she could not comment 
specifically on the british study because she had not seen it 
radon is a dense odorless gas created by the radioactive decay 
of small quantities of uranium found in many types of rock 
it has been known for decades to cause lung cancer the 
scientists said they stumbled on the link to other cancers last 
september when they realized radon is highly soluble in the fatty 
globules found in bone marrow 
previous researchers seem to have made the mistake of only 
considering the amount of radon in the blood where it appeared the 
effect was negligible said physicist jonathan eatough one of 
the authors but when the fatty globules are examined the radon 
becomes a significant factor in the dose to the bone marrow 
the scientists said they found an association of radon exposure 
and leukemia in children and adults brain spine bone and skin 
cancer in children and kidney and skin cancer in adults 
our observations in general clearly warrant urgent and 
detailed further investigations to determine whether radon is 
indeed the causative factor as we hypothesize the scientists 
said 
they said some findings such as the association of radon 
exposure and incidents of skin cancer were unexpected 
but they said it could explain current anomalies in the pattern 
of these cancers such as the high incidence of melanoma in 
scandinavian countries where the population is not exposed to high 
levels of harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun 
dr denis henshaw another of the authors said the study is 
actually good news scientifically because we believe we may 
have found a cause for cancer you can do something about 
radon seeps into homes and buildings through foundations and 
floorboards steps can be taken to keep it out including sealing 
floorboards with plastic sheeting and installing belowfloor 
extractor fans to channel the gas away 
the countries in the study were canada denmark finland 
france west germany ireland italy japan norway netherlands 
poland switzerland sweden britain and the united states

farmland values nationally rose in 1989 for 
the third straight year and may go up again in 1990 but the 
agriculture department isnt saying much about this years 
prospects 
roger hexem of the departments economic research service says 
the agencys 1990 forecast will be issued later this spring there 
are always uncertainties about farmland prices and this year is a 
bit more complicated than usual he said 
weather and general economic conditions are the usual concerns 
and this year congress is slowly grinding out a new farm bill that 
will set national agricultural policy for the next five years 
some of that will bear on federal price supports for key 
commodities such as wheat corn and cotton export subsidies 
research and marketing programs also enter into decisions on 
whether to buy or sell farmland 
hexem said the current multinational negotiations under the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade are other unknowns that 
could influence land price movements 
but the usda economist said thursday in a telephone interview 
that the average increase of farmland values in each of the last 
three years was a little more than 4 percent which pretty much 
tracked the rate of inflation during the same period 
im not saying thats going to happen in 1990 hexem said 
but thats been kind of the historical trend over the last three 
years 
a week ago the usda agency reported that farmland values 
nationally rose 4 percent averaging 693 per acre as of jan 1 up 
from a revised average of 667 a year earlier 
hexem said revisions were made in state and national farmland 
values as a result of the 1987 census of agriculture these 
revisions based on the census information collected every five 
years are part of the agencys regular longstanding procedure he 
said 
despite the recent upturn in farmland values which include 
land and buildings the jan 1 1990 national average of 693 per 
acre was still 16 percent below the record of 823 per acre in 1982 
hexem said estimates were developed from an opinion survey 
of farmers and ranchers about land values in their counties the 
figures are not based on actual sales of farmland 
the jan 1 land values in the corn belt showed only a 2 percent 
increase from a year earlier including a 1 percent dip in ohio and 
a 4 percent increase in missouri 
i would have expected the percentage increase in the corn 
belt to be higher than the survey indicated hexem said lower 
soybean prices probably had a dampening effect he said 
pockets of drought still exist in the western corn belt and 
northern plains which also can affect the price outlook 
states estimates can vary greatly and often show much greater 
movements than the national figures hexem said some things happen 
in one state and not another 
for example hexem said the importance of water and the 
structure of agriculture in many of the western states is much 
different from other regions 
theres quite a range in the value of farmland depending on 
whether or not you have water he said 
and there are other regional factors in the northeast which 
has the highest regional value for farmland 1802 per acre 
prices range from 5080 per acre in rhode island to 1029 in 
maine 
hexem said the northeast has no water problems as in the west 
but there is a mix of demand for land in some states including 
the demands of developers and people looking for second homes and 
retirement homes 
the figures are for 48 states with alaska reported separately 
and hawaii omitted entirely 
hexem said alaska has farmland but that it represents a small 
portion of the state and is considered a special case for 
statistical purposes hawaii has a relatively small amount of 
farmland which he said doesnt change hands very often 
here is a statebystate list of weighted average peracre 
values of farmland and buildings the first column shows in 
dollars the revised value as of feb 1 1989 and the second is 
the value as of jan 1 1990 an 11month period was used because 
the agency shifted to a jan 1 reporting date 
alaska not on the following list was reported at 232 per 
acre down from a revised 250 a year earlier there was no listing 
for hawaii

ranchers and their friends voted to hold a 
prairie dog shooting contest and told the governor and others who 
didnt like the idea to buzz off 
the ten ring gun club of nucla and neighboring naturita 
organized the contest recently to thin out the prairie dog 
population they said the animals carry bubonic plague and dig 
holes that break the legs of cattle 
townspeople hoped the contests would be a tourist attraction 
they invited hunting enthusiasts and visitors to the depressed town 
for the july 1415 contest where they estimated about 500 prairie 
dogs would perish 
animal rights got wind of the contest and lobbied gov roy romer 
and democratic rep ben nighthorse campbell who announced their 
opposition 
so the gun club held an open meeting in this town of 1000 
thursday night to decide the fate of the contest only three of the 
318 people who showed up voted against it 
governor romer congressman campbell buzz off nucla mayor 
john vanderpool said after the vote 
romer and campbell had said the hunt was a cruel spectacle and 
not a proper method of rodent extermination animal rights groups 
and humane societies wanted to save the prairie dogs 
officials in nucla and naturita in a remote corner of southwest 
colorado said they hoped to make the shoot an annual affair the 
towns are so desperate for jobs they tried unsuccessfully to lure a 
lowlevel radioactive waste dump to the area 
the town needs something to bring it back to life said elderly 
nucla resident thomas langan 
i dont care if its a prairie dog shoot or a yuppie shoot 
he said to great laughter from the crowd 
doylene garvey said she was angered by city folk telling 
ranchers how to care for the land 
they live in polluted cities where homeless people go so why 
dont they put their energies to that she said 
several speakers said the shoot was preferable to poison 
federal agencies have banned the use of most poisons because 
they enter the food chain when eagles coyotes and other natural 
predators of prairie dogs eat the carcasses 
one of the three people who voted against the shoot katherine 
hesse of nucla said she is not against shooting prairie dogs and 
has shot many herself 
but i dont like the circus its not right she said 
if you have a problem on your land take care of it and not for 
money this is a poor way to handle it

hospital thursday a day after the attack 
the attack on lafontaine a social democrat and helmut kohls 
leading challenger in the december election was the most serious 
on a topranking west german politician in the countrys 41year 
history 
it raised security concerns among politicians in both east 
germany and west germany but many conceded that absolute security 
is impossible without shutting off public access to officials

because of her mental condition 
he quoted her as saying i wanted to kill mr lafontaine so 
that i would have to go to court and then id get in the news 
friends who visited lafontaine thursday said he was able to get 
out of his hospital bed and make jokes 
hans jochenvogel the social democratic party chairman said 
lafontaine intends to remain the chancellor candidate 
vogel said lafontaine narrowly escaped death the knife missed a 
main artery by just a couple of millimeters he said 
otherwise we would be in mourning 
social democratic party officials told during a special meeting 
in bonn that lafontaine was out of danger burst into applause 
lafontaine 46 the governor of tiny saarland state is one of 
west germanys most colorful and popular politicians his stabbing

when lynda wright was on welfare strangers 
berated her in supermarket lines social workers asked about her 
sex life and her heart sometimes told her she was doomed to fail 
five years after pulling herself off public aid wright helped 
found welfare alumni to spare todays recipients some pain 
i want to hold out my hand to them and say you can make 
it said the 46yearold mother of four being on welfare is 
an experience that leaves scars 
the organization was formed last year to attack myths about 
people on welfare high on the list wright said is that theyre 
lazy and watch tv all day 
in 1988 about 37 million families nationwide got help under 
the aid to families with dependent children program according to 
the american public welfare association in washington 
association studies show about 30 percent of family heads who 
become eligible for assistance stay on welfare for less than a 
year said spokesman rick ferreira 
about 75 percent like wright are on for less than five years 
wrights group is compiling a book to encourage those who are 
struggling to become selfsufficient it will include photographs 
and stories of people who have gotten off welfare 
alumni members also speak to church school and community 
groups often retelling personal stories 
wrights nightmare like other women on welfare started when 
her husband divorced her 10 years ago and left her and the children 
with no money 
i had the american dream the family the house the kids the 
car she said of her 17year marriage and then all of a sudden 
i went from a nice income to zero i went straight down 
wright couldnt find a job and was barely scraping together 
money to feed her children within months her telephone gas and 
electric service were cut off 
we lived from day to day if there wasnt anything for that 
day sometimes my neighbors would be kind and lend us some food 
wright said i remember standing at the door one day and breaking 
down i knew i had to go on welfare i didnt want to see my 
children starve 
wright had many dehumanizing experiences 
a shopper behind her in a food store once criticized her for 
buying a beef roast intended to celebrate her daughters good 
grades the woman wright recalled said im working and i 
cant afford a beef roast i cant see how you can afford one 
social workers on house visits eyed her possessions to make sure 
she wasnt spending money frivolously 
they asked if she was sleeping with anyone to make sure there 
wasnt another source of support in the house that would make her 
ineligible for benefits 
i felt less than a human being wright said i felt like i 
was just stupid everybody knew how to get a job except me 
everybody had skills except me 
but things changed wright found meaningful work and went off 
welfare she has a fulltime job at the public welfare coalition an 
advocacy group where she and other women got the idea for forming 
the alumni 
we were just talking about how wed been through a lot 
wright said and we wanted to see how we could help somebody 
whos still going through it

first there was a moscow mcdonalds can a 
gorky porkys be far behind 
maybe not the ussr film service corp has opened a los angeles 
office encouraging us moviemakers to film their projects in the 
soviet union 
all comers from historical films to a soviet lonesome dove 
called a cowboy and a cossack are welcome say the 
organizers even leftover cold warrior types 
so far the office has provided production assistance for 
filming in the soviet union of the movies peter the great and 
dark eyes and the television shows dallas head of the 
class and road to africa 
the twoperson film service staff now is handling 60 projects in 
various stages of development the latest is the cable movie 
final warning starring jon voight as dr robert gale the us 
doctor who treated radiation sickness caused by the chernobyl 
disaster 
what are the advantages of shooting in the soviet union the 
ussr film service tempts producers with an array of outdoor 
locations affordable labor a growing pool of actors and 
technicians and some fairly modern equipment 
such improvements only came recently 
we have 39 motion picture studios in the country said yuri 
spilny the companys chief executive officer but they are not 
in perfect shape and some of the equipment is outdated 
soyuzkinoservice known as sks is the parent company of the 
film service and helps provide logistical support if you need the 
soviet army for a battle scene sks will arrange it need help 
getting through customs they can assist you there too 
sks has entered into a joint deal with a british supplier to 
provide catering trucks makeup trailers and lighting equipment for 
all productions 
for the upcoming feature film the siege of leningrad sks 
helped reconstruct a model of the title city in world war ii period 
detail 
its a huge construction job spilny said to do this in 
the united states would probably be four to five times more 
expensive the film also will use german equipment left behind in 
the war 
what happens if somebody wants to make a movie similar to the 
red scare drama red dawn 
if a film is pure nonsense well its still possible but 
government organizations will not get involved with it spilny 
said 
several us companies have expressed interest in making a film 
about stalin said david gamburg the president of film service 
the soviet union hasnt yet dealt with stalin himself because 
its such a painful subject gamburg said weve been trying 
not to do with stalin what the nbc miniseries did about mussolini 
we want to make a philosophical drama and not romanticize him 
the company takes on the work for a percentage of the films 
budget and will make close to 1 million for its work on final 
warning spilny said that in three years the company will be 
profitable 
as a side business the office is also trying to bring more 
soviet films to american theaters 
russia wants to get into the world market spilny said we 
do about 150 theatrical films a year but there is no distribution 
beyond our borders

a house interior committee leader is accusing 
the bush administration of blocking testimony from officials who 
could explain whether an electricityproducing dam is damaging the 
grand canyon 
an interior department spokesman however says the 
administration will cooperate with rep george millers 
subcommittee probe of the glen canyon dam on the colorado river 
the department of interior by imposing a gag order on 
national park and us fish and wildlife employees has 
demonstrated again its unwillingness to engage in a full public 
discussion about the impact of its operations on the grand 
canyon miller said thursday after witnesses from those agencies 
failed to appear before his subcommittee on water power and 
offshore energy resources 
miller says the interior department is moving too slowly on an 
environmental impact statement on the effects of the dam he has 
introduced a bill that would force the department to change 
operations at the dam until the study is complete 
the witnesses who testified at a hearing thursday presented a 
scenario that pits preservation of one of the worlds natural 
wonders against the need for electrical power in the southwestern 
united states 
the daily fluctuations in the river flow caused by the dam have 
greatly changed the ecosystem of the river bed and the grand 
canyon said w linn montgomery biologist from northern arizona 
university 
miller said a department of interior study issued last year 
found that the dam was having substantial adverse effects on the 
downstream resources including the grand canyon 
it might as well be running hundreds of bulldozers down the 
canyon floor daily he said 
when only dennis underwood commissioner of the bureau of 
reclamation showed up at thursdays hearing miller refused to 
accept his testimony 
as chairman of the subcommittee i could not allow the 
department to present distorted onesided testimony said miller 
steve goldstein interior department spokesman said underwood 
was prepared to present all views on the dam from the department 
including those in disagreement with current policy 
we dont dispute there is a dissenting view within the 
department said goldstein thats normal with an agency with 
10 bureaus and 70000 employees 
but he said underwood was sent as a representative of the 
administrations view 
miller said he would schedule another hearing when the others 
could testify goldstein said they would appear 
in a letter to interior secretary manuel lujan sent after the 
hearing miller said glen canyon dam is being operated in a 
manner which threatens the grand canyon national park glen canyon 
national recreation area endangered species and other fish and 
wildlife resources 
the members of our subcommittees are entitled to have 
witnesses available who have the expertise and authority to address 
these problems said miller 
there is no environmental emergency related to operation of the 
dam said joe falbo of the colorado river energy distributors 
association whose members buy power generated by the glen canyon 
dam and others in the colorado river storage project 
glen canyon is really the backbone of the system and accounts 
for 70 percent of all the power that can be generated on crsp dams 
in the upper colorado river basin said falbo 
he said the utilities turn to power from the dams at peak 
periods allowing them to burn less coal and oil 
hydropower is a clean renewable electric resource he said 
but montgomery said my greatest fear is that shortterm 
financial gain may overrun considerations of the native plants and 
animals as a driving force behind management decisions he said

when discovery glides to earth after 
its mission to set loose the hubble space telescope the shuttle 
will be testing new brakes that could pave the way for kennedy 
space center landings 
discovery is scheduled to touch down sunday at edwards air force 
base calif where most of the 34 previous shuttle missions have 
ended over the past nine years 
it will take about a week and 1 million to return discovery to 
kennedy space center where it will be prepared for its next flight 
in october if this crosscountry trip could be avoided in the 
future it would diminish the turnaround time for shuttle flights 
the new carbon brakes believed to slow shuttles quicker are 
a stepping stone toward the programs desires to one day be able 
to at least plan on kennedy landings again said discovery 
commander loren j shriver 
whether theyre done routinely or not that will be a subject 
of many many meetings shriver said in an interview prior to the 
mission 
kennedys threemilelong concrete runway provides considerably 
less room for maneuvering than the 44squaremile lakebed at 
edwards air force base 
the desert lakebed has eight designated runways up to 7 miles 
in length a concrete runway stretches 28 miles but extends onto 
the natural clay surface of the lakebed 
twentyseven shuttle landing occurred at edwards in 1982 
columbia was diverted to white sands nm because the normally 
dry lakebed was flooded 
five shuttle flights ended at kennedy the last one in april 
1985 in that flight discovery suffered extensive brake damage and 
blew a tire during the investigation that followed the jan 28 
1986 challenger explosion astronauts voiced concern over further 
kennedy landings 
the new carbon brakes used for years by passenger planes can 
withstand longer braking distances and higher braking temperatures 
than the older carbonlined beryllium brakes they also can be 
applied at higher landing speeds and are good for 50 touchdowns 
compared to six or so for the beryllium brakes 
until the beryllium brakes were modified in the late 1980s we 
used to find chunks of brakes on the runway said karen corne a 
nasa engineer who helped install the new brakes on discovery in 
december 
after discovery lands the brakes will be sent for analysis to 
bf goodrich their ohio designer 
hopefully well get to the point so we can just inspect them 
on landing leave them on just put new wheels and tires on and 
fly again corne said 
the brakes are similar in size and design although the carbon 
brakes weigh 182 pounds each 30 pounds more than the beryllium 
ones the carbon brakes have an additional rotor and stator and 
the axles are wider and stiffer to minimize tire wear 
shriver and discovery pilot charles bolden jr flew simulators 
to get a feel for the new brakes a few months ago at amesdryden 
flight research facility at edwards they liked them better 
i have a pickup truck and in the morning the first time you 
drive it you pull out of the driveway and you ease on the brakes 
and it wrrrrrrk it just kind of grabs until its ready bolden 
said the carbon brakes they dont grab 
discovery was the first shuttle to be modified for the new 
brakes 
depending on the results of the landing and another discovery 
landing to be attempted on a concrete edwards runway in october 
atlantis will be modified in 1991 followed by columbia nasas 
newest shuttle endeavor will have the carbon brakes when it comes 
on line next year 
nasa will be shooting for one out of every two or three landings 
at kennedy starting in late 1991 central floridas temperamental 
weather however is expected to be a determining factor 
the weather can be perfectly good one minute and 15 minutes 
later its disastrous bolden said 
bolden ought to know on his only other shuttle flight in 
january 1986 the crew tried to land at kennedy for three days but 
had to settle for edwards two other earlier flights also were 
moved from kennedy to edwards 
the weather just didnt cooperate bolden said the 
program will just have to live with that as we go along

aids had no name in 1981 but that year the virus 
that causes the disease was present in blood matsuko gaffney 
received in a transfusion at a naval hospital 
in time the disease killed her and her son and infected her 
husband a marine officer and a federal judge ruled thursday that 
government negligence was to blame 
us district judge rya zobel found that mrs gaffney had to 
have the transfusion because doctors failed to perform a caesarean 
section when she was two weeks late in delivering her first child 
in september 1981 
though aids was unknown at the time zobel ruled that 
infection with a communicable disease was a foreseeable 
consequence of administering blood to a patient even in 1981 
aids was identified as a disease in september 1982 
zobels ruling lets chief warrant officer martin gaffney seek 
compensation from the federal government the judge ordered a 
second trial to determine damages for gaffney and his daughter 
maureene on whose behalf the government was sued for 55 million 
two years ago 
maureene who is 6 is the only family member not infected by 
the virus 
gaffneys lawsuit claimed dr john yeast an obstetrician at the 
long beach naval hospital in california mishandled mrs gaffneys 
pregnancy by failing to perform a caesarean section when the birth 
was overdue 
the baby eventually was stillborn and mrs gaffney became 
infected and lost blood it was then she received the contaminated 
blood 
gaffney 40 who is still in good health and working at the 
south weymouth naval air station about 15 miles south of boston 
said he never doubted zobel would rule in his favor 
im just surprised it took this long for the decision its 
obviously very good news gaffney said i just wish my wife had 
heard this before she left this world 
assistant us attorney marianne bowler who represented the 
government in the case did not return requests for comment susan 
hicks spurlock a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office 
refused to comment while the second trial is pending 
navy lt bruce williams a spokesman at the pentagon said the 
navy could not comment on the ruling until the judges decision had 
been reviewed 
the long beach naval hospital no longer has an obstetrics 
department and the doctor named in the case could not be located 
thursday 
nearly two years after the transfusion mrs gaffney gave birth 
to maureene and two years after that to a boy john 
within a few months of his birth in july 1985 john became 
sickly and in may the following year he was diagnosed as having 
aids the rest of the family was then tested for the deadly virus 
the parents proved to be carrying the virus but maureene was not 
john died of aids in august 1986 at the age of 13 months his 
mother a japanese citizen was 38 when she died less than a year 
later in may 1987 the couple had been married seven years 
the navy discovered the blood was tainted by the aids virus 
after tracing the two donors for mrs gaffneys transfusion one 
donor tested negative the other refused to be tested and it was 
learned he had been discharged from the navy for homosexual 
activity

roughed up by a police officer during an arrest for failing to pay 
a 2 parking ticket won a 10000 settlement from the town 
william a rust filed a lawsuit in federal court in boston in 
1986 charging the officer violated his civil rights in the may 
1983 arrest rust said a wrist injury he had suffered was 
aggravated by the officers unnecessary use of force 
i have no criminal record i wasnt a threat to law and order 
and i certainly wasnt going to leave town rust said this week 
rust a professor of politics at framingham state college who 
has lived in shrewsbury for 24 years was arrested at his home 
after he failed to pay a 1981 parking ticket for violation of a 
parking ban on his street 
town counsel t philip leader said rust had been notified 
several times that he was in default rusts attorney stewart 
herrick denied his client had been advised 
i think its an awful miscarriage of justice that he got 
10000 said shrewsbury police chief robert mcginley the 
settlement was paid by the towns insurance company 
herrick countered certainly there must be more important 
things for the police to concern themselves with or shrewsbury 
must be an awfully peaceful little town

president carlos salinas de gortari told vice 
president dan quayle new rules are needed in the war on drugs 
following the abduction of a mexican who was taken to the united 
states to face charges in the tortureslaying of a drug agent 
salinas indicated he would like to establish new rules of 
understanding between mexico and the united states on drug 
cooperation quayle said after meeting with the president on 
thursday 
mexico has accused the united states of having a role in the 
abduction of dr humberto alvarez machain who now is awaiting 
trial in los angeles in the 1985 torture and murder of a us drug 
enforcement administration agent 
the incident caused intense controversy in mexico and created 
resentment in the salinas administration which had boosted 
cooperation with the united states in fighting drug trafficking 
a bush administration official told reporters salinas wants 
provisions for better advance notice of us drug operations that 
involve mexico and a better system of information sharing 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said quayle 
told the mexican president that he thought we already were 
sharing information 
the meeting was quayles final stop in a trip to ease latin 
american hard feelings over decembers us invasion of panama 
quayles third latin american swing since january completes the 
mission said the vice presidents press secretary david 
beckwith 
quayle on wednesday attended the inauguration of nicaraguan 
president violeta barrios de chamorro and delivered the first 
installment of a 24 million us food aid package 
the vice president said he and salinas also discussed 
usmexico trade relations and the situation in central america 
following mrs chamorros inauguration 
mexico claims the seizure of alvarez machain violated its 
sovereignty and salinas said monday in los angeles the incident 
threatened the international drugfighting effort 
this runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who 
have the obligation of defending the law and could create a problem 
much larger than the one we are trying to combat he said at the 
annual luncheon of the associated press 
quayle on thursday reiterated the us position that dea agents 
in mexico were not involved as claimed by the mexican government 
the dea has denied published reports that agents in the united 
states offered a bounty for alvarez machains delivery quayle said 
us attorney general dick thornburgh was still investigating 
alvarez machains lawyer has said dea agents met a plane 
carrying alvarez machain at the airport in el paso texas on april 
3 after he was abducted from his office in guadalajara 
alvarez machain is charged with reviving dea agent enrique 
camarena after torture sessions so he could face more questioning 
the mexican attorney generals office has also been conducting 
an investigation into the abduction case and published reports 
thursday said six people had been arrested including four members 
of the mexican federal judicial police 
mexico has sentenced two drug lords and more than 20 others to 
long prison terms in the camarena killing but alvarez machain was 
never charged 
the salinas administration has greatly expanded the fight 
against drug trafficking and corruption in mexico seizing more 
cocaine in one year than had been seized in the previous decade 
salinas wants to reduce the drug issues role as an irritant to 
usmexico relations and focus on trade and commercial ties to 
revive mexicos economy 
however the alvarez machain case brought domestic criticism 
that he is insufficiently concerned with mexicos national 
integrity

the president would be able to reduce or veto 
outright individual items within money bills under proposed 
constitutional amendments approved by the senate judiciary 
committee 
fortythree states give similar authority to their governors 
and i think it is time to have that at the federal level sen 
paul simon dill one of the sponsors said after the measures 
won 86 approval thursday 
the committees action which came one day after president bush 
renewed his call for lineitem veto powers set the stage for 
senate floor action 
senate approval would send the proposals to the house approval 
there would put the issue before the nations state legislatures 
bush told a white house ceremony on wednesday that the 
president needs the power to make the tough calls on spending 
take the heat and im perfectly prepared to do that he urged 
speedy approval 
lawmakers seldom enthusiastic about sharing the power of the 
purse have been killing lineitem veto proposals for more than a 
century simons office said the library of congress reported that 
nothing similar had emerged from the senate judiciary committee 
since april 21 1884 
voting in favor of the measure were six republicans plus simon 
and sen howell heflin dala six democrats voted against the 
measure 
sen orrin hatch rutah usually a critic of the concept voted 
to send the measures to the senate floor saying their importance 
merited a decision by the full senate but he said he would be an 
opponent if a floor debate developed 
simons version cosponsored by sen alan j dixon dill 
would give the president his choice of reducing or eliminating 
altogether individual line items in money bills a simple majority 
in both houses of congress could override the presidents veto 
the other version sponsored by sen strom thurmond rsc 
would empower the president to veto line items but not reduce them 
overriding his action would take a twothirds vote of both houses 
simons version was similar to a provision in the illinois state 
constitution

the united states is allowing saudi arabia to 
lease two supercomputers but so far refuses to let israel buy the 
same machines according to industry and government officials 
the computers have been leased to the governmentowned saudi 
arabian oil co to help increase the production of its oil wells 
one of the supercomputers a cray2 was installed at the saudi 
arabian oil computer center in the town of dhahran late last year 
according to the machines manufacturer cray research of 
minneapolis the oil company already has one other supercomputer 
an ibm model a us official said 
an israeli newspaper reported thursday that iraq had tapped into 
the saudi computer to conduct sophisticated calculations for its 
missile development program but us officials said they could not 
confirm the report 
a spokeswoman at cray said each computer includes a 
sophisticated security system designed to prevent unauthorized use 
of the machine including secret access codes and other devices 
the spokeswoman kate neessen also said such lease deals include 
governmenttogovernment pledges that the supercomputers would only 
be used for peaceful purposes 
another source familiar with the cray2s said buyers undertake 
to prevent remote access to the computer so that only authorized 
personnel at the site can use it 
the saudi cray is being used to simulate conditions in 
underground oil reservoirs and compute the wells capacity these 
simulation models are highly complex and saudi arabias oil fields 
are the largest in the world said a statement issued by cray 
the saudi oil company already has one other supercomputer an 
ibm model a us official said 
israel has applied for licenses to buy four supercomputers 
cray2s and ibms but its requests have been pending for as long as 
two years or more according to us officials two of the machines 
would go to universities one to the weizman institute of science 
and another to israels military industries according to american 
sources 
us government agencies considering the requests are concerned 
that israel could use the computers to improve its nuclear and 
missile arsenals 
with the saudis we dont have the same kinds of concerns 
said one government official they have no nuclear use for the 
machines they are very far away from any nuclear capability he 
added 
this source and others who discussed the issue spoke on 
condition that they not be identified the commerce department 
which by law must license all supercomputer exports does not 
comment on such sales 
also saudi arabia has signed the international nuclear 
nonproliferation agreement which israel has not another official 
said 
the leases with saudi arabia were not considered controversial 
and received almost automatic approval from the commerce 
department one official said 
but the requests from israel as well as pending license 
applications from india and brazil are under review by an 
interagency committee that deals with licensing for countries with 
nuclear capabilities 
us officials are willing to sell india a supercomputer for a 
research institute but only on condition that the indians allow 
outside inspections and follow other security guidelines india 
already has one supercomputer that is used to forecast monsoons 
supercomputers are simply much larger and faster than normal 
computers able to tackle in hours problems that might take weeks 
or months to run on a normal computer 
such problems include the complicated calculations necessary for 
designing nuclear weapons breaking codes predicting the behavior 
of oil reservoirs and forecasting the weather

researchers in four states suspect that dietary 
supplement ltryptophan from a single japanese manufacturer caused 
the outbreak of a rare sometimes deadly blood disorder but the 
hunt for a contaminant continues 
scientists in south carolina new york oregon and minnesota 
reported many of their states cases of eosinophiliamyalgia 
syndrome or ems occurred after patients took ltryptophan made by 
the japanese company 
the fact that a single manufacturer has been implicated in the 
ems outbreak means the likely cause of the illness is a product 
contamination and not the supplement itself said dr ed 
kilbourne an ems specialist for the national centers for disease 
control but researchers still dont know what sort of contaminant 
might be responsible or how it got there 
the ltryptophan use thats causing people to get ill is 
virtually universally from one particular company kilbourne said 
thursday 
the food and drug administration recalled ltryptophan earlier 
this year after it was linked to the painful blood disorder that 
has struck 1500 americans twentyone ems patients have died 
south carolina and new york researchers reported their findings 
thursday during two days of meeting at the centers for disease 
control in atlanta epidemiologists from oregon and minnesota 
reported similar findings wednesday the cdc has refused to name 
which of several japanese ltryptophan manufacturers produced the 
suspect product 
there are still a number of ongoing investigations which are 
not yet complete kilbourne said this is still a very 
complicated investigation 
but the showa denko co one of japans largest chemical 
manufacturers said in a statement thursday that studies show a 
statistically significant association between our bulk ltryptophan 
and the outbreak last fall of ems showa denko has been named in 
at least one lawsuit from an ems patient a 20 million claim from 
an oregon woman 
although the precise cause of ems has not been identified we 
are pleased that progress has been made toward solving the medical 
mystery koji yanai president of showa denko america said in 
the statement we will continue to cooperate with state and 
federal health authorities and independent researchers with the 
goal of finding the precise cause and treatment of ems 
ltryptophan is taken for excess weight sleeplessness and 
depression before its recall by the food and drug administration 
it was widely sold in health food stores 
the blood disorder is marked by severe muscle and joint pain 
breathing difficulties swelling of the arms and legs skin rash 
fatigue cough and sometimes fever in some cases victims show 
signs of congestive heart failure and develop a condition that 
causes progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis

a politically sensitive proposal to cut social 
security taxes failed its first formal congressional test 
the democraticrun senate budget committee voted 176 thursday 
against endorsing a plan that would slash the retirement programs 
payroll tax by 365 billion next year 
the vote was nonbinding but it provided the first sounding of 
lawmakers attitudes toward an idea that has been in the spotlight 
since its introduction last december by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny 
the tally came as the budget committee remained stalled in its 
efforts to craft a 12 trillion budget for the fiscal year 
beginning oct 1 the panel rejected five deficitcutting plans 
containing savings ranging from 43 billion to 565 billion 
across the capitol the house debated its own 124 trillion 
budget for next year which provides less for defense and more for 
domestic programs than president bush prefers final house approval 
of the democraticwritten plan is expected tuesday 
the house rejected two republicansponsored alternatives a 
proposal by rep john kasich of ohio to freeze military and 
domestic spending at current levels lost 305106 a plan by rep 
william dannemeyer of california featuring the use of goldbacked 
bonds to reduce the governments debt costs was defeated 35448 
sen james sasser dtenn chairman of the senate budget 
committee said he expected his panel to adopt a budget next week 
that would slash the deficit by about 40 billion the grammrudman 
law requires at least 37 billion in deficitreduction in the 
upcoming fiscal year 
im not discouraged at all sasser said after thursdays 
repeated no votes 
the social security tax cut proposal offered by sen ernest 
hollings dsc was virtually identical to the bill introduced by 
moynihan 
moynihan advanced the idea as a way of shrinking annual social 
security surpluses which he says mask the true size of the budget 
deficit he says the tax hits low and middleincome people the 
hardest because it applies to only the first 51300 of annual 
wages 
moynihans plan ignited political warfare the white house 
accused democrats of using it as an excuse to eventually reduce 
social security benefits some democrats hailed it as their partys 
own taxcut plan while others complained that the proposal would 
balloon the deficit even further 
nine democrats and eight republicans voted against hollings 
measure while four democrats and two republicans supported it 
the provision would have lowered the 62 percent payroll tax to 
51 percent next jan 1 the tax is paid by both wage earners and 
employers a family with an income of 32000 would save 400 a 
year 
the budget committees democrats were split over each of the 
five deficitcutting plans passage was impossible because gop 
senators voted solidly against the proposals republicans say 
congressional negotiations with the white house are the only way to 
concoct moneysaving measures that have a chance of becoming law 
all the democratic plans relied more on defense cuts and tax 
collections than bush wants they also surpassed the 37 billion in 
deficit reduction the president proposed in january

moviemakers defaced a limestone cavern in 
the mojave desert by painting fake indian pictographs on the rock 
for a scene in an oliver stone film on singer jim morrison park 
rangers said 
state officials had allowed stone to shoot part of his film 
the doors at mitchell caverns natural preserve in the 
providence mountains state recreation area 
the artists were required to paint the pictographs using a 
powdery substance they said could be vacuumed off the walls but 
someone used water in the process causing the substance to seep 
into the limestone 
the problem was discovered when the film company tried to vacuum 
the designs after the filming in march and failed said steven 
hansen chief ranger for the state park systems mojave river 
district 
this is absolutely criminal said elden hughes of the sierra 
club this shows total disrespect for a tremendous and rare 
resource 
producers of the doors which comes from the name of the 
late morrisons rock group said they contacted art restoration 
experts and specialists at the j paul getty museum in malibu to 
tackle the problem 
this is something we are very concerned with said alex ho 
producer of the doors the film company will spare no expense 
to remove the symbols but experts are few and far between we are 
making every effort to solve this problem 
mitchell caverns about 35 miles west of needles is known for 
its spectacular stalagmite stalactite and other mineral formations 
created several million years ago 
for 500 years the caves were used by the chemehuevi indians for 
shelter and ceremonial purposes 
the whole cave site was part of the initiation process for the 
shamans said scott simons president of the mojave desert 
chapter of the sierra club this is like taking a can of spray 
paint into a cathedral 
hansen said stone applied in february for permission to shoot a 
scene in the largest cavern the 250footlong tecopa cave actor 
val kilmer portraying morrison wanders about the cave in a 
hallucinatory state and meets a holy man 
the scene calls for morrison to study indian pictographs on the 
cave walls which the academy awardwinning stone had to create 
about 100 stick figures and other indian symbols were drawn on the 
limestone 
were not going to rest until its off and everyone is 
happy said larry fulton the films art director

the seawolf attack submarine hasnt touched 
the water and it is already on the defensive at the pentagon and on 
capitol hill 
with defense secretary dick cheney expected to complete an 
evaluation of seawolf next month a congressional panel added to 
the siege atmosphere thursday by detailing serious deficiencies 
and cost overruns in the subs computer system 
the seawolf represents the newest generation of attack 
submarines and perhaps the newest generation of waste and abuse at 
the pentagon said rep john conyers jr dmich chairman of a 
house government operations subcommittee investigating the program 
the inquiry turned up an internal navy memo pointing out 
problems in a sophisticated computer system that runs everything 
from the engine to the subs weapons systems 
without the computer software the seawolf submarine is just 
so much metal floating around out there said conyers 
the probe conducted by conyers national security subcommittee 
and the congressional general accounting office focused on the 
bsy2 computer system referred to colloquially as the busytwo 
the computer is built for the navy by the general electric co 
in syracuse ny it is designed specifically for the seawolf 
which is to be built in groton conn by general dynamics corp 
and in newport news va by the newport news shipbuilding and 
drydock co 
it has recently come to my attention that serious deficiencies 
in the busytwo software development program have been identified 
by department of defense software experts conyers said 
however it is by no means clear that corrective actions have 
been taken 
at thursdays hearing navy officials in charge of seawolf said 
they were unaware of a march 19 internal navy memo detailing 
problems in the computer software conyers had copies of the memo 
but did not make them publicly available 
the navys top acquisition official assistant secretary gerald 
a cann said he would respond to the memo as soon as it could be 
studied but he said there was little risk that any technical 
problems would significantly delay delivery of the system to 
groton where the first seawolf is under construction 
i dont think we have a flaming disaster here cann said 
ge spokesman george jamison said it was inappropriate to comment 
on an internal navy memo 
according to conyers the memo listed a number of problems 
including the navys failure to program all of the computers 
complex function in a single computer language developed for 
sophisticated weaponry 
the bsy2 is specifically designed to enable seawolf to detect 
and locate targets faster than existing submarine combat systems 
and to allow operators to detect and attack multiple targets 
frank conahan who headed the gao investigation of seawolf 
called the bsy2 system one of the most technically challenging 
and complex software development efforts ever undertaken for a 
submarine 
the navy has no alternative to the bsy2 system under 
consideration conahan said and problems in development of the 
computer could lead to costly delays in completion of the 
submarines 
rep frank horton rny the ranking republican on the 
subcommittee noted there has already been a 140 million cost 
overrun in completion of the first two bsy2 systems 
pending congressional approval the navy plans to buy 29 
seawolfs by the year 2000 at an estimated cost of 44 billion ge 
was awarded a 18 billion contract to develop the bsy2 in 1988 
assuming the entire run of submarines is built the computer 
equipment alone would account for 74 billion of the cost conahan 
said 
conyers said it is far more likely that the pressure to reduce 
defense spending will scale down the size of the seawolf program 
significantly

herring a cia analyst for 20 years until 1983 what has caused 
it to happen is competition particularly among american companies 
that for the first time are experiencing both international and 
corporate competition 
herring is vice president of the futures group in glastonbury 
conn a consulting company that helps corporations design develop 
and operate their own intelligence organizations 
he was on hand thursday for the annual meeting of the 
4yearold 1400member society 
in japan corporate spying is an old and respected custom 
herring said 
the japanese are the professionals he said theyre the 
ones who started it they do it almost second nature its just 
part of their companies 
margulies new president of the society said the japanese 
have honed their techniques for gathering and analyzing 
information to the point where they play it like an instrument like 
a professional musician 
corporate spying unlike its notorious relative industrial 
espionage is an honorable business margulies said 
corporate spies dont try to ferret out confidential information 
or bug meetings in their rivals offices rather they rely on 
public information and interviews with experts 
it is not glamorous work said margulies it is pure 
unadulterated research collecting data interpreting that data 
and communicating to your management or customer 
the information explosion of the past decade fueled by more 
powerful computers and a proliferation of data banks and 
specialized publications has enabled corporate spies to find out 
almost anything they want about competitors 
advanced degrees and computer expertise are the new cloaks and 
daggers 
ninetyfive percent of what you need is readily accessible 
that additional five percent that you cant get legally is not 
going to help you that much so why throw your career down the 
drain why embarrass your company its a nono margulies said 
margulies estimated that more than 10000 people work in 
competitor intelligence for hundreds of companies many of them in 
marketing strategic planning or financial departments 
those who are good at it are precious herring said 
a good intelligence analyst pulls together the pieces of 
the puzzle he said youll never get all the pieces you may 
sometimes get 70 percent but he can see the picture when you find 
those kinds of people theyre real jewels

the bush administration argues that extending 
a ban on imported saturday night specials to domestic arms 
manufacturers would deprive some americans of the ability to defend 
themselves with handguns 
assistant attorney general sg dennis jr told the house 
judiciary committees subcommittee on crime thursday that a total 
ban on the handguns commonly known as saturday night specials 
would deprive citizens who do not already own a handgun of their 
ability to obtain one suitable for selfdefense but not for 
sporting purposes 
gun control opponents paint the attempt to outlaw small cheaply 
made handguns as a class and racial issue because poor people 
especially blacks are more often the victims of crime and 
inadequate police protection 
but the committees chairman william j hughes dnj and 
other democrats said it was hypocritical to ban imports and not 
domestic versions of the weapons

a final appeal to delay startup of the 
seabrook nh nuclear power plant has been turned aside by chief 
justice william h rehnquist 
the decision thursday clears the way for the reactor to begin 
routine operations 
without comment rehnquist rejected a bid by opponents of the 
plant to hold up operation until a lowerlevel federal appeal can 
be heard next september 
we and the other opponents continue to have very serious 
concerns about the operation of that plant and thats why we could 
not in good conscience go ahead without exhausting every legal 
remedy available said mary breslauer a spokesman for 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon who is leading the 
antiseabrook forces 
plant spokesman ron sher said the seabrook reactor is currently 
being operated at 8 percent power and the power plant is on the 
verge of producing its first commercial electricity more than two 
decades after it was first conceived 
that will be the most significant milestone in seabrook 
stations history sher said that will mark the first time 
that seabrooks electricity will be traveling through the power 
lines of new england to homes and businesses and industries

seven weeks after leading his leftist 
guerrillas into the political system presidential candidate carlos 
pizarro died the violent death he long eluded as an insurgent 
pizarro was on a campaign trip when he was assassinated aboard a 
crowded jetliner in flight thursday 
he completed a peace settlement with the government on march 8 
and in a dramatic ceremony members of his april 19 movement 
guerrilla group surrendered their weapons to international 
observers 
mortars machine guns assault rifles and pistols were stacked 
in a huge pile and hauled off to a forge to be melted down for a 
peace monument 
the government pardoned the guerrillas and allowed the countrys 
most notorious guerrilla group also known as m19 to become a 
political party pizarro was its candidate for the may 27 
presidential elections 
he was murdered before the monument could be made and before he 
could test democracys promise of a better future 
pizarro 38 was from an upperclass family the son of a navy 
admiral but he came to believe colombias rigid political system 
could only be changed through violence 
he was a handsome man standing a trim 5foot10 fairskinned 
with dark curly hair cropped short and a mustache he had a sharp 
jaw that he thrust forward in defiance when he was angry his hobby 
was guns 
pizarro who never married joined m19 in 1974 the april 19 
movement took its name from the date of a presidential election 
that pizarro and other university students said was fraudulent 
the group started off with high spirits and high adventure the 
rebels stole the sword of latin american liberator simon bolivar 
from a bogota museum it has yet to be returned 
pizarro and friends hijacked milk trucks took them to poor 
neighborhoods and distributed the milk to people who thronged 
around them cheering and clapping the rebels on the back 
the emboldened group then began to kidnap people hijack planes 
and raid small towns to rob banks it blew up police stations and 
ransacked stores for supplies 
m19s bloodiest operation came on nov 6 1985 when about 
three dozen rebels seized the palace of justice in bogota more 
than 100 people including 11 supreme court justices and all the 
guerrillas were killed in fighting during the next three days 
pizarro became commander of m19 in 1986 after its fifth 
successive leader was killed 
last year he started negotiating the peace agreement with the 
government 
after disbanding the guerrilla group last month pizarro changed 
his combat gear for brightly colored sports coats and began 
campaigning for the presidency 
his vehement attacks on the united states ended and his views 
took a 180 degree turn 
fidel castro should allow other political parties in cuba he 
said he applauded violeta barrios de chamorros victory in the 
presidential election over leftist sandinistas in nicaragua 
he also said panamas former strongman gen manuel noriega now 
in a florida jail facing drug trafficking charges got what he 
deserved because of his corruption 
last year in an interview with the associated press at his 
mountain stronghold he told of his desire to negotiate peace 
he was asked whether he feared coming down out of the mountains 
and being killed by rightwing death squads who have murdered 
hundreds of leftists in colombia 
im willing to die for what i believe in pizarro replied

federal health officials say tobacco companies 
are using snappy promotions to target young people in marketing 
campaigns far afield of their traditional techniques 
the national centers for disease control said thursday more than 
twothirds of the tobacco industrys record 33 billion 
advertising and promotion budget in 1988 went to such things as 
event sponsorships and free sample giveaways 
promotional efforts differ in important ways from traditional 
advertising the cdc said 
the health agency contended free samples may encourage children 
to try smoking and sponsorship of sports events such as televised 
tennis and racing increases childrens recognition of cigarette 
brands 
but an official of the tobacco institute insisted that promotion 
is the best way to target a shrinking smokers market and said 
accusations that the industry is targeting children are dead 
wrong 
the cdcs accusations are a judgment call based on the 
preconceived notion that the industry is attempting to recruit 
underage smokers said thomas lauria assistant to the president 
of the tobacco institute 
the industry will fire anyone working who gives cigarettes to 
kids thats in our code of ethics he said and if there are 
underage people watching tennis on tv theyre watching the 
tennis 
he also criticized the cdc for grazing in marketing pastures 
theres some question in my mind what the cdc is doing over in 
a field far unrelated to its research he said i wouldnt 
think of going into aids research and making comments based on 
their numbers 
citing federal trade commission data the cdc said the industry 
in 1988 spent just over 1 billion on publication and sign 
advertising or 32 percent of total ad and promotion expenses 
while 22 billion or 68 percent went to promotions 
that was a flipflop from 1975 when 366 million or 75 
percent was spent on advertising and 125 million or 25 percent 
went to promotions

an army of census counters has hit the streets to 
fill in the blanks on some 37 million american households whose 
residents have yet to be counted 
thousands of enumerators began their doortodoor mission 
thursday in 100 metropolitan areas nationwide us census bureau 
officials concerned about the response to the pavement beaters 
sought to assure people that it was safe to open doors 
theyre people from your neighborhood said bj welborn a 
spokeswoman for the boston regional office of the us census 
bureau were trying to put a human face on the count 
nearly 40 percent of more than 95 million census questionnaires 
sent out in march havent been returned and millions more people 
never received forms the doortodoor canvassing is aimed at 
filling in all those missing names 
the next phase in the 13 billion census beginning may 3 is 
to take the doortodoor counting to 300 smaller communities 
collecting data on about 250 million americans couldnt be 
expected to be easy but the 1990 count has been especially vexing 
for one thing there are more doorbells to be rung than during 
the last census only 63 percent of households nationwide mailed 
back census forms this year 12 percent fewer than in 1980 
officials say 
in some big cities the return rate is even lower the census 
bureau says only 52 percent of new york city residents returned 
their census forms 
that does not include households that never got forms the city 
said 19 percent of 2008 residents it polled had not received 
census forms in the mail 
that translates to 600000 households or 15 million people 
said hulbert james the new york city census coordinator that is 
very scary to us 
another potential problem will be getting and keeping enough 
enumerators to finish the census said william m hunt who studies 
the project for the general accounting office 
its going to be much tougher than the bureau thought it would 
be hunt said well have to wait and see whether the 
recruitment is enough to sustain them through the process they 
tend to lose a lot of people 
recruiters have been struggling in more affluent areas like new 
yorks park avenue and californias silicon valley but have gotten 
more than enough applicants for counting jobs in poorer areas like 
new yorks east harlem and around kentucky coal mines the new york 
times reported today citing a survey of district census offices 
the jobs pay between 5 and 8 an hour 
the 1200 boston area counters sworn in thursday were looking at 
a long afternoon of dancing around potholes befriending 
neighborhood dogs and knocking on doors when no one is at home 
i dont like going into strange peoples houses said sheila 
moretti a mother of two and lifelong fixture in this citys 
closeknit mostly italian north end neighborhood but it helps 
that im a familiar face people know they can trust me 
but getting in the door is only half the battle 
then you have to convince people that everything we ask is 
confidential said paula decosta who manages a district census 
office we would be fined and imprisoned if we gave out any 
information 
new immigrants who sometimes associate the federal government 
with taxes or deportation are often among the most reluctant to 
confide in badgecarrying counters 
they dont know its for their own good said yuri quinnie 
of the citys hyde park section i didnt understand it at first 
either 
communities nationwide will earn their piece of the federal pie 
based on the 1990 census results congressional representation and 
federal funding for education housing medical and other local 
needs are at stake 
mike costelnik an enumerator in bayonne nj wasnt 
discouraged by getting replies from only five of the 50 households 
he tried on his first day on the job 
it was the afternoon costelnik said i can always come 
back and get them tomorrow night i am confident i will get them at 
some point

the organization of american states 
has begun providing food to contra rebels even though the fighters 
say they will keep their weapons until their sandinista enemies 
leave the military 
the guerrillas are supposed to lay down their weapons in return 
for such aid but one oas official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said thursday the organization fears the rebels would 
resort to felonies if they go hungry 
one rebel commander threatened that his forces would survive 
by whatever means necessary if provisions were cut off 
the rebels promised to disarm by june 10 but they have balked 
over fears of retaliation by leftist sandinistas who remain at 
their posts in the police and the military 
president violeta barrios de chamorro announced wednesday she 
would allow gen humberto ortega to remain a leader of the army 
ortega is brother of former president daniel ortega who led the 
sandinistas in their nineyear war against the usbacked contras 
mrs chamorros decision has split her own usbacked 
coalition on her first full day in office thursday two cabinet 
appointees were refusing to serve as long as gen ortega remained 
in place 
a thursday morning news conference by mrs chamorro was canceled 
without explanation and she remained out of sight for most of the 
day 
victor jimenez an oas delegate providing aid to demobilize the 
contras said more than 900 pounds of rice corn and beans had been 
delivered since the previous afternoon to rebel chiefs for 
distribution among the troops 
jimenez spoke in an interview at the unoas tent camp 
headquarters outside the mountain hamlet of el amparo in 
northcentral nicaragua 
in an accord signed last week the contras the sandinistas and 
the new government agreed oas aid would be provided to combatants 
after they turned their weapons over to un peacekeepers 
in el amparo maj ed peterson of the un force told 
journalists that not a single contra had turned over his weapon as 
of thursday afternoon 
el amparo sits in a valley in one of five internationally 
monitored areas an estimated 9000 contras are supposed to gather 
in the designated areas in coming days 
on thursday the rebels roamed the 450squaremile area around 
el amparo at will and unsupervised they were well armed with 
sovietdesigned ak47 assault rifles grenade launchers and other 
materiel 
under last weeks accord they were to begin handing over 
weapons to un forces wednesday afternoon following mrs 
chamorros inauguration 
however an assembly of 500 rebels on wednesday ridiculed an 
invitation from mrs chamorros delegate and un and oas 
representatives to begin giving up their arms 
the contras say they will remain armed mobilized and ready to 
resume civil war until the army is either disbanded or overhauled 
to eliminate sandininsta control 
in any case demobilized or not these people have to 
continue eating said jimenez defending the food program 
cmdr jimmy leo a member of the contra general staff and 
four other commanders in the hamlet of el destino scorned any 
attempt to try to link delivery of food to the surrender of weapons 
if they think theyre going to condition food on the handing 
over of a rifle they can load up their food and take it back where 
they got it said jimmy leo who spoke in an interview five miles 
from the unoas base 
israel galeano the contras top commander told his troops in 
an address wednesday if for not receiving any weapons the 
international organizations pack up and leave and dont give us any 
food so be it we will remain intact and vigilant waiting for the 
changes that have to be made 
jimmy leo said that in the event of a cutoff of oas supplies 
we would consider the accords broken and would spread out 
throughout the country were guerrillas and prepared to survive by 
whatever means necessary

management and union officials of hyundai heavy industries co 
said there was little room for compromise the shipyard has been 
closed and news reports quoted government sources as saying force 
may be used to end the strike 
the main dispute is the unions demand for the release of four 
labor leaders arrested in earlier protests the company maintains 
that judicial matters are out of its domain 
last year the government sent in 12000 police supported by 
helicopters to end a bitter 109day strike at the shipyard 
hyundai said it lost 6 million a day in last years strike

of seoul was tense today as riot police with shields and clubs 
surrounded the huge seaside shipyard 
about 10000 militant workers many of whom have occupied the 
yard for three days held a rally and burned a coffin symbolizing 
the police 
we have no choice but to fight said one union leader 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the workers piled up ladders and other giant steel fixtures to 
create a wall to seal off the shipyards main gate hundreds of 
workers wearing helmets and armed with steel pipes patrolled the 
yard 
news reports said police were mobilizing fire trucks 
helicopters and bulldozers to prepare for action 
police intervention appears imminent the influential chosun 
ilbo newspaper quoted a government official as saying 
gas and power supplies to the shipyard were cut thursday night 
cafeterias inside were shut down and 4000 management workers were 
withdrawn the company said 
the hyundai shipyard has about 24000 workers on its payroll 
about 20000 are unionized 
the company said its shipyard is the worlds largest capable of 
building 14 large ships simultaneously sales last year totaled 
15 billion the shipyard is a subsidiary of the giant hyundai 
group which produces cars computers and many consumer goods 
negotiations between the company and the union broke down 
thursday night and the union said there were no plans for further 
talks 
on thursday the government warned strong countermeasures 
would be taken to end what it called any illegal strikes that 
are liable to increase social unrest and hurt the korean economy 
already in a recession 
hyundai workers said three union leaders resigned thursday 
charging that the union is controlled by hardliners connected with 
dissident groups fighting for political causes 
in seoul on thursday night radical students firebombed four 
automobile showrooms of hyundai motor co no one was hurt but some 
windows were broken police said 
a major radical student group the national council of student 
representatives claimed responsibility for the attack it pledged

japanese astronomers have produced detailed 
pictures of austins comet which is heading toward the sun and 
observable through telescopes in the northern hemisphere officials 
said today 
researchers at tokyo university took the photographs through a 
telescope at their observatory in northern japan wednesday night 
details of the comets 44 millionmilelong tail were clearly 
visible in the photos giving researchers a chance to study it an 
observatory official said 
a comets tail is essentially a vapor trail created by solar 
wind striking the comets icy surface 
the pictures are the first of austins comet taken by japanese 
researchers for astronomical observation said the official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the comet is named for rodney austin an amateur astronomer from 
new zealand who discovered it last year 
the comet is moving west advancing about 38 million miles a 
day the observatory official said unlike periodical comets such 
as halleys he said once this one passes the sun it will never 
return 
austins comet will be observable throughout much of the earths 
northern hemisphere until the end of may but it is not bright 
enough to be seen by the naked eye he said 
he said the japanese observation effort is being conducted at 30 
locations in the nation 
data on austins comet including photos will be passed on to 
the smithsonian observatory in the united states the official said

mikhail s gorbachev battled critics on two fronts 
during a visit to the ural mountains where protesters denounced 
the crackdown on lithuania and a group of communists quit the party 
the president came to the industrial city of sverdlovsk about 
870 miles east of moscow to make a pitch for the economic reforms 
he says the soviet union desperately needs 
but some residents were more concerned about events in 
lithuania one of the prolithuania demonstrators tatiana 
karelina said she and other members of the political group 
democratic union mingled among 200 people in sverdlovsk as 
gorbachev spoke thursday in the citys youth palace 
as he was leaving the palace a democratic union member unfurled 
a banner that read gorbachev is a political hypocrite a 
plainclothes officer immediately grabbed the banner and tore it up 
mrs karelina said in a telephone interview 
other banners read no to the economic blockade of lithuania 
official soviet media carried no reports of protest and it was 
not clear whether gorbachev saw the banners 
the lithuanian crisis has come up repeatedly during gorbachevs 
visit to sverdlovsk the kremlin has cut off supplies to lithuania 
to pressure the baltic republic to rescind its march 11 declaration 
of independence 
president francois mitterrand of france and chancellor helmut 
kohl of west germany urged lithuania on thursday to meet moscows 
demands for a suspension of its independence drive 
in a letter to lithuanian representatives in moscow mitterrand 
and kohl said lithuanian president vytautus landsbergis should 
rescind proindependence laws to clear the way for talks with the 
kremlin so that the current crisis ends in a solution acceptable 
to all parties 
lithuanian parliamentary spokesman ed tuskenis said by telephone 
from vilnius the republics capital that landsbergis said he 
would study the letter carefully 
in moscow a lithuanian man died after setting himself on fire 
near the bolshoi theater soviet authorities said today 
police said the man identified as stanislovas jamaitis was 
drunk the independent postfactum news agency reported bystanders 
said he had been shouting various things including demands for 
lithuanian independence 
in sverdlovsk gorbachev also faced problems within the 
communist party and he expressed alarm over the resignations of 
local party members the day he arrived 
in a meeting wednesday with workers of uralmash a gigantic 
machinebuilding complex gorbachev said the party cannot be at the 
forefront of reform unless it keeps in touch with the working 
class then he broke the news about the resignations 
i am greatly alarmed that today 12 workers here gave notice 
about their withdrawal from the party said gorbachev who was 
elected to the top party post in march 1985 
i would look at it this way the time now is such that some 
come and some go i would ask simply that party comrades 
factory people meet with them to try to understand whats the 
matter he said 
the remarks were not reported until thursday tass did not 
explain why the party members quit or whether they timed their 
resignations to coincide with gorbachevs visit 
foreign reporters were not allowed to accompany gorbachev to 
sverdlovsk which is closed to foreigners because it is a center 
for defense industry 
in advance of a communist party congress scheduled in july some 
members are considering splitting off to form a faction a prospect 
gorbachev has condemned the party this year gave up its 
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power and decided to allow 
other political parties 
gorbachev said the main purpose of his trip to sverdlovsk was to 
explain plans to move the centrally planned and sluggish soviet 
economy toward a marketoriented system 
inside the youth palace gorbachev offered reassurances that the 
government will protect lowincome families from some of the 
expected hardships of his economic reforms 
the reforms are expected to free prices and close inefficient 
industies 
gorbachev said they are needed to end a foolish economic 
system that stifles initiative and technological progress 
he also discussed his finances during one of his sverdlovsk 
meetings saying he was responding to rumors that he has a swiss 
bank account into which he deposits royalties 
he said all his royalties including those from a book he 
published in the west about his reform program known as 
perestroika have been put into party coffers 
i have deposited in the party account a million rubles about 
16 million at the official exchange rate and didnt take a 
kopeck for myself he said according to a tass dispatch

state officials said they would defend their 
judicial election system that the us justice department found 
discriminates against blacks 
but one of the 25 superior court judges who could lose their 
jobs under the ruling warned on thursday that defending the system 
instead of changing it could devastate the courts ability to 
render justice 
it would be an impossible situation superior court judge 
david l cavender said we need judges to hear cases it would 
have a very damaging effect 
the justice department on wednesday declared onethird of 
georgias superior court judgeships illegal because the states 
system of electing judges by districts often composed of more than 
one county dilutes black voting strength 
the ruling affects 48 sitting judges including 25 who would 
have been up for reelection in november and an additional 10 
judgeships created in 1989 and 1990 that never have been filled 
georgia has 136 superior court judges 
attorney general michael bowers called the order an 
unwarranted expansion of the voting rights act 
bowers said he believes the state will spend whatever it takes 
to defend its judicial election system even if it means putting 
sitting judges out of work rather than holding new elections for 
their seats 
it could last for years he said is it worth a million 
dollars five million i say yes 
asked whether he would risk letting criminals loose because of 
too few judges to handle cases bowers said that would certainly 
be no change from whats happening right now 
gov joe frank harris spokeswoman barbara morgan said the 
governor would have no immediate comment 
bowers said he would put off action until a threejudge federal 
panel in savannah rules on the states request that sitting judges 
be allowed to stay in office until a federal lawsuit over the 
matter is settled 
the lawsuit challenges 48 judgeships created since 1964 it 
contends that these judgeships were not first cleared by the 
justice department as is required under the voting rights act of 
1965 
the 22 plaintiffs in the lawsuit led by state rep tyrone 
brooks of atlanta were jubilant in praising the justice department 
ruling they blasted state leaders for squandering the taxpayers 
money in defending the system 
i think this makes it clear that fundamental change is going 
to have to happen to have justice in georgia said plaintiffs 
attorney kathleen wilde from the sound of his bowers press 
conference there is no room for negotiation 
the plaintiffs and their attorneys conceded that the justice 
department action is probably only the beginning of a lengthy 
battle 
weve got more rounds to go unfortunately said american 
civil liberties union attorney laughlin mcdonald its clear that 
what the states strategy has been is to do nothing until theyre 
forced to comply 
brooks added were headed for the super bowl at the supreme 
court

christian leaders today closed the church on 
the site where jesus was buried for the first time in more than 800 
years as part of a oneday strike to protest a jewish settlement in 
the old city of jerusalem 
other churches and christian shrines throughout the holy land 
also were closed and church bells in jerusalem bethlehem and 
other towns rang in somber funeral cadence for about five minutes 
every hour 
about 150 clergymen including representatives from nine major 
christian sects gathered to oversee the closing of the massive 
wooden doors of the church of the holy sepulcher site of the 
crucifixion and burial of jesus 
black flags were raised including one atop the church 
in a show of solidarity moslem leaders closed to visitors the 
al aqsa mosque and dome of the rock shrine only worshipers were 
permitted in the complex 
bishop samir kafiti the head of the anglican church in 
jerusalem told reporters the settlers infringement of the 
christian quarter where we have been for 2000 years is a serious 
matter 
he said an israeli supreme court decision to evict the 150 
jewish settlers by tuesday was ambiguous because the judges did not 
return full control to the greek orthodox church 
the church owns the 72room st johns hospice into which the 
settlers moved on april 11 during easter week celebrations it 
claims the fourbuilding complex was illegally leased to the 
settlers 
it is a half solution kafiti said referring to the courts 
decision to allow 20 guards and maintenance staff to remain in the 
building pending a final ruling on the tenancy dispute 
george hintlian secretary to armenian patriarch torkum 
manoogian said if the courts did not eventually rule in favor of 
the greek orthodox church stronger protests will be considered by 
the heads of churches probably longer periods of closure 
the general mood here is that we are very disappointed he 
said 
the church leaders including latin patriarch michel sabbah and 
greek orthodox patriarch diodoros i prayed inside a chapel of the 
church of the holy sepulcher and then read in arabic armenian and 
greek the lords prayer before closing the doors 
it was a rare display of unity by the leaders of the various 
sects who frequently squabble over control of the holy sites 
wajih nusseibeh a moslem whose family keeps the key of the 
church of the holy sepulcher said it was the first time the doors 
were closed since the crusaders were driven out of the city by the 
islamic warrior saladin in the 12th century ad 
the nusseibeh and jodeh families have been the custodians and 
doorkeepers of the church for the past 1200 years to avoid 
conflicts among christian sects 
outside st johns hospice where the neot david settlement was 
established about eight police and two private guards could be 
seen 
benny elon a spokesman for the jewish residents said they had 
no intention of leaving before the end of israels independence day 
holiday monday at that point he said all the families who are 
not linked to the building will leave the 20 people representing 
the company will stay 
creation of the settlement triggered immediate protests from 
church leaders and palestinian moslems and arabs alike the us 
state department described the move as provocative and the greek 
government also protested 
meanwhile the army imposed curfews on three trouble spots in 
the occupied gaza strip after three palestinians were killed and 
more than 120 wounded twelve soldiers were also hurt 
a fourth palestinian was killed by soldiers in the west bank on 
thursday at the start of the moslem holiday of id alfitr 
the hebrew daily yediot ahronot decribed the clash in the 
jabalia refugee camp in gaza as the worst since the start of the 
uprising against israeli rule more than 28 months ago 
maj gen natan vilnai head of the southern command said 
several hundred moslems leaving the yellow mosque in jabalia were 
incited with calls to storm an army outpost and then ran toward it 
palestinian witnesses however said the trouble began when 
soldiers at an army encampment mistook the intentions of a 
procession of 4000 palestinians 
they said the crowd was headed toward a cemetery to pay respects 
to the dead when soldiers opened fire with tear gas palestinians 
responded with stones and bottles 
thursdays deaths brought to 680 the number of arabs killed by 
israeli gunfire in the rebellion in addition 209 palestinians 
have been slain by other arabs as suspected proisraeli 
collaborators fortythree israelis have died in the violence

a federal judge delivered a stern 
lecture on political corruption to a former powerful state senator 
he sentenced to 6 years in prison for selling votes to special 
interests 
us district judge milton l schwartz told joseph montoya that 
voteselling was the most serious type of white collar crime 
in a brief statement before sentencing thursday montoya said 
the system has found me guilty i will live with the 
consequences and so will my family 
he lashed out at the news media claiming reporters had tried 
and convicted me before i even came to trial 
montoya who was chairman of the senate business and professions 
committee was the first california legislator in 35 years to be 
convicted of a felony while in office he was the first person to 
stand trial on charges stemming from an fbi sting of statehouse 
corruption 
he resigned from the senate on feb 9 a week after he was 
convicted of one count of racketeering one count of money 
laundering and five counts of extortion 
montoya was convicted of demanding campaign contributions and 
honorariums in exchange for votes and other legislative favors 
schwartz also ordered montoya to three years probation fined 
him 32000 and ordered him to pay 8000 in restitution he said 
the amounts could be reduced based on montoyas ability to pay 
defense attorney michael sands said montoya had been 
financially devastated by the case 
schwartz ordered montoya to surrender by june 29 defense 
attorneys said they would appeal and a hearing on a motion to 
allow montoya to remain free pending appeal was tentatively 
scheduled for may 24

the man whose shameful taxi etiquette earned him 
the title of worst cabdriver in the city is being deported to 
turkey according to a published report 
driver vehbi gunduz was placed wednesday in the federal 
detention center and will be returned to his native country soon 
immigration and naturalization service spokesman charles troy told 
the new york post in todays editions 
an immigration judge had ordered gunduz to leave the country in 
1985 but gunduz kept appealing until last month when he lost his 
case troy said 
it wasnt his driving record that got him in trouble though 
gunduz must leave because when he entered the united states he 
concealed a drug conviction in italy for which he served more than 
a year in prison troy said 
gunduz began driving a cab in june 1985 in five years he was 
hit with 88 summonses and 199 violations 
he was cited for driving recklessly bullying passengers 
harassing dispatchers overcharging assaulting a taxi inspector 
and dumping riders luggage on an airport road because the 
passengers only wanted to go from one terminal to another 
the taxi and limousine commission took away gunduzs license in 
october when the agency set limits on the number of violations a 
driver can commit before having his license suspended gunduz 
surrendered his license in march 
troy said the ins had been working on the case long before 
gunduz was fingered as the citys worst taxi driver

there are enough bizarre twists and turns in 
accomplice which opened thursday at broadways richard rodgers 
theater to satisfy the most dedicated of contortionists 
unfortunately all of them occur in the second act it takes a 
long slow act 1 to set the convoluted plot of rupert holmes new 
comedythriller in motion and not much of that can be discussed 
here without revealing the surprises 
the play starts out as an awful sendup of those british theater 
mysteries you know the kind that run forever in londons west 
end with such titles as lets murder your wife holmes 
obviously has an affection for these hoary theatrical offerings but 
his adoration doesnt translate very well on stage at the rodgers 
the laughs are scattered and the chills more tepid than terrifying 
accomplice takes place in the moorland cottage of derek and 
janet taylor hes perpetually mixing a gin and tonic shes always 
complaining about their sex life dereks business partner john 
and his wife melinda are expected for dinner any more details 
and they do accumulate would spoil the story 
holmes is something of a mystery buff and gamesman he adapted 
charles dickens unfinished novel the mystery of edwin drood 
as a musical in that show he let the audience choose the murderer 
by having them vote at the end of the show 
accomplice is filled with similiar pranks in fact they 
pile up one after another especially in the second act some are 
ingenious others are exasperating mere gimmicks to kill time as 
well as characters the only thing you can be sure of in this play 
is that nothing is what it seems to be 
that puts a strain on the actors jason alexander pamela 
brull natalia nogulich and michael mckean they are forever 
backtracking and doubletaking unable to give their roles any 
personality as characters they are little more than chess pieces 
to be moved wherever the author wants them to go 
considering the continual surprises art wolffs direction is 
heavyhanded the actors hammer home the less than scintillating 
laugh lines holmes has included a great many inside theater jokes 
yuks about show biz that will mean little to a lot of folks west of 
the hudson river 
designer david jenkins opulent country house setting is fun 
particularly a sinister rotating wine cellar while alvin colts 
garish costumes are exactly right in their awfulness 
they complement all the empty flashiness the author has put on 
the stage holmes has turned out more of a theater game than a 
play accomplice is long on clever but short of any real style 
or wit 
what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times accomplice is one of those 
plays at which the patrons must be sworn to secrecy lest the 
authors surprises be ruined for future customers those secrets 
are safe with me because i found accomplice incomprehensible 
after intermission even though much of act 2 is given over to 
extended roundable discussions among the characters as to what has 
happened or wont happen or cant happen 
howard kissel the daily news accomplice spends too much 
energy trying to fool the audience to be a satisfying play it is 
the work of a sorcerers apprentice who has read the instructions 
but doesnt know that sorcery requires belief not cynicism 
clive barnes the new york post as a true genre piece 
accomplice is perhaps a little too generic with more spills 
than thrills yet it does have many good points and audiences 
determined to connive at contrivance and suspending even their 
suspenders might find themselves willing accomplices to 
accomplice

defense secretary dick cheney challenged his 
capitol hill critics today to end their bold talk about cutting 
the defense budget and come up with specifics for paring the 
nations military in a time of reduced superpower tensions 
speaking a day after he proposed sharp reductions in the b2 
stealth bomber production and cutbacks in other major warplane 
programs cheney said he was pleased with the response hed 
received during his testimony 
but he also had a blunt message for those lawmakers who say hes 
not cutting enough put up or shut up 
what i have heard consistently from the congress is a lot 
of bold talk about wanting to take down the top line on defense i 
have yet to see them deliver in terms of being willing to cut 
programs cut bases reduce force structure to achieve those 
levels cheney told reporters 
its easy to pontificate about what the overall top line ought 
to be but as soon as we get down to the real nittygritty of how 
were going cut the defense budget theres a noticeable lack of 
any significant substantive plans on capitol hill the secretary 
said 
asked to respond to criticism from house armed services chairman 
les aspin dwis that his program was too modest in spending 
cuts cheney said that aspin has had trouble in the past with 
gaining enough support in his own committee to support his views 
let alone prevail on the house floor 
he then challenged the lawmakers to come up with and vote on a 
defense budget if they think they can improve on the 
administrations plan 
if theyve got a better plan let em put it out there if 
theyve got the votes to change it produce them cheney said 
but the secretary predicted that the dissension on capitol hill 
about how to revamp the military in such a time of sweeping change 
and during an election year means that serious bargaining 
wont begin until late this fall and that a lameduck session of 
congress could be necessary before an agreement can be reached 
cheneys aircraft review calls for reducing the proposed number 
of b2 bombers from 132 to 75 and reducing the proposed purchase of 
the c17 longrange transport plane from 210 to 120 
the defense secretary also called for cutting back on the navys 
a12 attack aircraft and delaying purchases of the air forces 
advanced tactical aircraft and advanced tactical fighter 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee praised cheneys efforts but declined to adopt the 
proposed numbers 
i dont want to commit to any specific quantities of these 
weapons or the total of annual production rates until we know the 
results of the testing that will occur now at a more orderly way 
nunn said 
cheney cited the lessening soviet threat to the west and the 
impact of the faltering soviet economy on the military budget as 
the rationale for the aircraft reductions 
the proposal is based on an unrealistically pessimistic view 
of the soviet threat aspin said 
and at least one republican questioned whether likely 
congressional cuts in defense spending guided cheneys hand 
what is different on the b2 now that we had to have 132 
three months ago and all of sudden 75 will do the job is it 
because you think congress is going to do it anyway sen trent 
lott rmiss told cheney 
if we can go from 132 to 75 i may start saying hey well 
maybe 16 is fine lott said 
cheney responding to the democratic clamor for military cuts in 
response to rapid changes in europe said his blueprint would trim 
24 billion from president bushs 307 billion defense budget for 
1991 and would save 348 billion through 1997 
cheney said he intends to cut the number of b2 aircraft to be 
purchased in the next fiscal year to two planes from the five 
currently proposed at a cost of 55 billion 
the defense secretary also proposed 
buying 120 of the c17 longrange transport planes instead of 
the 210 originally planned at a proposed savings of 119 billion 
over the life of the program the plane is designed to replace the 
aging c141 transport plane 
purchasing 620 rather than the originally requested 858 of the 
navys a12 allweather medium attack planes the a12 is designed 
to replace the navys a6e intruder which is reaching the end of 
its service life as an aircraft carrierbased longrange strike jet 
the cuts could mean elimination of two of the navys 14 aircraft 
carrier battle groups he said 
the air forces version of the plane the advanced tactical 
aircraft is supposed to be used for deep attack missions now 
handled by the f111 and f15 production of the ata would be 
delayed beyond 1997 cheney said

guerrillas fired 20 rockets at israeli 
soldiers and detonated a roadside bomb in southern lebanon 
wounding at least one israeli soldier security sources said today 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said eight 
sovietdesigned katyusha rockets were fired today at an israeli 
army position in the southern village of kawkaba 
the rockets scored direct hits on the israeli position a 
casualty report was not immediately available one source said 
the unidentified guerrillas fired 12 katyusha rockets at israeli 
positions in the southern marjayoun region late thursday and 
denotated a roadside bomb as a twovehicle israeli patrol drove 
through the adjacent ahmadiyeh hill the source said 
the bomb exploded inflicting damage on one of the armored 
personnel carriers one israeli soldier was wounded and evacuated 
by ambulance from the scene the source added 
he said the targets were in israels selfproclaimed security 
zone of southern lebanon 
the source said the rockets were fired from truckmouted 
launchers deployed in southeast lebanon just north of the 
6to10mile security zone 
israel carved out the zone when it withdrew the bulk of its 
invading army from southern lebanon in the summer of 1985 ending a 
threeyear occupation of the predominantly shiite moslem region 
the zone which extends from the mediterranean coast in the west 
to the slopes of mount hermon in the east serves as a buffer to 
absorb crossborder guerrilla infiltrations into northern israel

twenty thousand orthodox jews gathered in 
madison square garden to celebrate the end of a 7year cycle of 
reading the talmud a sacred text of jewish law handed down by the 
ancient rabbis 
these are not dead letters of a printed book they are 
alive rabbi simon schwab of congregation khai adath jeshurun in 
manhattan told the assemblage thursday night 
the talmud is believed to have been given to moses by god at 
mount sinai and handed down orally until the 6th century bc when 
it was transcribed 
it is divided into tracts on agriculture blessings civil law 
matters pertaining to women and families holiness and synagogue 
services and purity including what is kosher 
the ancient codes and commentary have been reinterpreted and 
debated through the ages to answer contemporary questions 
we extend the great chain that binds us with the earlier 
traditions said rabbi chaskel besser chairman of the daf yomi 
commission of agudath israel a coalition of orthodox groups that 
organized the ceremony 
daf yomi means daily page it refers to the fact that the same 
page of the talmud is studied each day by jews everywhere the 
talmud has 2711 double folios and the cycle of reading that began 
in 1982 ended thursday the new cycle begins today 
the written torah is the first five books of the old testament 
the oral torah is the talmud 
most of the men attending the event were hasidim ultraorthodox 
jews who sport long beards long black coats black pants and 
widebrimmed black hats 
the sexes are segregated during orthodox services so women 
attending the celebration sat separately in the balcony most were 
modestly dressed in longsleeve blouses and skirts that fell below

oliver tambo president of the african 
national congress has left sweden after a fivemonth recuperation 
from a stroke officials said today 
tambo the longtime anc leader was staying at a stockholm 
clinic during the swift changes that saw his organization legalized 
and his old friend nelson mandela freed from prison 
tambo came to stockholm on jan 3 after being treated in london 
for a stroke he suffered late last year 
he returned thursday to london without fanfare 
the swedish news agency tt said the exiled tambo wanted to 
return to south africa as quickly as possible but it was unlikely 
he would be able to resume an active leadership role in the anc 
senior anc leaders are to meet the south african government next 
week for talks aimed at clearing the way for formal talks on ending 
white minority rule 
tambo reportedly gave mandela who was named deputy president of 
the anc his full support as acting anc leader when the freed 
activist came to sweden in march for a reunion of the two former 
law partners 
mandela was released feb 11 after 27 years in prison in south 
africa he was jailed on charges of helping plan the start of the 
ancs guerrilla campaign against the government 
anc officials in sweden were not available to comment on tambos 
plans

a soviet trawler seized by the coast 
guard for allegedly fishing in us waters is being escorted to an 
alaskan port and is expected to arrive sunday officials said 
when it arrives at kodiak it will be charged with violating the 
magnuson act a 1976 law establishing the nations 200mile 
exclusive fishing zone said assistant us attorney tim burgess 
kodiak is about 250 miles southwest of anchorage 
the factory trawler ilya ilyin was seized thursday after a 
highspeed chase by the coast guard cutter yocona inside the united 
states exclusive economic zone northwest of the pribilof islands 
in the bering sea said dennis fradley spokesman for sen frank 
murkowsk ralaska 
coast guard surveillance aircraft spotted the trawler and the 
yocona was diverted to intercept it according to a statement from 
coast guard district headquarters in juneau 
the coast guard said the yocona ordered the soviet ship to halt 
but the vessel attempted to elude the cutter and return to 
international waters 
the cutter pursued the vessel at high speed for the next hour 
and a half crossing into international waters before the vessel 
stopped and was boarded the statement said 
the coast guard told murkowskis washington dc office they 
found records providing clear evidence of illegal fishing 
this one is pretty clear cut said bill woolf a fisheries 
expert on murkowskis staff he said the ship was observed with its 
fishing gear in the water and was believed to be fishing for 
pollock 
the united states and several other nations with highseas 
fishing fleets have clashed for years over the rich and lucrative 
north pacific fisheries the united states has seized a number of 
canadian taiwanese and other vessels in the north pacific in 
recent years but seizures of soviet fleet fishing vessels is less 
common 
the last time the coast guard seized a soviet fishing vessel in 
the north pacific was in may 1989 when the trawler novoelnya was 
captured with 940 metric tons of pollock aboard the soviets paid 
275000 in fines burgess said

spending should be cut to help pay for german unification 
chancellor helmut kohls senior aide predicted agreement on merging 
the two countries economies within a week 
rudolf seiters kohls chief of staff also told parliament that 
local and state governments will help pay the costs of merging the 
two germanys and said the process will be easier if citizens show 
courage 
east and west german officials today negotiated economic union 
and seiters predicted success within a week and the merging of the 
two economies by summer 
west germany is demanding that the east german economy be 
completely overhauled but lothar de maiziere east germanys prime 
minister said his people would face enormous burdens if subsidies 
on rents energy and public services are eliminated immediately 
seiters acknowledged that the cost of reviving east germanys 
economy and protecting its people from economic shocks will result 
in west german budget cuts in defense and other areas and a 
higher budget deficit 
he did not specify what military cuts bonn envisions although 
it is considering a reduction in its 490000member armed forces to 
400000

can absorb much of the cost of unification and noted kohls promise 
not to raise taxes

excluding them from participating in the unification process 
unification is not a private matter for the federal 
chancellor it is a matter for the whole people said herta 
daeublergmelin a top official with the opposition social 
democrats 
west germany and east germany hope to adopt a single currency 
and join their economies by july 2 which will be huge steps toward 
ending the two countries 41year division 
no details were immediately forthcoming from the negotiations in 
east berlin on bonns proposed state contract on the monetary 
economic and social union of the two nations 
the proposal includes terms for replacing east germanys 
currency with the mighty west german mark restructuring the east 
german economy and adopting social programs to protect east 
germans from resulting economic shocks

wages pensions and savings up to 2300 savings over that amount

president bush acknowledging huge problems 
with the gathering of 1990 census data today implored americans 
who have not returned their census forms to do so at once 
we really need to get moving on this bush said in his first 
comments on the poor return rate so far in the census undertaking 
nearly 40 percent of more than 95 million census questionnaires 
sent out in march havent been returned and millions more people 
never received forms 
the us census bureau this week began sending out doortodoor 
census enumerators to help fill in the missing blanks 
bush said that in light of the poor response this would be a 
mammoth undertaking 
he made his appeal at the beginning of a talk to a group of 
state legislators visiting the white house 
the census data will help us make important decisions for the 
states bush told the american legislative exchange council 
census information is crucial for distributing federal funds in 
a variety of programs to states and local governments 
accurate census data is also needed for the redrawing of 
district lines for congressional and legislative seats 
bush called on the state legislators to help the federal 
government in coaxing americans into doing a better job of 
returning their census forms which where supposed to have been 
mailed in on april 1 
i want to take this opportunity to urge every american who has 
not returned the census form to do so to stand up and be 
counted the president said 
it was the first time that the vexing problems plaguing the 
census bureau has attracted official white house comment even 
though bush has made the importance of congressional restricting a 
major feature of his political speeches 
the president has told republican audiences to be vigilant 
against what he has said will be attempts in states with 
democraticcontrolled legislatures to redraw congressional and 
legislative district lines to minimize gop gains

when the movie cry freedom 
appeared in south africa in 1988 it was greeted by a storm of 
controversy two bomb blasts and a police order confiscating the 
film hours after it opened 
the movie reopened friday without fanfare 
the film began showing at more than 40 theaters nationwide to 
moderate crowds and no incidents according to police theater 
managers and the films distributor united international pictures 
people have accepted changes said dave de villiers general 
manager of sterkinekor theaters in johannesburg and surrounding 
areas cry freedom opened like an ordinary movie and we expect 
it will do decent business its not a controversial blockbuster 
like it was two years ago 
cry freedom is about black activist steve biko who died in 
police custody in 1977 and donald woods a white newspaper editor 
who befriended him the movie is based on two books by woods and 
was directed by sir richard attenborough 
cry freedom contains the most emotional and violent scenes 
involving south african police and black citizens ever shown in a 
general release movie in south africa 
the publications appeals board the governments censorship 
body approved the film july 29 1988 and it began showing at 30 
theaters the same morning 
the movie drew large crowds despite threats by rightwing 
whites there were two bomb blasts outside theaters where cry 
freedom was playing and several other theaters received bomb 
threats seven hours after the film opened police ordered it 
confiscated saying it endangers the safety of the public 
the security forces are portrayed in such a negative light in 
the movie that their public image would be seriously undermined 
said stoffel van der merwe minister of information at the time 
whites are typified as privileged and surrounded by wealth as 
opposed to blacks living in great poverty and subjected to 
exploitation and repression he said 
van der merwe described that portrayal as inaccurate 
but earlier this year police returned the film and indicated it 
could be shown 
president fw de klerk who assumed power in august has eased 
restrictions on many antigovernment activities as part of an 
effort to negotiate a new constitution with blacks 
under south africas apartheid system of racial segregation the 
countrys 5 million whites maintain political and economic control 
and the 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs

also friday the government information office reported it would 
issue a license to allow the soviet film war and peace to be 
shown in taiwan it will be the first soviet movie shown in taiwan

lifted last week to encourage trade between taiwan and the soviet 
union 
foreign ministry officials said they have received about 10 
applications and two visas have been issued allowing soviets to 
visit on business 
in the past month the nationalist government also has approved 
direct trade between taiwan and the soviet union and taiwanese 
investments in projects in the soviet union 
trade between anticommunist taiwan and the soviet union was 
conducted through third countries in the past 
the soviet union has no diplomatic ties with taiwan and 
recognizes the rival communist government in beijing 
the nationalists have long considered the soviet union a hostile 
nation and have linked their defeat in a civil war in china in 1949 
to soviet aid to communist chinese forces

donald trump said today he has discussed selling 
or refinancing virtually every major asset he owns but its not 
because he has any cash problems 
the casino and real estate mogul has hired merrill lynch amp co 
to negotiate a possible sale of the trump shuttle less than a year 
after buying the carrier and attaching his name to it 
if i got the right offer i would consider selling it trump 
told the associated press in a telephone interview 
trump was confirming remarks made to the wall street journal 
which published details of his financial plans in a story today 
after its own interview with him the journals account said trump 
was so adamant about his cash strength he threatened to sue the 
newspaper if it suggested otherwise 
he denied that his empire faces any cash shortage problems 
saying he has cash reserves of 380 million 
im very liquid now he said i want to build up cash 
because i think cash is going to be king 
among his assets are new yorks plaza hotel the glitzy trump 
tower skyscraper on manhattans fifth avenue and casinos in 
atlantic city nj including the 1 billion taj mahal casino 
which recently opened with much fanfare 
he said he is interested in raising cash now so that he will 
have funds on hand in the future to acquire additional properties 
the plaza and trump tower will not be sold however trump said 
some people in the financial community are watching for signs 
that trump might be accumulating cash to cope with a current or 
anticipated cash crunch caused by a heavy debt load 
several of trumps biggest holdings dont produce enough income 
to cover interest payments on loans taken out to pay for the 
acquisitions this means that trump relies heavily on cash cows 
such as casinos and condominiums according to an article today in 
the wall street journal 
the cash is king strategy trump is pursuing has led him to 
consider the sale of the trump shuttle an airline serving new 
york boston and washington when trump acquired the carrier with 
bank loans from eastern airlines last year for 365 million he 
said he wanted to transform it into one of the really fine 
airlines in the world 
trump said he is weighing a sale because he has been approached 
by numerous parties interested in it he declined to say whether he 
is making money on the shuttle or to identify the potential buyers 
weve been engaged to explore strategic alternatives for the 
shuttle merrill lynch spokesman fred yager said he declined to 
elaborate

chinas communist party admitted 113 million new 
members in 1989 a year in which the party was challenged by a 
widely popular democracy movement the official peoples daily said 
friday 
the party newspaper said twothirds of the new members are under 
the age of 35 and have at least high school educations 
the report did not give the current party membership an 
official of the party organization department contacted by phone 
said i know but i wont tell you 
figures published more than a year ago put membership at about 
48 million 4 percent of chinas population 
the party launched a review of the qualifications of all party 
members following the crackdown last june of the democracy 
movement many party members either participated in or voiced their 
support for the studentled movement for democratic reform 
so far it appears few are being dropped from party ranks for 
ideological shortcomings the peoples daily last month said 33400 
people were expelled from the party last year for abuse of power or 
other reasons up slightly from previous years 
the daily said there were 951 million pending applications by 
the end of 1989 and that there were 232 million new applications 
after the political turmoil of june 
in deciding whether to accept someone into the party officials 
consider whether the applicant submits to the party line and party 
discipline and has good moral character they also check the 
applicants personal and family background for such things as 
criminal records or accusations of political errors 
the daily said 53 million of the pending applicants were 
workers farmers herdsmen fishermen intellectuals and soldiers 
the other 4 million are presumably government officials who need 
party membership to advance their careers 
despite widespread disenchantment with the party many young 
people still see party membership as crucial to obtaining good jobs

mongolian security forces ringed the government 
palace today when thousands of people staged an unauthorized 
protest but the opposition demonstrators left peacefully after 
several hours sources in ulan bator said 
it was not immediately clear whether the government had made any 
concessions that led to the retreat most of the police and 
soldiers later withdrew one source said although small numbers 
remained posted outside the building into the night 
it was the first direct confrontation between protesters and 
security forces in five months of prodemocracy demonstrations in 
mongolias capital ulan bator and both sides seemed eager to 
avoid violence the security forces did not have weapons or riot 
gear 
the protest violated a recent government edict requiring that 
all demonstrations be approved in advance 
the largest opposition group the mongolian democratic 
association had planned to encircle the government palace to press 
its demands for equal status with the ruling communist party and 
formation of a temporary multiparty legislature until elections 
but police and soldiers of the internal militia formed a 
protective circle first and blocked adjoining streets said 
suhjargalmaa an editor at mongolias montsame news agency the 
protesters formed a picket line on only one side of the palace 
fronting a large central square where supporters and onlookers 
gathered 
there were about 40000 at noon but now there are much 
fewer suhjargalmaa said in a telephone interview she said the 
security forces did not have weapons or riot gear and that no 
force had been used like most mongolians suhjargalmaa uses only 
one name 
students chanted youth unite and waved national flags and 
emblems of the mongolian democratic association the soviet news 
agency tass said 
mongolian radio said the government was broadcasting appeals 
over loudspeakers for the crowd to disperse but protesters were 
responding with shouts for the soldiers to leave 
so far there has been no violence since opposition groups first 
emerged in december to demand democratic reforms like those 
elsewhere in the soviet bloc 
the mongolian peoples revolutionary party in march surrendered 
its constitutional right to rule and agreed to the first multiparty 
elections in mongolian history apparently believing that its best 
chance of staying in power will come from embracing reforms 
legislative elections are tentatively scheduled for july 
but the opposition has accused the party of cheating by amending 
the election law to give more delegates to rural areas where the 
communists are strongest opposition groups have demanded that this 
be changed and that the communistdominated legislature step down 
immediately they want a provisional legislature including all 
parties to oversee the elections 
earlier this week the mongolian democratic association set a 
deadline of noon today for the government to respond to these and 
other demands government and association officials met on 
thursday but the opposition walked out when its demands were not 
met suhjargalmaa said 
other demands included that the ruling partys central committee 
move its offices from the government palace and that all parties be 
allowed to join a commission that is investigating former 
highranking officials the commission was set up by the ruling 
party in early april to uncover alleged abuses of power under 
former dictator yumjaagiyn tsedenbal he was ousted in 1984 but 
many of his associates remain in government and the party 
tass said president punsalmaagiin ochirbat broadcast a speech on 
television and radio late thursday and early today urging the 
public to resist pressure stay calm and avoid disruptions of work 
public prosecutor baljinnyam said he would implement a decree 
issued by ochirbat in early april that requires advance approval 
for demonstrations and allows the government to use force 
suhjargalmaa said 
but she predicted the government would not use force because 
that would undermine its own reform efforts

a strong earthquake battered the remote highlands 
of central china killing 115 people and leaving thousands 
homeless the state seismology bureau said friday 
a bureau official said 160 people were injured in thursdays 
tremor which measured 69 on the richter scale 
china central television reported that the quake centered in 
the hainan tibetan autonomous prefecture of qinghai province left 
5000 people homeless hundreds of people were sleeping on the 
ground wrapped in heavy blankets to ward off the cold of the 
qinghai high plateau 
the news program said 500 soldiers and workers from army and 
provincial hospitals were rushed to the scene soldiers dug through 
the rubble of demolished packedearth homes and dragged away 
corpses 
the earthquakes epicenter about 70 miles southwest of the 
provincial capital of xining is believed populated mainly by 
tibetan herdsmen and miners 
qinghai one of chinas largest and least populous provinces is 
also home to moslem huis kazakhs and mongolians and contains many 
prisons and labor camps 
the temblor was felt as far away as the city of lanzhou 186 
miles to the east 
the powerful tremor dug large cracks in roads and often left 
nothing standing but wooden doors the only house shown in the tv 
tape that was not destroyed was a concrete structure with half its 
wall collapsed 
a seismology bureau official who gave his name only as zhai 
said more than 1000 homes collapsed in the initial quake and 
during more than 600 aftershocks some aftershocks were as strong 
as 60 on the richter scale 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph 
a quake measuring 6 can cause extensive damage in a populated area 
while one measuring 7 is 10 times stronger 
the far western chinese province of xinjiang was hit by a quake 
measuring 64 on april 19 some 1300 homes were damaged and two 
people were injured

irans spiritual leader ayatollah ali 
khamenei on friday denied there were rifts within the iranian 
leadership tehran radio reported 
khamenei said the western news medias portrayal of differences 
among iranian leaders was a result of their blindness and 
folly he said the west failed to understand the divine and 
spiritual relationships among the countrys leaders 
sharp differences over economic policy and normalizing relations 
with the west are believed to exist among iranian leaders 
khamenei who is often aligned with the pragmatic president 
hashemi rafsanjani favors a more laissezfaire economy and mending 
ties with the west to attract investment and technology for the 
countrys flagging economy 
a radical opposition camp led by former interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi wants tighter government control of the economy 
and eschews good ties with the west 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said khamenei was speaking 
to thousands of worshipers gathered at the shrine of the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on the outskirts of tehran 
the weekly prayer was significant friday because it coincided 
with the islamic celebration of eid alfitr marking the end of the 
moslem fasting month of ramadan 
rafsanjani won a major victory over his rival camp by helping 
gain the release sunday of american educator robert polhill from 
proiranian lebanese captors 
recognizing the hostages as perhaps the greatest obstacle 
blocking ties with the west rafsanjani is believed to want to end 
the crisis by gaining release of the 17 remaining western captives 
in lebanon 
the radicals including mohtashemi want the captives to remain 
most of the hostages who include seven americans are believed 
to be held by proiranian shiite factions in lebanon the hostage 
held longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985

despite their best efforts the 
residents of kalapana may be fighting a losing battle to preserve 
their town from a lava flow from kilauea volcano 
this rural community lost six more houses thursday and three 
early today said bruce butts a civil defense spokesman 
the latest toll brings to 31 the number of houses destroyed this 
month or about a quarter of the 125 homes in and around the 
kalapana gardens subdivision in all 107 houses have been 
destroyed along the southeastern coast of hawaii island since the 
volcano began erupting jan 3 1983 
two separate flows were joining together to overrun the 
subdivision with a sea of fastmoving lava that was heading toward 
the towns heart the activity caused civil defense officials to 
extend blockades and to warn residents of the possibility of large 
methane gas explosions 
lava surges were occurring in several areas threatening several 
more homes and continuing the destruction that has gone 
uninterrupted in the past week 
hawaii county civil defense administrator harry kim warned 
residents that the towns one store and two churches could be 
destroyed in the next week to 10 days 
im amazed by the constant fluidity its losing very little 
of its temperature kim said he said the lava was moving a foot 
a minute in some places 
the coastal community may soon be history said kim who now 
refers to people being relocated rather than evacuated 
because he doesnt think theyll be able to return 
moving companies were volunteering their services to help 
residents pack move their homes or dismantle them for 
reconstruction later but the lava swallowed up five homes thursday 
michael stephens whose house was the second to burn up 
thursday had the dubious honor of being the 100th homeowner 
victimized by the hawaiian volcano goddess madam pele 
i didnt think it was going to happen at first then i thought 
it was stephens said i really couldnt think straight 
after his home burned stephens helped neighbors pack their 
belongings 
the american red cross set up a disaster relief center near the 
civil defense command post at harry k brown park on the outskirts 
of the town about three dozen residents had set up tents in the 
park 
tourists continued to flock to the area trying to glimpse the 
imminent destruction oozing its way forward 
kini pea a custodian at the star of the sea church who had 
watched it being built in the 1930s said sunday service is planned 
as usual 
buidlingmoving companies have volunteered to move the church 
for free but officials have yet to decide when and where to move 
it 
meanwhile the hawaiis insurance industry has assured state 
insurance commissioner robin campaniano that area homeowners will 
continue to be insured 
one company royal insurance co had recently drawn 
campanianos ire when it refused to renew a policy for a house 
threatened by lava campaniano said roayl has agreed to honor its 
commitments to policyholders in the area

people in similar attacks since 1985

programs at police stations which have either been bombed or need 
renovation

to have done construction work at police and military installations 
in the province defying ira death threats 
police said the explosion was at an intersection near kilkeel 
five miles from the border with ireland police could not 
immediately determine whether the bomb was placed in the car or 
planted in the road graham later died in the hospital

violence this year in northern ireland 
police said today they discovered a major bomb factory in a 
vacant house in the border town of newry also county down and

dismissed the jury and ordered a new trial

mstislav rostropovich artistic director of 
the national symphony orchestra on friday compared restrictions on 
federal aid to the arts to the soviet unions censorship of 
writers artists and composers 
testifying before a senate hearing on financing for the national 
endowment for the arts rostropovich recalled how he had chafed 
under soviet censorship and smuggled out of that country a 
symphony babiy yar by dd shostakovich 
it was that life under censorship that led me to the united 
states rostropovich said 
only now he said are soviet people learning about some of 
their own writers and seeing their works published 
art and literature should be judged by the conscience of the 
creator his peers in his field and all of the people not by a 
separate bureaucracy artificially compressing the arteries and 
veins of this lifesustaining circulation he said 
rostropovich was among the witnesses supporting reauthorization 
of the nea before the education arts and humanities subcommittee 
of the senate labor and human resources committee 
the nea has come under intense criticism for works of art 
produced by artists who received support from the endowment and 
which were judged by some to be obscene or offensive 
congress added language to its 1990 appropriation for nea 
preventing federal aid for obscene art including but not 
limited to depictions of sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual 
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts 
a prominent new york producer joseph papp on thursday turned 
down a 50000 nea grant rather than pledge that none of the 
government money would be used for works that might be judged 
obscene 
phyllis schlafly president of the eagle forum a conservative 
group argued at the hearing that federal support for the endowment 
should be cut off 
she said the issue was not censorship but responsible use of 
taxpayers money 
nobody has a right to receive unrestricted grants of the 
taxpayers money schlafly said 
the nea was born in the mid1960s when unregulated handouts 
to targeted constituencies were the passion of the day schlafly 
said that era is over having proved its irresponsibility in 
spending the taxpayers money the national endowment for the arts 
should be completely defunded 
the chairman of the national endowment for the arts john e 
frohnmayer appeared at a house subcommittee hearing a day earlier 
where he called the restrictive language a compromise probably 
fully satisfactory to none he said confusion about the 
restrictions among artists was demonstrated by papps action 
frohnmayer said the language has made our task more difficult 
rather than easier and repeated his request that no content 
restrictions be added to the next appropriation and said the 
endowment would pursue its plans to improve a peer panel review 
process

original mickey mouse club

any more than a few dollars from the sales the lawsuit says 
in court papers gillespie said she only became aware of the 
gravity of her loss in 1987

a bloody 1979 rampage expressed remorse before he was executed 
early friday but a cheer erupted from a waiting crowd as his body 
was borne from the death house

pronounced dead seven minutes later said william d catoe the 
corrections departments deputy commissioner for operations 
the west virginia native was put to death for the murder of

im glad to know woomer wont ever be on the streets again to 
harm anybody else said 50yearold marion wright the brother of

the lens cover on the hubble space 
telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems and 
mission control told the discovery astronauts they no longer are 
needed to rescue the 15 billion instrument 
youve been released from hubble support its on its own 
mission control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door 
opened 
thank you sir thats great news said discovery commander 
loren j shriver 
there are handshakes and smiles all around up here said 
steve hawley who had been at the controls when the telescope was 
released into its own orbit on wednesday ill bet its just that 
way down there too 
the successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the 
astronauts to return to earth on sunday they had blasted into 
space tuesday after a twoweek delay and dispatched the telescope 
from its payload bay wednesday 
the hubble is open for business mission control told the 
astronauts 
the telescope still was having problems however when the door 
opened two of its four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped 
working and the electronic system went into an automatic safe 
mode in which all motion is stopped 
the team at the goddard space flight center in maryland which 
guides the telescope said the dooropening motion jarred the 
telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted 
properly in shutting down 
by early afternoon a stepbystep procedure was begun to bring 
the telescopes electronics back on line 
steve terry a top hubble engineering official said tolerances 
for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the 
first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions in 
addition to the trouble this morning there two communications 
outages thursday totaling several hours 
were cautious and thats natural he said weve got a 
very expensive spacecraft here and we dont want to do anything to 
jeopardize the usefulness well get to the point where we know 
exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits 
appropriately 
nasa announced that at this time the telescope is safe 
stable 
the space shuttle discovery which carried the telescope to 
orbit was 50 miles behind the telescope ready to lend a hand if 
needed later in the day the ship was to do an engine firing that 
would set it on a preliminary path for home 
that path would take the discovery two miles below the telescope 
the lens cover a 10foot diameter aperature door covers 
the opening to the telescopes light shield when it is closed the 
telescope is blind 
the lens cover had been closed except for a tiny wedge opening 
ever since the 15 billion telescope was dropped overboard by 
the discovery crew on wednesday 
now that it is opened starlight can strike the lens for the 
first time and it can go about its business of photographing and 
analyzing the universe in ways and with sensitivity never before 
possible 
the door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets covered on the 
outside with solarreflecting material the inside is painted black 
to absorb stray light 
if the door opening command had failed the five discovery 
astronauts who deployed hubble were prepared to head back to the 
telescope mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn 
sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door 
saturday if necessary 
if it had been needed the rescue would have delayed the 
landing scheduled for sunday at edwards air force base calif by 
a day 
the astronauts were awakened at 230 am edt to the mellow 
sounds of the beach boys song kokomo 
for max qs keyboard thats the way that song should really 
be done mission control radioed to mission specialist steve

the nations economy grew at a surprising 21 
percent rate in the first quarter the government reported friday 
but analysts said an ugly inflation rate could mean higher 
interest rates that would slow growth later this year 
we have set ourselves up for a halfway decent first half of 
1990 said donald straszheim chief economist for merrill lynch 
capital markets in new york but by the end of the year the 
economy will be slowing 
in addition to the strength in the gross national product the 
nations total output of goods and services the commerce 
department reported that inflation jumped 65 percent its steepest 
jump since a 77 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1981 
the gnp inflation rate for 1989 was 45 percent 
the inflation number was absolutely ugly remarked robert g 
dederick chief economist of the northern trust co in chicago 
he and other analysts said the pace of inflation boosted in 
part by the weather probably will slow during the current quarter 
to the 45 percent5 percent range 
but that still means the federal reserve will not lower interest 
rates and may decide to boost them further to slow the price 
spiral they contend 
higher rates curb growth in the construction and other 
interestsensitive industries by raising the cost of borrowing 
j antonio villamil the commerce departments chief economist 
called the inflation report disappointing news without the 
weather effect and a federal pay raise that went into effect in 
january prices still rose 52 percent during the quarter he said 
but villamil was upbeat about the 21 percent gnp grow which 
nearly doubled the 11 percent rate during the fourth quarter and 
came close to matching the administrations 22 percent forecast 
the administration is counting on a growing economy to help 
narrow the federal budget deficit 
despite the larger price rise villamil said the first 
quarter still had encouraging developments signs of the economys 
resilience 
most economists agreed 
on the gnp data one cant find anything wrong with this 
economy said allen sinai chief economist with the boston co 
everything is up except inventories a development he said was 
a healthy sign 
lower inventories usually result in a rise in production as 
companies restock their shelves and backlots 
other than inventories however increases in the gnp were 
widespread consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of 
economic activity rose 25 percent after a meager 05 percent 
advance in the previous quarter 
durable goods which had fallen 14 percent from october through 
december more than recovered with a 17 percent jump automobiles 
accounted for about twothirds of the increase 
the trade deficit narrowed as exports rose 09 percent while 
imports dropped 28 percent the deficit is the difference between 
the two 
business investment for expansion and modernization rose 76 
percent after declining 54 percent the previous quarter housing 
construction which was down 11 percent at years end jumped 85 
percent 
but analysts said much of the housing improvement was due to the 
warm weather which prompted builders to begin projects they 
normally would not have started until later in the year the 
analysts said the early starts will subtract from future growth 
the commerce department also said the weather played a part in 
hiking the inflation rate 
the 21 percent advance was the fastest since a 30 percent gain 
in the third quarter last year the various changes left the gnp 
after adjusting for inflation growing at an annual rate of 4196 
trillion in the first three months of the year

thousands of people gathered outside the 
mongolian government palace for an illegal protest friday but 
dispersed peacefully after security forces surrounded the palace 
sources in mongolia said 
it was the first direct confrontation between protesters and 
security forces in five months of prodemocracy demonstrations in 
mongolia and both sides seemed anxious to avoid violence the 
security forces did not have weapons or riot gear said the sources 
in the mongolian capital of ulan bator 
the protesters who demanded resignation of the 
communistdominated legislature violated a recent edict by 
president punsalmaagiin ochirbat that all demonstrations be 
approved in advance 
ochirbat tried to head off the confrontation by offering 
thursday night to set up a council for opposition groups to make 
suggestions to the legislature but the opposition demanded that a 
multiparty interim legislature govern until elections are held 
voting is tentatively set for july 
suhjargalmaa an editor at the official montsame news agency 
said in a telephone interview from ulan bator that the largest 
opposition group the mongolian democratic association had planned 
to circle the government palace when the demands were not met by 
noon 
but police and soldiers of the internal militia formed a 
protective circle first and blocked adjoining streets suhjargalmaa 
said the protesters were able to form a picket line on only one 
side of the palace fronting a large central square where 
supporters and onlookers gathered other opposition groups 
including the national progressives and social democrats also 
joined 
there were about 40000 at noon but now there are much 
fewer suhjargalmaa said in the early evening other sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the protest leaders had 
left by midafternoon and only curious passersby remained later 
they said the crowd peaked at about 10000 but that only 1200 to 
1400 seemed actively involved 
students chanted youth unite and waved national flags and 
emblems of the mongolian democratic association said the soviet 
news agency tass mongolian radio said the government broadcast 
appeals over loudspeakers for the crowd to disperse but that 
protesters responded with shouts for the soldiers to leave 
the breakup of the protest appeared to have been gradual and it 
was unclear if any concessions were made to end the protest 
so far mongolias democracy movement inspired by change 
elsewhere in the soviet bloc has been peaceful the communists 
formally called the mongolian peoples revolutionary party gave up 
their constitutional right to rule in march and agreed to the 
countrys first multiparty elections apparently believing they 
could best stay in power by embracing reforms 
but the opposition has accused the party of cheating by amending 
the election law to give more delegates to rural areas where the 
communists are strongest opposition groups want this changed and 
demand the immediate transfer of power to a multiparty interim 
legislature 
the mongolian democratic association set a deadline of noon 
friday for the government to respond 
ochirbat offered instead to set up an advisory council for the 
opposition to work with the existing legislature and to let it 
join in the work of the central election council suhjargalmaa said 
talks between the two sides ended when the opposition members 
walked out 
the opposition is also demanding that the ruling partys central 
committee move its offices from the government palace and that all 
parties be allowed to join a commission that is investigating 
former highranking officials 
the commission was set up by the ruling party in early april to 
uncover alleged abuses of power under former dictator yumjaagiyn 
tsedenbal he was ousted in 1984 but many of his associates remain 
in government and the party

church bells tolled black flags fluttered in 
the breeze and the doors of jesus burial site were shut friday for 
possibly the first time in 800 years as christians protested a 
jewish settlement in jerusalems old city 
in an unusual show of unity about 150 clergymen from nine major 
christian sects gathered to oversee the closing of the church of 
the holy sepulcher which marks the site of jesus crucifixion and 
burial 
latin patriarch michel sabbah greek orthodox patriarch diodoros 
i and armenian orthodox patriarch torkum manoogian recited the 
lords prayer in arabic armenian and greek before the massive 
wooden doors swung shut 
wajih nusseibeh a moslem whose family keeps the key of the 
church of the holy sepulcher said it was the first time the doors 
were closed since the crusaders were driven out of the city by the 
islamic warrior saladin in the 12th century ad 
the church of the nativity which marks the site of jesus birth 
in bethlehem and holy sites throughout the country were also 
closed in the daylong protest church bells rang in somber 
funereal cadence for about fivehree days in another army 
hospital 
i regret that at the moment i am unable to thank you more 
directly and personally polhill said in the prepared statement 
but my voice decided to go on vacation before i did however i 
do want you to know how very much i appreciate the warmth and 
sincerity of your welcome and the support youve given my wife and 
family who join me in hoping that this is the beginning of the end 
to the hostage situation 
i am happily now free to join you in your continued support 
for the loved ones of those who remain in captivity and in 
welcoming the hostages home in the very near future lets show the 
world that we the american people want to leave the past behind 
us look positively to the future and once and for all close the 
file on the hostage issue 
asked whether her husband was angry at his captors mrs polhill 
said his being angry has been blown out of all proportion she 
did not elaborate 
as to her own feelings she said i feel good to have him 
back she said that she and her husband spent their first night 
together in the states resting talking and doing everything 
every normal couple would do 
she also said that although polhill and the other hostages 
received little news in their captivity she believes he knew that 
george bush was president before the chief executive telephoned him 
in damascus 
the army doctor said he expects the biopsy to be performed in 
the near future although he could not be more specific 
he said polhill appears to be in good spirits considering the 
ordeal he has been through 
there is no evidence that he was beaten the doctor said he 
said polhill had indicated to other physicians that he was not 
in addition to the growth on his vocal cords the doctor said 
polhill has some numbness or tingling in his arms and hands as a 
complication of his diabetes he said polhill had told other 
physicians that he was given insulin for his condition while in 
custody 
with a wave and a broad smile polhill stepped off a military 
jet thursday onto the sundrenched tarmac at andrews air force base 
in suburban maryland 
he was whisked away by car to walter reed army medical center 
but not before shaking hands with the small official welcoming 
party and offering several thumbsup salutes to reporters and a 
small group of air force personnel on hand for his arrival 
polhill maintained his public silence on his arrival in private 
talks with us officials he reportedly has given a vivid and 
detailed account of his ordeal 
the return of the 55yearold business professor left behind in 
the middle east 17 western hostages seven of them americans 
although polhills release brought hopes that additional 
american hostages soon would share his freedom the us debriefing 
team that traveled to wiesbaden west germany to meet with polhill 
departed thursday seemingly a sign that no release is considered 
imminent 
for polhill it was back to a military hospital he left one at 
the air force base in wiesbaden where he spent three days after 
his weekend release and went to walter reed for a complete 
physical and other tests and treatment polhill lost 25 pounds in 
captivity and also is a diabetic 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said president bush 
planned to meet soon with polhill but that a date had not been set 
other administration officials also likely will have questions for 
polhill about his captors 
polhill was abducted with two other american educators on jan 
24 1987 from the campus of the usaffiliated beirut university 
college the other two remain among the seven american hostages 
the longestheld of the us hostages is terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent for the associated press

the ruling communist party will soon be relegated 
to a minority role in the soviet union unless it figures out how to 
win over voters moscows party chief warned friday 
if we cant learn to understand and defend the interests of 
the people well have to go into the opposition yuri a 
prokofiev leader of moscows 11 million communists told a news 
conference 
if there are no improvements in peoples lives in the near 
future then in the next elections they may not vote at all for the 
communist party and it could end up in the minority he added 
prokofiev was speaking from experience in moscow elections in 
march many communists were trounced by more reformist candidates 
who blamed the party for the citys many ills 
prokofiev himself was elected to the moscow city council but 
the bloc in the council that supports the communist party platform 
numbers only about 90 compared with some 400 in the more radical 
democratic russia group 
in the soviet unions first multicandidate elections held over 
the past year many communist leaders have been defeated officials 
say they are victims of the partys crisis of confidence 
prokofiev acknowledged that 6000 muscovites quit the party in 
the first quarter of this year but said only a scattered few 
were leaving for ideological reasons he said most were elderly or 
token members who were no longer active communists anyway 
of those who quit on principle he said about half left because 
they think reforms are proceeding too slowly and the other half 
because they oppose reform altogether he said 
prokofiev predicted the communist party would formally split 
soon losing a reformist group known as the democratic platform 
but he said he had high hopes for this julys party congress which 
could help both improve the partys image and heal the rift between 
party officials and rankandfile communists 
meanwhile he said the party is working on legally 
strengthening its claim on buildings newspapers and other 
properties to make sure it wont lose them if it falls from power 
prokofiev said he had learned from the extensive financial 
losses among polish communists whose party did not take such 
measures before elections last year that ended in a solidarityled 
government 
he said moscow party officials were also seeking commercial 
ventures they could undertake to earn money to buy television time 
pay rent and foot other bills that never came up when the party 
and the government were virtually the same 
in other communist party news leningrad party chief boris 
gidaspov was reelected friday the soviet news agency tass 
reported 
gidaspov is considered a leader of the more conservative wing of 
the communist party he has warned that allowing private property 
would result in black marketeers dominating the economy he drew 
criticism last fall for organizing a party protest at which some 
speakers denounced the politburo and kremlin reforms 
gidaspov a former factory director defeated four other 
candidates in a secret vote tass said

france and west germany are expected to 
press european community leaders at a summit saturday for swift 
progress toward european political union by 1993 despite britains 
skepticism 
the british are demanding to know what political union means 
the french and germans say its the spirit rather than 
definitions that matters most at this stage 
for british prime minister margaret thatcher the francogerman 
alliance presents a diplomatic challenge to tone down what she 
sees as rhetoric without worsening her reputation as a reluctant 
european 
france and west germany say they want saturdays summit to agree 
to set up an intergovernmental conference on political union that 
would be in addition to a conference already due late this year on 
economic and monetary union 
we are deeply skeptical about the timing british foreign 
secretary douglas hurd said this week nevertheless if our 
partners wish to set in hand such work we shall join actively in 
the task and contribute our own ideas 
ireland the holder of the communitys rotating presidency 
called the oneday summit to discuss german unification it will 
mean east germany becoming the first former communist territory to 
join the wealthy 12nation trade bloc 
but spurred by fears of resurgent nationalism destabilizing 
europe france and west germany have plunged the community into the 
momentous issue of political union 
in an april 15 announcement they said the community nations 
should each have laws in place by jan 1 1993 for both economic 
integration and political union five days later west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and french president francois mitterrand 
wrote to irish prime minister charles haughey suggesting the 
intergovernmental conference 
no one has defined what political union means possibilities 
range from a centralized government through a united states of 
europe to the more likely reality of increased powers for the 
communitys elected parliament and its executive commission in 
brussels 
we are witnessing a decisive thrust toward european unity 
kohl declared thursday after two days of talks with mitterrand in 
paris 
a dream is coming true seeing german unity and european 
unity come into being together he said 
mitterrand agreed a european community more unified thats 
what we want a structured balanced peaceful europe thats what 
we are working for 
mrs thatcher opposes any form of federal europe or markedly 
greater powers for the european commission arguing that no 
european government is truly willing to cede national sovereignty 
to brussels 
a stickler for detail she plans to ask bluntly what her 
continental partners mean by political union hoping their 
confusion will prove her point that no one knows just what it 
entails 
but as sir leon brittan a senior eec official said thursday 
it doesnt have a meaning it means what you want it to mean 
mrs thatcher also believes the issue of political union is 
premature she wants the community of 320 million people to give 
priority to more immediate issues like establishing a single 
tarifffree market for europe by the end of 1992 and incorporating 
east germanys backward economy 
we think the best european cooperation the best europe we can 
build will be a europe of 12 sovereign states sitting willingly 
and freely together mrs thatcher said recently 
i believe most people want to be proud of their country and 
want to feel that affinity to it as well as to europe 
europe can only live in peace if nationalism is overcome 
said irmgard adamschwaetzer no 2 to west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher 
the irish say they and other member states italy spain 
portugal greece denmark belgium the netherlands and luxembourg 
share a general wish for greater political unity 
on monetary union the 12 nations agree on the first stage of a 
threestage program but britain is resisting the ultimate goal of 
a single central bank and one currency 
the summit will also discuss closer relations with the other 
newly emerging democracies of eastern europe

president bush ignoring congressional 
pressure announced today that he has decided not to place japan on 
a hit list of countries with the worst trade barriers against 
us products 
india is the only country his administration has decided to keep 
on its list of nations targeted for unfair trading practices bush 
said in a statement 
bush hailed what he said was recent progress in easing 
usjapanese trade frictions 
promoting a vibrant open trading relationship with japan 
remains a key trade priority of the administration bush said 
a recent agreement with japan that included japanese concessions 
on opening its markets to more us goods was a promising 
start he said 
at the same time he said he was under no illusion that the 
agreement alone would lead to an immediate improvement in this 
nations 49 billion trade deficit with japan 
but he said he was persuaded that japanese prime minister 
toshiki kaifu and other japanese leaders share my commitment to 
ensuring that trade strengthens rather than undermines the 
friendship between our nations 
a year ago the administration named japan brazil and india as 
the countries with the most offensive barriers to american trade 
both japan and brazil have won praise from the administration 
for making significant concessions during negotiations aimed at 
opening their markets to american products 
but india which was cited last year for a ban on operations of 
foreign private insurance companies and for controls on foreign 
investment that distort trade has refused to make concessions 
us trade representative carla hills said that india was 
targeted again because it has the most trade barriers of any 
noncommunist country and negotiations over the past year had made 
no progress 
several members of congress had warned the administration that 
it would be making a serious mistake to fail to target japan once 
more as a way of keeping pressure on the country to honor its 
marketopening commitments 
but hills rejected these arguments saying that the 
administration needed flexibility in its negotiating efforts with 
other countries 
we believe we have made enormous progress with japan in the 
past few months she told reporters 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
he was glad that the administration had at least issued a new super 
301 list although he was disappointed that japan was not included 
there has been little improvement in our trade deficit with 
that country and i am a bit of a skeptic as to whether the recent 
agreements will make much of a difference bentsen said in a 
statement 
the 1988 trade law required the administration to issue a target 
list of countries with the most offensive trade barriers in 1989 
and 1990 
let there be no mistake bush said this administration is 
committed to free and fair trade we want open markets and fair 
treatment for our products services investment and ideas 
bush said he had also directed mrs hills to give her highest 
priority to seeking a conclusion by december of ongoing 
international trade liberalization talks now under way in geneva 
sources said indias refusal to seek a negotiated settlement of 
last years trade case prompted the administration to cite india 
again 
while the designation of india was likely to meet with approval 
on capitol hill the refusal to cite japan was certain to raise 
heavy protests 
many members of congress said that would indicate the 
administration is not interested in carrying out the requirements 
of the toughest section of the 1988 trade law known as super 301 
the law provides a tight timetable for negotiating away barriers 
and provides for economic sanctions if the talks prove unsuccessful 
they said super 301 was written with japan specifically in mind 
and that japan needed to be targeted again to ensure that it lived 
up to its newfound willingness to lower trade barriers 
in the days before the decision was announced hills lavished 
praise on both japan and brazil for their willingness to negotiate 
in good faith and said that citing japan again could provoke a 
backlash in tokyo where the kaifu government has been pushing to 
change japans trading practices 
in japans case there has been a flurry of trade agreements 
over the past month japanese negotiators agreed to open their 
markets for the sale of usmade satellites supercomputers and 
forest products the three product areas cited in last years 
super 301 case 
in addition japan and the united states earlier this month 
completed an interim agreement designed to attack broadbased 
structural barriers that are preventing american and other foreign 
companies from doing business in japan 
hills praised brazil for undertaking a fantastic change in 
policy under newly elected president fernando collor de mellor 
brazil has agreed to cut protectionist barriers and submit for 
international settlement the licensing restrictions on imports 
cited by the united states in last years complaint

and panama are surviving unscathed in a 34 billion spending bill

the dire emergency money bill contained 420 million to help 
rebuild panamas economy and 300 million to help the new 
democratic administration of violeta chamorro sworn in wednesday 
as president of nicaragua 
mrs chamorros term may expire before we get the aid down 
there minority leader bob dole rkan cracked as he surveyed a 
list late thursday of dozens of amendments that senators sought to 
add to the bill 
along with the aid bush is seeking to shore up the fledgling 
central american democracies the bill has become larded with a 
long list of pet spending projects of lawmakers pushing it to 
nearly four times the original white house request 
senators today adopted an amendment by sen robert c byrd 
dwva calling for a study of how foreign aid can be used to 
promote the fortunes of american businesses overseas it then 
turned its attention to a list of proposed amendments that included 
sanctions on iraq and relief for lithuania 
a provision in the bill permitting the district of columbia to 
use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women survived two 
early test votes 5145 and 5442 but it appeared the senate was 
in for a protracted debate over the perennially divisive issue 
bush has vowed to veto the bill if the abortion language remains in 
it 
the bill grew by an additional 363 million late thursday when 
senators voted 6230 to make up a shortfall in the state 
departments current budget the largest chunk of the money goes to 
pay us dues to the united nations with other amounts for 
construction of buildings overseas and for salaries and expenses 
earlier in the day byrd chairman of the appropriations 
committee tried unsuccessfully to slash the panama aid to 300 
million and use the savings for a variety of domestic programs 
byrd sought to harness the general unpopularity of foreign aid 
in congress and cast his amendment as an effort to make charity 
begin at home 
but sen mark o hatfield rore said the united states has an 
obligation to panama stemming from the us economic embargo and 
the damage inflicted by last decembers military invasion which 
ousted dictator manuel antonio noriega 
we owe them hatfield said this is a bill thats due 
senators then voted 5148 to kill byrds attempt with eight 
democrats joining a nearly solid bloc of republicans to provide the 
majority in support of bushs request 
the senate labored until late evening as it tried to deal with 
dozens of proposed amendments but prospects appeared remote for 
quick approval of the overall aid bill 
when finally passed the measure still must go to a conference 
with the house to work out differences with that chambers 24 
billion version most of the new spending in both versions of the 
bill is covered by cuts in the pentagon budget 
and as it stood the senate bill faced a veto threat from bush 
who opposes a provision that would allow the district of columbia 
government to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women 
dealing with related legislation on thursday the house foreign 
affairs committee defied bush and voted to cut in half and sharply 
restrict the 85 million in annual us military aid to el salvador 
the action came as an amendment to a bill authorizing spending 
of the panama and nicaragua aid funds despite administration 
objections that it could undermine fledgling peace talks between 
the government of el salvador and the leftist rebels who have 
fought a decadelong civil war 
it remained unclear whether the restrictions on aid would ever 
be finally enacted into law house democratic leaders plan to meet 
next week with secretary of state james a baker iii in an effort 
to begin drafting a new bipartisan us policy toward el salvador 
that could head off the restrictions

promoscow truckers protesting lithuanias 
campaign for independence blocked rushhour traffic in the baltic 
republics capital this morning while local authorities debated 
how to ease tension with the kremlin 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis weighed a proposal 
from the leaders of france and germany designed to end the impasse 
that began with lithuanias declaration of independence on march 11 
the demonstration included about 50 trucks and was organized by 
communist party members and russian workers said rita radzevicius 
a spokeswoman at the lithuanian supreme council or parliament in 
the capital city vilnius 
the soviet news agency tass said the truckers opposed the 
adventurist decisions of the lithuanian parliament it said 
supporters of the lithuanian popular front sajudis dragged the 
trucks from the streets with tractors 
ms radzevicius said in a telephone interview that local 
authorities persuaded the truckers to end the blockade after about 
two hours but she said force was not used 
because of gas shortages caused by the kremlin blockade 
rushhour traffic in vilnius was much lighter than usual many 
people walked to work or used the citys extensive trolley system 
the truckers worked for the autotransport enterprise in vilnius 
and consisted mostly of russians who are members of yedinstvo and 
the splinter of the lithuanian communist party that follows the 
kremlin line some lithuanians also took part she said 
the main lithuanian communist party split with moscow in 
december yedinstvo consists of russians poles and other 
minorities who believe that the lithuanian majority is infringing 
on their rights 
lithuanian authorities meanwhile grappled with a partial 
economic blockade imposed by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
after the independence declaration and groped for a diplomatic 
solution to the standoff 
many shop shelves were empty and the embargo slowed work at 46 
businesses and stopped it at two others in lithuania the moscow 
newspaper rabochaya tribuna reported the kremlin has cut off all 
oil and and 80 percent of lithuanias natural gas supply causing 
thousands of workers to be laid off 
lithuania will begin food rationing on tuesday vilnius radio 
reported as the republic of 38 million struggles under the 
economic embargo 
a leading politician in the neighboring baltic republic of 
estonia today pledged to help lithuania survive the soviet 
blockade even at the risk of relatiation by moscow 
we have to help lithuania in every case said marju 
lauristin a leader of the estonian peoples front in what she 
said was the majority opinion of the estonian supreme soviet she 
spoke during a visit to helsinki finland 
and in brussels today lithuanian parliamentarians asked belgium 
to help offset moscows economic blockade the delegation arrived 
with the precise mission of launching an sos for our people 
said emanuelis zingeris chairman of the lithuanian parliaments 
foreign affairs panel 
gorbachev touring an industrial center in the urals was 
confronted thursday by activists protesting his crackdown in 
lithuania with demonstrators branding him a political 
hypocrite 
on the diplomatic front french president francois mitterrand 
and german chancellor helmut kohl delivered a proposal to 
lithuanian representatives in moscow suggesting that the baltic 
republic temporarily suspend its secessionist actions so that the 
current crisis ends in a solution acceptable to all parties 
landsbergis in an apparent bid to find something positive in 
the letter from mitterrand and kohl described it as a step 
forward toward the realization of lithuanian independence 
lithuania wants an immediate dialogue landsbergis said and a 
termination of the soviet economic blockade against lithuania would 
be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue 
the leadership of lithuania greatly appreciating this act of 
good will on the part of two noted leaders will carefully study 
this letters proposition he added 
the letter came two days after president bush refused to impose 
sanctions on moscow at this time for bringing economic and military 
pressure on lithuania a move that clearly angered landsbergis 
when asked if landsbergis was disappointed by the letter from 
mitterrand and kohl lithuanian parliamentary spokesman ed tuskenis 
said the president viewed as positive the fact that it did not 
mention revoking the republics march 11 declaration of 
independence the letter discussed the temporary suspension of some 
decisions by the lithuanian parliament the supreme council 
kremlin authorities on monday urged lithuania to suspend for two 
years its declaration of independence 
lithuanian leaders have refused to revoke the declaration but 
the baltic republics leadership has always been willing to 
discuss the timing and the form of independence whether or not 
thats a year or two tuskenis said after talking to landsbergis 
they said they never expected independence to come within a 
matter of days and they dont expect full independence in a 
practical sense right away he said by telephone from vilnius 
also today lithuanian authorities disclosed that a lithuanian 
man who died thursday after setting himself on fire outside the 
bolshoi theater in moscow left suicide notes calling on gorbachev 
to let lithuania become independent 
since independence was declared in lithuania which was forcibly 
annexed by the soviet union in 1940 gorbachev has imposed the 
economic embargo and used the military to occupy some buildings in 
vilnius and round up army deserters

defense secretary dick cheney acknowledging 
his warplane cutbacks could be just the beginning of major pentagon 
changes predicted friday that americas military is destined to be 
significantly smaller than it is today 
cheney met with reporters one day after he informed congress of 
plans to nearly halve purchases of the b2 stealth bomber and the 
c17 transport jet and delay production of the pentagons next 
generation of fighters 
it was cheneys most significant step to date in his effort to 
realign the nations military expenditures in response to the 
nations budget woes and the lessened soviet threat 
but during his testimony cheney also indicated hes looking at 
paring the navys fleet of aircraft carriers from 14 to 12 and that 
he was considering further cuts in air force tactical fighter wings 
these statements come on the heels of disclosures by top army 
officials that they may be forced to trim hundreds of thousands of 
soldiers from the force in the coming years 
asked about such developments cheney noted that the service 
chiefs are scheduled to give him their longterm spending plans 
next week and that this will set off a debate on what we think 
that force ought to look like 
theres clearly going to be a smaller navy clearly going to 
be a smaller marine corps smaller army smaller air force 
cheney said adding obviously we are looking at a force that is 
significantly smaller than it is today 
but he added that there are several assumptions that must be 
taken into account in any plan to draw down the forces such as the 
successful completion of the talks in europe to reduce conventional 
forces and the strategic arms limitation talks with the soviets 
cheneys aircraft review called for reducing the proposed number 
of b2 bombers from 132 to 75 and reducing the proposed purchase of 
the c17 longrange transport plane from 210 to 120 
the defense secretary also called for cutting back on the navys 
a12 attack aircraft and delaying purchases of the air forces 
advanced tactical aircraft and advanced tactical fighter 
he predicted the changes would trim 24 billion from president 
bushs 307 billion defense budget for 1991 and would save 348 
billion through 1997 
meanwhile on capitol hill an air force official told a senate 
armed services subcommittee friday that a reduction in the 36 
tactical fighter wings by 1996 is likely 
i dont think i can say today whether well get below 30 but 
were going to get smaller maj gen richard e hawley director 
of operations told the subcommittee on conventional forces and 
alliance defense 
pressed by sen carl levin dmich chairman of the 
subcommittee about whether 30 wings is a fair assumption hawley 
said i would not be surprised to see numbers in that range 
the air force official also indicated that cheneys decision to 
delay procurement of the advanced tactical fighter poses a risk but 
it was determined that the risk was acceptable 
there is additional risk imposed by slipping the atf hawley 
said i guess the question is is it an acceptable risk and i 
think the judgment is that it is an acceptable level of risk given 
the changing nature of the threat we face 
although cheney told reporters he was pleased with the response 
hed received during his testimony he had a blunt message for 
those lawmakers who say hes not cutting enough put up or shut up 
its easy to pontificate about what the overall top line ought 
to be but as soon as we get down to the real nittygritty of how 
were going cut the defense budget theres a noticeable lack of 
any significant substantive plans on capitol hill the secretary 
complained

a judges decision to hold a state official in 
contempt for failing to request adequate money for mental health 
programs was unusual but probably justified a former law school 
dean said 
paul bender retired dean of the arizona state university 
college of law also said the ruling could spark lawsuits seeking 
additional money for other state programs 
lawmakers said the ruling likely will result in more money but 
probably much less than the 452 million maricopa county superior 
court judge bernard dougherty ordered department of health services 
director ted williams to request 
dougherty ruled wednesday that williams was in contempt for 
failing to ask for enough money to implement a 1985 court order 
requiring the state to provide a full range of services for people 
with chronic mental illness 
the judge likely will sign the order next week and williams has 
15 days after that to comply the judge offered no specific 
sanctions that he might apply 
williams lawyers said no decision has been made about whether 
to appeal 
i dont remember seeing another case like it bender said 
the idea of a judge getting involved in the states budgetary 
process is highly unusual that doesnt mean that i think its 
illegitimate because i dont think its illegitimate 
doughertys ruling stemmed from a petition filed by the center 
for law in the public interest which originally sought contempt 
sanctions against williams and gov rose mofford 
the state supreme court dismissed mrs mofford as a defendant on 
grounds that she was not a party to the original lawsuit and that 
the courts had no authority to tell her what to put in her budget 
request to the legislature 
charles arnold a phoenix lawyer who served on a governors task 
force on chronic mental illness said he believed doughertys 
ruling will provide the impetus for legislative action to pay 
for the programs 
of course some legislators will get their feathers up and say 
no court is going to tell us what to do said arnold a 
plaintiff in the classaction lawsuit that resulted in the ruling 
all we can do is hope the good guys prevail 
indeed house appropriations committee chairman john wettaw 
said the judge is in nevernever land 
and senate majority leader john mawhinney said the 
legislature does not respond very well to judicial threats 
still bender said he expects williams to request the 452 
million from the governor and for mrs mofford to include the 
entire amount in an amended budget request to the legislature 
that will put the onus on the legislature and thats a whole 
different story bender said what the legislature could do is 
simply repeal the laws that spell out what services these people 
are entitled to there is nothing to say the legislature couldnt 
do that 
house majority whip chris herstam said he doesnt expect that 
but im also not inclined to appropriate the amount of money they 
want because we dont have it 
the legislature already is holding a special session to deal 
with a budget deficit estimated at up to 350 million 
arnold said he expected the legislature to provide 16 million 
to 25 for the chronically mentally ill next year 
that would be enough to satisfy the court for now and get the 
department off the hook he said

west germany on friday said it would 
trim its military spending to help pay for unification but said 
east germany also will have to cut costs for the merger to succeed 
rudolf seiters chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff also 
said east germany should not make unreasonable demands in 
negotiations on merging the countries economies 
west germany and east germany hope to achieve economic unity by 
july 2 this would be a giant step toward ending the two countries 
41year division 
seiters predicted basic agreement based on proposals by bonn 
as early as next week 
however lothar de maiziere east germanys prime minister said 
his people would face enormous burdens if all subsidies are 
immediately eliminated 
we assume that rent energy and public services will continue 
to be subsidized he told the berliner zeitung newspaper of east 
berlin before talks with a west german delegation began in the city 
no details of the six hours of talks were released they are to 
continue monday in bonn 
guenther krause head of the east german delegation said 
agreement was reached on many questions but he added there 
are still open questions 
seiters told west german lawmakers east germany will have to 
hold down public spending for economic union with west germany to 
work 
i stress once again west germany is prepared to financially 
support east germany but as in west germany east germany must 
carefully weigh what is financially feasible and what is not 
seiters told parliament 
seiters called for cost cutting by state and local governments 
and said unification will be financed without any tax increases 
with the help of strong west german economic growth and added 
borrowing 
he said unity costs will also be paid through federal spending 
cuts in defense and other areas 
seiters said reorienting the armed forces for example 
will yield savings that can be used toward unification 
he did not elaborate west germany is considering reducing its 
armed forces from 490000 to 400000 
regarding monetary union bonn proposes exchanging one west 
german mark for one east german mark for wages pensions and 
savings up to 2300 east german savings over that amount would be 
exchanged at a 21 rate 
seiters said all west germans must be ready to make 
contributions toward assisting in the overhaul of east germanys 
battered economy and smoothing the way for unification 
he said basically this undertaking cannot be compared to any 
other 
we are not underestimating that many difficult problems need 
to be solved with the transition of this washedup socialist 
economy to a social market economy we are treading in many ways on 
unknown turf said seiters 
such a task requires from us all our courage energy 
imagination and politically creative will said seiters 
during the same parliamentary session opposition politicians 
accused kohl of excluding them from participating in the unity 
process 
unification is not a private matter for the federal 
chancellor it is a matter for the whole people said herta 
daeublergmelin a top official with the opposition social 
democrats

the circus elephants and clowns cleared out of 
madison square garden for a night so that nearly 20000 people 
could gather there to finish a good book they began reading in 1982 
the book was the talmud the repository of ageold jewish 
wisdom and its readers were orthodox jews every day for the past 
7 years each had read a page of the 2711page tome and thursday 
night they converged on the garden for a readin to study the last 
page 
these are not dead letters of a printed book they are 
alive rabbi simon schwab of congregation khai adath jeshurun 
of manhattan told the assemblage 
the daily reading known as the daf yomi or daily page was 
synchronized in 1923 so that jews all over the world read the same 
page on the same day thursday marked the end of the ninth reading 
of the talmud since that date on friday the cycle began anew 
anyone who studies jewish law every day is guaranteed a place 
in the world to come the text concludes 
the talmud is believed to have been given to moses by god at 
mount sinai and handed down orally for centuries before it was 
transcribed commentaries from scholars up to the 17th century are 
included 
it is divided into tracts on agriculture blessings civil law 
matters pertaining to women including marriage and divorce 
holiness and synagogue services and purity including foods that 
are kosher 
many of the readers are laymen not scholars they meet in 
informal study groups or read pocket editions on subway trains 
there also are cassette tapes about 15000 students around the 
world pay 8 a month for dialadaf a recorded telephone message 
discussing the days page in english yiddish or hebrew 
there were gatherings around the world thursday to mark the end 
of the cycle but the garden event was the largest the organizers 
agudath israel of america reserved the garden two years ago for 
the occasion thus the ringling bros and barnum amp bailey circus 
in town for a monthlong stay was forced to close for the night 
many of those attending the ceremony were blacksuited hasidic 
jews with long beards and unshorn sideburns that grew several 
inches long 
although orthodox tradition does not encourage women to study 
the talmud several hundred sat in the balcony separated from the 
men as they are at sabbath services it was the first time women 
were invited to the daf yomi celebration one rabbi said they were 
welcomed as a gesture of thanks for the sacrifices they made so 
their husbands could study 
its not easy said jacob i friedman a lawyer who attends 
a 6 am study group the alarm rings and i must get up or i 
miss my daily dose of inspiration 
there were roughly four times as many participants thursday 
night as there were in 1982 when the last cycle ended 
next time well fill yankee stadium one rabbi said

prime minister yitzhak shamir left the door 
open friday to another coalition with the rival labor party but 
said he would prefer a narrowbased government controlled by his 
hardline likud bloc 
shamir who was given the task of forming israels next 
government by president chaim herzog on friday immediately ran 
into trouble 
yigal bibi a legislator of the national religious party said 
he would only back likud if the centerleft labor joined the 
coalition the surprise statement brought the two major parties 
back to a 6060 deadlock in the 120seat knesset or parliament 
shamir 74 head of the interim government said he hoped to 
obtain a majority within the next three weeks as required by the 
presidential mandate speaking to reporters shamir said the 
prospects for a new likudlabor coalition at the moment look 
unrealistic 
i would never rule out the possibility of a coalition with 
labor he noted but my efforts in this period wont be aimed at 
a national unity government 
likud and labor ruled in an uneasy partnership as a result of 
stalemated elections in 1984 and 1988 the government was brought 
down march 15 by a laborengineered parliament vote of 
noconfidence 
the crisis was prompted by shamirs refusal to accept as labor 
demanded a us formula for arranging israelipalestinian talks 
herzog turned to shamir after shimon peres the labor leader 
announced thursday he had failed to assemble a coalition after 35 
days of efforts 
herzog urged shamir to act quickly 
these days the country is in a state of political and public 
confusion such as it has never known since its founding the 
president said there is a heavy and true sense of depression in 
the public 
the premier hopes to lure three rightwing factions and three 
ultraorthodox parties into a majority coalition in the knesset in 
such a coalition important cabinet posts are likely to be given to 
likud members who control 35 seats 
likud officials have predicted they would get a majority of 65 
seats apparently by attracting four ultraorthodox legislators 
from the laboraligned agudat israel party 
labor has vowed to block shamir warning that his prospective 
government would be extremist and derail middle east peace efforts 
it can ruin things in a big way for this country yitzhak 
rabin a former labor premier said on israel radio 
rabin a rival of peres said labor was ready to form a joint 
government with likud in order to handle the peace issue and 
security problems and absorb new immigrants from the soviet 
union the number of soviet jews immigrating to israel is expected 
to total 100000 this year 
peres has said a laborlikud government would not be practical 
and insisted that labor should condition support for any government 
on the acceptance of us peace plans 
rabin a labor hawk who served as defense minister in the last 
coalition and took a tough line on the palestinian uprising 
declined to say whether peres should step down but he said 
various changes will be required in the labor party

police do what they can to enforce noise 
limits in the french quarter but brass bands quiet down when 
officers set up meters to measure their loudness a city attorney 
told a judge friday 
theres no way we can take the test without the people being 
tested aware of it assistant city attorney ron sholes told state 
district judge richard ganucheau 
artists and business people who work in the court have filed 
suit against police chief warren woodfork and seek an order from 
ganucheau instructing police to enforce city noise ordinances in 
jackson square the square is in the heart of the french quarter 
and one of this dixieland jazz capitals prime tourist spots 
sidewalk musicians have entertained crowds there for years but 
artists who sell caricatures instant portraits and bayou scenes in 
the quarter say that now too many people play too loudly and too 
often 
they contend that the noise is causing them irreparable damage 
including headaches stress loss of sleep and irritability 
ganucheau did not indicate when he will rule but did have some 
sharp questions for plaintiff attorney luke fontana who lives and 
owns a store in the quarter 
at what point does it become my provenance to tell the 
superintendent of police to send his men to control noise in the 
french quarter and ignore cocaine traffic in the desire project 
i would observe that those people whose children are getting 
killed in the desire project might consider that irreparable harm 
he then added this does not indicate my frame of mind 
thoren rand a french quarter caricature artist representing the 
association of businessmen and artists of jackson square said 
later that the groups that filed the suit arent asking for extra 
officers or time 
police already assigned to patrol the area could set up decibel 
meters in a store or apartment where the owners had complained of 
the noise and do it so that musicians couldnt see them he said 
he said police wouldnt even need meters to enforce a law 
forbidding noise that can be heard more than 50 feet away 
deputy city attorney bill aaron said that if the artists have a 
gripe against the musicians they should sue the musicians 
we dont know who they are or where they live objected

the bush administration said friday that 
action by both lithuanian and soviet leaders is needed for talks to 
begin on the future of the rebellious republic 
we have said all along that dialogue is the only way to solve 
this problem richard boucher the state department spokesman 
said both sides need to find a way to get to that dialogue 
on thursday france and west germany jointly urged lithuania to 
suspend its parliaments moves toward independence as a way of 
opening talks with moscow 
asked if the united states supported the proposal by france and 
west germany the state department spokesman avoided a direct 
response 
he said the letter by president francois mitterrand of france 
and chancellor helmut kohl of west germany represents their 
effort to diffuse the situation 
further boucher said 
we didnt sign the letter its their idea on how to get a 
dialogue and we support anything that could lead to that end 
at the same time though the state department spokesman called 
for action on both sides 
both sides need to find a way to get to that dialogue he 
said 
on another subject the state department official said the 
administration would extend trading privileges to moscow only if 
the soviets complete legislation guaranteeing the right to travel 
and implement such a law 
the issue was raised after us and soviet negotiators reached

despite their obsession with security 
the shiite moslem militants holding western hostages in lebanon 
sometimes bring in doctors from iranianfunded hospitals to care 
for ailing captives informed sources say 
american robert polhill freed sunday suffered from diabetes 
but apart from loss of weight a growth on his vocal cords and 
malnourishment during his 39 months in captivity he clearly was 
given medication 
the hostages have common health problems such as diabetes 
high blood pressure or high levels of uric acid said a shiite 
physician who spoke on condition of anonymity 
medicines for such health problems are not a problem they can 
be obtained anywhere in lebanon he told the associated press 
west german businessman rudolf cordes freed by another shiite 
faction sept 12 1988 after 605 days in captivity said he often 
considered committing suicide when in captivity his jailers gave 
him five tranquilizers a day and brought in a doctor to examine him 
in january last year one group was reported to be seeking a 
cardiologist to examine an unidentified hostage who was believed to 
be suffering from a severe heart condition 
it underlined that the hostageholders make some effort to aid 
ailing captives possibly because at least one and maybe two 
captives have died from neglect 
frenchman michel seurat a researcher died of a severe illness 
believed to be hepatitis in december 1985 released hostages 
reported 
his captors islamic jihad claimed on march 5 1986 that they 
had killed him in retaliation for france extraditing two 
proiranian iraqi dissidents to baghdad 
briton alec collett a newyork based writer who suffered from 
diabetes is believed to have died in captivity through illness 
medical personnel from the khomeini hospital in baalbek in 
eastern lebanon and clinics run by the fundamentalist 
iranianbacked hezbollah in beiruts southern slums are summoned to 
help ailing hostages other shiite sources said 
baalbek and beiruts southern shantytowns are shiite strongholds 
and most of the 17 westerners missing in lebanon are believed to be 
held in the slums 
various groups hold seven americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss an irishman and an italian the longestheld 
hostage is american terry anderson 42 chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
while medicine might help treat the hostages physical ailments 
there is nothing that can be done to alleviate the immense 
psychological trauma of being chained day and night usually 
blindfolded beaten and submitted to mock executions not to 
mention poor food and unsanitary conditions 
you have to learn to master your sadness your desperation to 
channel your misery former french hostage jeanpaul kauffmann 
said after he was freed may 4 1988 
the worst thing for a hostage is not the physical suffering 
but the feeling of having been forgotten

japan airlines is offering a new alternative to 
inflight food no flight 
its new restaurant in osaka has a fullsize replica of a jal 
boeing 767 a cabin crew videotapes of travel information and 
seats in executive or first class sections 
for some people airline food is an oxymoron said airline 
spokesman geoffrey tudor but we thought there was a group of 
people who didnt think so were aiming the restaurant at people 
who maybe dont travel very much but want to try out the 
experience 
grounded diners have quickly been reserving seats at the 
restaurant since it opened this month at the international garden 
and greenery exposition in osaka officials say 
before the meal customers settle into a row of airplane seats 
in a lounge to watch a fiveminute videotape of jal inflight 
service and travel information a real jal cabin crew is on duty 
to add a touch of authenticity tudor said 
in concessions to comfort tables take the place of the plastic 
folddown stands and diners dont need a seat belt 
dominating the main 106seat dining room is the boeing 767 
replica which houses a secondfloor vip cabin featuring 
firstclass meals ticketed at 75 
tudor said the new restaurant was the latest attempt by the 
formerly governmentowned airline to brighten its image since going 
private in 1987 
this sort of promotion would have been unthinkable four years 
ago he said we took surveys and found that a lot of younger 
people thought jal was a pretty stuffy company

a 12yearold computer hacker is accused of 
gaining access to the computers of trw inc a national company 
that checks customers credit ratings and distributing charge card 
numbers to computer bulletin boards 
state police said today that authorities were preparing to 
submit a petition to wayne county probate court to charge the youth 
of computer fraud and financial transaction fraud 
the boys computer and files were seized thursday from his 
grosse ile home said lt tom meekins of the michigan state police 
criminal investigation division 
it wont be hard to prove meekins said the records we 
have indicate he was deeply involved 
authorities talked to the boy in his home but not take him into 
custody or charge him meekins said federal authorities had 
originally said that the boy was arrested and charged but that is 
incorrect meekins said 
authorities were uncertain how many files were tapped who used 
the credit card numbers and what was purchased with them said 
michigan state police lt chris hogan but officials said trw 
officials noticed the improper entry to their system and contacted 
authorities 
trws still trying to figure that one out he said 
trw consumer relations supervisor jean stevens was not in her 
farmington hills office this morning to comment her secretary said 
the michigan computer crime task force of state and federal 
authorities said the boy broke through trw security at a 
detroitarea branch 
hacking is a common problem and is proliferating as the 
computer industry improves and home computers are more available 
said us secret service special agent john britt in detroit but 
tapping into trw is a new twist and pretty sophisticated 
the boys mother said the family owned the computer for several 
years and friends of her son recently taught him how to use it he 
worked on it for up to five hours every weeknight and up to 14 
hours on weekends she said 
he didnt bother me she said he sat there on his 
computer well i figured computers thats the thing of the day

a federal judge friday struck down 
oaklands 1988 nuclearfree ordinance one of the nations 
strongest measures banning local involvement in nuclear 
weaponsrelated activities 
us district judge john vukasin agreed with arguments by the 
bush administration that the measure interfered with the federal 
governments constitutional authority over national defense and 
atomic energy 
the ordinance approved by city voters in november 1988 forbids 
most city contracting and investments with nuclear weapons 
manufacturers restricts transportation of nuclear material through 
the city and is intended to outlaw nuclear weapons work in the city 
it is the only such ordinance among more than 160 in the nation 
to be challenged in court by the federal government 
city attorney jayne williams said an appeal would be considered 
city councilman wilson riles jr a supporter of the ordinance 
said he was confident much of the measure would be revived by the 
9th us circuit court of appeals 
the ruling does not prohibit the city from limiting its 
investments in government securities or posting 
nuclearfreezone signs at its borders those provisions were 
not challenged by the federal government

president mikhail s gorbachev was besieged with 
complaints friday about foul water and air in a city so polluted 
that children have drawn pictures of smog and written i dont 
want to die 
after two days of addressing residents worries about the 
sagging economy in the ural mountains city of sverdlovsk gorbachev 
traveled to nearby nizhny tagil and confronted a new issue 
pollution 
metal is metal but people mikhail sergeyevich are not 
iron a metalworker told the president as they met on the shop 
floor of the nizhny tagil metallurgical complex the comment was 
reported by the tass news agency 
the city of 403000 people is among 36 in a government black 
book listing the most polluted areas of the russian federation 
pravda reported in september other news reports have said smog 
from the 45yearold cokeburning furnaces at the steel complex 
burns childrens skin as they walk to school and causes serious 
lung and heart problems 
factories in the area 900 miles east of moscow spew out more 
than 600000 tons of pollutants annually about 15 tons per 
resident 
local children last year sent the complexs managers drawings of 
smokestacks smog enveloping living areas and the handwritten 
words i dont want to die the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
reported 
huge demonstrations have been reported in nizhny tagil and other 
soviet cities as residents demand a cleanup of air and water 
they say the pollution was caused by a government policy that 
emphasized production at all costs even at the expense of peoples 
health 
the kremlin chief saw the pollution and its sources firsthand 
friday taking a walking tour of the sprawling metallurgical 
complex stopping occasionally to field what a soviet television 
correspondent said were thousands of workers questions 
soviet tvs nightly newscast vremya showed gorbachev 
wearing a white hard hat with a visor to protect his eyes from the 
intense light walking past coke furnaces that spewed orange 
flames a camera showed three tall chimneys at the plant spitting 
out gray smoke 
told by a crowd of shouting residents that the pollution was 
less than usual because factories had reduced emissions before 
gorbachevs visit the president said they say they turned off 
something people are living here surely we could have withstood 
one day 
a woman interrupted excitedly weve been breathing fresh air 
for a week 
i know about the situation with your water and air 
gorbachev responded he said the solution lies in a government plan 
for modernizing local factories equipment 
tass said a 35yearold lathe operator told gorbachev at a 
nizhny tagil factory that makes railroad cars even a healthy 
person like me often has difficulty breathing and how is it for my 
two children all the children of nizhny tagil 
gorbachev said he noticed the pollution as he flew into the city 
friday morning 
as i looked out of the airplane the president said i 
immediately understood how neglected the ecology is 
another resident told gorbachev there isnt one clean reservoir 
in the region and trees are barbarically cut down tass 
reported 
the president also heard complaints from the metalworkers about 
a shortage of kindergartens fruits and vegetables and modern 
machinery 
gorbachev counseled residents to be patient because the 
government faces similar demands from citizens nationwide 
his wife raisa was shown on tv giving a similar pitch to a 
crowd of women that surrounded her during a visit to a museum in 
nizhny tagil 
gorbachev wound up his visit to the sverdlovsk region and 
returned to moscow on friday in televised remarks he said he had 
heard many justified demands but was convinced the people 
believe the solutions lie in his reforms

president bush said friday that completing the 
nations problemplagued 1990 census is becoming a mammoth 
undertaking and he urged americans who havent returned their 
forms to get moving 
thirty seven percent of the 95 million census questionnaires 
sent in march havent been returned 
i simply want to urge every american who has not returned 
the census form to do so to stand up and be counted bush said 
in remarks to a group of state legislators at the white house 
we really need to get moving on this 
in his first comments on the difficulties vexing the us census 
bureau bush said census takers had begun to visit all address 
from which census forms have not been received a mammoth 
undertaking in light of the poor mail response 
rep thomas c sawyer dohio chairman of a house subcommittee 
that oversees the census bureau estimates that fielding the 
expanded army of census takers needed to cope with the low return 
rate could add 180 million to the 13 billion earmarked this year 
for conducting the census 
bush told the american legislative exchange council that helping 
persuade americans to do a better job of returning their census 
forms was a project that needs your involvement 
census data will help you make important decisions for the 
states and it really fits into this theme of decentralization 
part of the decentralization of government of putting our trust 
where it belongs with the people bush said 
the census will help determine distribution of hundreds of 
billions of dollars in federal and state aid among states and local 
communities for the next 10 years 
it will also be the basis on which congressional and state 
legislative district lines will be redrawn preliminary data 
suggests that as many as 14 of the 435 house of representative 
seats may shift into different states as a result of the 1990 count 
some democratic critics have assailed bush for not doing enough 
to guarantee an accurate census even though he frequently talks to 
republican audiences about the importance of congressional 
redistricting in soldifying gop gains 
some analysts have suggested that a census undercount could work 
to the benefit of republicans 
the theory is that middleclass households where response to 
the census forms has been generally high contain a proportionately 
larger number of republicans and that there is a higher percentage 
of democrats among those not yet counted 
democratic national committee chairman ron brown urged bush last 
week to publicly support a complete census count 
bush has taped two publicservice television announcements on 
the importance of filling out census forms he also invited cameras 
and reporters into the oval office to watch him and his wife 
barbara fill out their own census forms last month 
contributing to the poor return rate was the fact that millions 
of americans never got the forms 
the census bureau on thursday began its doortodoor survey of 
households that had not returned forms that portion of the head 
count is expected to take up to two months 
people who did not receive a form may get one by calling the 
census bureau at 18009991990

a soviet parliamentary delegation decrying 
the secrecy their government imposed after the chernobyl nuclear 
accident four years ago made an urgent appeal to the united states 
and the world friday for help in dealing with towering medical and 
human problems 
severe shortages exist in medical equipment radiological and 
other scientific laboratories radiation detectors housing for 
scores of thousands of relocated people and even baby food the 
fiveman delegation said at a news conference at the soviet embassy 
the history of mankind never knew an ecological catastrophe 
which is so disastrous and having unknown consequences for the 
nature health and life of the present and future generations 
the delegation said relaying an appeal made originally by 
officials of the ukraine and endorsed this week by the supreme 
soviet 
yuri n shcherbak chairman of the ecology subcommittee of the 
supreme soviet and a physician said it had taken a political 
struggle to open secret medical records and uncover the true extent 
of the damage caused by the radiation that poured from the 
chernobyl reactor 80 miles north of the ukrainian capital of kiev 
the accident on april 26 1986 began with a fire in one of 
four reactors followed by a core meltdown and an explosion which 
sent huge quantities of radiation billowing into the atmosphere 
dr shcherbak said thyroid disorders are beginning to appear 
along with the first cases of leukemia and cancer including 
thyroid cancer in infants 
he said serious medical effects are now expected to last 
decades perhaps centuries 
chernobyl is the gravest warning to all humankind the warning 
that the development of super technology systems may lead to great 
damage and perhaps a threat to all living things on earth he 
said 
kakimbek s salykov chairman of the delegation said that 
deaths attributed to chernobyl have reached at least 300 compared 
to the official report of 31 and that some 150000 people show 
some effects of radiation poisoning 
but he said the true extent of medical damage may never be known 
because a shroud of secrecy was placed on data after the accident 
and no statistics were compiled on the effects of radiation on the 
600000 people who took part in the initial cleanup 
he said that after the accident the death rate among the 600 
workers at the chernobyl plant increased tenfold including 
several deaths from cancer 
dr shcherbak said that 15 million people got a great dose of 
radiation and that the leukemia rate in the kiev area is 26 
times to 38 times greater than before the accident 
thirteen thousand persons must be relocated as soon as 
possible he said 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin said that when the effects on 
other soviet republics are taken into account some 4 million 
people may have been exposed to excessive levels of radiation 
the delegation released these other statistics 
125 million acres of farmland and 15 million acres of forests 
in the ukraine alone were affected by contamination 
the contaminated area of the ukraine contained more than 1600 
towns and villages with more than 15 million inhabitants 
more than 90000 people have been resettled from the 
contaminated zones to 101 new villages in unaffected areas and 
thousands more will be soon 
the obsolete chernobyl reactors will be shut down 
permanently this year or next

israel on friday agreed to sell back to 
norway a shipment of heavy water it bought 31 years ago rather than 
allow an inspection to prove the coolant was not used to make 
nuclear weapons 
we have negotiated an agreement that satisfies both sides 
said norwegian foreign ministry spokeswoman sigrid romundset the 
pact removes a longstanding irritant in relations between the two 
countries 
the accord signed in oslo by israeli ambassador yehiel yativ 
obliges norway to pay about 18 million to buy back the remaining 
105 tons of heavy water 
israel purchased 20 tons of the nuclear reactor coolant in 1959 
and one ton in 1970 for use at a research reactor in its southern 
desert city of dimona inspection rights were written into the 
sales contract 
experts concluded that there is about 105 tons left after 
evaporation and normal use said romundset 
the agreement reached friday gives israel one year to drain the 
heavy water from its facilities and return it to norway 
heavy water or deuterium oxide can be used to convert uranium 
into the plutonium used in atomic weapons 
a former dimona technician mordechai vanunu in 1986 charged 
that israel had produced up to 100 nuclear warheads his allegation 
prompted norway to demand an inspection of dimonas heavy water 
israel refused to open dimona it had not allowed a norwegian 
inspection since 1961 according to norwegian press reports 
oslo banned exports of heavy water in march 1989 after learning 
that at least three shipments ended up in countries on a norwegian 
blacklist fifteen tons were traced to india which norway refuses 
to supply because the country has nuclear weapons but has not 
signed a nonproliferation treaty 
norways sole heavy water supplier the norsk hydro as 
industrial concern stopped production a year ago

a man who burned himself to death was sending a 
message to president mikhail s gorbachev that lithuanians will 
not live in a lithuania that is not independent according to 
suicide notes released friday 
in the lithuanian capital of vilnius russian truckers lay down 
in front of their rigs and blocked rushhour traffic to protest the 
baltic republics declaration of independence on march 11 
the suicide victim stanislovas jamaitis 52 died thursday of 
burns suffered when he doused his clothes with gasoline and set 
himself ablaze in front of the bolshoi theater in central moscow 
jamaitis a lithuanian left suicide notes to his wife stasala 
and to lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis the lithuanian 
supreme council or parliament released the texts friday 
spokeswoman rita radzevicius translated them from lithuanian to 
russian and read them over the telephone 
the official soviet news agency tass also reported the existence 
of the note but did not mention any political motive tass said the 
letter spoke of an impossible family life and a desire to commit 
suicide 
the version released by lithuanian authorities apologized for 
something bad in his marriage but stressed political motives 
i went to moscow to set myself on fire in red square he 
said the bolshoi is a few blocks from red square where security 
is heavier 
the occupiers have cut off energy supplies and people are 
being thrown out of work wrote jamaitis who officials say was 
recently laid off 
i have lived my whole life in occupied lithuania wrote 
jamaitis who was born two years before the soviet union forcibly 
annexed lithuania and its sister republics of latvia and estonia 
during world war ii 
he was killing himself he said to let gorbachev know that 
lithuanians will not live in a lithuania that is not independent 
said the note read by ms radzevicius 
the suicide recalled the 1971 selfimmolation of a lithuanian 
student romas kalanta in the western lithuanian city of kaunas 
that act was a symbol of lithuanian resistance in the 1970s and 
1980s activists say 
the truck blockade in vilnius marked a new level of protest by 
nonlithuanians in the republic demonstrators lay down in front of 
their trucks in the center of vilnius to protest adventurist 
decisions of the lithuanian parliament tass said 
supporters of the lithuanian popular front sajudis dragged the 
trucks from the streets with tractors tass said it also reported 
that local authorities released truckers arrested in the protest to 
keep the peace 
because of gas shortages caused by the kremlin blockade 
rushhour traffic was much lighter than usual friday many people 
walked to work or used the citys extensive trolley system 
the blockade shown on the soviet evening tv news show 
vremya involved about 50 trucks and was organized by members 
of a lithuanian communist party splinter that remains loyal to the 
kremlin other organizers were members of yedinstvo consisting 
mostly of russian residents of lithuania said ms radzevicius 
just over 80 percent of the republics population is lithuanian 
and some russian polish and other minority residents have 
expressed fear their rights will be violated 
gorbachev has ordered curbs on supplies of oil and natural gas 
to lithuania in an effort to stem the independence movement and 
lithuanian and soviet media stressed the hardships caused by the 
embargo gorbachev also has refused to negotiate with lithuania 
soviet authorities have restricted western reporters from 
traveling to lithuania except by invitation on trips organized by 
the foreign ministry the associated press was not invited on one 
trip currently under way 
in london maverick soviet politician boris yeltsin criticized 
gorbachevs handling of the lithuanian independence crisis 
i would consider it immoral to declare an economic blockade in 
regard to one of our republics he said even if it were a 
foreign country gorbachev wouldnt have behaved in that way 
because people would have sat at the negotiating table and would 
have sought a way for political settlement 
kremlin officials have said lithuania might become independent 
but at a slower pace and gorbachevs actions appear designed to 
stem secessionist movements in other republics 
the parliament of estonia has voted to become independent at an 
unspecified later date and latvia is scheduled to vote on the 
issue next week 
an estonian delegation met friday with alexander yakovlev a 
gorbachev aide to discuss the independence of the baltic states 
the estonian news service reported the nongovernmental news 
outlet said yakovlev suggested estonia suspend its drive for 
independence and hold a referendum on the issue but did not demand 
the republic renounce its recent decisions 
in brussels lithuanian parliamentarians friday asked belgium to 
help offset moscows economic blockade 
lithuanian president landsbergis weighed a proposal from france 
and west germany that lithuania temporarily suspend its 
secessionist actions so that the current crisis ends in a 
solution acceptable to all parties 
lithuania wants an immediate dialogue landsbergis said and a 
termination of the soviet economic blockade against lithuania would 
be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue

harold gallegos says he still spits up blood 
and endures rashes blurred vision and kidney pains that began two 
years ago after he cleaned out a highway pit contaminated with 
toxic chemicals 
as a colorado state employee gallegos was not covered by 
federal occupational safety and health administration laws that 
require employers to tell workers what kind of hazards they face on 
the job 
workers such as gallegos would know their job risks under 
proposed osha changes being pushed by labor unions as they 
commemorate workers memorial day on saturday the day also marks 
the 20th anniversary of congress creation of osha 
in gallegos case after cleaning the highway pit he learned 
that it contained such heavy metals as arsenic zinc and cadmium 
and that an epa cleanup site contaminated with radioactive waste 
was just a few hundred feet away 
the colorado department of highways did not do anything 
inappropriate because the state had cleaned the same pump house for 
years without incident spokesman dan hopkins said the source of 
the contamination is still being investigated he said 
there was never any indication of any hazard we were shocked 
when we detected the contamination hopkins said in a telephone 
interview 
nevertheless the state now tests ground water and sand before 
cleaning similar pump houses and contracts the work out to 
hazardous substance specialists as a precaution hopkins said 
gallegos has not filed suit and the state has paid his medical 
bills and provided him leave including three days to visit 
washington and spotlight attention on the 10000 workers killed 
each year on the job and some 70000 others who have been 
permanently disabled by workplace accidents 
under osha revisions being pushed by the aflcio state and 
local employees and millions of other workers who currently dont 
fall under the federal law would have to be informed about their 
job risks 
the 142 millionmember federation also is calling on congress 
to require osha to increase penalties and enforcement authority 
improve recordkeeping of job injuries and illnesses and impose 
stronger safety and health standards in some industries 
labor secretary elizabeth dole is reviewing the proposed osha 
changes and wrote a letter this week to aflcio president lane 
kirkland pledging to find ways to increase effectiveness and 
implement improvements for osha enforcement 
labors supporters generally praise mrs doles commitment to 
workplace safety and consider her efforts a vast improvement over 
the neglect they felt osha received under president ronald reagan 
next week senate labor subcommittee chairman howard metzenbaum 
dohio will hold a hearing on various proposals to strengthen osha 
laws including one to increase criminal penalties 
metzenbaum said that during oshas first 18 years of existence 
200000 american workers were killed on the job many of the deaths 
were the result of willful violations of osha laws but not one 
employer spent one night in jail metzenbaum said 
right now the maximum criminal penalty for an employer who 
willfully violates federal safety laws when the violation results 
in death is six months in jail metzenbaums proposal would 
increase that to 10 years 
metzenbaum noted that last weekend millions of americans 
celebrated earth day in a push for tough enforcement of 
environmental laws 
i applaud their actions but if we throw corporate criminals 
in jail for harming our trees and animals and water we also should 
throw them in jail for killing and maiming our workers 
metzenbaum said 
the aflcio which created the first workers memorial day last 
year plans to hold ceremonies in 100 communities around the nation 
on saturday

role in bringing about an easing of tensions between the united 
states and cuba 
thirty years of confrontation and tension between cuba and the 
united states will not disappear overnight perez said in a 
speech to the oas permanent council but the oas could create a

is possible for the two governments to find an agenda for detente 
and eventually an agenda for cooperation 
perez who is here on an official visit made the recommendation 
as part of a broader proposal for revitalizing the oas 
relations between the united states and cuba have worsened in 
recent months the bush administration has shown little interest in 
opening a dialogue on reaching an accommodation

sixteen pelicans found dead near here 
were killed by lightning wildlife officials said 
its unusual for this to occur said game warden joe ulrich 
who investigated the birds deaths southeast of broadwater he said 
weather patterns seldom have such an impact on migrating birds 
pelicans which are not unusual in nebraska are mong the 
largest of all flying birds they have wingspans of up to 9 feet 
the american white pelicans probably were flying at an altitude 
of several hundred feet when they were caught in a thunderstorm 
earlier this week said dr stephen kerr a gering veterinarian and 
wildlife enthusiast who examined the birds 
its unusual because birds usually avoid bad weather he 
said thursday 
kerr said his examination showed that the birds died before 
hitting the ground marks on some of their plumage showed probable

authorities on friday searched fruitlessly 
for seven chinese peasants reported abducted upon arriving in this 
country suspicions rose that they may have been trying to escape 
china 
adding to the mystery was the question of why the chinese were 
being brought to a farm in this remote western massachusetts town 
to study organic agriculture an art that has been practiced in 
their country for centuries 
the chinese have never really had a foreign exchange to buy 
chemicals they are really knowledgeable from a millenium of 
organic farming said state agriculture commissioner august 
schumacher jr 
the seven missing chinese were among a group of 16 farmers who 
were brought here by molly aitken president of the world energy 
foundation and owner of green gables farm a modest spread on the 
outskirts of town 
federal authorities investigating the disappearance at new 
yorks kennedy international airport say they suspect it may have 
been a scheme to get away from the group and stay in the united 
states 
but aitken said thursday she trusted the seven and believes foul 
play was involved she said she and the chinese government selected 
the group 
i cannot believe they would deliberately jeopardize our 
project by running off she said they were very excited about 
the project it doesnt make any sense for them to want to do 
this 
the group was from fujian province in southern china the seven 
missing men are in their late 20s and early 30s and are married 
with families in china aitken said the remaining farmers were 
staying at her farm friday 
aitken said she was greeting the group at the airport wednesday 
night when she noticed several were being herded off by three men 
the alleged abductors apparently unarmed were yelling orders in 
chinese 
the men took the farmers across the crowded lobby out the 
terminal doors and into a waiting compact car 
port authority spokesman armando arrastia in new york said 
friday investigators were searching for the getaway car which was 
registered in morristown nj to a man named xueduan chen about 
30 years old 
authorities were trying to locate the owner said sgt thomas 
oreilly a detective with the port authority of new york and new 
jersey which operates the airport 
several law enforcement officials said they were reluctant to 
characterize the incident at kennedy 
theres something wrong here said duke austin a spokesman 
for the immigration and naturalization service in washington if 
there were other asians there with cars they must have known these 
people were coming 
the chinese embassy in washington did not immediately return a 
telephone call seeking comment friday afternoon 
michael ming cui an associate of aitkens suggested that 
overseas relatives of the men may have grabbed them for cheap 
labor austin however said the ins knew of no incidents in which 
chinese nationals were kidnapped as they entered this country 
cui said it is true the chinese are expert in organic farming 
but the visiting farmers were here to learn more sophisticated 
techniques such as solarpowered greenhouses and hydroponics 
cui said he doubted the disappearance was an attempt at illegal 
immigration he pointed to chinese immigration papers that showed 
that at least one member of the group had been cleared of 
involvement in last years studentled prodemocracy movement in 
beijing which was crushed by the government 
the farmers had been allowed into the united states on temporary 
h3 work visas intended for people in practical training programs 
working with the beijing vegetable research center aitken plans 
to build a model third world village on her property said cui an 
americaneducated chinese whose mother is affiliated with the 
center 
he said the project originally was intended to be conducted in 
china but supporters backed out after the government crackdown on 
prodemocracy students 
aitken said the world energy foundation is a new yorkbased 
nonprofit group that promotes the efficient use of energy and 
rural electrification in underdeveloped countries

kent state university under pressure from 
angry parents has agreed that a memorial to be dedicated to the 
students killed and wounded in a 1970 antiwar protest will include 
a plaque inscribed with their names 
the announcement was made thursday by the university president 
michael schwartz the granite plaque was placed near the hillside 
memorial in preparation for the dedication ceremony on may 4 the 
20th anniversary of the shootings 
schwartz made the decision after discussing the issue wednesday 
with martin and sarah scheuer the parents of one of the slain 
students sandra scheuer of boardman said janet thiede a 
university spokeswoman 
in an interview with the associated press published last week 
mrs scheuer expressed anger that no names were carved in the 
reddish granite of the memorial 
what good is a memorial if they dont have their names mrs 
scheuer said the vietnam memorial has names maybe the 
university just wants to forget about it 20 years is probably 
enough theyll probably think 
schwartz said the plaque was inscribed in loving memory of 
allison krause jeffrey miller sandra scheuer and william 
schroeder who were killed by ohio national guardsmen on may 4 
1970 
referring to the wounded students the plaque also says 
respectfully remembered alan canfora john cleary thomas grace 
dean kahler joseph lewis donald mackenzie james russell robert 
stamps and douglass wrentmore 
the plaque will speak to what happened here at kent while 
bruno asts design will speak to the larger issue of the disruption 
going on in our country at that time and the impact the events here 
had on our nation schwartz said in a statement 
the plaque was placed near the sidewalk north of the memorial 
plaza 
ms thiede the university spokeswoman said none of the 
finalists in the architectural design competition had called for 
including the names of the victims on the memorial 
the memorial plaza made of granite is built on a 2acre site 
atop a hill it consists of four standing slabs of increasing size 
that spread out from the center signifying that the impact of may 
4 1970 spread far beyond kent state 
asts name appears on the memorial along with the words 
inquire learn reflect which the university has outlined as 
its goal in building the memorial 
the memorial which cost 200000 was scaled down from a 1 
million proposal that the university said it had been unable to 
finance through private fundraising

william bennett the nations drug czar 
said friday that orphanages and youth camps may become sanctuaries 
for youngsters facing systematic child abuse in drugplagued 
homes and neighborhoods 
we may just have to find some way for children to get out of 
the environment they are in to go to orphanages to go to boys 
towns to institutions where they will be raised and nurtured 
bennett told about 3000 delegates to a world drug conference 
there are communities in america where children are not being 
raised at all 
but bennett offered no details about how children would be 
separated from families or what facilities would be used under such 
as plan 
i think before this is over we will see a dramatic increase in 
orphanages he said no one is a stronger proponent of family 
but when it reaches a level of systematic child abuse we have got 
to do something 
nearly 7000 adults and children attended the 13th annual 
conference sponsored by the atlantabased parent resource institute 
for drug education the convention ends saturday 
bennett stressed drug education for young people but vigorously 
opposed any efforts to legalize drugs or weaken present laws 
he also charged the nations colleges have ducked responsibility 
in the battle against drug use 
its interesting how many of these colleges want to take on 
ethnocentrism racism and sexism but when we ask them about drugs 
they say its a societywide problem and they cant do anything 
about it he said 
they can certainly do something about it such as adopting 
strong rules and strong principles

donald trump the king of glitzy real estate and 
casinos now says he wants to become the king of cash 
the tycoon said friday he has discussed selling or refinancing 
virtually every major asset he owns to raise money to buy new 
properties trump said he has hired merrill lynch amp co to 
negotiate a possible sale of the trump shuttle less than a year 
after buying the airline from eastern airlines 
if i got the right offer i would consider selling it trump 
told the associated press in a telephone interview 
trump was confirming remarks made to the wall street journal 
which published details of his financial plans in a story friday 
after its own interview with him the journals account said trump 
was so adamant about his cash strength he threatened to sue the 
newspaper if it suggested otherwise 
speculation about trumps net worth and business intentions have 
gathered momentum ever since his marital problems became the latest 
gossiptabloid fodder earlier this year 
forbes magazine for example says it has slashed an estimate of 
trumps net worth by more than 1 billion to around 500 million 
in its may 14 cover story which forbes made available friday the 
magazine says it revised the estimate after examining nonpublic 
documents submitted by trump last year to a government body which 
forbes declined to specify 
the article questions whether trumps cash flow is sufficient to 
cover the debt and interest payments from his vast holdings 
trump denied that his empire faces any cash shortage problems 
saying he has cash reserves of 380 million 
im very liquid now he told the ap i want to build up 
cash because i think cash is going to be king 
he did not elaborate but said he is interested in raising cash 
so that he will have funds on hand in the future to acquire 
additional properties 
among trumps assets are new yorks plaza hotel the glitzy 
trump tower skyscraper on manhattans fifth avenue and casinos in 
atlantic city nj including the 1 billion taj mahal casino 
which recently opened with much fanfare 
some people in the financial community are watching for signs 
that trump might be accumulating cash to cope with a current or 
anticipated cash crunch caused by a heavy debt load 
hes in a cash squeeze why else is he doing this said a 
hotel industry analyst 
he and other analysts spoke on condition they not be identified 
partly out of fear of arousing trumps lawsuit threats against 
people whose views he doesnt like 
last month gaming industry analyst marvin roffman was fired by 
his firm janney montgomery scott inc in philadelphia after he 
made negative comments published in the journal about the taj 
mahals longterm prospects trump threatened to sue the firm and 
roffman was fired after he rescinded his initial written apology to 
the developer 
several of trumps biggest holdings dont produce enough income 
to cover interest payments on loans taken out to pay for 
acquisitions this means that trump relies heavily on cash cows 
such as casinos and condominiums according to the journal article 
the plaza and trump tower will not be sold trump said

brown remembered going into a washington dc barber shop and 
the barbers hand was shaking so bad i walked out of there and 
my head was like the rocky mountains

quarter inch and its hardly noticeable not so with a crew cut 
one slip and you could draw blood brown said

any plans to visit kresge college 
part of the university of california santa cruz will require a 
passport and visa 
students at kresge one of eight ucsc residential colleges 
voted overwhelmingly this week 30679 to secede from the main 
campus 
the students on thursday were making plans to issue passports 
and entry visas they also intend to set up toll booths at border 
checkpoints 
it all started with a ballot measure that sought a secession 
initially it was considered a symbolic initiative but steve 
parks chairman of the kresge student parliament said were 
going to take this thing a bit further hence the toll booths 
and visas 
the ballot measure blasts school administrators as managers 
and demagogues rather than the visionaries and idealists who 
established the university among the redwoods above downtown santa 
cruz in the 1960s 
we secede in the name of the environment we secede in the 
name of the earth stated the initiative 
parks said the secessionist movement was spurred among other 
things by concerns about fast campus growth 
a ucsc spokesman said administrators are baffled 
we are not sure what this means said john harvith the 
schools assistant director of public information

barred deposits at five sperm banks including two being sued by 
women who say they were impregnated by the wrong sperm 
in a letter delivered wednesday each bank was told to cease 
collecting and processing human semen for artificial insemination 
and to either destroy all anonymous semen samples or hold them 
until it meets requirements for anonymous donor screening and 
testing 
authorities said none of the banks had applied for a state 
license as required by a regulation that took effect in october 
the banks all in manhattan included advanced fertility 
services which has been sued by julia skolnick and university 
fertility center of research which has been sued by a married 
couple identified in court papers as jane and john doe 
mrs skolnick gave birth to a daughter who is half black mrs 
skolnick is white as was her late husband whose sperm was 
supposed to have been used in the insemination 
jane doe sued university after she gave birth to a child whose 
blood type allegedly did not match hers or her husband she 
arranged to be impregnated by his sperm 
the three other banks were fertility research foundation the 
fertility institute of new york and the mary wilson fertility 
center 
according to investigators the most serious problems were at 
advanced fertility the investigators said there was no evidence 
that advanced fertility quarantined semen from anonymous donors 
for six months before it was used 
that donors were given appropriate physical exams 
that semen was frozen within an hour of collection 
that semen was screened for htlvi a virus linked to leukemia 
that can be sexually transmitted 
in addition the bank failed to apply for a state license even 
after it being told said maryanne gardineer a health department 
regulator 
robert whittaker a lawyer for the bank said its operator dr 
hugh melnick is working with the state and has indicated that 
whatever bookkeeping problems exist will be corrected 
vicki zeldin a health department spokeswoman said advanced 
fertility claimed these were only paperwork problems but if they 
cant document that something happened how do we know they did 
it 
ms gardineer declined to comment on a report published earlier 
this week that investigators also found semen at the bank bearing 
the code of mrs skolnicks husband mrs skolnick says she was 
told by the bank that all of her husbands semen there had been 
used she says the finding is proof that she was artificially 
inseminated with the wrong sperm 
mrs skolnick also has sued idant laboratories where her 
husband deposited his sperm and which was supposed to send it to 
advanced fertility for insemination ms gardineer said the states 
review of idant new yorks largest sperm bank was not finished 
investigators found that wilson fertility was using fresh semen 
that had neither been frozen nor quarantined ms gardineer said 
ian wilson of wilson fertility said fresh semen is more 
effective than frozen and he complained that the state order would 
inconvenience patients without increasing safeguards against 
disease 
zeldin said the three other banks were cited because they had 
not applied for the license 
ms gardineer said she does not know how many semen banks 
operate in the state so far license applications have been 
received from nine banks including five in other states 
officials at university said it no longer collected semen 
the states order only bars the five banks from collecting or 
processing semen not from releasing semen already on deposit 
accordingly the move does not affect semen of known donors like 
those involved in the two lawsuits 
but sperm banks record keeping is at the heart of those cases 
and ms gardineer said the inspections raised questions 
you should be able to trace semen much in the same way you can 
blood she said but from what weve seen the paper trail just 
isnt there

authorinhiding salman rushdie said friday he 
misses everyday pleasures like taking a walk but will not allow 
his prisonlike circumstances to defeat him 
in a telephone interview with bbc radio the british author of 
the satanic verses also said he finds it odd no one has been 
prosecuted for making the threats that keep him in hiding 14 months 
after irans ayatollah ruhollah khomeini imposed a death sentence 
im not a lawyer but it seems to me that people have been 
prosecuted for incitement in the past on less grounds than this 
he said i see what everyone else has seen on television and i 
find it hard to believe thats not sufficient evidence 
at un headquarters in new york iranian foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati said in reply to a question at a news conference 
friday that the death sentence stands and has been supported by the 
islamic world 
khomeini irans spiritual and revolutionary leader condemned 
rushdies novel as blaspheming islam khomeini died june 3 but 
iranian authorities reaffirmed his death decree and iranian 
clerics offered millions of dollars to anyone who killed rushdie 
some british moslems have expressed support for khomeinis decree 
rushdie born in india of moslem parents is not a practicing 
moslem 
asked how he was coping with life in hiding and under guard 
rushdie said well its amazing what people can get used to 
im doing my work and i suppose that keeps me going but i 
would like to think that this isnt a permanent condition it 
is a very difficult situation but i dont intend to be defeated by 
it 
i spend my life reading and writing its a simple life he 
said i get up in the morning and i work and i do whatever you 
might do if your life were confined to the interior of a house 
the british broadcasting corp said it was the 42yearold 
writers first broadcast interview since the feb 14 1989 death 
threat drove him into hiding 
rushdie said he regards the confines of his safehouse as a 
prison 
the fact that i cannot leave the house is a colossal 
restriction and is indeed a loss of freedom he said 
the worst about it is the loss of ordinary life the worst 
about it is not being able to do things that everybody else would 
take for granted like walking down a street 
rushdie said he has finished a novel for older children and a 
selection of his essays and criticisms 
when ive had a bit of a rest i try to dive into a grownup 
novel rushdie said 
he gave no indication of where he was 
rushdie indicated it was not his responsibility to bring the 
campaign against him to an end he called it a political problem 
that needs to be solved at the political level and i have to 
remain optimistic that it will be 
i wrote a book quite legitimately that was published quite 
legitimately and its not really for the person who is the object 
of an attack to solve the problem he said 
but liquat hussain leader of the moslem community in the 
central england city of bradford where the satanic verses was 
first burned said rushdie is the key to the problem 
he and his publishers can only solve the problem by 
withdrawing the book from publication he said 
hussain said the moslem campaign against the book would continue 
until it was withdrawn and the british law on blasphemy applied to 
all citizens the law now applies only to christian religions 
rushdie agreed to the interview on behalf of the charter 88 
campaign for a written constitution in britain which is the only 
country in western europe without one 
rushdie said newspaper reports that he was sighted in various 
places and had to be hustled away from a dinner in oxford after 
moslems arrived were wrong 
ive been sighted all over the place im told ive been in 
switzerland there was a point where i was supposed to be in 
paris rushdie said the fact is that im in none of those 
places 
the bbc said rushdie placed the call and they did not know from 
where he called

three men accosted irans foreign minister 
in a un hallway friday shouting murderer and torturer 
and one hurled eggs at velayati before being wrestled to the floor 
the eggs missed and the minister ali akbar velayati was 
untouched and unharmed the three welldressed men who identified 
themselves as iranians were apprehended and held for questioning 
one man giving his name as ahmed mohini said the iranian 
government killed his brother 
velayati does not represent the iranian people and should not 
be allowed here he said before being hustled off by guards 
velayati proceeded to his scheduled news conference where he 
told reporters he didnt know the men 
it was not known how the men got through un security us 
state department security guards also were protecting velayati 
the ambassador told the conference in response to a question 
that irans 14monthold death sentence against british author 
salman rushdie still stands and has been supported by the islamic 
world 
the sentence was decreed by the late iranian leader ayatolla 
ruhollah khomeini who found rushdies novel the satanic 
verses blasphemous 
velayati also repeated statements calling for international 
efforts to free all hostages western and middle eastern held 
in lebanon and israel 
it helps this positive process if the united states and 
britain use their moral influence over the government of israel and 
also the phalangist groups in lebanon to get the release of 
iranian hostages and also some moslems in lebanon and 
palestine 
he was referring to iranians who disappeared in lebanon in the 
early 1980s and to prisoners held by israel and its south lebanese 
army militia allies 
velayati said iraniraq peace talks were stalemated and he 
blamed iraq 
the two persian gulf neighbors fought an eightyear war which 
was halted by a truce in 1988

president bush on friday removed japan from a 
hit list of countries judged to have erected the most offensive 
trade barriers against american products rewarding japanese 
efforts to ease trade tensions between the two economic superpowers 
instead the president said he had decided to cite only one 
country india under a tough section of us trade law which 
provides for economic retaliation if the offending barriers are not 
removed 
the decision brought immediate protests from members of 
congress who charged the administration had made a serious mistake 
in not naming japan the country congress specifically had in mind 
when it wrote the provision known as super 301 into the 1988 
trade act 
i am thunderstruck sen robert c byrd dwva said in a 
senate floor speech excuse me mr president but this boggles 
the mind letting japan off the hook is a serious mistake and i 
think congress ought to take a look at it 
critics said japan needed to be targeted to keep pressure on the 
government of prime minister toshiki kaifu to live up to a flurry 
of trade concessions he has made aimed at lowering americas huge 
49 billion trade deficit with japan 
it is clear that japan should be on the list said sen don 
riegle dmich one of the sponsors of the super 301 provision 
our government is not using the tools that are available to 
correct this continuing hemorrhage of us capital and jobs 
but bush in announcing his decision said he was persuaded that 
kaifu shared my commitment to ensuring that trade strengthens 
rather than undermines the friendship between our nations 
administration officials said targeting japan could provoke a 
public backlash against the united states and make kaifus job of 
reforming japans trading system even more difficult 
we believe that the most effective way to achieve results is 
through cooperation not confrontation us trade representative 
carla hills told reporters 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama praised the presidents 
decision saying it upheld his governments position that it would 
not negotiate with the united states under threat of retaliation 
but house majority leader richard gephardt called the decision a 
free trade furlough 
if we have learned anything over the years as we have fought 
to reduce our monumental trade deficit with japan it is that the 
only thing that works is clear constant consistent pressure for 
needed change gephardt said 
a year ago the administration used the super 301 provision to 
target japan brazil and india as the countries with the highest 
barriers to american trade 
japan was cited for barriers to sales of usmade 
supercomputers satellites and wood products in the past month 
us and japanese negotiators have reached marketopening 
agreements in all three areas 
brazil was targeted for restrictive import licensing practices 
hills said recently enacted legislation in that country should meet 
us concerns in this area 
but india which was cited last year for a ban on operations of 
foreign private insurance companies and for controls on foreign 
investment that distort trade has refused to make concessions 
the 1990 target list names those barriers again hills said 
india was singled out because it had erected more trade barriers 
than any noncommunist country and the negotiations over the past 
year had made no progress 
the indian government issued a statement saying it would 
continue to refuse to negotiate bilaterally under threat of 
sanctions it said the best way to resolve the dispute was in the 
current round of global trade talks being held under the auspices 
of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
members of congress said it made no sense to target india with 
its modest 850 million trade surplus with the united states and 
neglect japan whose trade surplus accounted for almost half of 
americas 109 billion deficit last year 
naming india and not japan makes a mockery of super 301 and 
us trade policy said rep sander levin dmich 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen said he was glad 
the administration had at least issued a new super 301 list 
although he was disappointed that japan was not included 
bentsen dtexas had warned earlier in the week that if the 
administration ignored the law completely this year he would work 
to block congressional passage of trade agreements the 
administration is expected to seek this year with the soviet union 
china and the emerging democracies in eastern europe 
the 1988 trade law required the administration to issue a target 
list of countries with the most offensive trade barriers in 1989 
and 1990 the law provides a tight timetable for negotiating away 
barriers and provides for retaliatory tariffs against the nations 
imports into the united states if the negotiations prove 
unsuccessful 
some in congress said they would propose legislation to make the 
super 301 designation an annual event thus forcing the 
administration to address again next year japans success in 
opening its markets

chad said friday that its troops killed more than 
700 libyanbacked rebels in recent fighting and that france 
promised to keep a reinforced military contingent in its former 
colony 
the libyans continue to want to impose their will on chad 
despite a peace agreement the two countries signed aug 31 said 
foreign minister asheik ibn oumar 
we have had the assurance that french backing will not be 
lacking when we need it he said 
the chadian government of president hissene habre accuses 
tripoli of arming and training the islamic legion rebels fighting 
in eastern chad but libya denies the legion exists 
the two north african countries which border each other have a 
longrunning dispute over a territory in northern chad called the 
aouzou strip 
casualty figures released by the chadian embassy in paris listed 
736 rebels killed and 328 captured in attacks april 18 and 20 on 
two columns of the islamic legion 
chads high command gave government losses for the first time 
47 soldiers killed 102 wounded and about 150 vehicles and 63 heavy 
arms captured 
the legion operates along chads eastern border from bases 
inside neighboring sudans lightly populated darfur province where 
the khartoum government exercises virtually no control 
renewed fighting in the sporadic civil war broke out last month 
when rebels took government outposts at bahai and tine chadian 
troops later recaptured the positions 
 
ibn oumar said france assured him 1200 french troops will 
remain in chad indefinitely but added that no active support of the 
soldiers would be needed 
what we need is materials and weapons not the men to use 
them he said 
libya which once occupied most of northern chad was chased out 
three years ago in a series of defeats it still claims the aouzou 
strip as its own 
in the august agreement signed in algiers libya and chad 
reconfirmed a ceasefire agreed to the exchange of prisoners of 
war and to submitting their territorial dispute to international 
arbitration 
but ibn oumar said chad has encountered only endless 
obstruction from the libyans in trying to implement the agreement 
every meeting of experts on the territorial dispute ended in 
failure ibn oumar said libya wanted to discuss freeing an 
estimated 2000 libyans held by chad while chad wanted to discuss 
the future of the aouzou strip 
he said unless there is a breakthrough chad is plans to place 
the problem before the international court at the hague as from 
sept 1 as entitled by the algiers agreement 
ibn oumar also complained that european countries have an 
increasing tendency to neglect africa because their attention is 
focused on events in eastern europe 
we have repaid our total debt three or four times yet today 
we are more indebted than ever he said the european countries 
refuse even to discuss our urgent needs although the 
responsibility is theirs for colonizing us and for looting our 
economies during and since the colonial era 
chad gained independence from france in 1960

exxon corp on friday unveiled its 
second and last cleanup plan for the exxon valdez oil spill 
saying it will spread fertilizers that promote oileating bacteria 
and send squads to pick up debris this years work is scattered 
so we want to use a very flexible squadtype group that can move 
in and move out and move over to do other work said don 
carpenter exxons logistics and operations manager 
the plan submitted to coast guard rear admiral david e 
ciancaglini for approval contradicts conclusions by state 
officials that more than three quarters of beaches surveyed were 
still oiled from last years spill 
the plans call for bioremediation the use of the fertilizers 
also has been controversial state environmental officials said 
earlier in the week they wont approve its use until further 
studies have been done to allay fears about possible toxicity 
exxon plans to return its crews to the beaches may 1 
a multiagency task force has been conducting a shoreline survey 
this month and determined that conditions in prince william sound 
and the gulf of alaska have improved dramatically over the winter 
exxon said 
the oil company said its studies of 574 miles of shoreline so 
far showed twothirds without any oil at all 22 percent with 
very light oiling and 13 percent with a narrow to wide band 
of weathered crude along sections 
those figures include subsurface oil as well they said which 
went below 4 inches on 16 miles of shoreline 
the state department of environmental conservation reported 
those survey results differently wednesday saying 79 percent of 
the shoreline sites surveyed were still oiled 
i dont understand their numbers what the statistics are 
based on exxons technical manager bob mastracchio said 
friday weve got 20 teams out there surveying shorelines 
a more serious clash however may develop over bioremediation 
of 209 sites exxon has targeted so far for cleanup it hopes to 
use bioremediation on 160 of them 
some state and federal policymakers are worried about the 
release of still more toxins if they dont allow the fertilizers 
thats gonna be a dilemma for the agencies and the plan 
mastracchio said 
if you cant use bioremediation you can let nature remove the 
oil over the next few seasons bioremediation simply speeds up a 
natural degradation process 
the company will meet with federal parks officials and state 
environmental officials to continue talking about the use of the 
fertilizers he said 
exxon said it plans to manually pick up oily debris and tarballs 
on the majority of sites targeted for cleanup spotwash certain 
areas and till and rake sediment in others mastracchio said manual 
pickup was the least environmentally destructive kind of cleanup 
comparing rockwashing an entire beach to stripmining it 
the size of exxons crews this summer will be about 10 percent 
of last summers the company expects to have 1100 people at work 
on the cleanup by june 1 
exxons plans call for eight mobile teams supported by eight 
berthing vessels and 12 landing craft the teams would be supported 
by 24 helicopters 10 other aircraft 20 work boats eight supply 
vessels and about 30 smaller boats and skiffs 
that compares with more than 10000 workers and 1000 boats 
leased for last summers 2 billion program 
exxon officials wouldnt estimate how much this summers cleanup 
will cost but they expect it will be their last 
were putting out more than enough resources so the work can 
be done by the end of this summer said carpenter 
hundreds of miles of alaska shoreline were fouled when the 
tanker exxon valdez slammed into a charted reef march 24 1989 
releasing nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil into 
the water 
it was the nations biggest oil spill coating hundreds of miles 
of shoreline and killing hundreds of otters and thousands of birds 
and other animals 
ciancaglini the federal onsite coordinator said it will take 
him several days to review exxons plan and the comments on it 
submitted by various state and federal agencies and other parties 
the review wont delay the start of cleanup he said

a wildlife advocacy group said friday 
it has begun a campaign to warn fishermen on indonesias padaido 
islands that damage caused by their catching fish with explosives 
will ruin the fishing grounds 
the warning came in an article published by the feature service 
of the world wide fund for nature or wwf known as world wildlife 
fund in the united states canada and australia 
it informed the fishermen that the explosives they fashion from 
recovered world war ii bombs are ruining fragile coral reefs and 
devastating marine life what will we live on tomorrow ask a 
wwf poster in the local language where will we fish dont ruin 
your future 
wwf said that at the end of the war the us 7th fleet which 
operated out of the padaido islands dumped thousands of live bombs 
in the center of the chains atoll 
villagers dredged up the bombs emptied their contents and 
developed a local fish bomb industry that proved destructive to 
the environment the wwf said the contents of a large bomb can 
fill hundreds of small fishing bombs 
the concussion from the bombs kills the fish and they float to 
the surface for fishermen to collect 
it takes 38 years for a bombed reef to grow back to half its 
original area don mcallister a specialist with the 
switzerlandbased world conservation union was quoted as saying 
wwf said fish catches fall dramatically when reefs are damaged 
but the bombing problem has been largely ignored because damaged 
reefs are hidden beneath the sea

the new prodemocracy government said 
friday it has dismantled the last remnants of king birendras 
29yearold political system which had given the monarch an 
absolute grip on power 
ck prasai a spokesman for the nepali congress party said the 
cabinet had moved late thursday night to dissolve the system of 
panchayat the term means grassroots government but it 
actually gave the palace the power to choose local and national 
government representatives 
the new government took office april 19 birendra legalized 
political parties april 8 two days after security forces opened 
fire on prodemocracy deomstrators killing scores of people 
witnesses said 200 people were killed but birendras government 
said 10 were killed and 107 were injured 
prime minister krishna prasad bhattarai announced the cabinet 
decision during a nepali congress executive committee meeting 
friday prasai told reporters 
from now on there is no panchayat from village level to 
national level in the country prasai said this is a very 
drastic and swift step towards fulfilling the aspirations of the 
people it is happy news 
the panchayat system was introuduced by birendras father king 
mahendra in 1961 and extended from local levels to the rashtriya 
panchayat or national assembly 
birendra dissolved the rashtriya panchayat on april 16 
succumbing to demands of the prodemocracy movement spearheaded by 
the nepali congress and the sevenparty united left front 
his order did not formally disband local branches of the system 
although they had become practically defunct 
prasai said the district panchayats will be run by local 
development officers and that village secretaries will handle 
administrative duties until a new system is announced 
the nepali congress headed the countrys only democratically 
elected government in 1959 but it lasted only 20 months before it 
was dismissed by mahendra as part of his plan to set up the 
panchayat system

gov george mickelson said friday south 
dakota will file a lawsuit seeking to force the us army corps of 
engineers to reduce water releases from droughtstricken reservoirs 
on the upper missouri river 
despite a threeyear drought the corps of engineers has 
continued to discharge large amounts of water to support a small 
amount of barge traffic from sioux city iowa to st louis mo 
mickelson said at a news conference 
the governor said hes still willing to settle the dispute 
through negotiation but its unlikely such an agreement can be 
reached before the lawsuit is filed sometime next week 
im tired of the inaction and the indifference we have seen 
from all of our efforts mickelson said 
he said governors of other missouri river states and leaders of 
indian tribal governments may join south dakota in the lawsuit 
gov george sinner of north dakota said friday his state is likely 
to take part 
the state has hired former gov bill janklow a lawyer to 
handle the lawsuit 
dropping water levels have threatened city and rural water 
supply systems left boat ramps far from the waters edge and 
prevented irrigators from using the water in the huge reservoirs 
mickelson said 
the citizens of south dakota deserve and have the right to 
expect that we will equitably share in the benefits of the missouri 
river reservoirs and to this point we have not he told 
reporters 
g edward dickey acting deputy secretary of the army for civil 
works said the agency doesnt comment on lawsuits or potential 
lawsuits 
but dickey said groups that use rivers and reservoirs get 
worried when a drought cuts the water supply the corps is 
following the policy in its master manual in operating the missouri 
river reservoirs he said 
we have a drought out there a very severe drought its 
not surprising we have a lot of anxieties dickey said in a 
telephone interview from his washington office until it rains 
theres going to be continuing unhappiness among all users because 
everybody gives up something 
the water levels in fort peck lake in montana lake sakakawea in 
north dakota and oahe reservoir in south dakota have suffered the 
greatest drops in water levels during the drought the other three 
smaller reservoirs in south dakota have not been affected as much 
the water level in oahe reservoir which stretches 230 miles 
from the middle of south dakota to southern north dakota has 
fallen 20 feet below normal at times during the past year 
mickelson said the corps of engineers own study estimates 
downstream barge traffic is worth only 12 million a year while 
recreation in the upstream states is worth more than 63 million 
annually he said 
what were seeing now is massive record releases that are 
going out of the reservoirs in our state to support a dying 
navigation industry between st louis and sioux city mickelson 
said 
sinner the north dakota governor said the corps of engineers 
relies on the downstream navigation channel more than private 
shippers do 
he said the lawsuit might seek a court order reducing reservoir 
releases to the point where downstream navigation is shut down 
mickelson said the lawsuit will seek a court order requiring the 
corps to determine new longterm priorities for water use in the 
missouri river the lawsuit would harm only the navigation industry 
in downstream states mickelson said

five longexiled leaders of the 
african national congress made an emotional return to south africa 
on friday to prepare for groundbreaking talks next week with the 
whiteled government 
the five who arrived from the groups exile headquarters in 
lusaka zambia will join anc deputy president nelson mandela for 
discussions with president fw de klerks government may 24 
as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted 27 years 
ago we are really on the way said joe slovo a member of the 
ancs national executive committee he fled south africa in 1963 
we who left by the back door have now entered the very 
front door of south africa said slovo the ancs highestranking 
white its a remarkable feeling 
in addition to slovo the group included the ancs 
secretarygeneral alfred nzo head of foreign affairs thabo 
mbeki commander of the movements guerrilla wing joe modise and 
head of the womens section ruth mompati 
the five who had been in exile since the 1960s arrived on a 
private charter and held an airport news conference 
it is an exciting moment for all of us said nzo 
regrettably our south africa is still a bleeding country ravaged 
by the apartheid system which continues to divide our people into 
warring clusters 
mbeki wept as he stood beside his 80yearold father govan 
mbeki an anc veteran who spent 23 years in prison before his 
release in 1987 
about 100 supporters greeted the anc leaders at the airport 
hundreds more lined the road outside waving the banners of the anc 
and its ally the south african communist party 
meanwhile exiled anc president oliver tambo 73 quietly left 
sweden on thursday after a recuperating there since jan 3 from a 
stroke he suffered late last year officials in stockholm said 
friday 
the swedish news agency tt said tambo wanted to return to south 
africa soon but it was unlikely he would be able to resume an 
active leadership role in the anc 
de klerk legalized the anc in february after a 30year ban many 
of the estimated 15000 members in exile are likely to return this 
year four lesserranking anc officials returned this week but have 
not appeared in public 
the government promised that the exiled anc leaders would not be 
prosecuted upon returning to south africa for the talks 
under south africas apartheid system of racial segregation the 
countrys 5 million whites maintain political and economic control 
and the 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs 
next weeks talks are designed to clear the way for negotiations 
on a new constitution that would include blacks 
the anc has said the government must lift the 3yearold state 
of emergency and release prisoners convicted of politically 
motivated crimes before negotiations can begin the government 
wants the anc to renounce its armed struggle 
the government has said constitutional negotiations will include 
several black opposition groups in addition to the anc 
slovo is general secretary of the communist party about half of 
the ancs top 35 leaders also are communists 
in other developments 
police said friday six people were killed in black factional 
fighting in natal province during the preceding 24 hours 
justice minister kobie coetsee said he plans to introduce 
legislation that would end racial segregation of prisons 
a former member of the johannesburg city council security 
department alleged that a military intelligence operative was 
responsible for the assassination last year of prominent white 
antiapartheid activist david webster 
hannes gouws made his allegation at an inquiry into a spy ring 
conducted by the city council no one has been arrested for 
websters killing

gov tommy g thompson on friday signed 
what he called the nations strictest recycling law which bans 
bottles newspapers and other recyclable waste from wisconsin dumps 
by 1995 
the law requires every community to draw up a mandatory 
recycling plan by that year and it imposes a 15 millionayear 
tax on big businesses to help pay for stemming the tide of trash 
sponsors of the measure along with some environmentalists also 
called it the most farreaching in any state because of its onetwo 
punch of mandatory statewide recycling and a tax on business 
as far as i know wisconsin is the first state to use a 
broadbased business tax to pay for recycling said jeanne wirka 
policy analyst for the washingtonbased environmental action 
foundation the advocacy group has 30000 members nationwide 
the wisconsin bill is similar to a measure pending in the 
vermont legislature and is likely to serve as a model for other 
states she said 
thompson a republican surprised some by retaining part of the 
business tax which he had been expected to excise from the bill 
using his power of partial veto 
overall its a very tough bill and its making a lot of 
people nervous said douglas johnson a lobbyist for an industry 
group called the wisconsin consumer packaging council 
nothing will change immediately because of the bill which will 
work largely by banning recyclable products from the states 
landfills 
communities many of which have already begun work on plans that 
require residents and businesses to recycle must have mandatory 
recycling in place by 1995 that is also when the dumping 
restrictions take effect 
a detailed list of products barred from dumps includes aluminum 
glass and plastic containers newspapers cardboard and office 
paper steel containers and old tires 
wisconsin dumps will have to stop taking refuse from 
outofstate except from communities with the same strict 
recycling rules private wisconsin dumps now accept large amounts 
of refuse from minnesota and elsewhere 
the state will put up 185 million a year to finance the 
effort added to that will be an estimated 15 million from a tax 
on larger businesses 
the tax would be graduated firms with annual receipts of 1 
million would pay 63 a year and that would rise to rise to 2170 
for firms with 6 million or more in gross receipts companies with 
gross annual receipts of less than 1 million would be spared the 
tax 
businesses would begin paying the tax in 1992 to accumulate 
money for the recycling program the tax method would be reassessed 
after two years 
this is the most progressive farreaching and potentially 
effective recycling law in the united states thompson said 
during the capitol bill signingceremony 
wisconsin previously enacted legislation banning grass clippings 
and other yard wastes from landfills beginning in 1993 
the original bill called for about 30 million in business 
taxes but thompson used his partial veto power to cut the gross 
receipts tax in half and to set an expiration date of two years to 
force the legislature to seek others forms of funding 
the governor also removed sections that would have banned some 
types of packaging he said that represented a potential threat 
to wisconsin jobs with little or no demonstrated environmental 
gain 
the legislature approved the measure in late march after 
removing some strict features among them was a proposed pennyper 
diaper tax on disposables to pay for recycling

japanese astronomers reported friday that they have 
produced detailed pictures of comet austin which is observable 
through telescopes in the northern hemisphere as it nears the earth 
an observatory official said researchers took the photographs 
wednesday night through a telescope at tokyo universitys 
observatory in northern japan he said details of the comets 
44millionmilelong tail showed up clearly in the pictures 
affording researchers the opportunity of studying it 
the tail of a comet is essentially a vapor trail created by 
solar wind striking the comets icy surface 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
photos are the first of comet austin taken by japanese researchers 
for astronomical observation 
the comet is advancing about 38 million miles a day he said 
unlike periodic comets such as halleys he said comet austin 
having circled the sun will never return 
comet austin was named for amateur astronomer rodney austin of 
new zealand who discovered it last year 
it will be observable throughout much of the earths northern 
hemisphere until the end of may but it is not bright enough to be 
seen by the naked eye the official said it is traveling in a 
westerly direction he added 
the official reported that the observation effort is being 
conducted at 30 locations throughout japan and that photos and 
other data on comet austin will be shared with the smithsonian 
observatory in the united states

a jury friday convicted a former houston policeman 
of voluntary manslaughter in the shooting of a black woman on a 
houston freeway after a halloween night of drinking among offduty 
officers 
alex gonzales who was himself critically wounded by the victim 
in what prosecutors said was selfdefense faces up to 20 years in 
jail for the conviction in the death of ida lee delaney on oct 31 
the allwhite jury which began deliberating late wednesday 
afternoon delivered its verdict shortly before 230 pm friday 
state district judge ted poe instructed jurors that they could 
find gonzales guilty of murder voluntary manslaughter or innocent 
of either charge 
the punishment phase of the trial is scheduled to begin monday 
the trial was moved to dallas because of heavy pretrial 
publicity in houston where the death of ms delaney became another 
cause for groups that maintain that houston police are hostile 
toward blacks she was a janitor at the houston post 
gonzales 25 was accused of provoking ms delaney 50 into the 
predawn shooting then killing her tests after the incident 
showed gonzales had a bloodalcohol level of 19 nearly twice the 
amount to be considered legally drunk in texas 
according to trial testimony gonzales was riding in a private 
car with two other offduty officers none wearing uniforms when 
they encountered ms delaneys pickup truck about 515 am 
prosecutors said gonzales and the other officers who have also 
been dismissed from the department since the incident chased ms 
delaney for 12 miles after she cut them off in traffic on her way 
to work 
he stepped out of his police suit to become a thug on the 
street said harris county prosecutor chuck rosenthal in closing 
arguments on wednesday 
ms delaney had no way of knowing that the men chasing her were 
police officers prosecutors said 
the shooting occurred after ms delaney pulled off the freeway 
defense attorneys wednesday said gonzales shot ms delaney in 
selfdefense 
she was a violent aggressive hairtrigger individual 
defense attorney joe bailey said 
fellow defense attorney mike hinton told the jury she was 
discharging her weapon because she was discharging her temper 
gonzales said he and fellow officers alexander romero and rc 
gonzales jr followed delaney to arrest her after she nearly hit 
their car with her pickup and shot at them 
prosecutors say the three harassed and terrified the woman and 
that gonzales who was drunk and out of uniform slugged delaney in 
the face before shooting her to death

the hubble space telescope orbited 
with its big eye open friday after ground controllers overcame 
communications problems and lifted its lens cover but its 
electronics were shut down due to a malfunction 
those problems however were not the immediate concern of 
shuttle discoverys astronauts who prepared for sundays return to 
earth 
youve been released from hubble support its on its own 
mission controls story musgrave told the five crew members 
thats great news replied discovery commander loren j 
shriver 
there are handshakes and smiles all around up here ill bet 
its just that way back down there too added mission specialist 
steven hawley whos buying tonight 
well buy when you all get back musgrave replied 
flight director william reeves said it was too early to cheer 
we still have an important part of the mission to go reeves 
said we reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on the 
ground 
discovery is to land at 948 am edt sunday at edwards air 
force base calif landing would have been delayed a day if 
astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had had to perform 
a space walk to crank open the telescopes lens cover or aperture 
door 
the shuttle trailed 50 miles behind hubble when the aperture 
door opened 380 miles above earth but passed 37 miles beneath the 
telescope later in the day 
the national aeronautics and space administration had planned to 
release its first test image from the 15 billion telescope on 
tuesday showing an open star cluster in the constellation carina 
but steve terry director of orbital verifications said that would 
be delayed by problems with hubbles highspeed antennas 
scientific data will follow in a month or two 
hubbles 10foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the 
heavens at 1030 am edt nearly four hours later than planned 
exposing its finely polished 945inch mirror to starlight for the 
first time 
ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift 
even though the telescope was in an automatic safe mode with 
all motion stopped because of problems in linking its highspeed 
dish antennas with a relay satellite 
one of the two antennas apparently had swung too far and the 
telescope shut down said jean oliver a hubble deputy project 
manager if future movements of the antenna have to be limited to 
avoid the problem it would have only slight impact on the 
telescopes observing time oliver said 
terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have been 
delayed much longer 
there has to be a point where you say they have to go their 
way and we have to go ours he said of the astronauts 
when the door opened two of hubbles four positionstabilizing 
gyroscopes stopped working later engineers got them back on line 
the motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros said dave 
drachlis of the goddard space flight center in maryland that too 
kept it in the safe mode 
oliver said it would be saturday morning before the telescope is 
brought out of the safe mode it will take another day to get the 
instrument operating normally again putting controllers at goddard 
several days behind 
were trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any 
corners and do anything fast because we feel theres a lot at risk 
here and we want to make sure were doing it properly oliver 
said weve got a long future ahead of us and we want to make 
sure it starts off on the right foot 
nasa said the telescope was safe and in a stable position 
tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly 
narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many 
malfunctions terry said in addition to that trouble there were 
two communications outages totaling several hours 
were cautious and thats natural terry said weve got 
a very expensive spacecraft here and we dont want to do anything 
to jeopardize the usefulness well get to the point where we 
know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits 
appropriately 
terry said hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the 
master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting 
communications system is lost for extended periods the telescope 
will share the system known as tracking and data relay satellites 
with other space craft 
except for a tiny wedge opening the lens cover had been closed 
and the telescope blind ever since hubble was released by the 
astronauts wednesday 
from its orbit high above earths distorting atmosphere the 
telescope will enable astronomers over its 15year working lifetime 
to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the 
universe the universe is believed to have been created about 15 
billion years ago in a cosmic explosion 
the late astronomer edwin p hubble for whom the telescope is 
named provided the basis for the big bang theory of creation he 
discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that 
the farther the galaxy is from earth the faster it is moving away 
in honor of the astronomer sullivan carried with her into space 
an eyepiece from the 100inch telescope at californias mount 
wilson observatory that hubble used to make his pioneering 
observations 
its a great pleasure to have something of such historical 
significance and something that so directly symbolizes edwin 
hubbles fundamental contributions to astronomy she said friday 
afternoon 
once back on earth the eyepiece will be displayed at the 
observatory

a 6yearold girls arms and legs were 
amputated after a rare form of toxic shock bacteria infected 
chicken pox lesions on her body doctors said 
this is exceedingly rare said dr john bradley director of 
the division of infectious disease at childrens hospital 
he said he knew of no documented case of this strain of bacteria 
infecting children although there have been dozens of cases 
involving adults and it is fatal about 30 percent of the time 
jessica lynn esquivel was admitted to the hospital april 1 with 
what was believed to be a routine case of chicken pox but a 
toxinproducing streptococcal bacteria infected the lesions on her 
body caused by the chicken pox and spread to the other parts of her 
body 
the onset of toxic shock caused what bradley termed full 
cardiac arrest in addition to kidney liver and respiratory 
failure before infusions of penicillin began to reduce the effects 
of the bacteria 
because the illness had obstructed circulation to her limbs 
doctors severed jessicas legs at the knee and her arms at the 
elbow on april 18 bradley said wednesday 
jessica had been in critical condition after the surgery but 
was upgraded to serious this morning said hospital spokeswoman 
sharon ross 
with what we know about this toxinproducing strain of strep 
the shock that we saw here at the hospital was an extremely 
difficult one to reverse bradley said 
he said he doubted that jessicas condition could have been 
prevented because there is no vaccine for chicken pox and because 
of the rarity of the bacteria 
he said the child would not have incurred the bacteria without 
first having had the chicken pox but that streptococcus infections 
as an adjunct to chicken pox are common 
dr brad peterson who treated jessica said the girl suffered 
damage to her vital organs but they are 100 percent better now 
jessica who had been in an artificial respirator until this 
week is now able to speak peterson said the loss of her arms and 
legs have been explained to her and that a psychiatrist has been 
made available 
ms ross said a trust fund has been established to help pay for 
the childs longterm recovery 
lisa esquivel 25 said she and her husband felix 27 the 
girls parents are devastated by the turn of events 
now my daughter doesnt have hands or feet and its 
hard said felix esquivel

a synthetic molecule that converts light 
into energy almost as efficiently as the natural process of 
photosynthesis could be used to enrich soil and genetically design 
herbicideresistant crops scientists say 
the device which stores energy the way a battery would may 
even help speed up computers if someone can figure out how to 
hook up the microscopic device to wires many times its size 
thomas moore one of the 12member team from arizona state 
universitys photosynthesis research center who worked on the 
molecule said it might be able to drive chemical reactions in the 
soil such as nitrogen fixation known more commonly as 
fertilization 
crops grown in such soil would be healthier and more robust 
the researchers published the details of their work in the april 
13 issue of the journal science 
devens gust a leader of the research group said the device is 
called a pentad molecule because of its five active parts 
which are based on natural materials a previous device they built 
in 1983 consisted of three parts but was only 5 percent as 
efficient as the new one which is capable of storing 83 percent as 
much energy as natural molecules do in photosynthesis 
gust said the device does that by separating the positive and 
negatively charged parts of atoms and holding them about 
onebillionth of a centimeter apart at opposite ends of the 
ladderlike molecule 
photosynthesis is the solarpowered process by which plants 
convert nutrients and water to food 
dr mark wrighton chairman of the chemistry department at 
massachusetts institute of technology said in a telephone 
interview that efficient molecular electronic components also could 
radically increase the speed and capability of computers 
gust however said one roadblock to employing the asu molecule 
in consumer electronics is its size in relation to wires leading to 
circuits 
the traditional approach to electronics really has been a 
materials approach gust said you start out with something 
such as bulk silicon then you devise ways to make devices from 
that bulk silicon that are smaller and smaller 
using the molecularelectronics approach he said you design 
the device at the molecular level then you try to figure out ways 
to incorporate these molecularsized devices into large 
macroscopic electronic circuits 
such applications may be years away gust said but he said the 
device would be easy to apply in agriculture almost immediately 
besides its use in fertilizing soil gust said the molecule 
could be used to genetically design plants resistant to herbicides 
many of which are designed to interrupt photosynthesis 
then farmers could spray their fields with a herbicide that 
would not affect the desired plants

a dozen rockets slammed into the 
afghan capital and killed five people friday the 12th anniversary 
of the bloody coup that began communist rule in afghanistan radio 
kabul reported 
in pakistan relief officials said fundamentalist moslem clerics 
railing against western influence led about 5000 people on a 
rampage against a private aid groups facilities at a camp for 
afghan refugees 
no one was hurt in thursday nights attack at nasir bagh a 
sprawling compound near peshawar that has been home to about 60000 
refugees during the decadelong war in afghanistan the officials 
said 
but shelter now international which is financed by several 
christian organizations and delivers relief supplies to refugee 
children and widows said it sustained almost 1 million in damage 
weve been here seven years said thor armstrong director 
of shelter now its incomprehensible that this would happen 
armstrong says the trouble apparently was caused by 
fundamentalists angry over what they consider corrupting western 
influence on afghan women 
radio kabul said fridays fatal rocket attack was the second in 
as many days on the afghan capital 
the staterun broadcast blamed the latest attack on extremist 
opposition members backed by pakistan presumably referring to 
ussupported anticommunist rebels 
no group claimed responsiblity rebel fighters routinely deny 
hitting civilian targets 
radio kabul said eight people were wounded and five killed in 
the raid it said two people died and 11 people were hurt thursday 
when five rockets blasted the capital 
hundreds of people have been killed in rocket attacks on the 
afghan capital in the past several years 
the worst attack in recent weeks occurred monday when a rocket 
hit a mosque and killed 13 people another six people died that day 
when rockets slammed into other parts of the city 
moslem insurgents bankrolled by the united states pakistan 
saudi arabia and other arab states have been fighting 12 years to 
topple kabuls ruling communists 
fridays attack coincided with the 12th anniversary of a bloody 
coup that put the communists in power in afghanistan 
on april 27 1978 communist leader nur mohammad taraki 
overthrew mohammad daoud in what was called the saur revolution 
named after the moslem month in which it occurred 
within two years of the 1978 coup more than 100000 soviet 
soldiers marched into the central asian country to replace one 
communist government with another and to crush a burgeoning moslem 
insurgency 
after nine years of direct involvement moscow withdrew its 
troops from afghanistan in 1989 
rebel fighters headquartered in pakista have vowed to continue 
their fight until afghanistans president najib and his ruling 
peoples democratic party of afghanistan is overthrown 
the radio broadcast condemned the rebel fighters for the attack 
particularly during eidil fitr one of islams holiest holidays 
traditionally the saur revolution anniversary has been marked by 
pomp and ceremony military parades and speeches lauding 
communisms contributions to afghanistan 
but since the soviet withdrawal najib has toned down the 
anniversary 
the only reference to the saur revolution on radio kabuls 
broadcasts friday was a message of congratulations from soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
since withdrawing its troops moscow has sent billions of 
dollars worth of military and humanitarian assistance to kabul 
last year najib delayed the saur revolution celebrations one 
day after his governments secret police reportedly uncovered a 
plot to assassinate him 
the staterun radio broadcast did not say whether celebrations 
had been canceled friday or whether they had been delayed

three days after a mental patient took his new 
gun to a suburban mall and shot five people mayor maynard jackson 
pleaded friday with outlying counties to adopt a handgun waiting 
period similar to atlantas 
no one is trying to prohibit the use of handguns jackson 
said at a hastily called crime summit at city hall what were 
talking about is a sane and civilized system where someone whos 
insane and crazy cannot get a gun and blow somebodys brains out 
atlanta and surrounding fulton county currently require a 15day 
wait for the purchase of a handgun to allow public safety 
officials time to investigate the buyers background 
but virtually anyone can visit towns in surrounding counties to 
buy a gun with no delay since georgias local and state 
governments have traditionally been hostile to any kind of gun 
control 
about three dozen elected officials and police leaders from the 
metro area attended jacksons meeting none spoke up to oppose the 
waitingperiod proposal 
weve got to do something said mayor to smith of college 
park near atlantas southside airport its got to be at the 
state level but we can set an example 
after the meeting commissioner nate mosby of dekalb county 
where the shootings occurred said he would draft waitingperiod 
legislation 
i think the majority of the commission would be amenable to 
some kind of deterrent and the waiting period is the most 
palatable he said 
my plea is a consistent waiting period in the eight counties 
of metro atlanta thats all im asking jackson said when 
somebodys got a record as a homicidal maniac it gives us a chance 
to check 
james calvin brady identified as the gunman who killed one and 
injured four tuesday at perimeter mall had been released a day 
earlier from a state mental hospital even though a medical form he 
was still carrying listed him as homicidal after being 
released he bought the gun in suburban avondale estates 
atlanta police officials attending the summit said handgun 
applications in atlanta fell from 846 in 1985 to 197 in 1989 
presumably because purchasers bought guns elsewhere 
those attending the summit included representatives of dekalb 
clayton and fulton counties and the cities of atlanta hapeville 
alpharetta doraville mcdonough roswell smyrna east point 
mountain park fairburn palmetto chamblee and decatur 
skipping the meeting was mayor jo stephenson of kennesaw the 
cobb county town that passed a mandatory gun ownership bill several 
years ago in response to gun control initiatives elsewhere 
its ludicrous to think you can penalize lawabiding people 
when criminals and crazy people are going to try to get them guns 
any way they can he said thursday

the nations no 1 dairy state on friday 
approved a temporary ban on use of a synthetic hormone that makes 
cows give more milk 
the measure signed into law by gov tommy g thompson 
prohibits all but experimental use of bovine growth hormone in 
wisconsin until june 1 1991 
after that farmers would be able to inject their cows with the 
hormone which some consumer groups contend hasnt been adequately 
tested for potential heal affects on humans who drink milk a 
similar bill is pending in minnesota another major milkproducing 
state 
the us food and drug administration is allowing private 
companies to test the hormone on farms but has yet to approve it 
for commercial use some of the milk from test herds has reached 
the market and the fda contends that milk is safe 
in signing the ban thompson vetoed a separate stricter bill 
that measure would have banned used of the genetically engineered 
hormone until six months after the fda approved it for commercial 
use 
the republican governor said the more extensive moratorium would 
have put wisconsin dairy farmers at a disadvantage against 
competitors in states where the hormone could go into commercial 
use immediately after fda approval 
the hormone a copy of that which occurs naturally in cows is 
said to boost milk production by 10 percent to 20 percent 
under the new law the hormone can be used over the next 14 
months in wisconsin but only for experiments any milk produced by 
injected cows would have to dumped 
supporters of the hormone warned that wisconsin dairy farmers 
could be hurt if the state became an island surrounded by 
states that permitted its use 
opponents contended increased production could push milk prices 
down thus driving smaller dairy farmers out of business

oaklands 1988 nuclearfree initiative 
one of the nations broadest local bans on nuclear weaponsrelated 
activities was declared unconstitutional friday by a federal judge 
the ordinance forbids most city contracting purchases and 
investments with nuclear weapons manufacturers restricts 
transportation of nuclear material through the city and outlaws 
most nuclear weapons work in the city 
the federal governments lawsuit last september the first it 
has filed against any of the more than 160 local nuclearfree laws 
in the country said the oakland ordinance interfered with 
exclusive federal control of national defense atomic energy and 
shipments of hazardous materials 
us district judge john vukasin agreed with the governments 
arguments in a brief ruling from the bench friday earlier vukasin 
had refused to let city officials or antinuclear groups examine 
federal officials or documents to determine the extent of possible 
interference with government operations 
the oakland ordinance is so comprehensive so complete so 
allencompassing that it is invalid on its face the judge said 
it cannot help but conflict with the rights of the federal 
government 
the ruling is a potentially serious blow to a spreading campaign 
by antinuclear activists to put teeth into previously symbolic 
nuclearfree ordinances chiefly by limiting local government 
purchases and investments 
a similar measure is on the june ballot in alameda county home 
of the lawrence livermore laboratory where many of the nations 
nuclear weapons are designed 
city councilman wilson riles jr a supporter of the oakland 
ordinance predicted that most of it would be revived by a higher 
court 
a lot of the things oakland is trying to do with respect to 
protecting the health and welfare of its citizens have long 
standing in the law riles said he said ordinances imposing 
similar restrictions on south africarelated purchases and 
investments have been upheld in court 
steve bloom principal draftsman of the ordinance and 
coordinator of a group called nuclearfree california said the 
decision was the kind of ruling vukasin was appointed by former 
president ronald reagan to make not based on law but based on 
political expediency 
vukasin said he would issue a written decision later it was not 
clear whether his ruling extended to portions of the ordinance that 
do not involve the government directly such as a ban on city 
purchases of products made by companies engaged in nuclear weapons 
work 
but the governments suit argued that enforcement of the 
ordinance against its private contractors would also harm the 
national defense 
private contractors are relied on a great deal by the united 
states top carry out the national defense justice department 
lawyer richard stearns told vukasin he said any effort by the city 
to punish contractors by denying them business with the city 
would harm the government as well 
the only provisions expressly exempted from the ruling allow the 
city to limit its investments in government securities and post 
nuclearfreezone signs at its borders those provisions were 
not challenged by the government 
the oakland ordinance approved by a 57 percent vote in november 
1988 declared that all nuclear weapons work including 
production storage or classified research on nuclear weapons 
would be outlawed within two years in the city of 350000 
it also prohibited all city contracts and investments with 
nuclear weaponsmakers unless no reasonable alternatives existed 
and authorized the city council to choose the safest routes for 
shipment of radioactive material

actress marcia wallaces scheduled 
appearance at a hospital cancer program this weekend has been 
canceled because of her prochoice position on abortion

receptionist on the bob newhart show in the 1970s was 
scheduled to speak about her successful fight against breast cancer 
during a breast cancer awareness and education program 
officials at providencest margaret health center made the 
decision tuesday after the actress refused to take a no comment 
stance if the abortion issue arose said spokeswoman therese horvat 
the hospital which is antiabortion feared that ms wallace 
might talk about her abortion views if asked by the media or 
someone else attending the event ms horvat said in a statement 
thursday 
ms wallace said in a telephone interview from her los angeles 
home that she was upset with the hospitals decision because her 
views on abortion had nothing to do with her fight against cancer 
she said she had no intention of raising the abortion issue in 
her talk and had never taken a public stand it came up only when 
the hospital asked her for her views she said thursday 
i cannot imagine why the hospital thought i would bring it 
up she said i dont get the connection but i hope women 
really take advantage of the cancer awareness program

the new government on friday announced an 
economic austerity program including price increases higher 
indirect taxes and cuts in inflationlinked pay raises for public 
employees 
the moves came only hours after premier constantine mitsotakis 
and his conservative party won a vote of confidence in parliament 
the measures aimed at increasing state income by 24 billion 
this year are also expected to trigger higher inflation national 
economy minister george souflias told journalists as it was 
inflation hit 178 percent in march 
consumers will quickly feel the pinch under the program 
electricity rates will rise by 12 percent postal services by 15 
percent train tickets by 25 percent and domestic airfares by 25 
percent 
we have reached a dead end souflias said of every 100 
drachmas the state spends it has to borrow 40 this has to come to 
an end 
mitsotakis told lawmakers before the confidence vote that the 
total public debt would be 914 billion by the end of the year 
souflias said uncoupling state workers pay and inflation will 
mean a wage reduction of 6 percent in real terms but he said it 
would increase state revenue by 457 million 
companies and professionals will pay an extra 7 percent surtax 
on profits this year fuel prices will rise immediately with 
supergrade gasoline going from 2 per gallon to 268 the value 
added tax will increase as will alcohol and tobacco taxes 
the conservative new democracy party won elections on april 8 
following two inconclusive polls last year mitsotakis has placed 
the blame for the current economic woes on his socialist 
predecessors who ruled for eight years

opponents of aerial spraying against 
the medfly are angry over a state decision to ban spraying in an 
area where the endangered kangaroo rat roams 
this says to me that kangaroo rats are more important than 
humans said adelaide nimitz of burbank who heads a group called 
families opposed to chemical urban spraying 
the decision marked the second time this year the state has 
granted an exemption from the malathion spraying program that some 
people fear poses health hazards to humans 
three months ago state agricultural officials angered orange 
county residents by ordering helicopters to spray around the rev 
robert h schullers crystal cathedral in garden grove because of 
an outdoor event attended by several thousand guests that 
coincided with the spraying 
after the outcry the state pledged to stop issuing exemptions 
until the kangaroo rat matter came up 
state officials say federal law protecting endangered species 
left them no choice but to avoid spraying areas where the rat 
lives the kangaraoo rat is a small longlegged desert rodent 
known for its jumping ability 
this is a whole different thing said pat minyard deputy 
director of the medfly project in el monte theres a radical 
difference between doing something to be nice guys as in the case 
of crystal cathedral and doing something because of the law 
the exemption affects a 5squaremile area where the rats live 
within a 19squaremile medfly spraying zone near woodcrest and 
march air force base 
im just appalled to think that rats have more rights in the 
states eyes than i do or my children said garden grove 
antimalathion activist mollie haines 
malathion has been sprayed for months over a wide area of los 
angeles county recent medfly discoveries in orange san bernardino 
and riverside counties prompted officials to widen spraying zones 
mediterranean fruit flies are under attack because they threaten 
the states multibillion dollar farm economy

romanians gathered at one of the 
biggest rallies since the december revolution friday in support of 
interim president ion iliescu and in defiance of anticommunist 
protesters seeking his resignation 
iliescu is the target of a sixday roundtheclock protest by 
romanians who doubt he has really abandoned communism on friday he 
urged more than 10000 supporters to exercise tolerance of 
opposition views but attacked those who want him to step down 
they cant rebuild the country if they choose to camp out on 
the street without working he told the crowd overflowing the 
square in front of the military academy 
iliescu 60 a former communist party secretary under nicolae 
ceausescu fell from ceausescus favor after opposing the dictator 
and was given relatively minor party posts he rose to prominence 
in the revolution that toppled ceausescu who was executed 
christmas day and resulted in the disintegration of the communist 
party 
his foes accuse iliescu and others in the national salvation 
front of seeking to reestablish some form of marxist rule despite 
repeated assertions that the front embraces democracy 
the front dominates the interim government running romania until 
may 20 elections 
both iliescu and premier petre roman another former communist 
sought at the rally to emphasize their commitment to a pluralistic 
democracy and a market economy 
the president characterized the demise of communism as an 
irreversible process taking place in all the countries which were 
subjected to the socalled socialist society 
iliescu defended his opposition to rapid economic change 
saying its wellknown that we have already taken steps toward a 
market economy but a brusque change is an adventure 
we have been burned before by the automatic transplanting of 
foreign models here iliescu said clearly alluding to the 
disastrous attempt to introduce the soviet system of the early 
1950s that placed emphasis on heavy industry 
the trial of nicolae andruta ceausescu former head of the 
securitate secret police academy and brother of the dictator was 
suspended on friday until may 29 the prosecution said it needed 
time to investigate further 
the panel of three military judges held that not enough evidence 
now existed for a verdict he is charged with ordering his cadets 
to fire on demonstrators during the revolution and killing seven

police confirmed there was a bombing but refused to release 
details robertson said the package was addressed to him and 
suggested it could be related to recent attacks on a houston 
preacher and gospel singer sandi patti this could be part of a 
pattern of attacks against evangelical christians robertson said 
the package had a north carolina postmark and looked suspicious 
to station workers said frankie abourjilie a cbn spokeswoman 
security guard scott scheepers was summoned and the bomb 
exploded when he opened the package mrs abourjilie said

it appeared to be safe it wasnt heavy at all he said 
id opened it about a halfinch and it just exploded

recent attacks the explosion of a letter bomb at the church of 
the rev john osteen of houston that injured his daughter and an 
arson fire at the indiana recording studio of gospel singer sandi 
patti 
this is evidence of extreme hatred by some deranged 
individuals who want to silence the christian voice in this 
country robertson said they should realize that devices sent 
through the mail will never reach those for whom they are intended 
their victims will be innocent men and women who have devoted their 
lives to serving god 
virginia beach police spokesman lou thurston declined to give 
details about fridays bomb

participating in the investigation were officers of the federal 
bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the fbi postal 
inspectors state and city police and the city fire dpeartment

bit more sophisticated it would have killed scott 
robertson whose the 700 club tv program is seen by an 
estimated 965000 households daily said he did not plan to tighten 
security 
what we have to recognize as christians is we are in a 
spiritual battle the work we are doing is effective but dangerous

monthly death threats

osteens daughter lisa in houston she was not seriously injured

premier li peng on friday returned from a 
fourday visit to the soviet union he was chinas first head of 
government to make the trip in 26 years and helped to mend 
relations between the two communist giants

communist ideals

differences over ideology led to a split in the early 1960s and 
the two fought a brief border war in 1969

energy transport agriculture environmental protection and space 
the two sides agreed to mutually reduce armed forces on the 
4300mile border and keep troops to a minimum corresponding to 
normal goodneighborly relations

perrier returned to a third state thursday 
despite a lastminute wrangle with health authorities that took 
some of the sparkle out of the promotional blitz over the bottled 
mineral water 
perrier absent from the market since february because of a 
chemical scare was reintroduced in connecticut and new jersey on 
tuesday 
the company which has been advertising its impending return 
for some time launched a promotional campaign in new york on 
thursday that included passing out the green bottles on manhattan 
streets 
were calling it perrier day said jane lazgin a 
spokeswoman for greenwich connbased perrier group of america inc 
distribution is planned for other states in the east later this 
month and in the los angeles area by midmay said 
the company recalled its bottled water worldwide in february 
after tests showed traces of benzene a cancercausing chemical 
the company said the amounts were so small as to pose no health 
threat and said the benzene came from improper filtration of 
carbon dioxide gas added to the water 
then last week in the midst of the buildup for reintroduction 
of perrier in bottles labled nouvelle production the us 
food and drug administration refused to let the water be labled 
naturally sparkling 
that brought another round of bad press for perrier touted as a 
healthful naturally sparkling mineral water 
perrier officials went along even though they insist the 
carbonation and water both come from the spring but the carbon 
dioxide is separated and filtered before being put back in the 
water 
in new york reintroduction planned for wednesday was delayed by 
yet another disagreement with health regulators this one over salt 
content 
one of many chemical test results submitted by the company 
showed higher levels of sodium than allowed under federal standards 
for products advertising themselves as being lowsodium said 
william fagal department spokesman 
perrier already nervous about consumer questions about its 
purity said many other tests showed no problems with sodium he 
said 
the company and health department finished negotiating terms of 
the reintroduction wednesday night 
new york inspectors were still finding old bottles of perrier 
from before the recall on store shelves and also wanted to make 
sure the company had sufficient plans for retrieving them 
according to william stasiuk director of the health departments

president alfredo cristiani 
said thursday his government will resume peace talks with leftist 
rebels next week but the talks would be indirect with a united 
nations official acting as a gobetween 
he told a news conference no specific time and place have yet 
been set for direct talks but that un official alvaro de soto 
will be on hand as of may 2 to mediate 
de sotos mission will be mainly to arrange direct talks 
the contacts come under an agreement reached in geneva last 
month by cristianis conservative administration and the farabundo 
marti national liberation front guerrillas 
we believe that with the renewal this effort we are on our 
way toward initiating the process of dialogue cristiani said 
last week cristiani said his government planned to resume the 
talks may 3 in a central american capital or in caracas venezuela 
but did not go into specifics 
human rights groups estimate that 72000 people most of them 
civilians have been killed since civil war began in el salvador in 
october 1979 
attempts to initiate a dialogue by a previous christian 
democratic administration in 1984 and 1985 ended in deadlock

the tempestuous trumps are at it again 
ivana trump appalled at press coverage of a pact that allowed 
her and estranged billionaire husband donald to date thursday 
ordered her attorneys to cancel the contract 
but trumps attorneys said the contract which reportedly would 
allow her and trump to date without providing grounds for divorce 
remains in effect 
the contract drew attention earlier this week from new yorks 
tabloids which published headlines such as safe sex and 
donald and ivana playing singles games 
in a statement mrs trump said the agreement was misunderstood 
and misrepresented by the press the intent of the pact she said 
was to protect her children 
the last thing i want in the world is to start to date mrs 
trump said i love my husband men are the last thing on my mind 
and i do not want my husbands lawyers to misinterpret my going out 
socially with friends or having male employees 
mrs trump also said i cannot be hiding or reclusive for the 
rest of my life i want to go on seeing my friends and go on 
living i had hoped that this agreement would preclude any 
speculations about my friends friendships male employees 
stan lotwin trumps attorney said he doubted the cancellation 
would be challenged because as far as he was concerned the pact 
remains in force lotwin noted the april 11 contract was to be in 
effect for 60 days at which point either party could cancel 
of the dating contract lotwin said 
it was requested by her attorney it was written by her 
attorney and now because she doesnt like the public reaction 
she wants out he said

the city and state reached agreement thursday on 
a 600 million plan to clean up the citys contaminated garbage 
dumps including the worlds largest landfill fresh kills on 
staten island 
the agreement obligates the city and state to clean up landfills 
where hazardous wastes were dumped illegally mayor david dinkins 
and state environmental conservation commissioner thomas c jorling 
said at a city hall news conference 
we all know the damage that we the human species have done 
to our home dinkins said now we must begin to undo it 
the agreement includes a fiveyear 200 million cleanup at the 
3000acre 150foothigh fresh kills landfill and 400 million to 
purge four of the citys nowclosed dumps of pollutants 
under the agreement the state has withdrawn its 1989 threat to 
close the fresh kills landfill and dropped the 81 million in fines 
it had levied against the city 
the pact allows the city to operate fresh kills until 1998 as 
long as it goes ahead with cleanup operations 
the fresh kills facility handles nearly 17000 tons of solid 
waste and ash daily and is one of only two operating municipal 
landfills in the city 
it was described in 1981 by the us environmental protection 
agency as an open dump 
jorling said the agreement represents a full commitment by new 
york city to eliminate the sources of contamination from these 
major facilities and remove the environmental and public health 
threats that the landfills pose 
the agreement paves the way for the city to receive about 300 
million under the 1986 state environmental quality bond act to 
cover 75 percent of the cost of cleaning up the four closed 
landfills by 1998 
the city already has collected 30 million in settlements from 
13 corporations that generated toxic waste in a case involving 
exxon the mayors office said the city has filed claims against 
150 other companies it said were responsible for pollution 
any proceeds from the lawsuit will be used to pay for the 
cleanup operations at the four inactive landfills

it was 1971 and nikita khrushchev was three 
days dead without a mention in the soviet press 
hedrick smith in his first week as moscow bureau chief for the 
new york times went for the maninthestreet angle 
they didnt want to talk to me they ran the other way 
smith said but that was before mikhail gorbachevs glasnost opened 
soviet society 
it was different in may 1988 when smith was beginning work on 
inside gorbachevs ussr an insightful fourpart series 
starting tonight on pbs again he went for the maninthestreet 
interview 
instead of having people run the other way they gathered 
smith said some even complained about their country and even 
though they were surrounded by police no one was shouted down or 
dragged away 
to have that happening on the street and to hear the kinds of 
things people had to say was just an extraordinary change for me 
said smith a twotime pulitzer prizewinner and author of the 1976 
best seller the russians 
inside gorbachevs ussr puts a fascinating human face 
on the fundamental changes resulting from gorbachevs doctrine of 
perestroika or restructuring of soviet society 
i dont think that people in america understand the enormity 
of the change smith said were talking about people being 
jerked bodily into the 21st century from a mentality somewhere in 
the autocratic 18th or 19th century 
the four programs cover the changes in soviet politics the mass 
media the foundering economy and the recent tumultuous events in 
the ethnic republics the first episode the taste of 
democracy examines the foundations of perestroika using 
excellent archival photos and footage to track gorbachevs rise to 
power and the systemic failure of the soviet bureaucracy 
it also identifies nikita khrushchevs denunciation of josef 
stalin in 1956 as the central event of gorbachevs political 
generation and documents the soviets growing awareness of their 
power over their government and themselves 
the second installment comfortable lies bitter truths 
shows the burgeoning influence of soviet television and the 
soviets painfully relearning and rewriting their own history 
the episode elegiacally photographed by wiley foster visits 
the forests of kuropaty one of eight mass gravesites around minsk 
holding the bodies of an estimated 250000 victims of stalins 
purges it is powerful and moving 
thats one of the most horrible places i have ever been 
smith said in a small sad voice describing a forest pocked with 
thousands of declivities each marking six to a dozen bodies 
the land it looks like its got scarlet fever he said 
his voice breaking the holes everywhere theres no way a 
camera can get how many there are 
the third episode in search of perestroika shows a 
centralized economy frustrating its fledgling capitalists and its 
state factory managers who face shortages of labor raw materials 
transportation and marketing 
its in the economic domain where gorbachevs moderation most 
clearly is failing smith said 
piecemeal measures just aint going to work he said i 
really do wonder whether he has not gotten about as far as he can 
go 
the fourth installment coming apart focuses on the restive 
republics of uzbekistan azerbaijan and lithuania 
smith said he expects gorbachevs ussr in the next 
quartercentury to reflect a roller coaster of conservatism 
vying with liberal reform 
the soviet union he said has to make up for 200 years of 
history that took place in the west 
can gorbachev succeed 
in a way the answer is that he could succeed wildly in the 
next five years and disappear smith said somebody else would 
come along and youd still be asking the same questions because 
the task is so enormous

oprah winfreys brewster place which began 
as the highrated the women of brewster place miniseries of 
last year starts life anew tonight as a halfhour abc series 
alas it has an oddly tame although pleasant premiere 
filmed in chicago at harpo studios where winfrey also does her 
syndicated talk show the series is about the lives of bigcity 
blacks in 1967 it has a lot of things going for it particularly 
winfreys acting 
shes eminently believable as the lead character mattie 
michael a wise steady single woman to whom fate has dealt a few 
hard knocks but who faces life with dignity and a certain 
downhome grace 
the shows other pluses an optimistic view of life a fine 
ensemble cast and david shires sprightly lovely nowords theme 
song that verges close to bach in its rendition by the fine a 
capella group take six 
a firstrate singer and composer oscar brown jr also lurks 
in the cast as jessie the husband of the neighborhood busybody 
but the shows future episodes are going to need a bit more bite 
and true grit if the series is to make its way in this wicked 
world a world in which the new buzz phrase of networks is get 
weird as in twin peaks 
cowritten by earl hamner who did the waltons the premiere 
is a gentle lesson on the need after misfortune strikes to pick 
yourself up dust yourself off and start all over again preferably 
in a new direction 
but winfreys michael with all her strength cant bring 
herself to make such a dramatic move even when fired from her 
hairdressers job at a local beauty parlor after refusing to help 
bilk her trusting customers 
save for work as a domestic her job prospects are dim because 
of her lack of formal education and skills that could lead to say 
a secretarys job 
she has a nest egg that shes saved up in recent years but she 
cant bring herself to bet it on herself in a business venture the 
reason she was financially ruined before by her own son 
it turns out he had been arrested the charge isnt specified 
and jumped bail he left his mother who had put up her home as 
security for bail money flat broke 
when shes fired from her hairdressers job her best friend 
etta mae brenda pressley urges a big change becoming her 
partner in a local italian restaurant etta mae has a beau who will 
loan her half the money 
etta mae isnt embarrassed that her friend says shes dreaming 
damn right she snaps and you look to me like you could use 
a good dream 
the restaurant is being sold by an old decent man who blames 
age not the changing racial nature of the neighborhood for the 
slide in his business 
the neighborhoods changed he says all my customers 
they got old like me moved to miami 
there are such men to be sure but this suggestion of racial 
harmony just doesnt ring true neither does the generally sweet 
goodhearted nature of most everyone in and around this 
makebelieve brewster place 
and you know almost from the start that mattie is going to see 
the light and take a chance of course thats after other 
characters are established and she helps her widowed cousin and his 
three kids all fresh in from arkansas move into their new 
brewster place apartment 
in a way the opening show is almost a black urban counterpart 
of hamners the waltons with its emphasis on decency and 
optimism and even occasional narration by the lead charatcer 
its all well and good to revive what that rural predominantly 
whitecast cbs series represented kinder gentler television 
but a bit more realism would help brewster place too 
incidentally the show will be seen again next tuesday the day 
after that it will settle into abcs wednesday night schedule 
two tuesday showings may seem an odd way to get a wednesday 
night series going but gosh folks thats why they invented tv 
executives

many liberians cheered 10 years ago when a 
young army sergeant threw out the autocratic old order but no 
more now samuel k doe presides over a shattered economy and civil 
war is feeding tribal hatreds 
some who welcomed the coup even wish for the days before 
president doe when this west african country was dominated by a 
small elite descended from the freed american slaves who founded it 
in 1847 
at a banquet april 12 the coup anniversary doe blamed the poor 
economy and high unemployment on low world prices for liberias raw 
materials 
the president now a portly selfappointed general told the 
scores of diplomats officials and business leaders invited for 
redemption day we recall the events of the past 10 years with 
considerable pride 
applause for the speech was so feeble the master of ceremonies 
exhorted guests to raise a cheer 
a liberian muttered what we need is redemption from doe 
doe has changed army commanders five times in an effort to 
defeat rebels led by charles taylor a former aide who was accused 
of embezzlement and fired 
army soldiers have held ganta a garrison town but lost most of 
the rest of nimba county an area of 4400 square miles that juts 
east between guinea on the north and ivory coast 
since dec 24 when they invaded nimba from ivory coast 
taylors ragtag rebels have pushed south into river cess county 
southwest to grand bassa county and west to bong county 
they have halted traffic on the railroad serving an iron mine 
that normally earns half liberias foreign exchange all but two of 
the americans and britons who run the mine have left 
nimba which covers about 10 percent of the country is an area 
of dense forests highlands and mountains it produced more than 20 
percent of liberias food but at least fourfifths of its 350000 
people have fled the fighting to ivory coast guinea and other 
parts of their own country 
killing raping and looting by government soldiers have won the 
rebels hundreds of recruits what could have been a minor rebellion 
has become a major tribal conflict 
most of the refugees are of the gio and mano tribes as are many 
rebels 
members of those tribes have been army targets and rebels 
retaliate by killing civilians of does krahn tribe and the 
mandingo tribe which supports doe 
no one knows how many civilians have been killed international 
human rights organizations and aid agencies estimate soldiers have 
killed hundreds of civilians and the rebels have slain scores 
diplomats and aid workers in monrovia said rebels lined up and 
shot krahn and mandingo civilians when they captured kombo town 
in river cess county southwest of nimba refugees admitted seeing 
such reprisals 
young men have been pressed into service to strengthen the 
5000man army and criminals freed by presidential amnesty have 
been put into uniform liberian and western sources reported 
most of them fire 15 shots in training a european diplomat 
said they are a frightened illiterate superstitious bunch 
expected to put their lives on the line for 150 a day 
many desert but the government denies it 
the government will not say what the war costs but doe 
announced in january he was diverting money set aside to register 
voters for 1991 elections by redemption day many civil servants 
had not been paid for three months 
taylor the 42yearold rebel leader escaped from a jail in the 
united states in 1984 he was being held for extradition to face 
charges of embezzling 1 million 
thousands of liberians embraced the revolution when doe seized 
power april 12 1980 even though he killed ousted president 
william s tolbert and 30 other prominent americos as the 
descendants of liberias founders are called 
the 29yearold master sergeant promised equality regardless of 
tribe and an end to corruption human rights abuses nepotism and 
domination by the americos doe also pledged to return power to 
civilians 
he delivered economic collapse and brutal repression of dissent 
he held an election and won it but western diplomats say it was 
rigged 
then came the rebellion 
tribal hatred engendered by the conflict is terrifying one 
liberian said many of us are saying our only hope is to look for 
a leader among reasonably minded americos 
william gabriel kpoleh leader of the opposition liberian 
unification party said what doe has done is replace one 
privileged set of rulers with another his krahn tribe 
kpoleh was freed last month by presidential pardon after serving 
two years in jail for plotting against doe the charges were phony 
he said in an interview at the office of a friend 
security agents told the friend they will burn down his 
building if he lets me work here kpoleh said 
last month the offices of the independent daily observer in 
monrovia burned down a night watchman said four men in military 
uniforms set the fire and told him it was punishment for 
antigovernment reports 
two us government warehouses were destroyed by fire just as 
us relations with liberia reached their lowest ebb 
american aid including millions for the military used to be 
the highest per capita in subsaharan africa totaling more than 
500 million in 198085 it was cut to 10 million this year by 
congressmen who cited human rights abuses and failure to repay 
loans 
doe told reporters recently his government has faced all kinds 
of coup attempts and invasions intended to discourage potential 
investors 
businessmen say corruption is enough deterrent that liberia is 
rich in resources but doe has emulated previous administrations 
whose leaders looked after themselves 
miners from lebanon extract gold and diamonds one businessman 
said but the country gets little out of it because they pay huge 
bribes to government officials to smuggle them out 
there is little industry liberia is one of the worlds richest 
sources of rubber but imports tires 
an overvalued currency set at parity with the us dollar 
makes imports expensive grapefruit and pineapples are grown in 
liberia but restaurants offer imported canned juices at up to 5 a 
glass 
its easy to ask what a country of just 22 million people did 
with all the aid money former finance minister david m farhat 
said in an interview most of it was poured into projects that 
are completely useless 
kpoleh said does bloody method of dealing with rivals sickens 
liberians 
it began with the killings at the time of the coup since then 
more than 20 government ministers and army officers have been 
executed for allegedly plotting coups and dozens more have died in 
unexplained circumstances

thousands of refugees fleeing the 
brutality of liberian soldiers are crossing the border and 
inundating villages like gossopa 
many are filled with tribal hatred and vow to return home for 
revenge 
they killed my mother they killed my sister they killed my 
little brother a 34yearold businessman said now im 
joining the rebels and im going to kill them especially those 
krahns 
liberias president samuel k doe is of the krahn tribe 
guinean officials complain of slow international response to 
help feed a refugee population they said had doubled in april to 
more than 150000 
up to now we have received nothing but promises from the 
international community with the exception of france ireland and 
sierra leone said aboubacar fabou conde the secondranking 
government official at nzerekore a provincial capital near the 
frontier 
the world food program said emergency food approved feb 26 was 
bought locally in conakry capital of guinea and was being sent to 
the refugee area 635 miles away 
diane weather an information officer at the un agencys rome 
headquarters said poor roads along the heavily forested border 
often deteriorated into rutted tracks so transportation was 
uncertain 
she said 3640 tons of rice canned fish and oil were being sent 
and would help feed 80000 people for six months ms weather said 
the agency believed the estimate of 150000 refugees was high 
guineans expressed fear that by the time the size of the 
refugee population was recognized it would be too late to deliver 
food before a sixmonth rainy season 
the guinean government has done everything it can conde 
said our villagers have exhausted their food reserves and even 
eaten seed grain so now there is nothing to plant and the rainy 
season is upon us 
diplomats said politics also had slowed aid relief agencies had 
hoped to move food by truck from monrovia capital of liberia a 
drive of six to 10 hours over a good road 
the journey from conakry takes four or five days in the rainy 
season 
does government refused because it wants the refugees 
repatriated then the point became moot april 13 when rebels cut 
the road with an attack on ganta near the border 
the most recent refugee influx came from sanniquellie capital 
of nimba county a part of liberia that juts east between guinea 
and ivory coast the town is believed to have changed hands four 
times in the second week of april 
at nzerekore guinean officials welcomed more than a dozen 
civil administrators from sanniquellie their abandoned vehicles 
could be seen across the st johns river the border at that 
point which they crossed on foot 
gossopa nearby normally has 800 residents but was sheltering 
3500 refugees in march and 5906 in april 
fifteen of the refugees were liberian army soldiers who fled the 
fighting across the river 
we were plotting to kill those soldiers said a 20yearold 
high school student like other refugees he would not give his 
name because he feared for relatives still in liberia 
warrant officer george newray and the other soldiers denied 
allegations of brutality 
of his own retreat from the fighting he said the rebels were 
stronger than us and better armed my friend was killed beside me 
when the rebels attacked we ran out of ammunition so i decided to 
effect the army code of see survival evasion and escape 
he claimed he ran into and escaped from a white man dressed in 
an oldentime red military dress uniform like the romans and a 
gas mask who is known to help command rebels 
then he was confronted by a medicine woman at the rebel 
command post who started performing juju magic and turned into a 
snake newray said 
such stories are common one liberian in gossopa said soldiers 
believe rebels hide powder in their pants that makes them 
disappear or fly away 
refugees were openly sympathetic to the rebels who they said 
ordered all civilians into sanniquellie hospital when they took the 
town because they said they did not want us harmed in the 
fighting 
one said refugees had returned regularly for food and other 
belongings when i went the last time he said the rebels 
drove me to my house helped me pack up my belongings killed my 
hog for me and transported it to the border 
after the government announced april 14 that the army had 
retaken sanniquellie they were afraid to return the refugees said 
the soldiers steal everything food clothing and they burn 
down our homes one of them told a reporter 
refugees said villagers who remain in nimba had formed militias 
allied with the rebels to protect property from marauding troops 
the men of nimba are traditional hunters and most have shotguns

boundaries may be opening worldwide but some 
in the entertainment industry say the united states border is 
getting tougher to cross for anyone with a guitar and the ability 
to carry a tune 
theyre concerned that new visa rules will allow superstars such 
as paul mccartney to pull in millions at us concerts while 
singers who have more promise than paychecks are left trying to win 
over an audience of american immigration officials 
theres clear and away an aversion by some people to 
contemporary international music being brought into this 
country says bill kitchen of cellar door productions a major 
east coast concert promoter 
the new us immigration and naturalization service rules spell 
out tougher standards for temporary workers coming into the united 
states wouldbe visitors have to prove that american workers cant 
do the same job and artists have to show theyve gained 
recognition and made a living at their art 
french culture minister jack lang complained this month that if 
impressionist painter vincent van gogh were working today rather 
than 100 years ago he couldnt get a visa for the united states 
so far say promoters and agents it doesnt appear as if any 
fledgling beatles have been turned away at customs since the new 
rules took effect feb 26 
but they say the regulations follow tighter rules over the past 
decade that have led to some tours being canceled at the last 
minute and they fear american stages may be out of reach for 
artists who cant afford immigration lawyers to lead the way 
there is a concern about how the regulations could be 
interpreted said jeffrey gabel an immigration lawyer in new 
york who has written about the new rules for billboard magazine 
the big change is in the two categories of visas the united 
states gives to enter the country for temporary employment 
in the past most artists were given h1 visas handed out 
without much question to film directors singers and groups the 
new regulations make clear the h1 is for aliens of distinguished 
merit and ability and sustained achievement 
onehit wonders arent favored while the winner of an academy 
award or nobel prize the ins suggests should have no trouble 
getting a h1 
others are directed to the h2 which requires an application 
first to the labor department and then to the ins that can take 
from two to six months which concerns entertainers who may not be 
able to set tour plans more than a few weeks ahead of time 
were not getting into judging what they do rick kenney an 
ins spokesman said in an interview they would have to show that 
theyre going to be providing a service thats good for the united 
states 
it shouldnt hinder the royal danish ballet from touring but 
the philadelphia orchestra might have to answer a lot of questions 
if it wants to hire a third violinist from great britain 
we just make judgments of who is and who is not just a regular 
worker said kenney 
kitchen recalls that even before the new rules british folk 
rocker john wesley hardings performance at a washington club 
consisted only of an explanation to the crowd that he didnt have a 
visa to perform 
and he says a french rock group niagara canceled one date 
and got to play another only after frances cultural attache and 
sen john warner rva interceded with immigration officials who 
were unimpressed with the groups french clippings and videos 
i have yet to hear an explanation of why a band shouldnt be 
brought over said seth hurwitz owner of washingtons 930 club 
a small venue for international acts on the rise 
this takes business away from american businessmen like me 
and it deprives the american public the chance to see someone they 
want to see said hurwitz 
the ins says the new rules mean promoters are going to have to 
be better prepared no more booking garage bands from liverpool on 
friday to play in new york next wednesday 
you have to be aware that its going to take more information 
and youre going to have to file longer in advance said joel 
peresman an agent with the national talent group in new york 
unfortunately this is a big change for everybody said the 
inss kenney its going to be a change in practice for a lot of 
people and theyre going to have to get used to it and stop taking 
it personally 
as for langs comment that dutchborn van gogh who sold only 
one painting before he died in 1890 kenney says the french 
official was exaggerating 
thats just political said kenney he probably wouldnt 
get an h1 but that doesnt mean hed be denied entry he would 
apply for an h2

ual corps 26000 noncontract employees 
are being treated unfairly by the three union groups leading the 
charge for employee ownership of united airlines parent says 
chairman stephen wolf 
wolf said he agreed with daryl thorogood a united reservations 
agent from san francisco who told the companys shareholders 
thursday that the exclusion of salaried and management employees 
from buyout negotiations was rude illegal and undemocratic 
still wolf told several hundred shareholders at the annual 
meeting that the proposed 201ashare employee buyout is the best 
deal possible under the circumstances 
he also said ual plans to announce soon a large order for 
widebodied jetliners that may include the new boeing 777 
ms thorogood read a letter she said had been sent to a number 
of large banks and brokerage firms explaining the noncontract 
workers dissatisfaction with their treatment in the fashioning of 
the 438 billion buyout proposal 
at a news conference after the twohour meeting wolf declined 
to speculate on whether opposition by noncontract employees could 
scuttle the deal then added i dont think youd want them 
against it 
i cannot possibly conceive of acquiring this corporation in 
terms of 100 percent employee participation when 26000 are being 
disenfranchised wolf said 
i think its important to have them involved and have them 
involved fairly 
the noncontract employees represent about a third of uals 
71500 workers they include reservations and ticket agents 
professional and technical staff and management and supervisors 
excluding wolf and other top officers 
under the deal approved april 6 by uals board uniteds pilots 
would own 379 percent of the companys stock machinists would own 
357 percent noncontract employees would get 143 percent and 
united flight attendants 12 percent 
the union group has proposed overall employee wage and benefit 
cuts totaling 2 billion over five years to help offset buyout 
costs ms thorogood said the noncontract employees have had no 
voice in deciding how much they would give up 
responding to other shareholder questions at what could be uals 
last public stockholder meeting wolf said the employee bid is 
financeable and doable but declined to speculate on 
whether the deal will get done 
he tried to reassure skeptical stockholders that the proposed 
deal is better than the union groups initial bid which was 11 a 
share lower but included partial public ownership 
wolf also said selling all the companys stock to the employees 
was better than the alternative a threat by uals largest 
shareholder coniston partners to oust the companys directors and 
sell ual to the union group at a price that wolf said would have 
been lower than the one negotiated by the board 
coniston which owns 118 percent of uals stock didnt have 
any regard for the other 88 percent of our shareholders wolf 
said 
under the circumstances we got the highest price we possibly 
could have obtained for our shareholders and we spent a diligent 
amount of time on doing that he added 
investor skepticism about the ability of uniteds pilots flight 
attendants and machinists to borrow the 4 billion they need to 
complete their proposed buyout has contributed to a steady slide in 
uals stock price the shares closed thursday at 15250 on the new 
york stock exchange down from 16350 on april 6 the day the 
board accepted the offer 
wolf said ual plans to announce possibly by june 15 the 
largest order in aviation history for widebody aircraft he said 
the order will include some twin engine aircraft either boeing 
777s or airbus a330s and also possibly some mcdonnell douglas 
md11s wolf would not elaborate on the number or dollar value of 
the aircraft 
at the meeting shareholders reelected 13 of uals 15 directors 
to oneyear terms the two remaining directors had reached the 
mandatory retirement age of 70 and were not replaced

suppliers who helped pushed troubled ames 
department stores inc into bankruptcy welcomed the discounters 
chapter 11 filing saying it would provide the security needed to 
keep goods on store shelves 
the air has been cleared as far as where the money will come 
from said robert luehrs president of chic jeans 
ames filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy code late wednesday largely because of its 
inability to digest the zayre chain it bought two years ago the 
purchase doubled ames size and turned it overnight from a 
littleknown new englandbased chain to the nations fourthlargest 
discounter 
the bankruptcy filing will allow ames to reorganize its business 
and pay suppliers under a new credit arrangement 
in its filing ames listed a total of 144 billion in 
liabilities and 166 billion in assets 
it listed the companys biggest creditor as societe generale 
financial corp which is owed just over 14 million others listed 
among the top 20 creditors include thermos co at 52 million 
owed rubbermaid inc 45 million jp stevens 32 million 
and fisher price 29 million 
ironically it was skittishness on the part of ames suppliers 
that pushed the company to file for protection from its creditors 
several suppliers began cutting off shipments to ames last month 
after the company announced it lost an estimated 228 million in 
the fiscal year that ended jan 27 that news coupled with an 
apprehensive retail climate following the january bankruptcy filing 
by campeau corps us retailers put suppliers into a nearpanic 
its unprecedented in the history of retailing that suppliers 
cut you off like that but when you have numero uno go into 
receivership it makes people very nervous said alan 
millstein publisher of a monthly newsletter for retailers and 
manufacturers 
ames stock rebounded slightly after thursdays announcement 
closing at 162 a share on the new york stock exchange up 12 
cents ames stock had been trading at nearly 30 a share in late 
1987 but dipped to 9 a share in early january as ames troubles 
mounted after a dismal christmas season 
under the bankruptcy filing chemical bank has agreed to lend 
the ames chain 250 million with use of the money under control of 
the bankruptcy court the money will allow ames to continue 
operations and pay for merchandise shipments as it prepares it 
reorganization plan 
suppliers said the new credit arrangement offers them a measure 
of security they didnt have before the filing 
the gitano group inc a sportswear supplier that is owed 53 
million said it plans to meet with ames to talk about resuming 
shipments now that they have some assurance of payment gitano 
stopped shipments about four weeks ago 
analysts were unanimous in blaming ames downward spiral on its 
788 million acquisition of the 392store zayre chain in october 
1988 
this had to happen said howard davidowitz chairman of a 
new yorkbased retail financial consulting firm they took on a 
company that had been sinking and the sinking just accelerated 
they couldnt save themselves 
the zayre stores had been known for frequent promotions heavy 
advertising and discounted fashion items ames in contrast stocks 
more traditional merchandise and runs fewer promotions 
ames has since closed 90 zayre stores and converted others to 
the ames name 
further the companys attempts to quickly merge ames and zayre 
computer systems resulted in some glitches that delayed payments to 
suppliers which led some suppliers to cut off the chains credit 
douglas ewing ames vice president for investor relations said 
a dismal christmas season at zayre stores after a disappointing 
year pushed ames over the edge 
i think the fourthquarter results coupled with the sales 
shortfall overall did it for us ewing said 
ewing said ames will continue normal operations while it works 
out a payment plan with its creditors he said the chain has no 
immediate plan to cut staff or close additional stores but would 
not speculate on what will happen under the restructuring 
founded in 1958 ames operates more than 600 stores in 20 states 
and has about 55000 employees

michael milkens guilty plea may have settled 
criminal charges but his days as a target of civil litigation are 
only beginning 
lawyers said thursday about a dozen classaction lawsuits 
already have been filed against the former junk bond financier on 
top of some 30 still pending over his relationship with exstock 
speculator ivan boesky more lawsuits are planned 
the investors suing milken claim a 400 million fund established 
as part of his plea bargain to compensate defrauded investors wont 
be enough 
but it could be years before investors ever see a penny 
attorneys first must sort through millions of documents to build 
their cases and milkens defense lawyers promise to take the 
claims to trial if necessary 
proceedings already have been delayed in the boeskyrelated 
lawsuits because prosecutors have prevented witnesses such as 
milken and boesky from testifying while criminal cases were pending 
lawsuits already have been filed in new york phoenix san diego 
and elsewhere alleging that milken defrauded investors in 
connection with hostile takeovers the junk bond market and the 
nations troubled savings and loans 
the plaintiffs bar is drawn to something like this like bees 
to honey were not surprised said milken attorney steven b 
rosenfeld 
most of the litigation out there is totally totally unrelated 
not only to anything he pleaded guilty to but anything the 
government ever investigated him for he said 
milken the former head of junk bonds for drexel burnham lambert 
inc pleaded guilty tuesday to six tax and securities fraud 
charges and agreed to pay 600 million to settle his fouryearlong 
battle with the government 
under the plea milken will put 400 million in a fund to be 
administered by the securities and exchange commission for 
investors who can prove they were swindled by milkens actions 
the fund is not restricted to the limited transactions and 
transgressions in the plea bargain any civil claim against milken 
has a right to part of the money in structuring the plea milkens 
lawyers tried to limit his potential exposure to civil litigation 
you could spend the next 10 years investigating milken on 
these things said daniel berger of the philadelphia law firm 
berger amp montague which is involved in milken litigation the 
stuff he was indicted on was peripheral that doesnt mean there 
isnt other stuff 
bergers firm doesnt believe the fund will be large enough if 
the money runs out milken is personally liable for civil claims 
milken attorney arthur liman said in court he believes 400 million 
will be plenty 
one lawsuit filed last month on behalf of unocal corp 
shareholders accuses milken drexel and about 100 other defendants 
of a sweeping conspiracy to rig the financial markets in major 
takeover deals of the 1980s 
the sprawling claims unocal was a takeover target in 1985 
portray milken as mastermind of a racketeering enterprise that 
engaged in stock manipulation insider trading stock parking and 
other felonious activity 
it names takeover strategists including t boone pickens jr 
carl icahn and saul steinberg boesky and his cronies dozens of 
former drexel employees other convicted wall street figures such 
as stockbroker boyd jefferies and gaf corp executive james 
sherwin even milkens wife lori 
the lawsuit seeks 23 billion in tripled damages under the 
racketeering law said rosenfeld its a bunch of nonsense 
two shareholder lawsuits involving columbia savings amp loan 
association and lincoln savings amp loan association recently added 
milken as a defendant the thrifts which lost hundreds of millions 
of dollars had large junk bond holdings acquired through drexel 
another lawsuit filed on behalf of an estimated 10000 junk bond 
holders claims milken rigged securities prices by controlling a 
daisy chain of buyers and sellers drexel lawyers claim that 
suit is invalid because the main plaintiff lacks legal standing 
a lot of things are in the works said attorney r bruce 
mcnew of the philadelphia firm greenfield amp chimicles which 
specializes in shareholder actions 
similar funds were set up in other wall street fraud cases 50 
million for boesky about 20 million for investment bankers dennis 
levine and martin siegel and 350 million for drexel but 150 
million of the drexel fund which also could be used for milken 
plaintiffs is tied up in bankruptcy court 
the 30 lawsuits involving boeskys dealings are consolidated 
before us district judge milton pollack who also will handle the 
milken civil litigation 
no money yet has been paid out from the boesky fund which was 
created more than three years ago

worries about the quality of real estate and 
takeover loans reached the nations largest bank as citicorp had 
its credit rating lowered by a major rating agency 
standard amp poors corp on thursday downgraded about 30 billion 
in credit of citicorp 
the move comes one week after citicorp reported a 56 percent 
drop in firstquarter earnings in large part because of domestic 
real estate loan difficulties in slumping regions that are expected 
to worsen this year 
citicorp said it was dissapointed by the move 
we are confident that the strength of citicorps core 
businesses and wellpositioned global franchises will continue to 
provide excellent returns and growth it said in a statement 
standard amp poors said it was lowering key credit ratings 
because citicorps aggressive capital philosophy leaves it 
diminished flexibility to face increased risks in the general 
business environment 
sampp said citicorp has successfully resolved most of its problems 
related to loans to developing countries but is in a weakened 
condition to deal with problems loans for real estate and 
leveraged buyouts 
sampp also said citicorps capital levels are low especially 
considering the banks relatively low reserves to guard against 
failed loans 
a number of major banking institutions have seen their debt 
ratings downgraded recently by sampp and moodys investors service 
the two major credit rating agencies due to similar problems 
but the downgrade to doubleaminus from doublea on the 
banks senior debt is noteworthy because of citicorps size 
prestige and credit rating which is higher than many banking 
institutions moodys last week said it was considering a downgrade 
for citicorp 
a lower credit rating could make it more expensive for citicorp 
to borrow money by prompting investors to demand higher interest to 
compensate for increased risk the ratings have no effect on 
customer deposits 
robert albertson a banking analyst with goldman sachs amp co 
criticized the downgrade as unnecessary 
i think its two rating agencies trying to be more bearish 
than the regulators and i think its a mistake he said 
everybodys trying to sound tougher and be tougher in an 
environment thats uncertain 
albertson said he believes citicorp in the past has accurately 
forecast its losses and that if regulators had problems with the 
banks exposure to commercial real estate loans they would have 
said so by now 
analysts said 7 percent of citicorps outstanding real estate 
loans excluding residential mortgages were nonperforming in 1989 
about in line with other banks but the amount of nonperforming 
loans on which payments are not being made are expected to 
increase 
about 5 percent of citicorps highly leveraged transactions were 
nonperforming fifth worst in a survey by icba inc a credit 
rating agency citicorp has 78 billion in highly leveraged loans 
outstanding about twice as much as the next biggest bank 
sampp said citicorp has withstood problems in its portfolio of 
loans to developing countries the bank charged 135 million 
against earnings for loans to developing countries in the first 
quarter including 56 million of real estate loans mostly in 
north america 
about half of a 548 million quarterly increase in loans not 
paying interest reflected loans to highly leveraged companies 
involved in takeovers or refinancings 
citicorp allocated 570 million in the first quarter for loan 
losses a 212 million increase over the previous year citicorp 
had 13 billion in nonperforming us real estate loans up 119 
million from a year earlier 
sampp said that citicorp despite the downgrade has advantages 
over other banks because of its diversification strong consumer 
businesses such as credit cards and varied forms of corporate 
banking

from suppliers to the aerospace giant 
northrop the defense industry will feel the pinch of the 
pentagons plan to slash production of the b2 stealth bomber 
nearly in half 
it would mean that we would not recognize the buildup and 
growth we had anticipated when we set out to do this john 
kvasnosky spokesman for boeing military airplanes said thursday 
he spoke after defense secretary dick cheney outlined to 
congress proposed cuts aimed at saving 348 billion through 1997 
the savings would be achieved partly by purchasing 75 b2 stealth 
bombers instead of 132 and delaying the start of production of 
advanced tactical fighters 
with 10000 people working on the b2 project in the seattle 
area the boeing co is one of the largest contractors for the 
stealth built by los angelesbased northrop 
northrop employs 12000 people on the b2 project including 
about 1700 who work on assembling the radarevading bomber in 
palmdale calif 
stealth bomber subcontractors and suppliers across the nation 
employ 30000 to 40000 workers said tony cantafio a northrop 
spokesman 
production of five b2s was proposed in the fiscal 1991 budget 
at a cost of 55 billion under the new plan only two jets would 
be built that year 
the immediate effect may be felt by suppliers and 
subcontractors around the country said cantafio 
from an employment standpoint at northrop there wont be an 
immediate effect 
northrop still will need to hire several hundred more workers 
for the palmdale plant because of prior orders cantafio said 
however cheneys proposal would halve production in peak years to 
12 from 24 aircraft 
obviously in the long run we wont build up our employment to 
the original schedule cantafio said 
just last sunday the company ran fullpage newspaper 
advertisements for a b2 job fair using a photograph of the 
ominouslooking flying wing and an appeal to many types of 
aerospace workers to help make history 
northrop has also been running television ads focusing on 
employees talking about their work and featuring famed test pilot 
chuck yeager 
building fewer stealth bombers would reduce the programs 
projected cost from 754 billion to 611 billion but would raise 
the cost of individual planes to more than 800 million according 
to cheney 
northrop also is competing for a role in a new generation 
aircraft known as the advanced tactical fighter which will replace 
the air forces f15 
cheney still wants 750 planes built but would push back 
purchases two years from 1994 to 1996 
the northrop spokesman characterized the impact of that change 
as minimal because the aircraft is not yet in fullscale 
development

the top two executives of marshall field amp co 
announced their resignations one day after dayton hudson corp said 
it would consolidate fields corporate headquarters with its own in 
minneapolis 
field chairman philip b miller and president burnett w donoho 
will resign when minneapolisbased dayton hudsons 104 billion 
buyout is complete miller said thursday 
a week ago dayton hudson beat out several suitors including a 
group of managers led by miller in a bidding war for marshall 
fields 
i was terribly disappointed that our bid wasnt successful 
miller said we couldnt have reached that price level with our 
partnership group one of the ways dayton hudson got to their 
number was their plan to consolidate which we couldnt do 
dayton hudson expects to complete the deal within two months 
bat industries plc of britain put the 24store chain up for sale 
last year as part of its restructuring to fight a takeover attempt 
by corporate raider sir james goldsmith goldsmith dropped his 
takeover effort monday 
in a letter wednesday to marshall fields employees dayton 
hudson said it will offer jobs in chicago and minneapolis to some 
central office employees a marshall field regional organization 
focused on customer service and community involvement will be 
based in chicago the letter said 
of the 1700 corporate employees 350 to 400 are in the 
merchandise group including buyers and managers remaining jobs 
are largely administrative and operational 
miller said he believes the consolidation will result in the 
loss of about 1450 jobs in fields central organization 
we will know by the time of the closing at the end of may or 
the first few days of june how many people will be let go said 
ann barkelew a spokeswoman for dayton hudson 
she also said the company tried to work with miller to see if it 
had anything that interested him 
to say anything more would not be appropriate because he has 
made his decision she said from minneapolis adding the company 
has no idea who will replace miller 
miller said he had discussions with dayton hudson about staying 
with the company but it became apparent to him it was time to move 
on 
under the consolidation plan the responsibilities are so 
changed i dont feel i can be effective he said during a news 
conference 
i dont have any plans right now this has come about very 
quickly 
miller won wide credit for making marshall fields an attractive 
target he came to the chain in 1983 from dallasbased 
neimanmarcus where he was president 
his retailing history also included stints as merchandise 
manager of filenes in boston vice president and general manager 
of wallachs in new york vice president and general merchandise 
manager of bloomingdales and president of lord amp taylor both of 
new york 
donoho joined fields in 1984 from gimbels midwest at the

hundreds of brands of insect repellents 
including some types of off and cutters are being withdrawn from 
stores because a longused ingredient to repel biting flies gave 
tumors to lab rats and withered their ovaries 
the ingredients manufacturer mclaughlin gormley king co of 
minneapolis gave the government test information disclosing the 
problem and asked that its license to produce and sell it be 
withdrawn said albert heier a spokesman for the environmental 
protection agency 
the company has voluntarily canceled their registration on 
this product and informed all the users heier said thursday 
they did the responsible thing 
some 200 brands of insect repellent including deep woods off 
and cutters use the ingredient 
2345bis2butylenetetrahydro2furaldehyde as an additive to 
repel flies that bite heier said 
two of the major users of the additive are sc johnson and son 
co of racine wis which makes off and miles co of chicago 
producer of cutters heier said 
both companies began notifying retailers a couple of weeks ago 
to take the products containing the ingredient off their shelves 
in both cases the withdrawal affects only a portion of the product 
line and does not include every insect repellent the companies 
make 
sc johnson publicly announced its withdrawal of off earlier 
this month but cutters said nothing in public although it did 
notify retailers 
about 25 percent of all insect repellents on the market use the 
additive known industrially as r11 although that name does not 
appear on the label of any consumer product the labels instead 
carry the long technical name heier said 
the manufacturers test results showed that the additive caused 
adverse reproductive effects ovarian atrophy and oncogenicity 
or tumors in laboratory rats and mice the epa spokesman said 
these are the preliminary results the studies arent 
completed he said 
the government has done no independent testing of the additive 
it requires pesticide manufacturers to conduct safety tests and 
does not know how dangerous it may be the ingredient has been used 
for 35 years 
we just dont have enough data to do a risk assessment 
heier said we have no evidence that it hurt anybody 
in the case of deep woods off the withdrawal affects about 
150000 cases of aerosol and pump containers and boxes of 
towelettes the company said in its public announcement nearly 
three weeks ago 
cutters however did not make a public announcement and 
instead quietly informed retailers to take products from their 
shelves said spokeswoman dionn tron 
because there was no safety reason for doing this it was 
simply a precautionary measure on our part there was no public 
announcement she said 
the voluntary recall involved several products carrying the 
cutters name ms tron said three cutters products did not 
contain the ingredient in question the tick repellent the maximum 
strength formula and the stick repellent 
the recalled products are being replaced with new ones carrying 
a yellow sticker saying it is a new formula the spokeswoman said 
sixtyfive other companies also produce repellents using r11 
under a variety of brand names 
among those are pet products including some flea and tick 
repellents marketed under the adams or mycodex brand names said 
linda kriesman a spokeswoman for smithkline beecham co 
the products have been reformulated and those new formulas 
either have been approved already by the government or are awaiting 
approval she said 
people with repellents containing r11 who want to throw it away 
should handle its disposal as they would any pesticide in 
accordance with local ordinances heier said 
ms tron said people with cutters products containing r11 can 
contact the company which will send a mailer to dispose of it 
however she said there was no need to get rid of the repellent 
people who have the stuff can continue to use it she said

a religious group has ended a ninemonth 
boycott of clorox co products citing a marked reduction in the 
companys sponsorship of sex violence profanity and 
antichristian stereotyping on television 
but the boycott was a success in both dropping the sales of 
clorox products and in encouraging clorox to enforce their 
advertising policy said billy melvin executive director of 
national association of evangelicals and chairman of the group 
known as christian leaders for responsible television or cleartv 
without disclosing whether the boycott cut into sales clorox 
communications director fred reicher said certainly we are 
gratified the boycott has been lifted the boycott made us aware 
that implementation of our standards were flawed and we tightened 
those 
cleartv describes itself as a coalition of 1600 christian 
leaders with constituencies totaling 60 million people 
the rev donald e wildmon a united methodist preacher who 
founded the group and serves as its executive director said the 
organization would continue a oneyear boycott of products made by 
the mennen co also accused of sponsoring what the group sees as 
objectionable television programming 
when the boycotts were announced nine months ago cleartv said 
it had found the two manufacturers had placed advertisements on 
offensive television programs from april 27 through may 24 a 
sweeps period during which the popularity of network 
programming is gauged 
programs considered particularly offensive during that period 
both carrying advertising by the targeted companies included 
nbctvs miami vice and dream street melvin had said 
cleartv said it found a reduction of almost twothirds in the 
amount of sex violence and profanity sponsored by clorox last fall 
as compared with last spring 
the group said it had been approached by clorox officials in 
february noting that standards had been tightened and requesting 
that the boycott be lifted 
clorox whose products include bleach act laundry detergent 
formula 409 cleaner and lucite paint ranked 66th among the leading 
national advertising spenders at 148 million in 1988 according to 
the trade publication advertising age

a giant oil company is offering 700 to 
motorists who are looking to unload their old clunkers and would 
like to help reduce smog in the los angeles area 
we want to take the heaviest polluters off the road and hand 
them over to a scrap yard which will shred and recycle the 
metal unocal corp chairman richard j stegemeier said thursday 
unocal executives said pre1971 vehicles pollute 15 to 30 times 
more than 1990 models although air quality officials dont 
consider buyback programs for old cars the most effective way to 
reduce pollution 
there are 410000 pre1971 cars registered in the los angeles 
area unocal said it would pay 700 for the first 7000 cars turned 
in 
we want to demonstrate ways of reducing smog that are 
efficient and costeffective stegemeier said the program is 
scheduled to begin june 1 
another voluntary program to take effect in july offers free 
smog checks and emission control tuneups for pre1975 cars at 
participating unocal 76 service stations 
such tuneups could remove 17 million pounds of carbon monoxide 
nitrogen oxides and reactive organic gases from the los angeles 
basin which has the worst air quality problem in the nation 
unocal said 
a buyback program was suggested last year to regional smog 
control officials by the claremont institute a conservative 
nonprofit think tank 
the institute suggested paying about 1500 apiece to remove 
850000 pre1980 vehicles from the region at a cost of 13 
billion said lucas morel a research associate at the institute 
while unusual in its approach unocals announcement was hardly 
unique 
theyre all becoming environmentally proactive said 
kenneth b funsten an oil industry analyst 
funsten attributed the trend largely to exxon corps handling 
of the alaska oil spill which has hardened political opposition to 
oil industry operations 
tom eichhorn a spokesman for the south coast air quality 
management district said estimates of pollution eliminated by 
vehicle buyback programs are questionable because old cars are 
less reliable and probably driven less than newer cars 
in addition agency officials estimate that most old cars will 
stop running in a few years anyway which doesnt really help the 
region attain federal clean air standards by 2007 as required by 
congress

the us economy which ended last year on a 
weak note rebounded during the first quarter of 1990 at a 
surprisingly healthy annual rate of 21 percent the government 
said today 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
total output of goods and services grew nearly twice as fast as 
the feeble 11 percent gain from october through december 
but the faster growth was accompanied by a worrisome pickup in 
inflation as a price gauge tied to the gnp jumped at an annual rate 
of 65 percent up from the 45 percent rate for last year and the 
biggest gain since a 77 percent advance in the fourth quarter of 
1981 
j antonio villamil commerce department chief economist said 
the weather contributed to both the economys strength and the 
price hike and that inflation would moderate over the rest of the 
year 
excluding the weather factor and a federal pay raise that went 
into effect in january inflation rose only 52 percent he said 
despite the larger price rise the first quarter still had 
encouraging developments signs of the economys resilience he 
told a news conference noting that the 21 percent gnp growth was 
close to the administrations forecast last january of 22 percent 
while the bush administration is counting on a growing economy 
this year to help close the federal budget gap many private 
analysts are pessimistic about whether the firstquarter rate can 
be sustained 
these analysts believe the firstquarter gnp strength resulted 
from special onetime factors and many fear the federal reserve 
could slow it further by increasing interest rates to curb 
inflation 
in fact for the entire year the consensus forecast is for a 
meager gnp growth of just 19 percent far below the 3 percent 
increase of 1989 and a halfpercentage point below the 
administrations 24 percent forecast 
still the first quarter performance was a far cry from most 
forecasts when the year began 
at that time many economists forecast gnp growth in the first 
quarter would be little improved from the fourth quarter rate the 
slowest in three years some even said the economic recovery now 
in its eighth year was in danger of toppling into a recession 
the unexpected strength in the first quarter was credited in 
part to the unusually warm weather during the quarter which 
boosted building construction and helped to hold down americas 
demand for foreign oil 
but the weather also was partly responsible for the jump in 
inflation 
december was the fourth coldest on record destroying fruits and 
vegetables and driving up prices in the following months the 
frigid temperatures also resulted in higher fuel costs as dealers 
sought to replenish their stocks 
the gnps 21 percent advance was the fastest since a 30 
percent gain in the third quarter last year the various changes 
left the gnp after adjusting for inflation growing at an annual 
rate of 4196 trillion in the

the senate agriculture committee voted today 
to set a national standard for organically grown food 
the regulations requiring farmers to follow specific methods in 
order to label their products organically produced will be part 
of the 1990 farm bill that the full senate will vote on later this 
year 
this legislation sets one tough national standard for organic 
foods said sen patrick leahy dvt chairman of the 
agriculture committee 
he said the label will mean that the food has been grown without 
substances known to be harmful to human health or to cause 
environmental pollution 
a march 1990 harris poll showed for the second year in a row 
that more than four out of five americans want organic fruits and 
vegetables and over half are willing to pay more for them he 
said consumers who want organic food should get what they pay 
for 
leahy said current farm programs encourage chemicalintensive 
agriculture by discouraging crop rotation and limiting diversity 
this legislation will help american farmers learn to use fewer 
synthetic pesticides and fertilizers he said 
the bill that will be incorporated into legislation setting 
federal farm policies for the next five years was passed 
unanimously by the senate committee 
the bill requires 
minimum standards for the label organically produced 
periodic onsite inspections and residue testing 
an accreditation program for state officials and private 
individuals who certify farms and foodhandling operations 
a second label indicating the state of origin of the product 
establishment of a national organic promotion advisory 
committee to gain insight and advice from the organic farming 
sector of the agriculture industry to help develop legislation on 
organic promotion research and education 
the house which is also working on the 1990 farm bill has not 
passed any similar legislation yet

earnings for the nations big three automakers 
are expected to take another doubledigit dive reflecting 
production slashes and economic problems in south america analysts 
say 
firstquarter profits for general motors corp ford motor co 
and chrysler corp are expected to be less than a third of last 
years levels auto analysts said thursday the companies will 
report their quarterly earnings next week 
the pricing environment was extremely weak and there wasnt a 
lot of production in the first quarter said john kirnan of 
kidder peabody amp co of new york 
during the januarymarch period this year automakers cut 
production and laid on incentives in an effort to deflate 
ballooning newcar inventories the inventories were brought back 
to more manageable levels which was good for the companies but 
the moves apparently clobbered firstquarter earnings 
a spot check of analysts showed forecasts that gms quarterly 
earnings would be down about 70 percent from the 155 billion 
earned during the first three months of last year when gm had its 
best quarter since the second quarter of 1984 
fords earnings should be down about 75 percent from the 164 
billion the company earned in last years period chrysler corp 
may show a marginal profit if any compared with the 351 million 
in profits it posted last year the analysts said 
the earnings are going to be almost a yawn kirnan said 
people have been bracing for the weakened earnings report the 
bigger question is when we are going to get the turn 
auto company executives and other analysts have predicted that 
the first half of the year would be tough and that things would 
pick up in the second half 
in the second quarter earnings will still be below last year 
but the comparisons wont be as bad as the first quarter said 
david healy of barclaysbzw of new york 
a secondhalf rebound may be delayed though kirnan said 
the and truck sales numbers have certainly gotten back into a 
sluggish territory and with interest rates continuing to escalate 
it may choke off a major turn in secondquarter and secondhalf 
earnings of these companies he said 
chrysler which has relied heavily on incentives to sell its 
cars and trucks had an aggressive incentive program for its 
popular minivans during january that pumped up sales but incentive 
costs come directly out of profits and the no 3 automaker doesnt 
have overseas operations to prop up any sag in north american 
operations 
during the past year or so gm and ford relied on their overseas 
businesses especially in europe and south america to help 
maintain profit levels for the entire corporation that reliance 
may be ending 
a lot of people got surprised by the extent of the damage in 
brazil said analyst mary anne sudol of fitch investors service 
inc in new york everything is at a standstill in brazil 
in march the new brazilian government froze 80 percent of the 
nations savings sharply curtailing economic activity on march 
26 ford and the west german automaker volkswagen ag shut down 
production at autolatina joint venture in brazil and put 2800 
employees on a paid leave 
ford spokesman rex greenslade said thursday those workers would 
be recalled next wednesday 
ford in a recent filing with the securities and exchange 
commission said if current conditions continued in brazil there 
was a potential for a substantial negative effect on the companys 
earnings 
greenslade declined to comment on whether the employee recall 
meant that ford has more confidence in the brazilian economic 
situation

wang laboratories inc said friday it lost 1466 
million in its most recent quarter in part due to a number of 
significant onetime charges including one related to the sale of 
its international leasefinancing operations 
the loss which came to 89 cents a share was double the loss of 
the same period a year earlier when wang reported a deficit of 
637 million or 39 cents a share 
the office computer company said its revenue dropped to 5831 
million in the three months ended march 31 which is wangs third 
fiscal quarter from 7214 million for the same quarter of 1989 
a significant portion of our thirdquarter loss is the direct 
result of onetime charges associated with our highly successful 
program to sell nonstrategic assets and the ongoing fundamental 
reordering of wangs business operations richard w miller 
wangs chairman and chief executive said in a statement 
miller said the lowellbased companys debtreduction plan would 
have a positive effect in the future by eliminating about 55 
million in annual interest payments which accounted for 159 
million of wangs fiscal thirdquarter loss 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year wang reported a 
net loss of 2192 million or 133 a share compared with a loss 
of 496 million or 33 cents a share for the same period a year 
earlier 
since august 1989 our aggressive actions to sell 
nonstrategic assets and our consolidation programs have enabled 
wang laboratories to cut operating expenses by more than 300 
million annually miller said 
with future asset sales anticipated wang hopes to eliminate 
completely its bankgroup debt and associated future interest 
payments while strengthening its cash reserves 
wang said friday it completed the sale of its international 
leasefinancing operations to ge capital corp a division of 
general electric co for about 240 million the company said it 
expected to record a book loss of about 19 million on the sale 
which was recorded in wangs thirdquarter results 
officials said 215 of the proceeds from the sale will be used 
to reduce the companys bank debt to about 90 million the 
remaining 25 million will be used to increase the companys cash 
reserves officials said 
wangs bank debt had totaled about 575 million last august

for up to one year from the date of layoff the company also will 
offer jobfinding assistance

an increasing number of service workers 
wont have adequate retirement income promised by the 1965 older 
americans act a florida state university professor reported friday 
a study cowritten by associate sociology professor melissa a 
hardy said service workers are less likely to retire and more 
likely to leave the work force through disability or death than 
those in most other career fields 
the study suggests that retirement among service workers is an 
option that is financially unavailable or unattractive hardy 
said it indicates that as the service sector grows fewer 
americans will be able to retire early enough to enjoy their 
retirement years 
mark d hayward a professor of sociology at the university of 
southern california and william r grady a researcher at battelle 
memorial institute in seattle cowrote the study 
service jobs include such occupations as waitress porter 
bartender janitor cab driver and kitchen worker 
clearly workers with different occupational histories do not 
have equal access to adequate retirement income promised by the 
older americans act because inequalities are built into the 
system hardy said 
the 25yearold law a major piece of president lyndon johnsons 
great society program says americans should have equal 
opportunity to the full and free enjoyment of retirement in 
health honor and dignity 
but the study found only 67 percent of service workers 
nationwide leave the job for conventional retirement the rate was 
higher for managers craftsmen factory workers clerical help 
farm laborers and general laborers 
one reason fewer service workers retire is because pension 
systems tend not to be in place in service industries as they have 
traditionally been in manufacturing industries hardy said and 
theyre often lowwage jobs so the probability of service workers 
accumulating savings and investments is much reduced as well 
the result is that more service workers stay on the job until 
they become disabled or die compared to other occupations she 
said according to the study which tracked 2816 men from age 55 
through retirement 9 percent of all service workers leave work 
because of disability 
only farmers at 10 percent leave at a higher rate the study 
noted and only professionals are more likely to die on the job 
than service workers among professionals 15 percent died while 
still working as opposed to 13 percent of service workers 
professionals traditionally stay on the job longer than others 
because they enjoy the challenge have more control over their work 
and sometimes find it harder to maintain their lifestyles on 
pensions she said about 11 percent of the service workers were 
still employed at the end of the study period

lockheed corp said today it would lay 
off 2750 workers in its planebuilding division including about 
2000 of them in southern california 
the job cuts which had been expected were the second big round 
of aerospace layoffs in as many days to hit the region mcdonnell 
douglas corp said wednesday it will eliminate 3000 jobs at its 
long beachbased douglas aircraft unit this summer to reduce the 
costs of jet aircraft production at the moneylosing division 
in yet another indication of hard times for the defense 
industry general electric co said today it will eliminate about 
4200 jobs over the next two years at ge aerospace locations in new 
york and new jersey the cuts are part of efforts to make gms 
aerospace defense businesses leaner so the company can compete 
despite a shrinking market and increased competition 
james ragsdale a spokesman for lockheeds aeronautical systems 
co in burbank said the other 750 employees who will lose their 
jobs are based in marietta ga where lockheed had built the huge 
c5 cargo plane 
the c5 is just one of four lockheed military planes whose 
production had ended recently or is to end soon the others are the 
p3 subhunter the tr1 highaltitude reconnaissance plane and 
the f117a stealth fighter 
it is unlikely we will have any large new military aircraft 
production project that will begin before the mid1990s ken 
cannestra the president of the aeronautics unit said in a 
statement 
lockheed the nations sixthbiggest military contractor saw 
its profits fall from 624 million in 1988 to just 2 million last 
year one big reason was that the company underestimated by 
hundreds of millions of dollars the costs of developing a new 
warplane the p7 a replacement for the p3 
as of april 1 lockheeds aeronautical division had 10124 
workers in georgia and 12752 in southern california employment in 
the division peaked in mid1988 about 9000 workers already had 
been laid off 
douglas aircraft hasnt managed any profit recently in its 
firstquarter report last week st louisbased mcdonnell douglas 
said the quarterly operating loss at douglas was 84 million 
douglas is home to the md80 jetliner and where the md11 
jetliner and c17 cargo plane are being developed employment rose 
from about 15000 in 1984 to 50000 as orders for the twinengine 
md80 surged and the other planes were brought along but the 
losses forced the elimination of 3000 of those jobs about 6 
percent the company said 
the bottom line is weve got to reduce costs because the 
performance has not been up to expectations said spokesman john 
thom 
thom said the cuts had been under discussion for some time and 
were not a reaction to thursdays proposal by defense secretary 
dick cheney to buy 120 of the c17 longrange transport planes 
instead of the 210 originally planned cheney projects that such 
cuts would save 119 billion over the life of the program

dave lyons remembers the glory days in 
odessa texas when the oil boom brought roustabouts and rig 
workers to west texas and the circulation of his newspaper the 
odessa american shot skyward 
they were bluecollar workers but they were sophisticated 
he said they were world traveled some of them had served 
overseas in saudi arabia or libya 
they were people who read newspapers 
now many of the oil people are gone and like other texas 
papers the odessa american is struggling back from a precipitous 
tumble in readership and advertising 
texas papers are not alone odessas story was typical of tales 
of woe told this week at the american newspaper publishers 
associations 104th convention a gathering that annually takes the 
pulse of the us newspaper industry 
this year the pulse was slower than ever and the prognosis for 
the patients future was anybodys guess was the problem a 
recurring depression or something more life threatening a 
transfusion of advertising would help all agreed a healthier 
readership was advised 
the odessa american a member of the freedom newspapers group 
with a circulation of 38000 is bouncing back lyons said due to 
aggressive changes those include conversion from an afternoon to a 
morning paper and a heavy focus on local sports to attract 
notoriously indifferent younger readers 
since 1986 weve lost about 20 percent of circulation 
lyons said but that was because we lost population our home 
county had a population of 144000 before the oil bust now the 
population is 116000 
these days every time i see an obituary for a person over 50 
i think oh no there goes another subscriber lyons said 
advertising the life blood of newspapers has been draining 
away at an alarming rate all over the country in the worst slump 
since the 1970s advertising was down 28 percent in 1989 from a 
year earlier according to leading national advertisers a firm 
that tracks newspaper ad revenue 
in the first quarter of 1990 even the normally robust times 
mirror co reported a 33 percent fall in net income the drop was 
blamed on a soft ad market particularly for the companys east 
coast newspapers 
times mirrors flagship paper the los angeles times announced 
a dramatic circulation climb of 95 percent to an alltime high of 
1225189 daily buoyed by readers from the los angeles herald 
examiner which folded in november but the times advertising 
revenue was down about 2 percent 
ironically the financial news that fills newspaper business 
pages has had a boomerang effect striking the messengers in the 
pocketbook acquisitions mergers store closures and a falling 
real estate market mean decreased advertising 
classified pages the newspapers financial backbone shrank as 
ads for automobiles real estate and help wanted declined 
the question is whether its cyclical or not said john j 
curley chairman of gannett co which owns more dailies than any 
other group we honestly dont know 
in its firstquarter report issued last week gannett profits 
rose by only the narrowest of margins from 749 million a year 
ago to 75 million this year 
curley sees the newspaper recession as regional rather than 
nationwide he linked it to last winters bankruptcy protection 
filing by the campeau corp the torontobased conglomerate that 
controlled some of this countrys bestknown retail stores 
including bloomingdales jordan marsh lazarus and abraham amp 
straus 
west is best curley said noting that the southwest 
recovering from the oil crisis is doing well northwest is 
secondbest midwest is more down than out southeast is mostly 
down thats retail related northeast is worst with automotive 
ads a big factor 
craig standen president of the newspaper advertising bureau an 
arm of anpa stressed that newspapers arent the only mediarelated 
companies suffering 
the whole media market the advertising business is not going 
as fast as it has in the past he said yes its a problem for 
newspapers but i dont think it means something is structurally 
wrong with newspapers 
declining readership was the other major problem troubling 
publishers it was the topic of panel discussions speeches and 
workshops poor education was denounced more literacy was demanded 
a note of hope was sounded by steven l isenberg associate 
publisher of newsday who said that in spite of a general economic 
downturn new york remains a bastion of newspaper readers 
in new york city the number of people who read two or more 
papers a day is remarkable he said adding opinion is the 
mothers milk of new york life we give them columnists with 
different opinions and views and they come back with a real 
signature of daily life 
isenberg warned that while newspapers are besieged with 
financial woes they shouldnt forget their underlying purpose 
newspapers are part of helping us to be intelligent citizens 
he said 
we are an engine of democracy and we have a responsibility to 
the whole community said c shelby coffey iii editor and 
executive vice president of the los angeles times 
i think newspapers are central to the survival of a free 
society said john e cox jr president of the foundation for 
american communications 
their statements could be taken as an echo of the enthusiastic 
standing ovation the 1600 anpa members gave to two special guests 
the publishers of a bogota colombia newspaper that fought that 
countrys drug lords and managed to publish after its plant was 
bombed no mention was made of the papers advertising and 
circulation numbers

soybean futures prices closed sharply higher 
friday on the chicago board of trade in a late flurry of 
speculative buying underpinned by strong demand and slow shipments 
from brazil 
grain futures ended mixed with newcrop wheat prices rising 
strongly 
analysts were somewhat bewildered by the performance of the 
soybean market which had opened lower after a powerful advance on 
thursday 
mickey luth grains analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc 
said underlying support was provided by strong world demand for 
soybean meal and by the slow pace of soybean and soymeal exports 
from south america due to harvest delays and sweeping economic 
reforms in brazil 
but analysts said there had been no change friday in supply and 
demand factors that might account for the surge in the soybean 
market fridays rally was led by speculative funds they said 
the soybean market also may be reflecting speculation that the 
past weeks unusually warm dry midwestern weather could extend 
into the growing season analysts said but they added that it is 
too early in the growing season to worry about a repeat of the 1988 
drought 
at the close wheat futures were cent lower to 5 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in may at 370 a bushel corn was 1 
cent lower to 3 cents higher with may at 279 a bushel oats were 
1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with may at 162 a bushel

gov robert p casey friday signed the 
nations toughest antitakeover law saying it would discourage 
corporate raiders from stripping jobs and economic vitality from 
pennsylvania 
within hours the law was challenged by two suits filed in 
federal court that claimed unconstitutional infringment on 
shareholder and investor rights 
analysts expect the law which took effect immediately will 
create ripples in boardrooms and legislatures throughout the nation 
for the first time in any state raiders will be forced to 
surrender shortterm profits from thwarted takeover attempts the 
law also restricts the voting rights of raiders and preserves labor 
contracts when corporations change hands 
casey said the buyout spree of the past decade had left a wake 
of broken dreams for both workers and companies the law he said 
would protect their interests in the face of greeddriven 
profiteers 
were interested in longterm stable economic growth were 
not interested in corporate raiders that see shortterm profits for 
narrow interests casey said 
hostile takeovers have cost pennsylvania thousands of jobs and 
such corporate mainstays as gulf oil co which closed its 
headquarters in pittsburgh after it was merged with chevron corp 
the aflcio estimates 90000 jobs were lost nationwide over the 
last decade because of mergers takeovers and leveraged buyouts 
casey signed the bill at city council chambers blocks from the 
corporate headquarters of armstrong world industries inc the 
floor covering manufacturer that the legislation was first drafted 
to protect 
its enactment comes three days before armstrongs annual 
stockholder meeting where the belzberg family of canada plans to 
wage a proxy fight to place four of its representatives on the 
companys board 
a suit filed on behalf of the belzbergs in us district court 
in philadelphia alleges the law conflicts with federal legislation 
and violates the first and fifth amendments of the constitution 
the federal statutory scheme is designed to create a level 
playing field for management and those who would oppose management 
this new legislation dramatically tilts the playing field in favor 
of management said lawrence fox an attorney who filed the suit 
on behalf of first city financial corp and other belzbergowned 
entities 
the second suit was filed by richard greenfield a montgomery 
county attorney on behalf of a new york resident and an arizona 
resident who own stock in pennsylvania companies 
the shareholders are concerned with the provision of the new 
law that effectively takes away the very fundamental rights theyve 
traditionally had we dont think for that reason that the law is 
constitutional greenfield said 
the central provision in the law requires raiders after a 
failed buyout or proxy fight to forfeit any profit made from the 
sale of the target companys stock for 18 months shareholders who 
initiate proxy fights could avoid sanctions in most cases 
providing they dont intend to take control of the corporation 
the law would also allow management to give first consideration 
to employees customers suppliers or the community rather than 
shareholders when weighing takeover bids another provision would 
deny raiders voting rights in a corporation until they are restored 
by other shareholders 
if corporate ownership changes hands labor contracts would have 
to be honored and severance paid to laidoff workers 
up to 90 days after the law takes effect corporations would be 
able to exempt themselves from the legislation the chairman of pnc 
financial corp in pittsburgh has said he plans to recommend to 
directors that the company exempt itself pnc is the parent company 
of pittsburgh national bank and is the nations 14thlargest bank 
holding company 
the legislation had been criticized by the chairman of the 
securities and exchange commission among others critics contend 
the bill would insulate bad management from shareholders and 
ultimately depress stock prices for state companies 
some also claim the law is too late because the pace of hostile 
takeovers slowed considerably and the junk bond market is in 
shambles 
but supporters assert the law will give companies breathing room 
from the threat of takeovers freeing them to concentrate on growth 
and longrange planning 
i clearly think that its going to mean stabilization and 
preservation of pennsylvania corporations jobs and payroll said 
clifford jones president of the pennsylvania chamber of business 
and industry which drafted the bill

the five new york futures and options markets 
shut down early on friday after a communications glitch prevented 
thousands of traders brokers and investors from receiving price 
data 
action in the nations major oil and metals trading pits came to 
a standstill when the exchanges discovered that no price quotes 
were leaving the building 
exchanges employees and participants said it was the first time 
in recent memory that the markets were closed because of a 
technical problem traders reported no panic and an orderly 
shutdown some players took an early weekend trading was halted at 
1120 am at the commodity exchange the nations main metals 
market the new york mercantile exchange the main oil trading 
market the coffee sugar and cocoa exchange the cotton exchange 
and the new york futures exchange 
its a friday afternoon and its a gorgeous day outside if it 
didnt look like comex was going to open up it was im going to 
get a tee time or put my boat in the water said scott hinton a 
metals broker with elders futures inc 
the problem involved communication lines inside the exchange at 
the world trade center in lower manhattan and prevented price 
quotations from being transferred from the trading floor to 
computer screens in the outside world 
the highspeed futures line is dead tom crisalli an 
operations employee with the commodity exchange center which 
oversees the five futures markets said early friday afternoon 
failing to resolve the problem the exchanges shut down at 2 
pm after giving traders a few minutes to settle pending deals 
the regular closing times for most commodities run from 220 pm 
until around 3 pm the new york stock exchange composite 
indexfutures contract continued to trade until its normal 415 
pm close 
employees said the system began transmitting data again at 249 
pm officials said the exchanges would reopen monday but the 
exact cause of the glitch remained unclear 
exchange executives took to the floor shortly after 11 am to 
inform participants that trading would be halted the normally 
frenzied pace of shouted trading died down one floor worker played 
a george thorogood rock tune on the harmonica 
its closed baby michael wilner president of hilltop 
trading co an energy futures trader told a california trader who 
was unaware of the problem were done for the day period 
wilner said there was some confusion after the halt was 
announced but trading had been slow so participants didnt panic 
the problem was further minimized because foreign markets already 
had closed for the weekend 
but market participants said such a shutdown could have caused 
chaos if the stock market for instance was in turmoil or rumors 
about world events that often buffet the markets had been 
circulating 
ive been in this business over 10 years ive never seen it 
go down this long and ive never seen it close down early said 
john jonat a precious metals trader deak international inc 
wilner said the event indicated the kinds of perils that affect 
financial markets which rely on sophisticated computer and 
telephone communications networks that could go down at any time 
if you go skateboarding you should wear elbow pads knee pads 
and a helmet he said from the exchange floor there are a lot 
of forces that impact on the market 
exchange officials said the glitch was in its internal 
communications network not with american telephone amp telegraph co 
lines that feed data from the exchanges 
after trades are recorded on slips of paper and entered into 
computers on the exchange floor the futures price information is 
relayed to an onsite atampt facility that in turn relays it to 
outside points identified by the exchange 
all indications are that the problems encountered by the 
commodity exchanges were not caused by atampts network or 
equipment atampt spokeswoman linda haertlein said 
the new york markets trade futures contracts from orange juice 
to gold in an openoutcry system where bids are shouted by 
designated floor employees the new york markets trail chicagos

for years ames department stores inc 
flourished by gobbling up other bankrupt or ailing discount chains 
now the oncethriving retailer is learning what its like to be on 
the other side 
analysts say ames can recover from its own bankruptcy filing by 
ridding itself of its unprofitable zayre stores and reorganizing 
its own stores 
but that will be an especially difficult task in a turbulent 
retail climate where bankruptcy filings have become almost as 
common as dollarday sales 
ames became the latest casualty in the retail industry when it 
filed for protection from its creditors wednesday under chapter 11 
of the us bankruptcy code 
the ames filing came three months after campeau corps allied 
and federated stores filed for chapter 11 protection a move that 
sent a wave of panic through the industry last summer the bonwit 
teller and b altman units of the hooker corp also filed for 
protection 
coupled with the downfalls of smaller retailers the troubles of 
the upscalecampeau companies and the discount ames chain has left 
suppliers skittish and retailers worrying about who will be next 
the drink of choice used to be absolut vodka on seventh 
avenue its now maalox said alan millstein publisher of a 
monthly newsletter for retailers and manufacturers 
retail analysts blame amess problems on its 1988 acquisition of 
the zayre discount chain a deal some analysts now describe as the 
albatross that brought ames down 
but they also say ames may have been able to save itself in a 
healthier retail climate 
howard davidowitz chairman of a new yorkbased retail financial 
consulting firm said amess problems are symptoms of the 
competitive squeeze that has gripped retailers for the last five 
years 
america is badly overstored and overshopping centered and 
what happens in that environment is the strong get stronger and the 
weak get weaker and fall out davidowitz said 
other analysts say those who blame a new breed of competition in 
retail are just whining and that the recent spate of bankruptcy 
filings are really caused by mismanagement and bad decisions 
the bankruptcy filings by ames and the campeau units have 
nothing to do with anything but people making bad financial 
decisions said jeffrey branman managing director for financo 
inc a new york investment bank that specializes in retail 
industry transactions 
there really is not a revolution thats going on branman 
said this is the normal evolution where the strong get stronger 
and the weak get weaker and get shaken out 
the tense retail climate caused by recent bankruptcies has led 
to a growing number of consolidations especially among discounters 
ironically ames rode the crest of the consolidation trend 
swallowing up competitors who were either bankrupt or on the brink 
of bankruptcy from 1974 to 1985 ames had consumed nearly 500 new 
stores by capitalizing on the weaknesses of competitors including 
stores owned by giant stores corp wt grant co kdt industries 
inc gc murphy co and neisner brothers inc 
amess purchase of the zayre chain in 1988 is widely seen as the 
companys one big blunder its 788 million acquisition of the 
392store zayre chain doubled ames size and transformed the 
company from a littleknown new englandbased chain into the 
nations fourthlargest discounter 
the zayre stores had been known for frequent promotions heavy 
advertising and discounted fashion items ames by contrast stocks 
more traditional merchandise and runs fewer promotions the two 
styles never meshed successfully 
analysts who have watched ames through its glory days and its 
more recent turmoil say the chains recovery will depend on its 
ability to scale back its operations to the manageable and 
successful size it had before acquiring the zayre chain 
it will be a difficult road back for ames because they have to 
divest themselves of all of the zayre stores and of their own 
underperforming stores and they have to go back to a promotional 
discount store to regain consumer recognition said walter s 
loeb president of a new york retail consulting firm 
amess ability to win back the confidence of its suppliers is 
also considered critical for any comeback 
the discounter listed a total of 144 billion in liabilities 
and 166 billion in assets in its bankruptcy filing its top 20 
creditors include societe genenerale financial corp which is owed 
just over 14 million rubbermaid inc which is owed 45 million 
and the sara lee group which is owed nearly 39 million 
suppliers began cutting off deliveries to ames last month after 
they were not paid for earlier shipments because of amess cash 
shortage 
their basic customer couldnt care less whether the store is 
in bankruptcy or not said millstein all they care about is 
seeing their favorite merchandise on the shelves and to do that 
you need suppliers

the dollar declined against most major 
currencies friday in trading dominated by the west german mark and 
japanese yen 
news that inflation has picked up this year initially caused 
heavy dollar buying but it tapered off by late morning 
gold prices fell modestly 
on the new york commodity exchange gold for june delivery 
settled down 30 cents at 373 a troy ounce after an abbreviated 
session trading ended early on the comex before noon in new york 
because of a communications problem later republic national bank 
of new york quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at 37150 as of 4 
pm edt 90 cents higher than thursdays late bid 
foreign exchange dealers said the dollar traded within a narrow 
range as most of the buying and selling interest was directed 
toward the mark and yen 
really the day was dominated by cross trading particularly 
the markyen said bob morrissey senior trader at the bank of 
boston 
traders snapped up dollars in the morning after the government 
reported that us inflation jumped 65 percent in the first 
quarter of this year the steepest increase since a 77 percent 
advance in the fourth quarter of 1981 
they bought on the assumption that the federal reserve board 
might step up its battle against inflation by pursuing a tighter 
credit policy which would lead to higher interest rates higher 
rates would boost returns on dollardenominated investments and 
tend to increase demand for dollars 
but the buying enthusiasm soon waned traders apparently 
concluded that the central bank wouldnt adjust its policy in the 
immediate future activity typically slows on fridays because 
traders prefer not to establish significant new positions ahead of 
a weekend 
the inflation reading came in a report that showed the gross 
national product the countrys total output of goods and services 
grew at a 21 percent annual rate in the first three months of 
1990 the gnp figure was in line with expectations and therefore 
had little impact on the dollar 
the dollars trading day began in tokyo where it rose to 15908 
japanese yen from 15877 yen on thursday later in london it fell 
to 15880 yen by the time trading was done for the day in new 
york the dollar had risen to 15930 yen from 15923 yen late 
thursday 
the british pound rose to 16360 from 16340 late thursday 
sterling also strengthened in new york and one pound fetched 
16350 in late trading up from 16342 the day before 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
thursdays quotes included 16775 west german marks down from 
16797 14530 swiss francs down from 14575 56290 french 
francs down from 56355 123000 italian lire down from 
123175 and 116375 canadian dollars up from 11603 
selected late dollar rates in europe compared with late

italian lire down from 123100 and 11632 canadian dollars up 
from 11602 
gold prices moved lower on most world markets while silver was 
mixed

from 37265 bid late thursday in zurich the metal fell to a

in the latest round in a decadelong struggle 
with penny stock mogul meyer blinder federal regulators on friday 
suspended the firm he founded from trading in the lowcost 
highrisk securities for 45 days and from underwriting such 
offerings for two years 
the securities and exchange commission in an administrative 
action also barred blinder himself from associating with any 
registered brokerdealer for at least two years 
lawyers in washington for the firm and blinder were out of their 
offices thursday afternoon and had not returned a reporters 
telephone call for comment by evening 
lawyers in the secs enforcement division were at a conference 
friday and also unavailable for comment 
normally however such findings are appealable either to the 
full commission or to a federal judge 
blinder 69 of denver colo and four associates were indicted 
in february on racketeering and securities fraud charges by a 
federal grand jury in las vegas the indictment followed a 1988 
internal revenue service raid on blinder robinsons denver office 
blinder robinson was once the nations largest penny stock 
brokerage 
penny stocks are low cost high risk securities usually trading 
for less than 3 per share they are not listed on stock exchanges 
and thus reliable uptotheminute information about them is hard 
to obtain 
that makes penny stocks which typically are used to raise 
capital for new or small companies prone to fraud by unscrupulous 
traders and promoters 
the sec action dates back to the early 1980s and has seesawed 
back and forth through hearings in the federal courts in denver and 
washington as well as administrative actions before the full 
commission and administrative law judges 
the sec has accused blinder and the firm of fraud and 
manipulative practices involving the securities of america leisure 
corp a company that told investors it planned to build and 
operate an atlantic city nj casinohotel but only owned 172 
acres of land in atlantic city an area deemed too small for such a 
venture

here is a look at the six competitors for a 
us standard for either high definition tv or enhanced television 
zenith electronics corp zenith says it has devised technology 
to compress the 30 megahertz signal of hdtv into 6 megahertz the 
band width of todays television broadcasts 
the system transmits thelow frequency portion of the signal 
digitally or in computer language sharply reducing the power 
required for hdtv transmission by reducing the power zenith says 
it can boost the highfrequency pictureside of the signal 
zenith has joined american telephone and telegraph co in 
developing its hdtv system which it says would be available in 
1994 zenith says it is spending 10 million on hdtv research this 
year 
sarnoff consortium composed of the david sarnoff research 
center in princeton nj nbc philips consumer electronics co 
and thomson consumer electronics inc 
it plans to introduce hdtv in two steps the first advanced 
compatible television or actv would produce images 30 percent 
clearer than todays broadcasts digital sound and ghostfree 
images 
the groups hdtv proposal is a philips concept based on an 
analog system the conventional way of sending television signals 
but it says the system will not be ready for testing until late 
1991 
the consortium which has spent 100 million on these projects 
over the past seven years plans to have actv available by 1993 and 
full hdtv by 2000 nhk japan broadcasting corp nhk is 
proposing two systems muse an hdtv system and muse6 which 
provides an enhanced version of todays tv it remains unclear how 
much the company is spending for research on these projects 
massachusetts institute of technology mit is proposing a 
channel compatible system similar to zeniths mit says the 
difference is it provides a more robust signal that eliminates 
distortion of regular broadcast channels by the highdefinition 
signal the system uses a hybrid digitalanalog signal developed 
during seven years of research that cost 2 million 
production services inc the tuscon arizbased research 
company proposes a system it calls genesys in which a 
highdefinition signal would be superimposed on a regular broadcast 
signal the completely digital system uses technology to shrink the 
hdtv transmission into a 6 megahertz band the company says it has 
spent 2 million over six years developing the technology 
faroudja laboratories the sunnyvale calif research 
company proposes an enhancement of the current tv signal that 
removes some of the ghosts and squiggles it is not hdtv the 
amount of money spent on research remains unclear

companys operating performance the super value menu is a 
collection of seven menu items priced at 99 cents in most markets 
james w near company president and chief executive officer 
said improved efficiency led to higher profit margins

1990 the company was able to improve margins through increased 
efficiencies near said we reduced operating expenses to 
2002 million from 223 million and raised restaurant operating 
margins to 98 percent from 64 percent

the exxon corp said friday its 1990 
summer cleanup program on the stilloiled shorelines of prince 
william sound will consist of small mobile squads of workers using 
techniques that are the least intrusive on the environment 
the giant oil company has said its crews will be returning to 
the beaches on may 1 for a second and final year 
hundreds of miles of alaska shoreline were fouled when the 
tanker exxon valdez slammed into a charted reef march 24 1989 
shredding its hull and releasing nearly 11 million gallons of north 
slope crude oil into the water 
exxon submitted its cleanup plan friday to the federal onscene 
coordinator coast guard rear adm david ciancaglini who must 
approve the proposal before any work is allowed to begin 
a multiagency task force has been conducting a shoreline survey 
this month and determined that conditions in prince william sound 
and the gulf of alaska had improved dramatically over the winter 
exxon said 
as of april 20 574 miles of shoreline had been inspected still 
more sites remain to be checked before the survey ends next week 
exxon said the inspections showed no evidence of surface oil on 
372 miles of shoreline or 65 percent very light oiling along 
sections of 130 miles or 22 percent and a narrow to wide band of 
weathered crude along sections of 72 miles or 13 percent 
the remaining oil is on generally short lengths of shoreline 
in scattered locations otto harrison general manager of exxons 
alaska operations said in a news release 
the state department of environmental conservation reported the 
results of the survey another way wednesday saying that 79 percent 
of the shoreline sites surveyed were still oiled 
while there may be some debate over the extent of the campaign 
its expected that the real controversy may be over the way exxon 
goes about cleaning up whats left of the mess 
exxon said it plans to pick up oily debris and tarballs 
manually spotwash certain areas till and rake sediment and use 
bioremediation oileating bacteria to hasten the breakup of the 
tarry coating on some beaches 
but state policymakers are not yet certain they want to use the 
fertilizers on the beaches fearing the release of still more 
toxins 
exxon expects to have 1100 people at work on the cleanup by 
june 1

the proposed recapitalization of national bancshares corp of 
texas inc fell through friday when equimark corp pulled out 
laying the basis for the federal takeover of the largest remaining 
insolvent bank in texas 
equimark a 37 billion financial services company based in 
pittsburgh agreed last july to take over the ailing san antonio 
bank holding company providing 31 million of its own money along 
with 250 million from the federal deposit insurance corp 
however the deal was contingent on approval by holders of at 
least 85 percent of 25 million national bancshares debt and on 
thursday the bank holding company said holders of only 25 percent 
had given their approval by the 5 pm deadline 
obviously we are disappointed that this transaction cannot go 
forward as planned said equimark chairman alan s fellheimer 
national bancshares had assets of 23 billion last july but 
that has shrunk to about 19 billion 
the fdic and other regulatory agencies are proceeding to 
consider alternative resolutions to the nbc situation including 
contact with qualified prospective acquirers fdic spokesman 
david barr said friday 
those alternatives include closing national bancshares 
insolvent banks and selling them immediately to another 
institution or operating them as bridge banks until a buyer 
can be found 
a sale offer could rekindle the interest of a host of other 
banks who had originally taken a look at national bancshares last 
year included in that list were ncnb texas national bank the 
states largest holding company minneapolis investor carl pohlad 
together with norwest corp and security pacific corp 
however robert rieke banking analysts at rauscher pierce refnes 
inc brokerage in dallas predicted two texas banks first city 
bancorp of texas inc and texas commerce bancshares inc a 
subsidiary of chemical banking co will show the greatest 
interest 
i cannot imagine an outofstate organization coming to texas 
and using national bancshares as a platform he said 
national bancshares once the eighth largest bank holding 
company in texas and second largest bank in san antonio lost 285 
million in the first quarter of this year following a loss of 
4291 million in the previous four years 
declining real estate and energy markets have sapped many texas 
banks in recent years forcing many of the into private or 
federally funded recapitalizations

bond prices rose slightly friday in light 
trading as the market shrugged off a government report showing 
strong economic growth and rising inflation but long treasury bond 
yields remained above 9 percent 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond rose 532 point or 
156 for each 1000 in face value its yield which falls when 
prices rise dipped to 902 percent from 904 percent late thursday 
the yield on the 30year treasury finished above 9 percent 
thursday for the first time in almost a year the yield is 
important since it is used to calculate some mortgage and other 
loan rates 
the commerce department said the gross national product rose 21 
percent in the first quarter almost double the previous quarters 
rate a price gauge tied to the gnp shot up an annual rate of 65 
percent from the 45 percent for all of last year 
both reports normally would be bad news for the bond market 
because inflation erodes the value of fixedincome securities such 
as bonds and because a healthy economy makes it less likely the 
federal reserve will act to ease interest rates 
but the figures had been expected by bond traders in fact 
some anticipated the inflation figure would be even higher said 
james marshall a trader with clayton brown amp associates in chicago 
after the release of the numbers bond prices rose then fell 
then rose again some traders said the market appeared to be 
reacting to different components of the report 
the market didnt know which way it wanted to go marshall 
said 
bond prices had been down all week people have been saying it 
the market is oversold and cant go down forever marshall 
said but then weve got a lot of supply coming up for the 
quarterly refunding that always causes a lot of consternation 
he said referring to the treasurys quarterly refunding auction 
next month 
you have these two forces at work and they really kind of 
washed each other out today 
another force at work was the need by some traders to cover 
their short positions before the weekend by buying bonds he added 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues rose by between 532 point and 316 point 
intermediate maturities rose by 332 point to 532 point and 
longterm issues rose by lsqb point to 732 point according to 
figures provided by telerate inc a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value

soybean futures prices surged friday to their highest levels 
since last summer extending a rally linked to the rainslowed 
brazilian harvest and fears that the recent hot dry midwestern 
weather might be a harbinger of drought 
on other commodity markets grain futures ended mixed cattle 
were higher pork futures were mixed oil futures were mixed and 
precious metals were mixed 
trading in oil precious metals and a number of other 
commodities ended before noon edt after a communications glitch at 
new yorks commodity exchange center prevented price quotes from 
the five new york markets from reaching customers 
the trading halt affected the new york mercantile exchange the 
commodity exchange the coffee sugar and cocoa exchange the new 
york cotton exchange and the new york futures exchange officials 
said the problem was corrected friday afternoon and normal trading 
would resume on monday 
soybean futures settled 7 cents to 10 cents higher on the 
chicago board of trade with the contract for delivery in may up 8 
cents at 635 a bushel the highest settlement of a nearmonth 
soybean contract since july 28 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 5 cents higher with may at 
370 a bushel corn was cent lower to 1 cents higher with may 
at 280 a bushel oats were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with 
may at 162 a bushel 
the rise in soybean futures followed leaps of 17 cents thursday 
and 10 cents wednesday in the may soybean contract 
soybean meal for may delivery settled 390 higher at 18440 
amid the heaviest trading volume in exchange history the board of 
trade said fridays volume of 54815 meal contracts surpassed the 
previous high of 45411 set oct 20 1987 
analysts said some of the underlying support in the soybean 
complex was provided by the relatively slow pace of soybean and 
soymeal exports from south america mainly due to wetweather 
harvest delays in brazil the worlds secondlargest soybean 
producer 
theyve had rain pretty much on a steady basis for a month 
now said walter spilka of smith barney harris upham amp co 
he said the brazilian harvest was about half complete but would 
be 80 percent finished by now if the harvest was progressing at a 
normal pace 
the slow brazilian harvest is fueling speculation that european 
nations may need to buy us soybean meal for livestock feed 
according to spilka and others 
the strong soybean market also may have reflected speculation 
that the past weeks unusually warm dry midwestern weather could 
extend into the growing season analysts said 
but several said it was too early in the growing season to worry 
about a repeat of the 1988 drought 
after the close of trading friday a national weather service 
forecast predicted normal to belownormal temperatures and normal 
to abovenormal rainfall for the region through the end of july 
cattle futures posted modest gains on the chicago mercantile 
exchange amid buying prompted by the low price of futures versus 
the cash cattle markets 
further support came from a a strong rally in the adjacent 
porkbelly pit early in the session although those gains were 
later trimmed 
live cattle settled 40 cent to 55 cent higher with june at 
7315 cents a pound feeder cattle were 35 cent to 73 cent higher 
with may at 8215 cents a pound live hogs were 57 cent lower to 
10 cent higher with june at 63 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were 80 cent lower to 95 cent higher with may at 6465 cents a

summer camp directors planned letters to parents 
and pharmacies yanked cans from shelves friday after two top insect 
repellents were recalled because a longused ingredient made lab 
rats sick 
the environmental protection agency announced thursday that the 
makers of deep woods off and cutters insect repellents had 
voluntarily recalled their products because of the findings 
the ingredients manufacturer mclaughlin gormley king co of 
minneapolis told the government that preliminary testing showed an 
additive known as r11 gave tumors to lab rats and withered their 
ovaries the company asked that its license to make the product be 
withdrawn 
about 200 brands of repellent use r11 which helps repel flies 
that bite 
i will just make sure that when my final notice goes out to 
parents if they dont know about it not to send anything with 
their child thats on the recall list said betsy cobb owner of 
camp runoia a small girls camp in belgrade lakes maine 
cobb said the camp does not recommend a brand of insect 
repellent children should bring but said she would check to see 
what children were using 
i would not put it on a child said dolly jacobson owner of 
buck and beaver camp in shohola pa in the poconos mountains 
which attracts about 100 boys and girls ages 7 to 15 
im planning on covering it during orientation telling them 
to be on the lookout in case parents havent heard about it she 
said 
two of the major users of the additive are sc johnson and son 
co of racine wis which makes off products and miles co of 
elkhart ind producer of cutters 
off spokeswoman barbara jorgensen said 150000 cases of deep 
woods off containing r11 were in circulation the company on 
april 6 asked retailers to return the product and exchange it for a 
newly formulated one 
deep woods off has contained r11 since it was first 
manufactured in 1973 the new version will will bear a red sticker 
on the cap saying new forumla she said other off products 
are not affected by the recall 
theres a huge concern that there would be product 
confusion said jorgensen we dont want people to overreact to 
this and not use insect repellents this season 
miles inc on april 10 asked its retailers to return cutters 
aeresol pump spray and lotion which contained r11 the new 
versions without the chemical will have a yellow sticker 
our concern is that consumers not become overly alarmed 
because this does not pose a health risk company spokeswoman 
dionn tron said 
rite aid corp one of the nations leading drugstore chains 
notified its 2350 stores in 22 states to pull the problem 
repellents from shelves a rite aid official said the company was 
waiting to retrieve all the old formula before stocking the new 
versions 
we do have the new formula in warehouses but we want to make 
sure we only get the product that manufacturers have approved as 
safe on the shelves said the official who asked not to be named 
bonnie carmody manager of naults heights pharmacy in concord 
nh said she pulled the remaining 12 cans of the products off the 
shelves friday after a pharmacist heard a news report about the 
recall 
she said deep woods off and cutters products were big sellers 
in new england dreaded for its summer bug migration and she 
expected consumers to buy the replacement versions 
about 25 percent of all insect repellents on the market use the 
additive formally known as 
2345bis2butylenetetrahydro2furaldehyde the technical name 
appears on product labels 
the government said it has done no independent testing of r11 
requiring pesticide manufacturers to conduct safety tests and does 
not know how dangerous it may be the ingredient has been used for 
35 years

a resolution urging a resumption of bargaining 
in the eightweekold greyhound bus strike and deploring strike 
violence was introduced thursday in the house by rep pat williams 
dmont and about 100 cosponsors 
the toll exacted by this increasingly bitter dispute is 
worsening with each day that passes without negotiations 
williams said 
greyhound has refused to resume negotiations until a week passes 
without a shooting or bomb threat the last confirmed incident 
occurred monday talks broke down march 18 in tucson ariz and 
have been stalled ever since 
the amalgamated transit union which has condemned the nearly 40 
shootings and other violent incidents that have occurred has said 
it was willing to resume contract talks at any time 
we wish that the company would see the error in its ways 
particularly in regard to this business of putting the bargaining 
process in the hands of some kook out there who might make a phone 
call or pick up a weapon said union spokesman nick nichols 
greyhound spokesman george gravley said the company welcomed 
congress condemnation of the violence and that greyhound 
executives would resume bargaining when seven days passed without 
violence 
the bus lines 6300 drivers and about 3000 of its office and 
maintenance workers walked out march 2 over wages and job security 
the company which operates the only nationwide bus system has 
been running on a reduced schedule since then using replacements 
and union members who cross picket lines

the head of the securities and exchange 
commission has asked the national association of securities dealers 
to explore the development of an electronic pricing system for the 
junk bond market a newspaper reported 
such a system could improve liquidity in the ailing market for 
highyield bonds and increase investor interest in the securities 
the new york times said in an early edition of fridays paper 
the request is based on a new computerized trading system the 
association has developed for securities issued via private 
placement the sec authorized big institutional investors to trade 
such securities last week and at the same time approved the trading 
system known as portal 
sec chairman richard c breeden has asked the association to 
examine whether portal could be used to quote prices of junk bonds 
the times reported 
at the request of the sec we are exploring whether we can use 
the same software that we developed for portal in the pricing of 
highyield securities joseph hardiman president of nasd was 
quoted as saying 
there is obviously a void in the pricing of those securities 
and there is strong demand among buyers legislators and regulators 
to see if we can come up with something 
prices and trading activity in the junk bond market have been 
depressed for months by defaults bankruptcy filings by major 
issuers and the collapse of drexel burnham lambert inc which used 
to dominate the market

general motors corp will install electronic 
security devices as standard equipment in the ignition systems of 
nearly all its cars by 1994 gm chairmanelect robert stempel said 
friday 
the passkey system currently available on about oneeighth of

communicates electronically with the engine through the ignition 
lock 
if the lock reads an unfamiliar code the cars starter and fuel 
lines are disabled for several minutes according to delco 
electronics the gm division that makes passkey 
the system shuts down the starter and fuel lines if a thief 
tries to start a car without a key delco said 
stempel said the 1991 saturn line of cars scheduled for release 
this fall would include the passkey as standard equipment 
by the time we get through 1993 virtually all of our cars

by its sulphur division and a decline in its motor oil and

for the first three months of 1990 pennzoil earned 327 
million or 85 cents per share compared with earnings of 525 
million or 134 per share during the first quarter of 1989 
revenue fell 4 percent to 5532 million from 5763 million a 
year ago 
operating income from the companys oil and gas operations was 
up sharply over 1989 levels due to higher crude oil and natural 
gas prices said james l pate pennzoils president however 
the gain was largely offset by lower prices and volumes in the 
sulphur division 
operating income for the motor oil and automotive products 
segment was somewhat lower due to decreased motor oil volumes and 
increased cost he said 
the companys oil and gas division posted profits of 458 
million up 92 percent from 238 million in 1989 
the sulphur division however had a 67 percent decline in its

general electric co and lockheed corp 
announced thousands of job cuts friday a move analysts say is 
fueled in part by decreases in defense spending 
ge said it will eliminate about 4200 hourly and salaried jobs 
over the next two years at five ge aerospace locations in new york 
and new jersey 
lockheed based in calabasas calif plans to lay off 2750 
workers in its planebuilding division including about 2000 in 
southern california 
the job cuts which had been expected were the second big round 
of aerospace layoffs in as many days to hit southern california 
on thursday mcdonnell douglas corp said it will eliminate 
3000 jobs at its long beachbased douglas aircraft unit this 
summer to reduce the costs of jet aircraft production at the 
moneylosing division 
the basic reason for the reductions is were looking at cuts 
in the defense budget said wendy abramowitz an analyst for 
argus research corp in new york if they keep all those people 
they will be expending money and will not have the same amount 
coming in 
steven binder an analyst at bear sterns and co in new york 
said the job cuts are reflective of future defense cuts and 
spending 
during recent years the defense department has had to cut 
procurement and research and development that has made it 
necessary for companies to reduce employment he said 
ges cuts stem in part from efforts to reorganize its aerospace 
defense businesses so the company can remain successful despite a 
shrinking market and increased competition 
ge says it will take advantage of projected attrition and 
retirements of about 2000 employees to reduce significantly the 
number of employees actually laid off 
the reductions are scheduled to take place at plants in 
binghamton syracuse and utica ny and camden and moorestown nj 
we are taking decisive actions now to enable our business to 
meet its future commitments to customers and ensure that ge 
aerospace will be a vital industryleading business for many years 
to come said jon rittenhouse senior vice president for ge 
aerospace which is based in valley forge 
were entering a decade that will provide a difficult 
challenge for defense companies he said by taking these 
steps we are protecting the longterm competitive outlook for the 
business 
where layoffs are necessary ge will offer financial assistance 
based on length of service and medical and life insurance coverage 
for up to one year from the date of layoff the company also will 
offer jobfinding assistance 
the cuts affect about 15 percent of the companys 6000 
employees at three syracusearea plants they are the first 
significant local layoffs since the company shut down its picture 
tube production operation in november 1986 
ge syracuses largest employer will cut 200 salaried jobs by 
the end of 1990 said ge spokeswoman connie grasso another 420 
hourly jobs and 250 salaried will be eliminated over the next two 
years 
layoffs at the three local sites in the towns of geddes dewitt 
and salina will begin as early as june 1 
james ragsdale a spokesman for lockheeds aeronautical systems 
co in burbank said 750 employees who will lose their jobs are 
based in marietta ga where lockhee had built the huge c5 cargo 
plane 
the c5 is just one of four lockheed military planes whose 
production had ended recently or is to end soon the others are the 
p3 subhunter the tr1 highaltitude reconnaissance plane and 
the f117a stealth fighter 
it is unlikely we will have any large new military aircraft 
production project that will begin before the mid1990s ken 
cannestra the president of the aeronautics unit said in a 
statement 
lockheed the nations sixthbiggest military contractor saw 
its profits fall from 624 million in 1988 to just 2 million last 
year one big reason was that the company underestimated by 
hundreds of millions of dollars the costs of developing a new 
warplane the p7 a replacement for the p3

effective may 1 after only nine months on the job 
the comex said only that staloff was leaving to pursue other 
business opportunities but published reports said he resigned 
under pressure amid strained relationships with comexs trader 
leadership including chairman martin greenberg 
staloff could not be reached for comment a successor was not

staloff won a reputation as an innovator of financial products 
when he was a senior officer of the philadelphia stock exchange and 
president of the philadelphia board of trade 
but he apparently encountered conflict at comex where members 
mainly trading houses and individual traders have a reputation for 
being strongwilled and who effectively run the exchange 
the comex is the nations major gold silver and copper futures 
exchange but it is a distant fourth in size behind the chicago 
board of trade chicago mercantile exchange and new york mercantile

donald trump may not be nearly as rich as he 
claims forbes magazine says in an article that if true would bump 
the tycoon out of the world billionaires club 
forbes has slashed its estimate of trumps net worth by more 
than 1 billion to around 500 million in its may 14 cover story 
which forbes made available friday the magazine says it revised 
the estimate after examining nonpublic documents submitted by trump 
last year to a government body which forbes declined to specify 
the article challenges trumps claim in the documents to have a 
net worth of 15 billion it also questions whether trumps cash 
flow is sufficient to cover the debt and interest payments on his 
vast holdings 
the developer said friday he has discussed selling or 
refinancing most of his major asset to raise money to buy new 
properties trump said he has hired merrill lynch amp co to 
negotiate a possible sale of the trump shuttle less than a year 
after buying the airline and sticking his name on it 
trump said he is interested in raising cash now so that he will 
have funds on hand in the future to acquire additional properties 
his assets also include new yorks plaza hotel the glitzy trump 
tower skyscraper on manhattans fifth avenue and casinos in 
atlantic city nj including the 1 billion taj mahal casino 
which recently opened 
in a statement released late friday trump organization said 
forbes made a mathematical mistake or purposeful omission by 
not including 160 million a year in anticipated operating profit 
from the taj mahal while including the new casinos debt service 
they forbes made a major mistake here said a trump 
spokesman who asked not to be identified by name 
he declined comment on the broader question of trumps total net 
worth only donald trumps accountants know this he said 
forbes magazine may guess as others do but they really dont 
know 
ray healey a spokesman for the magazine responded weve 
done a very thorough analysis and we stand by our story 
using the list of properties in trumps 1989 documents and 
updating their values forbes said it came up with a total market 
value of slightly less than 37 billion however with nearly 32 
billion in debt trumps cash shortfall may be nearly 40 million a 
year the business magazine estimated 
some of the interest on his debt is accruing rather than being 
paid in cash 
in the documents trump claims a net worth after deducting all 
debts and mortgages of 15 billion forbes noted in the article 
entitled manhattans favorite guessing game how rich is donald 
the magazines own estimate in 1989 was 17 billion 
doublewhammied by a real estate recession and problems with 
his gambling casinos donald trump may be down to his last 
halfbillion in net worth and he has little liquidity the 
article says thats not comfortable for a guy with more than 3 
billion in debt 
in an interview friday with the associated press trump insisted 
that he is very liquid now 
i want to build up cash because i think cash is going to be 
king he said
