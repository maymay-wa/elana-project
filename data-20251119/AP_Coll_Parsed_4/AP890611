seven people hospitalized after being 
overcome by carbon monoxide in an ice skating rink were released 
saturday and special precautions were taken to avoid more problems 
the seven were among 25 people sickened by gas emitted from an 
ice grooming machine known as a zamboni during a hockey tournament 
at the rink friday the others were treated with oxygen at the scene 
a faulty exhaust system on the zamboni apparently caused it to 
emit the carbon monoxide which stayed close to the ice said 
tualatin valley fire and rescue department dispatcher rod nodland 
he said the carbon monoxide readings in the arena were at safe 
levels saturday 
john mcbride the valley ice arena general manager said large 
fans were set up saturday to circulate air at the rink and the ice 
grooming machine was fitted with a catalytic converter to reduce its 
emissions 
he theorized that extra refrigeration used to keep the ice solid 
in recent warm weather brought the temperature so low in the arena 
friday that carbon monoxide from the zamboni stayed near the ice and 
wouldnt disperse normally 
this was the second year in a row that carbon monoxide poisoning 
has occurred at the rink during a hockey game for the rose festival 
the citys annual june festival 
paramedics were first alerted to the problems at the rink friday 
night when a parent sought aid for a child that was vomiting 
several children complained of dizziness and nausea and at least 
one child fainted 
dr gregory lorts of providence hospital said one boy brought 
there friday night was treated for 90 minutes in a glassenclosed 
pressurized chamber where pure oxygen was pumped into the boys 
lungs 
because of the relatively low levels of the carbon monoxide in 
fridays incident lorts said it is unlikely that any person at the 
rink would suffer longterm ill effects 
carbon monoxide is odorless tasteless and colorless and is 
produced during combustion 
capt terry kline who headed tualatin valley fire and rescues 
hazardousmaterials team at the rink said initial readings of 
carbon monoxide in the building were 120 to 170 parts per million of 
air 
he said 50 parts per million was considered the maximum 
concentration before people felt sick and 1500 parts per million 
would be lethal

mikhail s gorbachevs first state 
visit to west germany is overshadowed by tragedy and unrest in the 
soviet union and an accelerating threat worldwide to the socialist 
ideology that guides his leadership 
but the soviet presidents advance men have been deftly 
deflecting the distractions hinting that major initiatives may be 
in the making during the muchpublicized summit 
gorbachevs fourday visit which begins monday comes with high 
expectations on both sides each speaks of a new era in relations 
and a historic chance for closing the gap between east and west 
both nations are focusing on the opportunities presented by 
gorbachevs reforms relegating to the sidelines the reformrelated 
crises in china eastern europe and among ethnic groups within the 
soviet union 
we consider this an extremely important meeting perhaps the 
most important one weve had in europe gennady i gerasimov the 
soviet government spokesman said in an interview on friday 
acknowledging west germans enthusiasm for the kremlin leader and 
his reform program gerasimov said gorbachev wanted a close look at 
west germany and would go out and press the flesh 
asked if gorbachev planned to respond to president bushs arms 
control initiative announced may 29 during the nato summit in 
brussels gerasimov said there is no ground for a quick reply 
he said the conventional weapons reduction plan outlined by bush 
and endorsed by the western allies has not been formally presented 
to negotiators at superpower talks in vienna so an official kremlin 
response was unlikely 
but he said another soviet step in the disarmament volley was 
possible during the summit that opens monday 
another member of the soviet advance delegation political 
observer lev a bezymensky of the magazine new times told reporters 
friday that we should let ourselves be surprised by what takes 
place during the summit 
hans klein a west german government spokesman sees the visit as 
a chance to reach a goal of peace with ever fewer weapons 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher predicted a milestone in 
germansoviet relations 
the atmosphere of hope however has been tainted by numerous 
domestic troubles likely to continue boiling while the soviet leader 
is abroad 
ethnic unrest in the central asian republic of uzbekistan 
reportedly prompted some lastminute schedule changes to allow 
gorbachev to stay in close contact with the kremlin throughout his 
visit 
the congress of peoples deputies finally ended its stormy 
inaugural session friday the lawmakers struggle to redefine the 
nations course for democracy and their sharp criticism of the 
communist party amazed the soviet people who watched on television 
and preoccupied the kremlin leadership 
soviets are in mourning over the hundreds of deaths resulting 
from a train disaster in the ural mountains june 3 and the advance 
delegation indicated gorbachev would not be attending a gala concert 
in bonn on wednesday so as to maintain an appropriately somber 
atmosphere but the hosts eagerness to give the summit the highest 
profile appears to have won out 
the germans have done a very clever thing said yuri a 
gremitskikh another senior soviet foreign ministry official in bonn 
to prepare the summit they have now made it a concert to benefit 
the victims of the train tragedy so we will have to reconsider 
both sides have pinned high hopes on the visit and its potential 
to maintain good momentum in improving relations between east and 
west 
west germans have embraced gorbachevs call for a common 
european home an aim they see as an opportunity to let the 
barriers fall between east and west and perhaps lead to an eventual 
reunification of germany 
the conservative bonn daily newspaper die welt reported two weeks 
ago that the west german government expects that gorbachev will 
stress the german right of selfdetermination in some form or 
another when he visits west germany that would soften the 
kremlins traditional view that reunification could take place only 
under a socialist leadership 
soviet officials have indicated such a gesture is possible but 
they have given no clues as to what gorbachev might say on that 
subject or in response to persistent questions about the berlin 
wall erected by east germany in 1961 
eduard shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister visited berlin 
on friday for talks with east german leader erich honecker 
gerasimov described his visit with honecker as a matter of 
protocol prior to the state visit to west germany but the minister 
declined to specify what matters would be discussed at the gorbachev 
summit 
the visit is likely to provide a boost to the standing of west 
german chancellor helmut kohl 
gorbachev was rated as the most popular foreign statesman ever in 
a poll released a week ago by the weekly magazine der spiegel 
outdistancing even john f kennedy and the gorbachev visit may help 
kohl and his christian democratic party in next weeks european 
parliament elections 
heinrich vogel director of the federal institute for eastern and 
international studies in cologne and a specialist in soviet affairs 
predicted that the summit would focus on atmosphere rather than 
substance mostly because of the sensitive stage in which the 
kremlin leader finds himself 
vogel said problems with socialism as an ideology began 
escalating with the polish solidarity movement in 1980 and lately 
have been accelerating at an unbelievable pace a pace that is 
really staggering and frightening

fighters during a battle in the southern province of gaza the

bulele

government troop casualties information on the fighting is often 
sketchy and can take days or even weeks to reach maputo 
the rebels have been fighting since 1977 in a bid to undermine 
mozambiques marxist government 
the rebels have devastated the economy of the southeast african 
nation with hitandrun attacks on both military and civilian 
targets

estimated 6 million of its 15 million people are in need of food aid

nearly four centuries after explorer henry 
hudsons crew mutinied and set him adrift a replica of his ship has 
been launched to honor the netherlands contributions to the new 
world 
what the sea separates the shipbuilder unites ship designer 
nicholas benton told a crowd of about 500 saturday before the 
christening of the half moon 
the 85foot 120ton wooden vessel was lowered by crane into the 
hudson river which hudson discovered in 1609 during his search for 
a northwest passage to the orient 
two years later hudsons crew mutinied setting him his young 
son and seven others adrift in a small boat in canadas hudson bay 
they were never seen again 
the replica was conceived by andrew hendricks a dermatologist 
who plans to use the half moon as a platform to give history lessons 
on dutch contributions 
hudson himself was born in england but was working for the dutch 
east india company at the time he found the river that bears his 
name 
theres a historical blind spot that keeps historians from 
considering dutch contributions to the new world hendricks said 
thats partly because the english ousted the dutch from their early 
stronghold in the new world in the 1600s he said 
the dutch first settled the area between english colonies in 
virginia and new england including albany the nations oldest 
incorporated city he said 
the ship will spend the summer touring the states once called the 
new netherlands new york connecticut pennsylvania new jersey 
and delaware 
at the christening netherlands consul general adrien tieleman 
said the dutch have always been proud of their small contribution 
to the mightiest most free and prosperous nation in the world 
the half moon replica cost about 1 million raised mostly 
through donations and took a year to build the builders are 
applying finishing touches and the ships maiden voyage is scheduled 
for july 5 
about 25 people worked to build the squarerigged ship which 
will be outfitted with replicas of 17th century cannons said 
shipwright ernie cowan of mayville ny 
sailmaker david bierig of erie pa handsewed the ships nine 
sails about 600 manhours went into the sails made of synthetics 
treated to look like canvas sails of the 1600s he said 
because ships four centuries ago were built for cargo the squat 
half moon wont win any races bierig said 
it will be on the slow side he said sailors were cheap 
and in those days there was no reason you needed speed

the communist chinese propaganda machine is 
working at a frenzied pace to portray the bloody military occupation 
of beijing as a heroic operation against counterrevolutionaries 
the saturation campaign serves to shield the government from 
blame for the june 4 massacre in which hundreds perhaps thousands 
of people died when soldiers fired at unarmed citizens supporting a 
movement for a freer society 
word of the assault on the prodemocracy movement quickly spread 
to several large chinese cities where huge crowds took to the 
streets to demand the fall of conservative leaders who ordered the 
military attack 
but hardliners such as senior leader deng xiaoping and premier li 
peng have kept their grip on power supporting their position with 
the propaganda barrage 
the main vehicle for the campaign has been nationwide television 
after a few days of virtual silence on the attack television 
began showing grainy blackandwhite tapes of angry crowds attacking 
soldiers and torching military vehicles color videotapes of similar 
scenes soon appeared often shown dozens of times over several days 
soldiers indiscriminately firing at crowds or crushing people 
with armored vehicles were not shown neither were scenes of 
hospitals filled with the dead and the injured from the withering 
attack on beijings tiananmen square 
the videotapes often did not have sound perhaps so the audience 
could not hear the gunfire or the angry chants of fascists 
directed at the soldiers 
the official theme of soldiers as victims soon was expanded with 
television showing injured troops lying in hospital beds in one 
particularly gruesome scene an evening newscast showed the charred 
bodies of three soldiers burned to death including one who was 
disemboweled 
the campaign also stresses the theme of soldiers as friends 
under guard of rifletoting soldiers propaganda trucks with signs 
reading the peoples army loves the people rolled down beijings 
main streets with loudspeakers blaring 
scenes of soldiers and citizens helping one another have 
dominated television which in recent days have devoted several 
hours of special newscasts daily to present the government line 
on saturday television showed a peasant bringing three huge pigs 
to applauding soldiers the next days evening newscast showed 
troops at an elementary school playing with children and helping 
them clean their classrooms 
the newest phase of the propaganda onslaught has shown dozens of 
scoundrels and counterrevolutionaries under arrest on 
charges of participating in the demonstrations television has shown 
them questioned at gunpoint and signing confessions 
chinese media also has attacked the us governmentfunded voice 
of america which has provided millions of chinese with an 
independent account of the weekend bloodbath 
in another attempt to quell nonofficial accounts television 
saturday urged viewers to turn in a rumormonger who was shown 
giving a bloody account of the attack on sunday the evening news 
reported his capture and the man was shown expressing remorse to 
security officials 
television interviews with citizens applauding the military 
action increased during the weekend 
it gave use great satisfaction to see the peoples liberation 
army go into the city and put down the turmoil said one man 
several people who were interviewed said they were shocked by the 
attacks on soldiers seen on television i was greatly pained to 
see pla soldiers burned to death and beaten to death primary 
school teacher chen qing told a television reporter 
many chinese are skeptical of the statecontrolled media so it is 
impossible to know how many people find the propaganda campaign 
convincing 
not a single person will believe it said one beijing 
university student who claimed he saw more than 10 people shot in 
tiananmen square by soldiers early june 4 
but some chinese who did not see the weekend events themselves 
could find the relentless television accounts persuasive 
in beijing people know what happened but those on the outside 
do not said another beijing university student most chinese 
are peasants they believe what the government says

discovery that their seat belts made handy tools for breaking 
handcuffs 
the sheriffs office and fbi didnt smile though and are 
warning officers nationwide of the technique 
there is danger to every law enforcement officer in the 
country said franklin county sheriff earl o smith 
ten prisoners learned the seat belt trick while being taken from 
the downtown jail to the jackson pike jail and before the ride was 
over all were free smith said saturday 
when the deputy opened the back of the van all 10 guys were 
smiling and said see what we did smith said adding that each 
prisoner held up his arms to show broken handcuffs 
the cuffs that go around each wrist are connected by a chain 
attached to each cuff by a swivel that moves freely to ensure that 
the chain doesnt twist 
seat belt clips have one or two holes or slots that lock them 
into place with the buckle the prisoners learned that jamming the 
swivel link through a hole on the clip stops the swivel from turning 
freely 
a quick twist of the wrist and the chain shears off at the 
cuff smith said 
the prank led franklin county authorities to issue emergency 
bulletins to law enforcement agencies across the state friday 
similar warnings also would be given nationwide the sheriff said 
and an fbi spokesman said an advisory would be placed in the 
agencys law enforcement bulletin 
although only 10 people know the technique i guarantee that 
the entire jail population all 690 of them will know how to do it 
before the day is up smith said the only people who wont know 
about it is law enforcement officers 
smith ordered seat belts removed from jail vans he also ordered 
that prisoners in police cars be cuffed with their hands behind 
their backs and that the seat belts be locked firmly across them 
handcuff manufacturers were contacted friday and are studying 
ways of redesigning the handcuffs smith said 
the 10 inmates who revealed their discovery may regret the caper 
the sheriff was not amused 
charge them with destruction of county property he told 
deputies well see how funny they think that is

president bush worked on the final details 
sunday of a package of proposals aimed at cleaning up the nations 
air by imposing sharp cuts in acid rain pollutants and reducing the 
smog that plagues most cities 
the proposals to be unveiled at the white house on monday 
represent the first time in nearly a decade that the white house has 
joined in an effort to overhaul federal air quality laws 
president reagan refused to send clean air legislation to 
congress during his eight years in office 
bush told a conservation group last week his proposals would 
represent sweeping changes in federal air pollution laws and 
significantly improve every north americans quality of life 
whether they live near industrial plants or in the woodland 
countryside 
environmentalists say bushs clean air package is his severest 
test so far on whether he plans to make good on campaign promises to 
take environmental issues seriously 
while details of the presidents proposals are not yet clear 
government and congressional sources said the plan is expected to 
include 
requirements for cutting sulfur dioxide emissions mostly from 
older coalburning electric power plants by 10 million tons by the 
year 2000 to combat acid rain which has been blamed for destroying 
lakes streams and forests 
a requirement for industry to install control technology to 
curb the release of cancercausing and other toxic chemicals from 
such facilities as chemical plants and oil refineries it also is 
likely to streamline the way the environmental protection agency 
regulates such chemicals allowing them to set standards by broad 
category rather than chemical by chemical 
reductions in smogcausing pollutants from automobiles through 
a combination of pollution controls and a limited shift to 
alternative cleaner fuels instead of gasoline 
the urban smog problem largely caused by automobile pollutants 
has been among the thorniest issues facing the administration some 
members of the administration have favored requiring specific curbs 
to reduce ozonecausing pollutants while others have favored 
broader flexibility that would allow the oil and automobile 
industries to work out how best to meet governmentimposed targets 
even though the presidents proposals were expected to fall short 
of what some environmentalists sought they welcomed his 
administrations willingness to get involved in efforts to update 
the 1970 clean air act 
congressional leaders have said that they expect revisions to be 
enacted by this congress although probably not until next year 
legislation already has been introduced in the house to require 
stringent reductions in pollutants primarily hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen dioxide from motor vehicles that cause ozone pollution 
which in turn is a key component of smog other bills already being 
considered would require the best available technology to be 
enlisted to curb toxic chemical emissions into the air by industry 
and establish specific benchmarks for cutting acid rain pollutants 
the presidents proposal was expected to be less demanding of 
industry than some of the legislation already before congress 
environmentalists for example have sought a reduction in sulfur 
dioxide from power plants of at least 12 million tons over the next 
decade and have argued for tightening of automobile tailpipe 
emission controls to fight urban pollution 
the utility industry has called those actions too expensive and 
some in the administration particularly the office of management 
and budget and the presidents council of economic advisers have 
agreed 
during a meeting with the president last week on the clean air 
proposals industry representatives pleaded that the proposals not 
be too costly we urged that when the dust settles on clean air 
that we have a healthy economy left said william d fay head of 
the clean air working group a business coalition 
after a later meeting attended by environmentalists the 
president was told that pollution itself also is costly as well as 
being pervasive 
to make the point they provided a chart showing that during a 
week last summer the air in kennebunkport maine where the 
president has a vacation retreat had ozone concentrates that were 
unhealthy by federal definition on two of the seven days 
he sat there and said im not safe anywhere and we said 
yes and its worse in houston connecticut and washington 
recalled paul prichard one of the environmentalists at the meeting

a soviet defector has been telling us 
government agencies some of the inner secrets of a little understood 
kremlin body that plays a key role in charting soviet foreign policy 
under soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the international 
department of the communist party central committee has shifted 
course loosening its ties with marxist parties in the west and 
cultivating relations with other less radical elements said the 
defector evgeny novikov 
gorbachev started to promote the principles of his new 
thinking to find new clients sometimes at the expense of old 
clients to find parties and groups that have influence in 
capitalist countries novikov said in a recent interview with the 
associated press 
the new approach has brought closer soviet ties to american and 
western european environmental and peace groups that agree with 
gorbachevs approach to disarmament and attempts to lessen 
international tension said novikov 
because his work in the international department centered on arab 
and middle eastern affairs novikov declined to speculate on which 
western groups were sympathetic to gorbachevs new approach 
us intelligence officials who said they were not familar with 
the specifics of novikovs case confirmed that novikovs 
description met their understanding of the international department 
they said most us and western european groups were 
sophisticated enough to remain independent even while developing 
contacts with soviet officials known to be linked to the 
international department 
the international department for which novikov worked from 1970 
until his defection last year was the successor to the comintern 
or communist international or later the cominform disbanded by 
josef stalin in 1947 
the comintern was the main organ of kremlin influence on 
communist parties outside the soviet union a means of molding 
political platforms and sometimes recruiting intelligence agents 
according to numerous accounts by defectors 
the international department shares with the foreign ministry 
responsibility for formulating soviet foreign policy which is 
decided by the ruling politburo novikov said the foreign ministry 
carries out statetostate contacts while the international 
department handles partytoparty matters 
senior international department experts are driven in chauffeured 
cars receive salaries equal to those of deputy ministers and have 
access to intelligence reports from the ministries of defense and 
foreign affairs and the kgb novikov said in a paper prepared for 
the us government 
shortly after gorbachev rose to power in march 1985 he tried to 
gain control of the international department and change its inner 
workings by appointing as its chief anatoly dobrynin who had served 
as the soviet ambassador to washington since the 1960s 
dobrynin however was very much an outsider to the moscow 
bureaucracy novikov said thus dobrynins reform attempts 
foundered forcing gorbachev to move him from the central committee 
secretariat into a newly created post as adviser 
the old timers in the international department opposed 
dobrynin said novikov the old cadres sabotaged dobryinin 
last fall gorbachev reorganized the central committee 
secretariat naming his righthand man aleksandr yakovlev as head 
of a newly created international commission which controls the 
international department 
the new head of the international department is valentin falin a 
former ambassador to west germany 
before the reorganization said novikov many of the senior 
officials in the international department dated back to the days of 
mikhail suslov and boris ponomarev two stalinist holdovers who 
served under the late soviet leader leonid brezhnev 
novikov lectured from 1970 to 1985 in the institute for social 
sciences which he described as a secret school run by the 
international department in moscow his job was to conduct seminars 
in political philosophy for small groups of students from marxist 
parties in south yemen syria and iraq and for two radical 
palestinian groups the democratic front for the liberation of 
palestine and the peoples front for the liberation of palestine 
professors at the institute drew up classified reports on those 
movements based in part on what the students said in class 
for example i made a study of the yemeni socialist party its 
origins history influence of marxism influence of islam 
influence on the masses said novikov 
from 1985 until his defection novikov was chief of the arabic 
editorial office of the world marxist review in prague 
czechoslovakia 
arabic versions of the magazine were printed mostly in western 
countries and distributed in various arab countries under titles 
very different from the original 
the goal was to pretend it was a national magazine produced in 
each nation but 70100 percent of it was prepared in prague 
under directions from the international department said novikov 
nowhere did it say it was printed in prague one percent of the 
readers would know where it came from 
novikov crossed the border in austria in march 1988 was given 
asylum by the us embassy there and spent the next seven months 
briefing western officials 
novikov who has the soviet equivalent of a doctorate has been 
living in the united states since last september working as a 
butler in a small hotel while he tries to launch a career as a 
consultant in soviet affairs 
in contrast to past soviet defectors who complained about 
insensitivity on the part of their cia handlers novikov said he 
met with a very human attitude from the united states government

millions of dollars of special interest money 
is expected to prime the political pumps as republicans battle for 
three historically democratic seats in races spawned by the 
congressional ethics wars and the death of claude pepper 
youre going to see candidates in all of these races spending a 
good deal of time trying to squeeze money out of the lobbyists and 
theres no doubt that millions of dollars special interest funds 
will pour in says michael waldman of congress watch a citizens 
group based here 
the stakes are not momentous since democrats control the house 
259 to 175 and even a republican sweep would not change things 
much for that matter registered democrats predominate in all three 
districts 
but republicans lost face in april with specialelection defeats 
in alabama and indiana even though they held on in wyoming they 
want to avenge those losses in the upcoming round democrats on the 
other hand want to avoid the embarrassment of an upset 
the three districts are 
the 12th district of texas taking in much of fort worth jim 
wright who has represented it since 1955 stepped down as house 
speaker on may 31 at the end of a yearlong ethics probe and is 
expected to resign from the house itself by the end of the month 
the 15th district of california in the rich cotton fruit and 
vegetablegrowing san joaquin valley the nations premier center of 
agribusiness house majority whip tony coelho who represented the 
district since 1979 announced on may 27 that he would resign to 
head off a protracted controversy over a 100000 junk bond 
purchase 
the 18th district of florida taking in much of miami miami 
beach key biscayne and coral gables rules chairman claude pepper 
died may 30 after representing the district since 1962 
there is no denying that the races will cost a bundle 
were talking about 500000 at this point but if we have to 
go higher i guess we can says modesto calif mayor carole 
whiteside already an announced candidate but i want to earn this 
race i dont want to buy it 
candidates in aprils indiana race spent 500000 each as did 
contestants in a wyoming election where republicans eked out victory 
on april 29 need for money and lack of time most likely will send 
the new set of candidates scurrying to washington lobbies that have 
plenty of ready cash as well as long legislative shopping lists 
i would think that the democrats would do what theyve done 
already which is to organize labor union political action 
committees to turn on the spigot and republicans will do what we 
can to reach out to the business pacs to help raise money for 
republicans says john buckley spokesman for the national 
republican congressional committee 
in texas senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen already 
is putting out word that he backs fort worth attorney pete geren 
geren 37 a former bentsen staffer is unlikely to announce 
however until after wright leaves or at least sets a specific date 
for his departure other democrats being mentioned as possible 
contenders include state sen hugh parmer and former state rep mike 
millsap as well as fort worth councilman gary gilley 
republicans include state rep billy carter television health 
show host dr bob lanier airport board member erma johnson former 
republican county chairman jim ryan and county judge roy english 
who switched to the gop at a heavily ballyhooed white house ceremony 
in 1986 
under texas law candidates from both parties slug it out in a 
single special election with a runoff between the two top vote 
getters if no one gains a majority 
in california democratic state rep gary condit is also 
campaigning 
condit 41 is a member of the gang of five conservative 
democrats who warred with liberal assembly speaker willie brown in 
1988 i was stripped of all my committee assignments and had my 
office moved about once a month condit chortles 
the antics helped condit fighting with willie brown didnt 
hurt him at all because fighting with a liberal in that district is 
what you want to do says gop consultant george gorton of san 
diego 
water availability and quality loom as crucial issues in 
district where farmers are also irked by pollution damage to crops 
from autos of increasingly numerous commuters to bay area jobs both 
candidates vow to shun negative campaigning 
whiteside does say however that my opponent already has been 
involved in special interest politics in sacramento and sacramento 
frankly is not a whole lot better than washington im glad i 
wasnt there 
only one other democrat has been mentioned as a possible 
contender state rep rusty areias dlos banos another gang of 
five member republicans include stanislaus county chairman 
barbara keatingedh fresno county supervisor daran koligian fresno 
councilman rod anaforian merced businessman terry newman and highly 
decorated vietnam veteran chris patterakis 
under california law candidates of both parties are lumped in 
one race if no one gains a majority the top republican fights the 
leading democrat in a runoff 
the florida election set for aug 29 puts the spotlight on the 
sizeable cubanamerican community in the miami area 
pepper won their hearts with tv ads in spanish and firm backing 
for nicaraguas contra rebels while cementing ties with just about 
every other ethnic group in one way or another in 1988 the 
88yearold lawmaker ran without opposition 
battle lines are drawn again however with two cubanamericans 
already in the race on the republican side state sen ileana 
roslehtinen and millionaire banana importer carlos perez a 
prominent supporter of former president reagan and lt col oliver 
north 
among democrats state sen jack gordon a onetime claude pepper 
business partner who plans to get in the race this week 
acknowledges that his stand against contra aid could be vexing as 
a matter of fact the rightwing cubans threw rocks and eggs at me 
at an anticontra demonstration he says he says he has a strategy 
to counteract the problem that he will reveal this week 
i think the chances are pretty good for a cubanamerican to be 
elected said democratic strategist sergio bendixen 
already announced among republicans are state sen ileana 
roslehtinen and millionaire banana importer carlos perez a 
highprofile supporter of former president reagan and lt col 
oliver north 
also mentioned as a possible contenders was gop state sen al 
gutman democrats include hialeah mayor raul martinez commissioner 
rosario kennedy miami beach mayor alex daoud dade county 
commissioner joe gersten state attorney janet reno and former 
school board chairman paul cejas

american burn experts flew to the ural mountains on 
sunday to treat hundreds of victims of a huge gas explosion that 
engulfed two trains in flames official media said more than 400 
people have now died in the tragedy 
authorities said the death toll likely would climb especially if 
severely burned patients do not receive immediate treatment 
we are close to the most critical stage for patients russian 
federation health minister a potapov told the government newspaper 
izvestia 
izvestia said only 32 of the 805 people hospitalized following 
the june 4 blast had recovered sufficiently to be discharged while 
another 114 including 28 children had died 
at the site of the huge explosion along the transsiberian 
railway 308 bodies including the remains of 67 children have been 
found to date the paper said these are terrifying figures but 
they are not final it said 
just one search party in which passengers relatives took part 
located the remains of three more victims friday izvestia said 
previously staterun media had said more than 190 of the 
approximately 1200 passengers aboard the trains were killed when a 
spark from the railways electrical line ignited a highly flammable 
mixture of benzine and propanebutane gas that leaked from a 
pipeline about a half mile away 
the trains traveling in opposite directions between siberias 
largest city novosibirsk and the black sea resort city of adler 
had made unscheduled stops in the valley in the ural mountains one 
train was carrying schoolchildren to vacation camps in the southern 
soviet union 
the blast had the force of 10000 tons of tnt half as strong as 
the abomb that fell on hiroshima said gen mikhail moiseyev chief 
of the soviet militarys general staff but its true human costs are 
only now becoming apparent 
a government commission looking into the accident which occurred 
750 miles southeast of moscow concluded sunday that the 
dimensions of the june 34 railway tragedy are much broader than 
supposed before the tass news agency reported from the ural 
mountain city of ufa 
the commission said the number of passengers aboard the two 
trains was greater than originally believed but that even now it is 
impossible to cite excat numbers 
night and day in the hospitals of ufa the fight continues for 
the lives of the injured tass added 
a group of us medics flew into ufa on sunday and headed 
straight for the citys hospitals to begin helping accident victims 
tass said all the doctors are specialists in treating burns and 
the group brought its own drugs and equipment tass said 
the 17member team from the institute of surgical research at 
brooke army medical center in san antonio texas stopped saturday 
in west germany on its way to the soviet union the groups leader 
lt col william becker said the medics expected to remain in the 
soviet union for up to 10 days 
what weve been told is that there are more than 100 children 
with serious burns and in addition to that there are an unknown 
number of adults with significant burns becker told the 
associated press in frankfurt 
he said the group responding to a request for aid from the 
soviets was bringing 18000 pounds of medical supplies on its giant 
c141 transport plane as well as three russianlanguage translators 
and two administrative officers 
staterun television reported last week that 50 percent of the 
injured suffered burns over more than 70 percent of their bodies 
health minister yevgeny chazov says soviet doctors lack 
experience in treating such severe burns and the soviets appealed 
for advice and urgent airlifts of equipment from west germany 
italy japan and the united states 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other officials have charged 
that workers in charge of the pipeline noticed a drop in pressure 
caused by the leak but increased pressure instead of shutting the 
line down 
kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov has told izvestia the soviet secret 
police sent a team of investigators to the accident site to learn 
what had happened

the head of the east german government says 
president bushs proposal for a reduction in conventional arms in 
europe is a welcome step that is in tune with warsaw pact desires 
for speedy negotiations according to a published report 
the washington post also quoted erich honecker in its sunday 
edition as confirming that east german border guards have been 
ordered not to use deadly force to stop civilians who attempt to 
flee into west germany unless the soldiers are threatened themselves 
in a twohour interview conducted last wednesday in east berlin 
the post quoted the influential warsaw pact leader as saying the 
bush proposal for nato and warsaw pact nations to cut conventional 
arms is close to our striving for radical conventional 
disarmament 
questioned on bushs call to lock in reductions in tanks 
artillery armed personnel carriers and other nonnuclear forces in 
vienna during a 23nation negotiation on conventional forces in 
europe the paper quoted honecker as replying 
we are interested in having those proposals included in the 
negotiations so that we can identify where the warsaw treaty states 
concur with nato and those areas where more intensive negotiations 
are needed 
as to nuclear arms he said we are in favor of the 
stepbystep elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in europe of 
course we know that this cant be done in one stroke he raised 
the possibility that each side might decide to keep say 10 
weapons 
one has to enter negotiations and see what progress can be 
achieved said honecker who is head of state and general 
secretary of the east german communist party sometimes surprises 
even occur 
he rejected bushs call for the berlin wall to be torn down but 
said his government wants to humanize the border regime as part 
of generally improving relations with western europe and the united 
states 
honecker said east german border guards are authorized to shoot 
people trying to flee the country only if the guards are in physical 
danger or if a soldier or other uniformed person is trying to desert 
he did not say when the restrictions took effect but western 
officials have said the policy apparently was adopted as a goodwill 
gesture prior to honeckers visit to west germany in 1987 
although 190 people have died trying to flee east germany since 
the wall was built in 1961 there has been only one confirmed case 
since the 1987 honecker visit to west berlin

the government has moved to silence three top 
dissidents who share a passion for democracy an internationally 
known astrophysicist his college professor wife and a shaggyhaired 
accountant 
the public security department issued an arrest warrant for 
astrophysicist fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian who are hiding 
in the us embassy in beijing 
meanwhile abc news quoted chinese sources as saying another 
dissident ren wanding was arrested late saturday 
fang 53 is the most prominent dissident in china he was 
expelled from the communist party in 1987 on charges of having 
helped provoke an earlier series of student prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
after his expulsion fang continued to condemn marxism as a 
failure and to urge democratic change in this authoritarian 
communist state he also sent an open letter to deng xiaoping in 
january calling for the release of political prisoners 
many people dont agree with marxism even workers and 
students he said in an interview with the associated press last 
year even people of my generation dont believe in marxism 
the beijing observatory professor was at the center of a 
uschinese controversy in february when chinese police prevented 
him from attending a banquet given by visiting us president george 
bush 
although he kept a low profile during the recent studentled 
demonstrations for democracy fang told the associated press just 
before he disappeared into the us embassy that he feared he would 
be arrested as part of a crackdown on liberal intellectuals 
his wife is a professor of physics at beijing university the 
countrys most prestigious school and also has criticized the lack 
of democracy in china 
she was elected a deputy to the peoples congress of beijings 
haidian district by beijing university students 
ren wanding does not have the international standing enjoyed by 
fang but nonetheless has waged a crusade for human rights and 
democracy in china 
ren 44 was jailed in 197983 after helping edit an underground 
prodemocracy magazine after a long silence he renewed his call 
for multiparty democracy late last year with an open letter to the 
un human rights commission and a 22page essay on freedom 
after the recent prodemocracy movement began he went to 
universities and studentoccupied tiananmen square to read his 
essays on political reform but ren insisted he had no formal 
connection with the student protesters 
at a news conference two week ago ren told reporters he feared 
arrest but defended his actions and speeches i must speak he 
said it is my fate to do such things

to mark 50th anniversaries of the classics the wizard of oz and 
gone with the wind 
talking trees from oz paraded in grand rapids minn saturday 
and a barbecue in cadiz ohio recreated the lawn party at twelve 
oaks home of ashley wilkes on the eve of the civil war in gwtw 
no one seemed to pay much mind that neither garland nor gable 
showed much interest in their tiny hometowns after shaking the dust 
from their heels on their respective roads to hollywood and stardom 
folks in both towns are hoping that more hoopla about their famous 
former residents will boost tourism 
garland best known as as dorthy in oz was born in grand 
rapids as frances gumm she who died in london in 1969 would have 
been 67 saturday 
gable was born feb 1 1901 in hopedale ohio 10 miles from 
saturdays festivities but a monument to the actor is in cadiz 
where he lived as a child the gawky bigeared boy never returned 
to harrison county after moving to akron in 1917 
known as the king of hollywood during his heyday gable 
played the confederate blockaderunner rhett butler in gone with 
the wind while vivien leigh played the southern belle scarlett 
ohara 
in grand rapids on saturday lawn chairs and strollers were

i got the role by default ms conlon recalled my older 
sister was cast for the part but by the time the shooting began 
she was too old to play bonnie blue 
curtis said he appeared in the film because gable was a friend of 
his fathers when i was older he took me for a ride in his new 
jaguar he said that is the thoughtful kind of person he was 
grand rapids which was renamed the emerald city for the nineday

two unions and the seven socalled baby bells 
spawned by the 1984 atampt breakup begin contract talks this month a 
splintered and complex process affecting more than 350000 workers 
in 48 states and the district of columbia 
across the tables from unions at negotiations in seven cities 
will be representatives from the highly profitable regional phone 
companies several of which were hit by strikes three years ago in 
their first postdivestiture negotiations 
both sides had problems in 1986 communications workers of 
america president morton bahr said in an interview last week 
there was no blueprint there were people involved who had never 
negotiated a contract before 
the unions cwa and the international brotherhood of electrical 
workers say the blueprint for this years talks is the recent 
agreement they reached with american telephone amp telegraph co 
which includes wage and pension increases a profitsharing plan and 
an innovative package of benefits dealing with parental and elder 
care leaves and child care 
spokesmen for the regional phone companies however say they do 
not feel obligated to match the atampt contract 
wed be reluctant to acknowledge that any patterns have been 
set said nynex spokesman robert obrien things will vary from 
one region of the country to another and i dont think we want to be 
locked into any feeling that a pattern has been set we want to 
start at the beginning 
added bellsouths terry johnson we are different companies 
facing different circumstances and what atampt and the cwa doe is 
between that company and those union members ours is a completely 
different situation as far as we are concerned 
nonetheless atampt briefed officials representing all of the 
regional companies last week 
for nynex parent company for the local phone service providers 
in new york and most of new england the beginning of the talks is 
tuesday the same day the unions first sit down for formal 
negotiations with us west which provides service to 14 states in 
the midwest and west and pacific telesis which serves nevada and 
california 
talks between the unions and two of the companies begin monday 
they are ameritech parent company of local phone companies in 
indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin and bellsouth which serves 
nine southeastern states 
negotiations with bell atlantic which serves six midatlantic 
states and the district of columbia open on june 19 and the final 
baby bell southwestern bell which serves arkansas kansas 
missouri oklahoma and texas will open formal negotiations june 26 
four of the contracts expire aug 5 the others aug 12 except 
for ameritechs illinois bell which faces a july 1 deadline and has 
already begun negotiations 
parts of nynex us west and ameritech were struck in 1986 bahr 
said the unions were making preparations for strikes this year as 
well but said he was optimistic settlements would be reached by the 
deadlines 
cwa represents all but 32000 of the 352000 union workers at the 
seven companies with ibew representing the others 
the unions have a nationwide agenda that will dominate all of the 
talks but there are a number of local issues as well 
the national issues will mirror those in the atampt talks with 
health insurance again likely to emerge as the major hurdle to 
settlements 
bahr identified nynex and pacific telesis as the companies with 
which he expected the greatest fight over health insurance 
ameritech bellsouth and southwestern bell already have in place 
many of the costcontainment measures that were inserted into the 
recent atampt agreement 
the unions also want all of the companies to offer profit 
sharing some now offer performancerelated bonuses but the unions 
say they are inadequate 
another provision of the atampt contract the unions will be seeking 
in the regional talks is company participation in a lobbying effort 
designed to curb rising health care costs through revisions in 
federal policy 
bahr said he was optimistic the companies would sign on but said 
the larger problem will be getting them major employers from other 
industries lawmakers and interest groups to reach consensus on a 
strategy 
as for local issues disputes over job titles and use of outside 
contracts likely will surface at all of the regional talks nynex is 
the only one of the baby bells still offering cost of living 
adjustments to its workers and any attempt by the company to 
eliminate those would be meet heavy resistance from union 
negotiators

companies are handing out 5000 
checks paying hotel bills and promising more help for people whose 
lowincome neighborhood was ravaged by a runaway train and exploding 
pipeline 
but many furious survivors are afraid to return home and worry 
they wont recover their losses particularly lesstangible losses 
like a drop in property values 
i dont like the neighborhood any more theres not much of it 
left said plumber mark kingston 30 
kingston lived 1 blocks from the row of duffy street homes 
demolished one month ago monday when an overloaded freight train 
speeding down from cajon pass at 90 mph derailed on a curve 
after the wreck calnev pipe line co inspected its 14inch 
pipeline buried next to the southern pacific tracks and assured 
residents they could safely return home the 250mile pipeline 
provides 90 percent of las vegas gasoline and supplies three air 
force bases with gasoline diesel and jet fuel 
but on may 25 the pipeline ruptured spewing gasoline that 
exploded in a fireball and engulfed homes spared by the train wreck 
the toll of the twin disasters six people dead 42 injured 800 
to 1000 evacuated and at least 22 homes destroyed significantly 
damaged or considered unsafe to reoccupy 
trains are running again after failed legal efforts by the city 
and residents gasoline resumed flowing friday through the repaired 
and reinforced 600foot section of pipe 
southern pacific transportation co calnev and government 
officials again are telling residents of the roughly 200 homes in 
the subdivision that its safe to go home 
this is probably the most looked at and examined pipeline in 
the united states calnev spokesman richard kline said 
i would not hesitate moving back into this neighborhood said 
anthony andrukaitis vice president of chicagobased gatx terminals 
corp calnevs parent company 
they told us that after the derailment said duffy street 
resident paul evans jr 21 everybody believed it and moved back 
in and what happens it blows up after they say they checked it 
they messed up and im never going by their word again 
police sgt george finkle estimated that by sunday only 40 
percent of the evacuated residents had returned 
we deeply regret that this occurred andrukaitis said the 
only thing calnev can do is everything in its power to work with the 
citizens and elected officials to get them back to where they were 
calnev and southern pacific agreed to pay the citys costs and 
buy the 22 homes most of which have been razed they are footing 
hotel and restaurant bills until monday for evacuees from undamaged 
homes 
the companies distributed dozens of 5000 checks to heads of 
evacuated households recipients still can sue 
andrukaitis and southern pacific claims manager floyd parker 
estimate the companies will spend tens of millions of dollars 
southern pacific accepted full blame for the derailment the 
national transportation safety board is investigating calnevs 
postderailment pipeline inspection and whether the pipeline was 
dented or cracked by the train wreck 
calnev acknowledged it visually inspected only portions of the 
pipe 
duffy street residents like dwight pledger believe another 
derailment is possible 
we cant go back the fear the apprehension and anxiety 
said the 36yearold real estate agent ive got to make mortgage 
payments on a place i cant even live in real estate values are 
just gone they ought to clear the whole area 
were not going to buy the whole neighborhood parker 
replied southern pacific lawyer douglas stephenson said the 
railroad and calnev will establish a panel of retired judges to 
arbitrate claims by residents who say their property values 
plummeted 
stephenson predicted most claims will be settled without 
lawsuits parker said residents soon will realize we really are 
intending to right as much of the problem as is possible 
thats not good enough for many 
it was a nice neighborhood said retiree jack samuels it 
was quiet and we could let our kids run loose 
now said angela kingston 19 weve got to worry about 
them blowing up

moslem rebels said sunday they 
ambushed and killed an afghan army colonel and nine soldiers on the 
main road linking afghanistans capital and the besieged eastern 
city of jalalabad 
the soviet news agency tass meanwhile said guerrillas launched 
another attack on jalalabad during the weekend with rockets and 
artillery killing 10 people and injuring 16 it said considerable 
damage was done to the city and that the cities of herat and 
gardiz also were under fire 
insurgents known as the mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors 
ambushed three government convoys on wednesday and thursday along a 
40mile stretch of the road linking jalalabad and kabul the rebel 
afghan news agency said 
the agency said 10 soldiers were killed including a colonel and 
27 were wounded one officer deserted to the mujahedeen the agency 
said 
qaribur rehman saeed head of the news agency said he did not 
know the colonels identity there was no independent confirmation 
of the attack 
the mujahedeen backed principally by pakistan and the united 
states have besieged jalalabad since march 6 three weeks after 
soviet troops ended nine years of intervention on behalf of the 
communist regime 
the guerrillas have rendered the communistheld airport unsafe 
but supplies have been dropped by air to government forces a few 
armored convoys have fought their way through from the west 
the guerrilla news agency said 51 communist soldiers have died 
and 54 have been wounded in fighting around afghanistan since june 7 
the tass report said that the afghan air force attacked enemy 
positions outside jalalabad killing 270 guerrillas it claimed 12 
were pakistani military personnel 
the soviet union has accused pakistan of aiding the rebels and 
violating the accord that resulted in the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from the country pakistan has denied that its troops have 
aided the guerrillas 
meanwhile two of the most powerful mujahedeen groups the 
jamiatiislami of burhanuddin rabbani and the hezbiislami of 
gulbaddin hekmatyar both based in pakistan denied claims by the 
kabul government that guerrilla commanders approached the communists 
for a truce 
the regimes claims that the mujahedeen commanders have 
contacted them is based on fabrication and falsehood they 
said in a joint statement 
they said it was a ploy by afghan president najib to sow discord 
among rebel groups 
the writing on the wall is clear the puppet regimes days are 
numbered the statement said 
guerrilla leaders predicted the ruling peoples democratic party 
of afghanistan would fall quickly after the soviet troop withdrawal 
but najib has cited his forces tenacious defense of jalalabad as 
proof that his government has the power to survive 
he has offered repeated deals to the rebels to end the fighting 
and recently launched a propaganda campaign indicating the 
insurgents were pressing for peace 
but guerrilla leaders who want to establish an islamic republic 
in afghanistan have rejected overtures from kabul 
afghanistans ruling party seized power in a 1978 military coup 
sparking the moslem insurgency

hundreds of protesters and even some police 
officers wept as two chinese diplomats made a surprise and emotional 
public appeal for political asylum and rally organizers sunday 
predicted more defections 
many of my friends have lost their lives and we wanted to do 
something to show we support what they stood for said one of the 
diplomats during a rally saturday night against chinas repression 
of the prodemocracy movement 
compared to them i am not brave at all added the man who 
was not immediately identified they are brave for standing up for 
democracy in the face of death or imprisonment 
the two men identified as a vice consul for cultural affairs and 
an overseas affairs officer told the crowd of 5000 they decided to 
defect after beijing leaders launched a propaganda campaign claiming 
no citizens died in the clash 
chinese troops opened fire on tens of thousands of students and 
beijing residents june 4 to put an end to the sevenweek 
prodemocracy movement and the sitin at the citys tiananmen 
square us intelligence estimates put the number of people slain 
in the hundreds and possibly the thousands 
we are supposed to tell you that no one was injured or killed 
why because we are diplomats but we wont fake it here before we 
are diplomats we are chinese and we are human beings one of the 
men told the crowd 
we are public servants we are not slaves he added 
the whereabouts of the diplomats sunday were not immediately 
known 
the fbi would not release their names but confirmed the two 
requested political asylum a bureau spokeswoman sunday said only 
that their case would be handled by the immigration and 
naturalization service 
a staffer in the office of david ilchert ins regional director 
said sunday morning the two had not filed an asylum request he 
would not give his name 
to obtain political asylum an applicant must show a wellfounded 
fear of persecution in their homeland 
in washington state department spokeswoman daria novak said the 
department had no immediate comment on the situation 
telephone calls to the chinese consulate went unanswered 
organizers at the rally and candlelight memorial said at first 
they refused to allow the consulate officials to address the crowd 
outside city hall even later when event organizers were convinced 
of their sincerity three people were posted alongside the diplomats 
on stage to yank them off in case of trouble 
we didnt know if theyd start a riot or what and it was a 
complete surprise for everyone when they said what they did said 
humphrey wou a member of the chinese christian mission one of the 
sponsors of the rally 
but then we were ecstatic and everybody was hugging them and 
crying and saying that they were true chinese and very very 
brave wou said he said he saw several police officers weeping 
after the announcement 
wou and other rally organizers predicted there would be other 
defections from chinese consulates in the united states 
we are encouraging this sort of thing to happen and expect more 
people to come out of these consulates to freedom said steve lu 
general coordinator of san franciscobased support democracy in 
china however wou said he expects most chinese students eventually 
to return home to support the prodemocracy cause 
lee mankar an editor at san franciscos chinese times on 
sunday identified the two from their business cards as zhou liming 
26 vice consul for cultural affairs and zhang liman 25 acting 
consul for overseas affairs he said both had been in the united 
states for 2 years and were unmarried 
he estimated that the total number of chinese staff members and 
dependents at the consulate was 300 to 400 
wou said the diplomats told him they had walked to the rally 
after finishing dinner at the chinese consulate about a halfmile 
away on the way they stopped at a public telephone and called the 
fbi which escorted them to an undisclosed location from the rally 
the defections were announced in chinese and english at the 
protest where a largely asian crowd denounced the beijing 
government many wore black arm bands and carried banners reading 
their blood our tears

in an odd way indianapolis art dealer peg 
goldberg feels honored 
very few people in the united states have had the privilege of 
being sued not only by a country but by a religion goldberg said 
following the conclusion of a sixday civil trial in us district 
court last week 
the republic of cyprus and the autocephalous greek orthodox 
church of cyprus are demanding the return of four sixthcentury 
christian mosaics taken from a church in northern cyprus in 1979 
the works were purchased by goldberg last summer 
goldberg says she fell in love with the rare byzantine pieces and 
purchased them for 11 million only after her investigation turned 
up no evidence they had been reported stolen she later offered them 
for sale for 20 million but they are off the market pending the 
outcome of the lawsuit 
judge james e nolands decision which is not expected until 
august at the earliest could rest on two legal questions 
did goldberg act recklessly and hastily when she purchased the 
mosaics during a fourday visit to switzerland in july 
did cyprus diligently seek the return of the mosaics and try to 
notify the international art community after it learned the works 
were stolen in 1979 
at stake are not only the spiritual treasures of one of the 
earliest christian religions but also the status of antiquities in 
united states museums and around the world analysts say 
goldbergs actions were criticized in testimony from three 
witnesses a harvard university law professor and curators at the j 
paul getty museum in malibu calif and walters art gallery in 
baltimore md 
gary vikan of the baltimore gallery said the objects 
circumstances and people involved in goldbergs purchase should have 
warned her away 
among those who brought goldberg into the deal were an 
indianapolis art dealer who has used three names and a dutchman who 
has been convicted of art forgery in france court records show 
the dutchman michel van rijn is wellknown as a shady 
dealer who markets stolen art vikan testified but goldberg 
testified she liked van rijn and he seemed to have universal respect 
in amsterdam 
there wasnt anyplace that we went that somebody didnt come 
out of a shop and say hi michel she said we were always 
bumping into people he would chat with and introduce me to 
the roughly 2footsquare mosaics which depict the heads of 
jesus as a boy the apostles james and matthew and an archangel 
were taken from a wartorn area of northern cyprus under control of 
a breakaway turkish state recognized only by turkey 
vikan testified he would have walked away from the purchase 
new york art dealer andre emmerich a former president of the art 
dealers association of america said he might have gone ahead 
when confronted by a really major work of art and its 
perfectly clear the piece is authentic and of unequaled quality i 
might well have proceeded the same way my god yes emmerich 
testified on goldbergs behalf 
emmerich also testified he felt goldberg had left no stone 
unturned in her investigation 
i think her inquiry met the best professional standards 
emmerich said i couldnt have expected more 
goldberg seemed incredulous at the suggestion she would sacrifice 
her business and the livelihood of her partner george feldman by 
purchasing stolen artwork 
who in their right mind can imagine that we would borrow one 
million dollars to buy stolen property she said 
goldbergs attorneys tried to prove cyprus gave up claim to the 
mosaics when greek cypriots fled the village of lythrankomi in 1976 
leaving the church and its mosaics unattended turkish forces had 
taken control of the area stifling the rights of greek citizens 
greek cypriots testified 
did in fact southern cyprus have a right to lay claim to 
something in northern cyprus goldberg asked 
six greek cypriot officials testified how they tried to recover 
the mosaics against political and bureaucratic roadblocks erected by 
the division of their country 
they said they notified museums and agencies of the theft issued 
press releases and sent representatives to speak about stolen 
cypriot antiquities at international art conferences 
however none of them could say they had notified interpol an 
international police agency or tried to pursue aydin dikmen the 
turk who sold the mosaics to goldberg and who had been publicly 
linked to the mosaics in 1982

one of every four us households was the 
target of a violent crime or theft in 1988 the same proportion as 
the previous three years the justice department said sunday 
this proportion remained at the lowest level since the bureau of 
justice statistics began calculating the household rate in 1975 
that year almost one in three households was the target of a 
violent crime 
in 1988 27 percent of households with incomes of 25000 or 
more 29 percent of black households and 30 percent of urban 
households were touched by crime the report found adding that 
hispanic households remained more vulnerable to crime than 
nonhispanic households 
geographically households in the northeast were the least 
vulnerable to crime with 19 percent hit while those in the west 
suffered the most with 303 percent about 249 percent of 
midwestern households and 244 percent of southern households were 
hit the report found 
the report based on the national crime survey covered 929 
million households and found that 228 million experienced a theft 
or burglary or had a member who was raped robbed or assaulted 
the bureau of justice statistics does not include murders in the 
survey because it relies on a polling technique based on what the 
crime victim says and then estimates a total amount of crime 
nationwide 
murder statistics would not change the overall figures for 
household crimes the bureau said other crimes not measured by the 
crime survey include kidnapping and arson 
overall members of about 141000 households were raped 872000 
were robbed and 37 million were assaulted and the bureau found a 
total of 719 million households or one in 13 were targeted by 
crimes of high concern including rape robbery assault by a 
stranger or a burglar 
black households 29 percent of which were touched by crime were 
significantly more vulnerable to crime than white households of 
which 239 percent were targeted the bureau found 
in addition black households were more likely than white 
households if victimized to be victimized by a serious violent 
crime or a crime of high concern the report said 
a total of 16 percent of the black households touched by crime in 
1988 had a member suffer a rape robbery or aggravated assault 
while 9 percent of white households had a member who suffered from 
one of those crimes according to the study 
the bureau in trying to explain the overall downward trend in 
the householdstouchedbycrime indicator since 1975 said 
population movements and changes in household composition 
undoubtedly affected it 
in addition to a movement away from the northeast and midwest in 
the south and west as well as away from urban areas into suburban 
and rural areas the report noted that the average american 
household decreased in size during the 197588 period 
oneperson households represented 21 percent of all households 
in 1975 but 25 percent in 1988 which the percentage of households 
containing six or more people fell from 7 percent to 3 percent the 
report said 
if a household contains more people it is more vulnerable to 
crime particularly for personal crimes since larger households have

presidentelect carlos menem will 
assume power several months ahead of schedule in an agreement being 
worked out with argentinas lameduck leader raul alfonsin 
officials said sunday 
the arrangement would allow menem to begin tackling the nations 
crippling economic problems sometime this summer rather than wait 
until december when he is scheduled to take over from president 
alfonsin 
i have no doubt he doesnt want to stay until dec 10 juan 
manuel casella an official of the governing radical civic union 
said of alfonsin there will be an accord shortly 
casella was the governing party candidate for vice president in 
the may 14 elections which were won by menem of the peronist party 
under the constitution menem is scheduled to take office on dec 
10 
but with the economy in chaos and food riots in early june that 
left 14 dead many people have called on alfonsin to step aside 
sooner 
although no date was set in weekend talks between the two main 
parties alfonsin might hand over power in the first half of august 
said eduardo menem the senate president and a key adviser to his 
older brother 
presidentelect menem has said he wont push alfonsin to step 
down early but last week after he appointed a cabinet and fleshed 
out an economic plan the peronist said he was prepared to take 
power any time 
shortly after the peronist election landslide alfonsin offered 
to step down early but he could not agree with menem on terms the 
main differences were over economic policies and how alfonsin could 
leave office without resigning 
menem also insisted that peronist congressmen who won election 
with him take office when he does and that the trials of military 
officers charged with human rights abuse during the 197683 
dictatorship be resolved by alfonsin 
the military situation stems from the current government and i 
consider it convenient that the answer and the solution be granted 
by this government menem said 
in an apparent solution worked out over the weekend the 
electoral college would meet early to confirm menems victory and 
congress would modify the law that sets the transition day that 
would allow alfonsin to step down without resigning 
in addition radical civic union congressmen would agree to 
support whatever legislation menem deemed necessary to stabilize the 
economy which has soared out of control under alfonsin 
hyperinflation economic recession and high unemployment caused 
food riots in which argentines looted supermarkets and grocery 
stores alfonsin declared a nationwide state of siege 
alfonsin has tried to cut the budget deficit a main cause of 
inflation by cutting government spending and raising tariffs for 
public services the measures coupled with inflation expected to 
reach 70 percent this month have torn into pocketbooks and prompted 
cries for alfonsin to leave office early 
menem has said the higher rates are antipopular 
measures reportedly being developed by the economy 
ministerdesignate miguel roig include an acrosstheboard wage 
raise easy access to central bank credit and a new currency to 
replace the austral 
it was unclear how the military issue which has brought on three 
insurrections against alfonsin would be resolved 
alfonsin took office in december 1983 for a sixyear term after 
elections that ended rule by military dictators since 1976 he was 
barred by the consitution from seeking reelection

huge crowds flocked to the grave of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini on 
sunday for a memorial service marking a week since his death 
irans most powerful leaders were among the more than 1 million 
mourners at beheshte zahra cemetery 10 miles south of tehran 
according to iranian press reports monitored in nicosia 
soon this site will become a shrine to attract the moslems of 
the world said parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani who broke 
into tears during his speech this is a center which radiates 
heavenly light 
in islam the seventh and 40th days after death are considered a 
time for special mourning rites free food and drink was distributed 
around the grave 
irans staterun television showed mourners beating their heads 
and chests with clenched fists in the shiite moslem expression of 
grief and chanting khomeini khomeini why did you leave us 
but the atmosphere appeared calmer than during tuesdays burial 
which was delayed for six hours after some in the hysterical crowd 
of 2 million tore pieces from khomeinis white shroud and sent the 
body falling to the ground 
the 86yearold patriarch died june 3 after suffering a heart 
attack there were eight deaths and 11000 injuries in subsequent 
three days of mourning 
on sunday one man died of a heart attack and another died after 
falling from a cargo container used for television cameras 
according to press reports 
the official islamic republic news agency said the mourners were 
so densely packed during the afternoon ceremony that on average one 
person fainted every second in temperatures around 96 
the sick were passed overhand to one of 23 mobile medical units 
stationed around the site and more than 1000 doctors and medical 
workers were on duty the news agency reported more serious 
injuries were rushed to nearby hospitals in one of 250 ambulances 
the television also monitored in nicosia showed a shrine built 
from four metal cargo containers to stop crowds from carrying off 
the dirt the containers were covered in green a holy color for 
islam and were topped with a golden dome and a black flag 
the television showed weeping mourners gripping a metal grille 
built around the structure trying to touch and kiss the shrine 
which they consider sacred 
those unable to reach it threw clothes and other articles to the 
guards standing on top the containers the guards touched them to 
the shrine and threw them back 
it would take a stone heart to stay composed at such a time 
rafsanjani said in his speech khomeinis 43yearold son ahmad 
was reported too overcome to speak 
a cropdusting plane sprayed rosewater on the mourners and 
helicopters circled overhead showering the crowds with flowers 
the agency said crowds began collecting at the grave site on 
saturday night and swelled to almost 2 miles wide there were 
unprecedented traffic jams on the expressway leading to the cemetery 
in a related development iranian opposition leaders said exiled 
iranians living in the united states and europe have flocked to 
rebel training camps reopened after the death of khomeini a 
guerrilla spokesman said sunday 
the national liberation army the armed wing of the baghdadbased 
mujahedeen khalq received many new supporters in the past week and 
sent them to camps on the iraqiran border according to spokesman 
farid suliamani 
the camps were closed after the aug 20 unmediated ceasefire 
in the eightyear iraniraq war then reopened in a show of strength 
following khomeinis death according to diplomatic sources they 
said however there was no indication the rebels would attack iran 
in violation of the ceasefire

with accelerating economic reform and political 
liberalization hungary could emerge as a western country within 
the next decade the us ambassador to budapest said sunday 
at the same time ambassador mark palmer cautioned that under 
certain conditions the soviet union might again use military force 
to reassert its control in hungary or elsewhere in eastern europe 
i think the brezhnev doctrine is not dead that there are 
circumstances under which the soviets would intervene he said 
hungarys a little less of a concern to them i would say than 
the militarily more important countries of east germany 
czechoslovakia and poland but i would not rule out the possibility 
of their intervening again 
under the brezhnev doctrine named for late soviet president 
leonid i brezhnev moscow reserved the right to intervene as it 
did in hungary in 1956 and in czechoslovakia in 1968 to preserve 
communist regimes in eastern europe 
palmer interviewed on the abc program this week with david 
brinkley was asked about the longerterm prospects for hungary 
which recently began taking down its iron curtain barbed wire 
and fortifications along its border with austria 
the envoy said the outlook depends partly on what the united 
states and other western nations do 
if we come into these countries with our political parties our 
trade unions with our ideas our values and our institutions our 
churches our universities our foundations i think theres a real 
chance that what you will see 10 years from today in hungary is a 
western country palmer said 
also interviewed on the program was john davis us ambassador 
to poland where candidates backed by the solidarity movement won a 
resounding victory in parliamentary elections last week 
davis was asked whether solidarity would now be a permanent 
political force in poland or could be suppressed again in a way 
comparable to the martial law crackdown in 1981 
i think its back to stay he replied 
davis added i think that solidarity has proved through its 
nonviolence its responsible attitude and its willingness to share 
power in the country that it is a partner that the government can 
look forward to working with 
in fact the situation now is that the government in poland 
the communist government cannot pass any legislation without the 
agreement of solidarity the ambassador said

the peoples square in downtown shanghai was largely empty sunday 
despite students threat to resort to stronger tactics if their 
ultimatum was not met 
the inactivity by protesters was reflected across china as the 
government intensified its crackdown rounding up leaders of 
independent worker and student groups and waging a propaganda war to 
discredit demonstrators 
our hearts support the students struggle for democracy said 
one worker at a cargo firm but many people feel it is time to 
stop the protests and think of the best way to achieve the goal 
there was no way the government would agree to their demands 
said a young worker at shanghais riverfront they know the 
students are all gone that theyre not at their schools

population of 12 million announced more arrests sunday in a 
continuing crackdown but no figure was given up to 680 people have

an unprecedented experiment in public education is 
about to begin with gov michael s dukakis expected to sign a bill 
monday that will let boston university take over the troubled school 
system in the city of chelsea 
the plan approved by the legislature after months of sometimes 
bitter discussion will link a public school system with one of the 
highest dropout rates in the state 17 percent to a worldclass 
university with all its financial and educational resources 
boston university will get the prestige of conducting an 
educational experiment never before tried in the united states one 
that will be watched closely and possibly duplicated by universities 
around the country 
one of the things i think wed like to encourage in this state 
is innovation and experimentation dukakis said at a news 
conference and theres no question this is innovative and 
experimental 
we have a bill which i think has real promise for the future of 
the schoolchildren in chelsea dukakis said its an experiment 
and like most experiments it is one that has to be tried before we 
know whether it will succeed 
under the plan bu will run the 3600student system for 10 years 
and pump in money from private donors and foundations for a variety 
of new programs including early childhood education counseling and 
nutritional services 
chelsea schools have been woefully underfunded according to 
officials in the largely hispanic workingclass city of 25000 
outside boston chelsea has seen its tax base shrink and faces cuts 
of about 28 million in next years school budget because of a 
state budget crunch 
bus refusal to agree to any language guaranteeing open meetings 
while orally promising to abide by state openmeeting laws had held 
up the bill and had put dukakis in a difficult position once the 
measure reached his desk 
local teachers unions and the american federation of teachers 
which endorsed dukakis in his bid for president last year had 
complained that the pact would allow bu to make decisions behind 
closed doors but a veto would have set up dukakis for an 
embarrassment since the legislature had passed the bill with enough 
votes to override 
on friday however the governor said he would sign the bill 
and also direct the state board of education to set up a monitoring 
panel to make sure bu abides by the openmeeting and publicrecords 
laws 
that move seemed to satisfy several factions that were 
practically at one anothers throats days earlier 
bu administrators were delighted with the announcement saying it 
allowed them to begin raising the roughly 30 million they hope to 
spend over the next decade 
hispanics opposed the agreement saying university officials have 
ignored requests for more information about bilingual programs 
bu president john silber said he would heed concerns raised 
we are not going to privatize the schools silber said we 
are going to manage the public schools and they are going to remain 
public 
for higher education there could be a longterm benefit if the bu 
experiment succeeds 
universities are looking at themselves and saying what is our 
role in terms of the reform movement in education said peter 
greer dean of the bu education school one thing universities 
have said is say how bad the entering freshmen are

gen wojciech jaruzelski of poland laid a 
wreath at the grave of one of his countrys war heroes on sunday and 
ignored the jeers of anticommunist emigres 
the polish leader on the second day of a british visit was 
heckled by protesters as he honored gen wladislaw sikorski 
commander of the free polish forces who joined the allies against 
the nazis during world war ii 
police sealed off the polish war graves section of newark 
cemetery 125 miles north of london several hours before jaruzelski 
arrived in a 12car motorcade he left immediately after the short 
ceremony for lunch with local officials and a return flight to 
poland 
sikorski a prime minister of poland in 192223 was killed in an 
air crash in the british colony of gibraltar on july 4 1943 he is 
buried with other free polish veterans many of whom served at 
british air bases during the war 
the british visit preceded by a oneday stop in belgium was 
jaruzelskis first trip outside poland since his communist party 
suffered a resounding defeat in national elections to the 
solidarityled political opposition 
several hundred polish emigres some holding banners saying 
jaruzelski who are you kidding and we want 100 percent 
democracy gathered outside the cemetery entrance and yelled as 
jaruzelski arrived 
several dozen protesters slipped around to the side of the 
cemetery near the polish war graves and shouted sacrilege at 
jaruzelski while he laid the wreath 
this man jaruzelski is the one who sent tanks against his own 
people and he is a product of his masters the soviet union said 
artur e rynkiewicz president of the federation of poles in great 
britain which sponsored the protest 
jaruzelski ordered a martial law crackdown to crush solidarity in 
december 1981 it was made legal again under an agreement in april 
that also allowed limited opposition participation in elections 
the emigres also said it was sikorskis last wish that his body 
not be returned to poland until his homeland was free 
the polish government wants the world to think that poland is 
free they want to use gen sikorskis return as window dressing 
said ted lawrence 65 of long eaton he served in the free polish 
forces 
prime minister margaret thatcher has refused requests for the 
return of his body to poland where a marble tomb awaits his burial 
among the last polish kings 
press association britains domestic news agency said 
jaruzelski did not raise the issue during his meeting with mrs 
thatcher on saturday 
during the visit the british told jaruzelski they would provide 
limited economic aid including a 775 million annual contribution 
to a new fund to train poles for a more marketoriented economy 
britain also agreed to press for rescheduling of polands 38 
billion foreign debt 
jaruzelski has been stepping up contacts with western countries 
mainly in the hope of getting economic aid after the domestic 
political reforms

two new security systems capable of detecting 
plastic explosives were displayed sunday at the paris air show the 
first international aviation exposition since the december bombing 
of pan am flight 103 
the sophisticated systems both on the market for the first time 
this spring were created by two american companies the companies 
were invited by the federal aviation administration to show the new 
technology during the 10day gathering at le bourget airport north 
of paris 
in recent years searches metal detectors and xray machines 
have become routine at airports and the number of hijackings has 
declined but passenger planes remain vulnerable to hidden devices 
it takes less than a pound of plastic explosive the size of a 
chocolate bar to bring down a jumbo jet the deadly material can be 
molded into shapes that are easy to hide 
such an explosive hidden in a casette tape player is believed to 
have caused the death of 275 passengers aboard the pan am jet downed 
over the scottish village of lockerbee in december 
thermedics inc of woburn mass came up with a sniffer that 
detects chemical vapors the 125000 handheld sniffer called 
egis is a computerized chemical analyzer with programmed rules 
called algorithms 
if you look at the last 15 incidents of bombing or attempted 
bombing in six of them the bomb found its way into the aircraft 
cabin said thermedics president john w wood jr this 
illustrates the need to screen people and carry on bags as well as 
checked luggage 
thermedics has developed a second sniffer that is about a year 
away from the markeplace it is called securscan and works on the 
same principle as egis but is designed as a walkthrough chamber 
similar to the now common metal detector 
a second new device is being shown by science international 
applications corp of santa clara calif their apparatus is called 
a thermal neutron activation or tna and sells for 900000 
baggage passes on a conveyor belt through a chamber where it is 
showered with neutrons that react when exposed to nitrogen the 
chemical emitted by virtually all explosives the reaction produces 
a scattering of gamma rays a sort of chemical fingerprint that is 
analyzed by a computer 
six units have been purchased by the faa for installation at new 
yorks kennedy airport and londons gatwick and 12 others will be 
installed in highrisk airports in the united states and overseas 
meanwhile thousands of visitors to the airshow cast their eyes 
skyward over le bourget airport sunday to watch the first 
demonstration flight by a soviet mig29 since the crash of an 
identical fighter last week 
the camouflagegreen fighter emblazoned with a red star flew 
loops and spins in the blue sky its engines spitting pale fire 
the sister mig29 crashed just after the opening of the air show 
on thursday but pilot anatoly kvochur managed to eject from the 
plane at 500 feet

gary mcgivern is both an environmental 
activist and a convicted cop killer a combination which may prove 
deadly to an annual festival that raises money for conservation 
the westchester county executive says that because mcgivern edits 
a newsletter published by the events sponsor the county will back 
out of the great hudson river festival in coming years county 
police say they wont help patrol the festival this year in their 
off hours 
this guy is a convicted killer of a police officer who was a 
member of my department said ronald harbolic head of the county 
police benevolent association we arent going to work for people 
who hire copkillers 
for five years mcgivern and his wife marguerite culp have 
coedited the navigator the newsletter of the hudson river sloop 
clearwater the group founded by folksinger pete seeger to help 
clean up the hudson river 
mcgivern did his work from a prison cell until this year when he 
was granted clemency by gov mario cuomo mcgivern who has always 
claimed his innocence was convicted of the 1968 murder of 
westchester deputy sheriff william fitzgerald 
this years festival is scheduled for saturday and sunday at 
westchester community college it has roots going back more than 20 
years when seeger sang on a lawn and passed the hat to raise money 
to build the clearwater a replica of a 19th century sloop the ship 
has sailed the hudson to promote efforts to clean the river efforts 
that have met with some success 
the fullscale festival has been staged annually for 12 years 
last year 20000 people attended the county contributed 
services it estimated to be worth 45000 including bus 
transportation park attendants and police the county also allows 
use of the college campus 
its an impossible situation for westchester to give up to 
45000 in taxpayer dollars to an organization which hired a cop 
killer someone who murdered a westchester county deputy sheriff 
said county executive andrew orourke its impossible to 
underwrite the organization public money can be better spent than 
paying gary mcgivern mcgivern and his wife put out the newsletter 
under a contract 
john mylod executive director of the clearwater said the 
organization knew who mcgivern was when he was hired and has never 
tried to hide him 
orourke and harbolic both said they failed to notice mcgiverns 
name on the newsletters masthead and had not seen a festival 
program in which mcgivern and culp were pictured and profiled 
mcgivern and his wife declined to be interviewed about the 
controversy 
mcgivern 44 has maintained he was innocent in the 1968 shooting 
of fitzgerald which occurred while mcgivern and two other inmates 
were being transported from the auburn correctional facility to a 
white plains court 
mcgivern was serving time on a robbery charge when the shooting 
occurred he said one of the other two inmates did the shooting 
that inmate was killed in the shootout along with the deputy sheriff 
he a model inmate and made powerful friends such as seeger 
cuomo and columnist william f buckley when he was released this 
year the parole board cited his outstanding record of 
institutional adjustment 
mylod indicated that mcgivern would not be let go because of the 
threats and protests some hateful things are being said its 
unfortunate but were not going to change anything 
mylod said he thought the clearwaters 1500 volunteers would be 
able to handle any problems at the festival this year 
he was unmoved by suggestions that some people might stay away 
from the festival this year because of the mcgivern connection 
thats their right he said the same he said goes for police 
officers who may picket the fair 
we may not have to worry about next year he said if its 
a bad year financially especially if it really rains that may 
answer the question about next year from a practical financial 
point of view rather than a political one

activists for battered women are 
advocating the maximum sentence for a man convicted only for 
manslaughter in the shooting of his estranged wife a county judge 
sentencing was set for monday 
when judge carol irons was shot to death in her chambers eight 
months ago by clarence ratliff a former police officer who was her 
estranged husband deputy clerk mary harrison tried to stanch irons 
bleeding 
harrison still has nightmares about the shooting and attends 
weekly counseling sessions she says shell be among the many people 
expected to speak monday before ratliffs sentencing 
this has consumed me for months now said harrison now i 
want rat ratliff to know what hes done to us here the whole 
building he didnt just kill carol though that was horrifying 
enough in itself hes changed all our lives 
well never be the same again 
a thousand people rallied last month outside the county hall of 
justice to protest the voluntary manslaughter conviction on may 11 
a jury acquitted ratliff of firstdegree murder which carries a 
possible sentence of life in prison without parole ratliff 53 
testified that he was drunk and upset over their impending divorce 
and did not mean to kill irons 40 manslaughter carries a sentence 
of up to 15 years 
the jury also convicted ratliff of attempted murder for firing at 
two officers who tried to help irons a conviction that carries a 
potential sentence of life in prison with possibility of parole 
we are outraged that the murder of a woman is considered less 
serious than shooting at and missing two men said dotti 
clune one of those who protested the verdict 
another deputy clerk danielle smith said she also would address 
kent county circuit judge dennis c kolenda before the sentencing 
smith 27 said she opened the locked door to let ratliff into 
his wifes chambers on the day of the shooting 
at first though when it was happening i laid under a desk 
and thought god i let that man in she recalled 
also planning to speak are former college classmates of irons who 
formed the carol s irons committee for justice in response to the 
ratliff verdict 
kolenda said he was told irons brother peter would speak her 
parents james and virginia irons of farwell have asked an attorney 
to speak on their behalf 
ratliff will also have a chance to address the court before he is 
sentenced 
this is the time for the defendant to tell me anything he wants 
me to consider so he cant complain later something was said to 
which he didnt have a chance to respond kolenda said 
i plan to be very explicit in explaining the process what im 
doing and why im doing it i take time with every defendant he 
said but ill be especially careful here because i want 
absolutely no room for complaints on appeal and because there are so 
many people interested in this

summer may be over almost before its begun 
for students at two elementary schools where officials are planning 
to try the three rs yearround 
the orleans parish school board meets monday to make its final 
decison after giving tentative approval in february to add 40 days 
to the school year at the two city schools 
for pupils at robert moton and johnson c lockett elementary 
schools who volunteer to take part it would mean returning to 
school july 10 instead of sept 5 like the rest of the citys 
students the schools have a combined enrollment of 1400 
its estimated cost would be 703000 and some supporters fear 
board members might balk at the expense of the plan when they meet 
on monday 
we really have to try a model to work out the kinks board 
member woody koppel said sunday 
he said he expects a unanimous vote even though some board 
members may have reservations about parts of the plan 
its expensive but its worth spending the money to try it 
out 
plans call for the money to come from the federal governments 
chapter i supplemental program for disadvantaged students about 
threequarters of the students at each school are from lowincome 
families koppel said 
but federal rather than local tax dollars wont mean the program 
will be judged any less strictly he said 
it has to prove that its costeffective and can improve test 
scores and deportment in the schools said koppel we will see 
after the first year how well this program is judged 
he said the program is planned for both moton which had 798 
students last year and lockett which had 710 because they serve 
students from the same general area an area which includes two 
housing projects 
sometimes the kids move around we dont want a situation where 
they move from one school to another and lose the services he 
said 
nelka smith is one parent who will be disappointed if the 
yearround plan is postponed 
yearround school is a plus said smith who was at moton on 
thursday to pick up report cards for her five children all of whom 
made the honor roll and earned perfect attendance certificates 
a longer school year would give the children something better 
to do than playing in the street especially in that dirty water 
after it rains she said 
like other moton parents smith said the yearround program will 
give the children an alternative to the drugs and violence prevalent 
in the nearby desire housing project area 
id rather see them here safe than exposed to drugs in the 
streets said sandra doyle whose three children attend moton 
three months without nothing to do is too much time wasted 
while most american children spend 180 days in the classroom 
school terms in japan last 240 days the new orleans experiment 
would be for a 220day term two american high schools offer an 
extended year 
california has yearround schools koppel said but that program 
was started because there were too few school buildings rather than 
as an attempt to boost learning 
moton and lockett teachers were given the option of transferring 
to other schools and student participation is voluntary 
lockett principal herbert dunn said all but two of his teachers 
signed up for the yearround program 
the parents are enthused about it he said

iranian opposition forces hoping to take 
advantage of the disarray in iran following the death of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini have reopened camps in iraq to train thousands of 
recruits according to diplomats 
they said iranians living in exile in europe and the united 
states have flocked to iraq to join the national liberation army of 
iran since khomeinis death june 3 
the national liberation army is the military wing of the 
mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors the main iranian 
opposition group 
thousands of exiled sympathizers were immediately sent to rebel 
bases along the iraniraq border for training according to a 
mujahedeen spokesman 
a stream of our supporters has been pouring in and they are 
being given proper training in our bases here said farid 
suliamani a spokesman for the baghdadbased organization he did 
not give figures on new recruits 
witnesses said dozens of military vehicles carrying rebel 
fighters were seen thursday and friday near northern suliamaniya 
heading toward rebel camps on the border with iran the vehicles had 
farsi markings and bore mujahedeen emblems they said 
border camps were closed after a united nations ceasefire halted 
the eightyear iraniraq war on aug 20 the mujahedeen fought 
alongside iraq in the war and also halted operations inside iran 
following the truce 
but rebel leaders put their forces estimated at 20000 on 
alert after khomeini underwent surgery may 23 to stop intestinal 
bleeding 
after the patriarchs death opposition leader massoud rajavi 
called on iranians to prepare to welcome the rebels and help them 
when they move into iran at the appropriate moment rebel camps 
were reopened in a show of force diplomats said 
the diplomatic sources spoke on the condition they not be 
identified 
but there has been no indication that the rebels are planning 
military action 
military analysts do not believe the rebels are strong enough to 
topple the iranian government alone unless a power struggle 
develops and despite earlier indications of factional fighting 
irans new leader president ali khamenei seems to be consolidating 
his position sources said 
in addition any military move would need approval from the iraqi 
government it is thought unlikely that baghdad would permit any 
action that might jeopardize the temporary truce with iran or impede 
progress in deadlocked peace talks 
one diplomat said although it was unlikely the rebels would move 
across the border while the ceasefire holds they might take 
advantage of any serious truce violation to attack iranian positions 
or set up rebel bases inside iran mujahedeen officials said the 
groups military strength has increased steadily since the 
ceasefire and that months of intensive training in iraq have made 
it a far more effective military force than before 
the rebels were allied with khomeini in the struggle to topple 
the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi but in 198081 a year after 
khomeini took power he turned on the group and other leftist 
factions killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people

the us ambassador to china james r lilley 
said sunday it would be a terrible mistake for the united states 
to give up on maintaining relations with china despite the beijing 
governments harsh crackdown on the democratic reform movement 
lilley said us policy toward china needs to respond to the 
immediate situation there but also take a longterm approach rather 
than seek any kind of quick fix 
the envoys comments came in a telephone interview from beijing 
broadcast on the cbs program face the nation 
i think weve gone through many ups and downs with china and i 
think right now were going through a down lilley said but i 
dont think we should sort of give up on it i think that would be a 
terrible mistake 
he said the united states can continue to have some influence in 
china through avenues including voice of america broadcasts 
training of chinese students and in the multitude of business 
decisions that are made every day on the basis of investment climate 
and trading atmosphere 
what we do is we play for the long term and we dont look for 
a quick fix we look for a long term solution and i think 
thats what were working towards lilley said 
the ambassador was asked about leading chinese dissident fang 
lizhi who has taken refuge in the us embassy in beijing and is 
seeking political asylum 
lilley responded i would prefer not to discuss that situation 
i will say that i have had conversations with them chinese 
officials in the last two or three days its a very sensitive 
thing and its best to do it and shut up 
lilley gave no indication during the interview that he was aware 
the chinese government had issued an arrest warrant for lizhi and 
his wife li shuxian on charges of committing crimes of 
counterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation 
asked if the chinese had approached us officials about the two 
dissidents kenneth bailes a state department spokesman refused to 
comment on the report and on any aspect of the situation 
upon arrival at the white house from the camp david weekend 
retreat esident bush declined to give a reaction to the chinese 
demand 
as reporters shouted questions he cupped his hand to his ear and 
said i cant hear a thing this is not an appropriate time 
the head of an organization supporting uschina trade and 
business ventures said american companies should first take steps to 
ensure the safety of their personnel in china then carefully 
reassess their business prospects 
roger sullivan president of the uschina business council 
said that in the short term nobodys talking about business as 
usual business with china has been devastated and its very 
important for us to bring home to the chinese people that their 
government did it 
he estimated that up until the current turmoil the american 
business presence in china totalled 8000 to 9000 people with 
about 300 us companies having investment contracts worth 34 
billion 
companies are taking their people out thats the first thing 
to do i mean youve got to protect the safety and security of your 
people and then take a long look at and test your assumptions about 
how youre going to be able to continue if indeed youre going to 
be able to continue at all sullivan said 
also appearing on the cbs program was sen alfonse damato 
rny who said he expects to see congressional action within the 
next 10 days on economic sanctions against china including a cutoff 
of high technology 
damato said the united states should act as a catalyst in 
promoting multilateral sanctions against china by western european 
countries and japan 
rep stephen j solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on asian and pacific affairs also endorsed a 
strategy of seeking multilateral economic sanctions 
interviewed on cnns newsmaker sunday solarz said the united 
states should deprive china of any special concessions or credits 
which theyve been receiving in the past which we ordinarily 
wouldnt give to a communist regime which engages in the fundamental 
abuse of the human rights of its own people 
solarz was asked about the question of maintaining electronic 
listening posts in china which help monitor soviet missile tests 
he responded that in terms of the listening posts i believe 
that those are mutually beneficial and so i dont think we need to 
be overly concerned about them

the navy is changing the way it stores 
gunpowder for 16inch guns on its iowaclass battleships despite 
indications that powder was not at fault in the fatal blast on the 
battleship iowa 
when the battleship wisconsin heads for maintenance and repairs 
this summer its powder charges 110pound bags will not be 
stored aboard uncooled unventilated barges as the iowas were navy 
officials told the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar of norfolk 
when the iowa went in for similar overhaul during the summer of 
1988 its powder was stored aboard uncooled barges at the yorktown 
naval weapons station on the york river during the hottest part of 
the summer 
in april 47 sailors aboard the iowa were killed when powder 
exploded in the no 2 gun turret during open seas gunnery practice 
before the explosion the no 1 turret had a misfire when the five 
bags of powder used to propel the guns projectile wouldnt ignite 
navy officials have said they do not believe the storage of the 
powder was to blame and are investigating the possibility of 
sabotage nevertheless the charges aboard the iowa have been 
removed and replaced with powder that was stored in 
temperaturecontrolled underground bunkers 
smokeless powder is less stable and less effective if it is 
stored in damp atmosphere or subjected to high temperatures a 
combination of the two is particularly bad according to navy 
manual op5 the services guide to munition storage 
the manual says the powder charges decompose faster at 
temperatures above 70 degrees fahrenheit becoming relatively high 
at 100 degrees fahrenheit and dangerously accelerated at 
temperatures above 110 degrees fahrenheit 
an internal navy report estimates the temperature inside the 
aluminumsided barges used for storage was 25 degrees higher than 
the outside air temperature using that estimate the newspaper 
calculated from national weather service readings for the area that 
the temperature inside the barges could have exceeded 110 degrees on 
66 days at the time the iowas powder was in storage 
the newspaper quoting internal memos from the stations safety 
officer to his superiors said the stations command was urged to 
remove the iowas powder charges from the barges anchored at piers 
on the river bank 
permitting these charges to be stored in the barge for this 
period of time indicates the lack of importance that is placed on 
compliance with the safety requirements set forth in the manual on 
munition storage a september 1988 memo said 
thomas black administrative officer at the yorktown station 
said the wisconsins powder would not be stored at the station the 
largest of the navys six weapon stations 
if it was for a short period it would be something different 
well move it inland and then bring it back when its needed he 
said 
black said additional magazines are being built at the weapons 
station to accommodate more munitions according to the pentagon 
yorktown is the only one of the navys munitions stations that uses 
barges for temporary powder storage 
the navy is continuing its investigation into the explosion and 
has regularly declined to comment on its findings until the 
investigation is complete 
preliminary tests by the navy of the iowa powder have not shown 
any indications of instability according to the pentagon

a mission from the organization of 
american states arrived sunday for its second try at mediating the 
monthold election crisis and the legislatures speaker urged the 
group to focus on what he called us meddling 
the fourman delegation includes oas secretary general joao baena 
soares and the foreign ministers of ecuador guatemala and trinidad 
and tobago 
the oas mission failed on its trip in may to negotiate an end to 
the crisis touched off when the government led by gen manuel 
antonio noriega annulled results of the may 7 presidential election 
international observers say that when the counting was halted the 
opposition candidate had a 3to1 margin of victory over the one 
backed by the noriegacontrolled government 
the opposition insists noriega head of the defense forces must 
resign and that its victory be recognized the government says 
noriegas status is not negotiable and has proposed that a 
provisional junta take power sept 1 the constitutional 
inauguration date 
the speaker of the noriegadominated legislative assembly on 
sunday made public an open letter to the oas asking it to focus its 
efforts on us actions not those of noriega 
the fundamental reasons for the panamanian crisis are rooted in 
the open us intervention in our internal affairs aimed at 
maintaining hegemony in panama and the region celso carrizo said 
in the letter 
this intervention is carried through slander disinformation 
economic aggression psychological war constant violations of the 
torrijoscarter treaties and the threat of military attack 
the treaties signed in 1977 by thenpresidents jimmy carter and 
omar torrijos cede control of the panama canal to panama at the end 
of the century noriega has long maintained the united states wants 
to renege on the pacts 
the falling out between noriega and the united states began last 
year when he was indicted in the united states on drug trafficking 
charges the united states threw its support against the 
antinoriega movement that has so far failed to budge the strongman

hungarian television on sunday showed 
brief film footage of the trial of premier imre nagy a leader of 
the 1956 antisoviet revolt who was executed in 1958 
nagy and the bodies of several of his close associates were 
buried in unmarked graves but the remains are to be reburied during 
a ceremony friday 
reformers including communist party members have claimed nagy 
and the others were convicted at an unconstitutional show trial 
and said they should be rehabilitated 
the film clip showed nagy and some of his supporters being led 
into a courtroom where they were charged with crimes against the 
state 
it was shown during a halfhour news program on the 1956 revolt 
when nagys government sought to organize multiparty free elections 
and sever hungarys ties with the sovietled warsaw pact alliance 
soviet tanks crushed the revolt and nagy and hundreds of other 
government and political leaders were arrested 
the bodies of nagy and a few associates were dumped in a grave in 
a cemetery in suburban budpest during fridays ceremony which will 
be televised the remains will be buried again in the same cemetery 
reevaluation of the revolt began after hardline communist party 
chief janos kadar who succeeded nagy was ousted in may 1988 under 
strong criticism from reformers 
in a statement last week the communist party leadership called 
nagy a significant figure in postworld war ii hungary 
leading communist reformer imre pozsgay in an interview on 
sundays television program said the time has come to face the 
facts of what happened between oct 1956 and june 1958 
he said nagys trial was a political trial on trumped up 
charges 
foreign minister gyula horn who also was interviewed on the 
program said many of the tasks he nagy set remain important to 
this day

republican party officials are playing 
down their chances for rep jim wrights 12th district seat despite 
an ethics investigation that forced the house speaker to resign 
its like running the 100yard dash between a republican and a 
democrat and giving the democrat an 80yard head start said 
brian epstein a republican political consultant in fort worth 
its not a fair race 
republican officials point to several factors in their decision 
to focus their efforts elsewhere 
the district which includes all of fort worth and most of its 
surrounding communities was drawn by wright himself it is full of 
bluecollar democrats and boasts a solid bloc of minority voters 
that averages 30 percent to 40 percent of the voter turnout 
in addition wright brought home more defense contracts jobs and 
federal funding than any other large urban area in the country 
received according to a computer study earlier this year by the 
dallas morning news 
many residents view wright as a martyr in an unjust political 
war and two of the strongest of possible gop candidates fort worth 
mayor bob bolen and tarrant county judge roy english have indicated 
they are not interested in the seat 
finally state sen hugh parmer a formidable democrat and 
longtime friend of wright is considered a viable candidate 
ed rollins deputy chairman of the national republican 
congressional committee said the district was drawn for the 
democratic leadership steve hollern chairman of the tarrant 
county republican party called the seat marginally winnable 
the 12th district seat is one of three formerly democratic seats 
to be filled in upcoming special elections claude pepper of florida 
died may 30 at the age of 88 and majority whip tony coelho of 
california announced last month he would resign rather than face an 
ethics investigation similar to wrights 
rollins indicated last week that republicans probably would 
target peppers seat more heavily than the fort worth district 
you cannot attack jim wright epstein told the morning news 
anywhere in texas his name is mud except in the congressional 
district 12 
gov bill clements can set a date for a special election not less 
than 36 days after wright submits his resignation from the house 
wright indicated that would happen by the end of june 
republican officials say as many as 15 potential candidates have 
begun to scope out potential supporters and financial backers but 
the field is not expected to narrow for at least another week 
the potential gop candidates include alvarado businessman don 
mcniel who unsuccessfully challenged wright in 1986 state rep 
bill carter erma johnson former chairwoman of the dallasfort 
worth international airport board and former fort worth city 
council member russell lancaster

china on sunday ordered the arrest of a prominent 
dissident hiding in the us embassy and authorities rounded up 
more workers and students nationwide who helped lead prodemocracy 
protests 
the official xinhua news agency said warrants were issued for 
dissident fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian who were charged with 
committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda and 
instigation 
the state department said tuesday that fang and li took shelter 
at the us embassy after the army rolled into central beijing and 
opened fire on demonstrators june 34 
military attacks that left hundreds dead ended seven weeks of 
protests that spawned demonstrations nationwide and caused a power 
struggle in which hardliners emerged in charge 
the chinese foreign ministry has strongly protested the us 
decision to grant sanctuary to fang 
the us embassy had no immediate comment on the xinhua 
announcement fang already was at the center of a uschinese 
conflict in february when police barred him from attending a banquet 
given by visiting president bush 
james r lilley the us ambassador in beijing declined to 
discuss fangs case when asked about it in a telephone interview 
broadcast sunday on the cbs program face the nation he gave no 
indication he was aware the government issued arrest warrants for 
fang and his wife 
the news of the warrants came as the government intensified its 
efforts nationwide to round up students and workers who led the 
demonstrations demanding a freer society and an end to corruption 
a heavy troop presence in the capital remained on sunday and the 
government kept up its propaganda effort to blame last weeks 
violence on protesters urging citizens to turn in anyone suspected 
of involvement 
abc news quoted chinese sources as saying police arrested another 
leading dissident ren wanding ren 44 an accountant was jailed 
from 197983 for helping lead an earlier prodemocracy movement 
beijing communist party chief li ximing reportedly named him as 
an instigator of the latest student movement in a report to the 
central government may 19 and ren had told foreign reporters he 
feared arrest 
authorities in shanghai said they arrested the leader of a 
counterrevolutionary clique called the china youth democratic 
party weng zhengming and the head of an independent shanghai 
student group yao yongzhan 
they said yao was arrested at the shanghai airport as he tried to 
board a hong kongbound plane and was in the company of personnel 
of the consulate of a certain country they did not identify the 
country 
the government has announced the arrest of only one beijing 
student leader gua haifeng secretary of an independent student 
group that organized hunger strike and marches by tens of thousands 
of students other beijing student leaders were in hiding 
television news broadcasts showed dozens of people being arrested 
and questioned by police at gunpoint in various cities many looked 
as if they had been beaten and the face of one man identified as a 
leader of an independent labor union was swollen so badly he could 
barely open his eyes 
one of those arrested was a man accused of rumormongering 
for telling abc that 20000 people were killed in the military 
crackdown chinas national television broadcast network footage of 
the man saturday and appealed to the public to turn him in it 
announced his arrest sunday in the northeastern city of dalian 
in new york abc news said in a statement that it was deeply 
distressed to learn that in this instance the chinese authorities 
intercepted unedited news material that was being satellited and 
used it for political purposes 
laura wessner an abc spokeswoman said that last monday world 
news tonight used about eight seconds of the tape in a report by 
correspondent jim laurie and it was one of several manonthestreet 
interviews 
she said she did not know how the raw footage was intercepted by 
chinese authorities who broadcast one minute and nine seconds of 
the mans interview with abc 
we intend to do whatever we can to protect the identities of 
those that we interview who feel their safety might be jeopardized 
or at risk ms wessner said 
the government has said nearly 300 people were killed but that 
most were soldiers attacked by ruffians chinese witnesses and 
western intelligence sources have said as many as 3000 may have 
died when troops fired on crowds of citizens 
the government issued no figure for the total number of arrests 
nationwide but partial figures issued by some cities totaled more 
than 680 
at least one city the northwest tourist city of xian ordered 
its residents to hand over foreign news reports of the attacks in 
beijing the city government said the materials contained 
distorted propaganda 
an unspecified number of students from neighboring hong kong and 
macao were arrested in the southern chinese city of canton last week 
after they protested the beijing crackdown thailands consul in 
canton wichai vanasin reported 
chinese authorites were in full control of canton after arresting 
the students from the british colony of hong kong and the portuguese 
territory of macao the consul said hong kong is to revert to 
chinese rule in 1997 and macao in 1999 and the violence in beijing 
has created concern in both 
authorities in beijing which has been under martial law since 
may 20 issued a new order sunday calling on anyone who burned 
army or police vehicles public buses and other public vehicles or 
plotted organized or abetted in providing the conditions for such 
atrocities to turn themselves in for lenient treatment or expect 
harsh punishment 
other cities issued similar orders and banned the independent 
groups that led the protests 
in the northeast city of changchun authorities held a rally 
parading 26 alleged lawbreakers so the public would be 
educated mass rallies to parade and in some cases execute 
suspects were common elements of political control in the past but 
had become less frequent in recent years 
no new protests were reported in any cities 
student protesters in shanghai had given the government until 
sunday to open talks with them on democratic reform publicize the 
truth of the military attack in beijing and fly flags at halfstaff 
in honor of the beijing dead however the deadline passed without 
new student action 
the media stepped up its criticism of the us governmentrun 
voice of america radio station accusing it of distorting the 
crackdown 
the shanghai government sent foreign consulates a letter during 
the weekend warning that foreign journalists there needed official 
permission to report foreign reporters in beijing already are 
banned from conducting interviews on the street and most other 
places

members of the house ethics committee 
not speaker jim wright initiated an attempt to strike a deal and 
negotiate his resignation the dallas times herald reported sunday 
everybody made it sound like jim wright went in on his knees 
and asked for a deal one senior democratic source told the 
newspaper that is the complete opposite of what is true 
the times herald reported that numerous sources who asked not to 
be named said the house speakers resignation began with a call from 
ethics committee chairman julian dixon dcalif to rep louis 
stokes dohio the former ethics chairman 
dixon said wrights resignation would spare the house a harsh 
and divisive confrontation sources told the newspaper dixon said 
the committee could drop some of the 69 allegations against wright 
by accepting portions of his legal motions filed the previous week 
if the speaker would agree to resign 
stokes relayed the message to rep robert torricelli a new 
jersey democrat who joined wrights defense team several weeks 
earlier he passed the information on to the speaker 
wright who told torricelli to go ahead with negotiations 
reportedly said he was interested in an agreement if it would clear 
the names of his wife betty and friend george mallick mallick had 
been accused of providing betty wright with a phony job and improper 
gifts 
as negotiations continued wright turned down offers that would 
have included continuing the censure over the sale of his book 
reflections of a public man and the stipulation that wright 
step down within 24 hours 
wright reportedly said there would be no quid pro quo 
agreement for his resignation in exchange for exoneration on charges 
wrights representatives met with the committees outside 
counsel richard phelan phelan said he had votes of all six 
republicans and at least one democrat rep chester atkins dmass 
to continue the investigation into other allegations against wright 
for several months 
when those talks failed thomas foley dwash then the house 
majority leader and now the speaker was called in as a mediator 
the relationship between dixon and wright had deteriorated to the 
point that neither man trusted the other the newspaper reported 
then the ethics committee convened with some republicans 
reportedly angered by the negotiations but three hours later the 
group had heard nothing from wright 
if he wanted to make an offer we were sitting there said 
rep john myers rindiana who added that he was opposed to any 
deals 
to wrights closest allies the former speaker was the victim of 
a setup 
but john buckley of the national republican congressional 
committee disputed the claim 
it is quite a typical democratic ploy once they have lost to 
claim that they were tricked or the tactics against them were 
illegitimate buckley said wrights decline was inevitable 
whether it happened as quickly as it did or not he was going down

foreign minister marwan kassem says two 
regiments of iranian soldiers have arrived in warravaged lebanon 
the jordan times newspaper reported sunday 
the iranian military presence in the country is an attempt 
designed to partition the sovereign arab state through deepening 
sectarianism which in turn facilitates israeli plans he was 
quoted as saying 
the englishlanguage daily quoted him as saying two iranian 
regiments had arrived in lebanon and that more could arrive soon 
but there was no indication when the troops had arrived or how many 
men were in each regiment 
sources in the eastern baalbek region of lebanon a 
fundamentalist stronghold said 500 revolutionary guards had arrived 
last month to reinforce the 3000strong garrison in the area 
the contingent has been based there since early 1983 months 
after the israel invasion of lebanon their stated purpose was to 
fight with the syrian army against israel but the syrian troops did 
not engage israeli forces 
former president amin gemayel asked for their withdrawal several 
times severing relations with iran over the issue in 1984 
relations were restored in 1987 
the contingent has been preaching khomeinis brand of 
fundamentalism among the shiites in the bekaa valley it has its own 
radio and television stations 
syria has allowed increasing iranian influence in lebanon 
annoying the many arab states allied with iraq during the 8year 
iraniraq war that ended in a ceasefire last august those states 
oppose the spread irans shiite moslem religious fundamentalism 
kassem was a member of a sixman arab league committee which 
tried to solve the 14yearold lebanese conflict earlier this year 
rival christian and moslem cabinets have been vying for power since 
september and artillery duels between their sectors in beirut has 
left more than 360 dead in the latest round of fighting that began 
march 8 
an arab summit late last month replaced the earlier panel with a 
threeman committee of saudi arabias king fahd moroccos king 
hassan and algerian president chedli benjedid 
the summit failed to win syrian agreement to withdraw its 40000 
troops in lebanon who are backing the moslem forces 
the newspaper quoted kassem as saying foreign occupation of 
lebanon could end when the arabs can solve lebanons political 
problem and can assure syria it will not face israeli threats 
through lebanon 
israel occupies a strip of territory in south lebanon kassem 
suggested arabs could try to push for israels withdrawal under un 
security council resolutions a solution that he said might require 
increased numbers of un peacekeeping troops in lebanon

a pamphlet issued by the clandestine unified national leadership 
of the uprising called on palestinians to kill one soldier or jewish 
settler for each arab slain it is our right to defend ourselves 
and slaughter our enemy with knives because our blood is not cheaper 
than theirs it said

politicians and a palestinian activist who supports the palestine 
liberation organization 
prime minister yitzhak shamir agreed to convene the governing 
body of his rightwing likud bloc where he will face a challenge to 
his peace plan by three of the partys leading members 
israeli peace activists protested a plan to require arab day 
laborers to wait in a specially designated transit station in a 
town near tel aviv and 
another group of eight israeli peace activists who attended a 
meeting with plo representatives in june 1987 were charged by an 
israeli court with violating the nations antiterror law 
after the curfew was lifted 4000 cars streamed out of gaza

arab workers from loitering on the streets as they await hiring on 
work crews 
the station was to be used starting sunday but a town spokeman 
said implementation of the plan was delayed while town council 
members debated it police have objected to the plan challenging 
its legality 
opponents described the holding area as racist and reminiscent of 
south african apartheid we didnt believe they would use it

his party rivals industry and trade minister ariel sharon

sharon has demanded that the elections be held without 
international supervision or the participation of the 140000 arabs 
of east jerusalem palestinians have insisted on both as a condition 
for agreeing to elections 
the plan is silent on both points and would have little chance 
of palestinian acceptance if sharons amendments are accepted 
the charges against the eight israeli peace activists say they 
met plo members in hungary and discussed political matters without 
authorization if convicted the activists face a maximum sentence 
of three years in jail

libyan leader moammar gadhafi on sunday praised the 
bush administration as wise and mature and said he expected 
balanced relations with both superpowers the official libyan 
news agency jana reported 
gadhafis comments in tripoli the libyan capital appeared to be 
part of an effort in recent months to improve relations with the 
united states which were sour under former president ronald reagan 
the libyan leader spoke to jana monitored in rome after a 
ceremony marking the 19th anniversary of the eviction of us forces 
from bases in libya 
the bush administration is a wise and mature administration and 
understands international politics and it is not possible that it 
will repeat the ignorance of reagan and it is not possible that it 
will inflict new damages to american interests and foreign policy 
he told a jana reporter 
but contrary to that we believe the new administration will 
make up for the damage caused to america during the reagan era and 
that great jamahiriya libya will establish balanced relations with 
america and the soviet union gadhafi said according to the jana 
dispatch 
gadhafi told the associated press in september that he expected 
us foreign policy to change from the strongly antilibyan stance 
pursued under reagan the libyan leader has also said president bush 
realized the irrationality of the reagan policy and would make 
amends for it 
in a january interview gadhafi called for a dialogue with the 
united states but washington says libya must first renounce 
international terrorism gadhafi has said his country does not 
practice terrorism 
in his remarks to jana sunday gadhafi also said libya will 
invite american and soviet companies to explore for oil and gas as 
there are massive quantities of these raw materials in great 
jamahiriya libya and perhaps these companies will even participate 
in water projects 
there have been reports in recent months that libya is trying to 
induce americans to return to its oil operations 
in his final weeks in office reagan authorized american oil 
companies to resume operations in the north african country through 
foreign subsidiaries he had forbidden them from working there three 
years earlier under sanctions imposed on libya

the environmental protection agency 
ordered the city to stop digging a ditch to divert water coming from 
the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant despite allegations that the 
plant dumped hazardous chemicals 
officials of the suburb northwest of denver ordered the ditch dug 
saturday citing federal allegations that the plant had dumped 
hazardous chemicals into walnut creek which is used for some of the 
citys drinking water 
the allegations were made public last week in an affidavit which 
also charged that hazardous wastes were illegally burned at the 
plant 
the proposed onemile diversion would take walnut creek water 
around great western reservoir where city drinking water is stored 
and reconnect with walnut creeks outflow from the reservoir 
the epa told broomfield officials such a diversion would be 
illegal because the city of 27600 residents does not have a federal 
permit from the army corps of engineers the permit is required to 
divert any river or stream epa regional director jim scherer said 
broomfield asked why the department of energy can be in 
violation of the law and it cant scherer said

ethnic rioting that has killed 100 people in the 
uzbekistan republic has driven nearly 15000 refugees into a camp 
where living conditions are so primitive that women give birth on 
the ground soviet media said sunday 
the military newspaper krasnaya zvezda said mobs of intoxicated 
residents continue to direct violence at minority turks in the 
republics fergana valley region 
the green colors of fergana do not cover the remains of 
burnedout homes which belonged to turks not so long ago the 
newspaper said in some places of the region clouds of smoke are 
visible numerous are the crowds made up of drunks and people high 
on drugs 
the staterun televisions evening news program vremya showed 
some of the estimated 14500 meskhi turks housed at the camp outside 
fergana huddled under canvas tents out of the blazing sun 
the most explosive situation is here in the refugee camp 
the report said 
a spokesman for the turks interviewed by vremya demanded their 
immediate evacuation from soviet central asia to save our 
people 
the government newspaper izvestia said conditions are so hard in 
the camp that some of the 20 babies born in the past week were 
delivered on the bare ground 
most of the violence in the cotton and grapegrowing region 
about 1500 miles southeast of moscow has been directed at the 
meshki turks a minority uprooted by dictator josef stalin in 1944 
from its homeland in soviet georgia and forcibly resettled in the 
soviet east 
krasnaya zvezda said about 100 people had been killed in the 
first days of the weeklong rioting and approximately 1000 other 
people wounded official media previously reported 80 deaths 
from sundays soviet press it was clear the violence was 
continuing despite the presence of 9000 interior ministry troops 
sent to restore order but the reasons for the outburst which 
officials said began as an ethnic dispute between turks and the 
dominant native population the uzbeks were still unclear 
krasnaya zvezda quoted col e nechaeyv deputy chief of the 
political department of interior ministry troops as saying we 
think that the extremists actions are guided by interested leaders 
with mercenary goals which they use vile methods to achieve 
interior minister vadim bakatin on saturday blamed the rampage on 
outside agitators who came pouring into the valley in cars and 
trucks he called them opponents of president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms which have brought a crackdown on highlevel corruption in 
uzbekistan 
one thing is absolutely clear bakatin told the sovietskaya 
kultura newspaper evil forces that want to destabilize the 
situation are behind these events but he said he could not 
yet determine who was responsible 
at kimyagar settlement five miles from the city of kokand young 
people who arrived in cars smashed kiosks and shop windows on 
saturday attacking people who tried to stop them the labor daily 
trud said 
it said the young rioters were detained and some admitted that on 
the eve of their attack instigators from the city of kokand came to 
their region and threatened to set their homes ablaze if they did 
not set out for kimyagar 
but the trud report like past soviet accounts did not explain 
why the instigators wanted the turks attacked 
a ansarov a resident of the village of komsomolsk was quoted 
by izvestia as saying that on saturday a bus drove into our 
street i saw how they took a turkish boy out of the bus he was 
terribly beaten and covered in blood 
ansarov claimed hoodlums cut the ears off a 10yearold boy in 
his neighborhood and said he and his family were saved because they 
were concealed by their uzbek neighbors 
according to krasnaya zvezda 136 interior ministry soldiers have 
been injured since the disturbances began 
according to izvestia a 200bed field hospital has been set up 
at the refugee camp to treat wounded turks who left hospitals in 
fergana because they were afraid to stay there soldiers guarding 
the refugees have turned their barracks over to the turks and moved 
into tents it said 
but izvestia quoted interior ministry lt col n usmanov as 
saying about 20 of the refugees had gone on hunger strike demanding 
to be taken out of central asia altogether 
it quoted one old man as saying for how long will we be moved 
out of our homes 
krasnaya zvezda said the decision had been taken to evacuate 
women and children from the camp and that 400 people had already 
been airlifted to a childrens camp operated by the ministry of the 
interior

from business sponsors of the antidrug effort and was offered to 
him by city officials

the rainbow coalition rather than into his own pocket 
oliver north gets 25000 for his own personal

the communications industry will grow at an 
average annual rate of 88 percent over the next five years down 
from a 98 percent yearly growth pace over the past five years 
according to a report for release monday by an investment banking 
firm that specializes in media buyouts 
veronis suhler amp associates inc said the communications 
business will generate 251 billion in spending by 1993 up from 
164 billion in 1988 
it said the projected growth pace will place the communications 
business second only to the anticipated 95 percent annual growth 
rate in the health and medical services industry among the major 
segments of the economy 
john suhler president of veronis suhler said the main reasons 
for the slower growth in communications from 198893 compared with 
the 198388 period is an anticipated slowdown in the expansion of 
spending in cable television home video and business information 
growth in cable television for instance should moderate over 
the next five years because most households already have access to 
cable service and basic cable service rate increases are expected to 
moderate it said 
it put cable spending growth at 77 percent over the next five 
years down from 113 percent in the past five 
home video growth will also slow as that segment of the industry 
begins to mature falling to an 112 percent growth pace in the next 
five years from 527 percent a year in the past five it said 
spending on business information services will still be the 
fastestgrowing segment of the comunications business at 105 
percent a year but that is down from a 121 percent growth pace 
over the past five years 
none of the projections is adjusted for inflation 
the forecasters said they expect the economy will grow at a 75 
percent annual rate including inflation over the next five years 
compared with 74 percent over the past five years 
suhler said that advertising and promotion spending growth should 
accelerate in the next five years after slowing in the 198388 
period when the nations economic focus shifted from expansion to 
cost control 
such trends run in cycles and as this one runs its course over 
the next five years higher spending on advertising and promotion 
will benefit the advertisingsupported segments of the 
communications industry he said 
the broadcasting business is expected to grow at an 87 percent 
annual rate from 198893 up from 82 percent over the past five 
years 
ad spending on the networks should rise at a 69 percent yearly 
rate over the next five years up from 62 percent over the past 
five while spending at local tv stations should edge up to 98 
percent a year up from 97 percent 
the rate of audience decline for the three major networks is 
projected to moderate between 1988 and 1993 because of lower growth 
in cable television and independent stations 
the networks share of the prime time audience fell to about 68 
percent last year down from 81 percent in 1983 but veronis suhler 
expects it will dip to only 63 percent by 1993 
spending on radio is expected to grow 9 percent a year in the 
next five years up from 83 percent in the past five the study 
said 
in the newspaper business spending is expected to grow at an 81 
percent rate in the next five years including an 86 percent yearly 
increase in advertising spending and 62 percent annual growth in 
circulation 
that compares with a 77 percent growth rate overall in the past 
five years including 86 percent in advertising and 48 percent in 
circulation 
projections for annual growth over the next five years in other 
segments of the industry include 
99 percent in filmed entertainment including home video down 
from 175 percent in the past five years 
98 percent in book publishing up from 89 percent 
74 percent in recorded music down from 104 percent 
73 percent in magazine publishing down from 74 percent

house republicans are telling president bush to 
take a hike on his demand that all savings and loan operators put 
some of their own money at risk as the price for a 157 billion 
taxpayer bailout of the industry 
the administration is asking republican members to go through 
the hoop any number of times getting no points for their own 
parochial interests complains house gop leader bob michel of 
illinois 
as the rescue plan moves to the house floor this week it was 
mostly liberal democrats scrambling to salvage the key reform in the 
presidents package making all thrift operators put up real money 
as capital as a buffer between risky loans and the governments 
deposit insurance funds 
bush and other industry critics have blamed loose government 
regulations and accounting practices that have allowed sampls to 
attract and lend federally insured deposits with little or no money 
of their own at risk as the primary cause of the thrift crisis 
while bush proposed stiffer capital standards in general terms 
it was one of the congresss most liberal democrats howard 
metzenbaum of ohio who put a real dollar figure behind it 150 
in capital for every 100 in loans by june 1991 when the senate 
passed its version in april 
the administration immediately embraced metzenbaums measure and 
asked for more 
the house banking committee complied adopting the 150 standard 
by 1991 and upping the ante by telling sampls they will have to have 
3 in capital for every 100 in loans by 1995 over the opposition of 
most of its gop members 
so far it looks like the republicans are more interested in 
weakening the presidents own bill and the democrats more interested 
in helping him said rep dennis eckart dohio we intend to 
make it somewhat of a political test 
the senate meanwhile is expected to spend most of the week 
debating a bill to lift the remaining government price controls on 
natural gas 
only about onethird of the nations supply of the fuel is still 
under the controls experts generally agree prices to consumers 
would not rise if it is decontrolled because current market prices 
are well below the federal ceiling 
however many acknowledge that anticipated increased demand for 
natural gas in the 1990s could drive gas prices much higher then 
the battle over cash investment requirements for savings and 
loans underscores one of the differences between banks and sampls in 
general 
even though banks already have twice as tough capital 
requirements 6 for every 100 in loans and expected to rise to 8 
in the near future many of the nations biggest sampls cried foul at 
raising their requirements and are engaged in an intensive lobbying 
effort to knock some loopholes in the bill on the house floor 
more than twothirds of the nations 2949 sampls already meet the 
3 capital requirement moreover all but about 250 of those 
expected to still be in business once the immediate crisis is solved 
are expected to have little trouble meeting the new standard by 1995 
however about 450 sampls now have absolutely no cash capital and 
it is their losses of up to 100 billion in depositors money 
driving the emerging 30year bailout plan that works about to about 
600 for every man woman and child in the country 
many sampls are meeting the current capital requirements only 
through supervisory good will an accounting device regulators 
adopted to encourage healthy thrifts to take over failing sampls in 
the early 1980s 
more than 730 sampls now hold about 20 billion in supervisory 
good will exemptions effectively that allows them to lend out 
600 billion in federally insured deposits with no money of their 
own at risk 
some of those exemptions were supposed to have lasted for up to 
40 years but the life span of all of them would be whittled down to 
five years under the bill approved by the house banking committee 
and endorsed by bush 
the fight appears to be centering on an amendment by rep henry 
hyde rill to make the government grant hearings to 241 sampls now 
possessing good will exemptions before making them meet the 
proposed new standards 
the institutions who relied in good faith on the word of the 
federal government deserve some consideration hyde said 
according to michel about 40 of them are in illinois 
rep charles schumer of new york one of the democrats leading 
the fight to preserve the tougher capital requirements said hydes 
proposal could prevent regulators from moving in on unsound sampls for 
up to 18 months 
this will allow the shysters over and over to strip an 
institution of its assets before the regulators could move in he 
said as were seeing it only takes a few bad apples to bring a 
whole industry down 
another fight when the bill reaches the floor wednesday and votes 
start thursday will be over whether to add the immediate 50 billion 
taxpayer share of the costs to the federal deficit

the washington apple commission has 
rejected a call to put special labels on boxes of alartreated 
apples 
commissioners voted instead friday to ask growers to approve an 
emergency assessment of 25 cents a box to pay for additional 
advertising to move the remaining 1988 crop 
some 12 million boxes of washington apples are in storage now 
about 45 million more than last year to sell that inventory before 
the 1989 crop arrives will require moving about 682000 boxes of 
apples a week executive director tom hale said that compares to 
the past two summers average of 425000 boxes a week he said 
the emergency assessment must be ratified by growers and then 
come back to the commission for final approval it would be in 
effect only between july 1 and aug 30 
the manufacturer of alar uniroyal chemical co announced june 2 
it was taking the substance off the us market immediately to help 
rebuild consumer confidence 
alar is the marketing name for daminozide a growth regulator 
that enhances the appearance of apples and increases their shelf 
life it was labeled a possible carcinogen by the private natural 
resources defense council in a february report the environmental 
protection agency subsequently announced it plans to ban alar next 
year 
the commissions advertising money is depleted now but a 
proposed 2 million supplemental advertising program funded by the 
assessment would promote apples as a portable summer fruit and try 
to lure customers with sweepstakes and cash prizes 
the commission had sent a questionnaire to growers asking in 
part whether all washington apple cartons should be labeled 
alar or no alar for the remainder of the 1988 crop 
in the results announced friday 689 growers said yes and 734 
said no 
several commissioners said they thought segregating alartreated 
apples would be harmful to the industry they also said it would be 
counterproductive to the commissions plan to erase the word 
alar the publics mind 
the alar controversy already has cost washington growers more 
than 77 million this year and nationwide has cost growers more 
than 100 million hale has said

operations to fend off the bid it turned up possible financial 
wrongdoings by the companys chief executive officer william w 
nicholson

analysts say a decision by chrysler corp to drop 
2monthold interestfree financing on most models may be a sign the 
no 3 automaker will adopt other incentive programs 
chrysler on friday altered the incentive package by offering cash 
rebates ranging from 500 to 2000 and interest rates as low as 29 
percent for the bulk of its car and truck line the program runs 
indefinitely 
chryslers move brings it closer to incentive programs at ford 
motor co and general motors corp 
jeannette garretty of the bank of america in san francisco said 
the move could indicate other incentives are planned 
the issue that is facing all of the manufacturers right now is 
with sales not as high or not responding as quickly to the 
incentives that have been put out there the question is what do 
they do she said 
do they have to take them off for a little while in order to be 
able to trumpet a whole new thisisit endoftheyear clearance 
there are going to be all sorts of deals 
chrysler began offering interestfree financing on twoyear loans 
for all of its cars and some of its light trucks on april 3 
effective monday the automaker said nointerest twoyear loans 
would be available only on six cars and trucks 
during april about half of the loans written by chrysler 
financial corp the automakers financing arm were zero percent 
said spokesman bob heath figures for may are not yet available he 
said 
chryslers car sales were down 29 percent and truck sales were 
up 55 percent in april compared with april 1988 
typically less than 25 percent of the automobile buyers going 
through financing arms of the big three automakers choose twoyear 
loans garretty speculated that most chrysler buyers who chose 
twoyear loans already were in the car market and were ready with 
large down payments

would have forfeited if tyson had failed in its bid to acquire holly 
farms of memphis tenn 
the deal having failed conagra increased its bid for holly farms 
to 70 a share later on may 19 a bid which the holly farms board 
subsequently accepted and which tyson the nations largest poultry 
processor has challenged in court 
blair said friday in a telephone interview that tyson had agreed 
after extensive negotiations with conagra that if we acquired 
holly we would require holly to settle with conagra by paying 
conagra 50 million the payment arrangement had been suggested by 
conagra a major food processor and agricultural supply company 
blair said 
blair said that when conagra sought the 25 million deposit on 
the morning of may 19 it made him so dismayed and angry and 
irritated that he handed over negotiations to an attorney who 
represents tyson in its effort to acquire holly farms 
the attorneys efforts failed to clear the air blair said and 
just as the 5 pm edt deadline approached for the holly farms 
auction conagra began to transmit via a facsimile machine its bid 
for the memphis company 
the fax transmission was interrupted when tyson chairman don 
tyson called michael harper conagras chairman to renew talks 
conagra spokesman walt casey said friday 
that effort also collapsed so we turned on the fax machine 
and resubmitted the bid casey said 
after the holly farms board accepted conagras 70ashare bid 
over tysons 6350ashare offer tyson petitioned the delaware 
courts for relief in the 8monthold battle for holly farms 
as part of the proposed settlement between tyson and conagra 
conagra would have dropped its insistence on enforcing the asset 
lockup agreement holly farms granted it in november the agreement 
gives conagra the right to buy some of holly farms most valuable 
assets in the event conagra does not acquire holly farms 
effectively blocking any other company from acquiring holly farms 
the lockup agreement is at the heart of tysons court claims that 
it has never had a fair shot at bidding on holly farms 
the three companies are now waiting for a trial date to be set 
for tysons challenge to the lockup

an italian magistrate has charged the head of 
italys dominant merchant bank mediobanca with deceitful 
bookkeeping newspapers reported sunday 
milan investigating magistrate gherardo colombo charged enrico 
cuccia with registering the equivalent of 17 million under a false 
heading in mediobancas balance sheets during the years 19761980 
cuccia and other bank officials have said they are innocent of 
the charges 
investigators did not reveal the alleged destination of the 
funds newspapers said investigators believed the money was likely 
paid under the table to accountants construction workers or others 
performing services for the bank 
additionally the newspapers reported the money probably was 
used to give bank employees bonuses and to improve ailing balances 
of some of the banks client companies 
cuccia an 81yearold financial wizard has headed the bank 
which is part stateowned and part private since it was founded in 
1946 he formally retired in 1982 but has stayed on as honorary 
president 
investigations into the alledged diversion of funds began about 
ten years ago and seemed to have reached a halt in 1984 when 
prosecutors recommended the case be dismissed 
milan magistrates instead continued examining the case and have 
issued a summons for the elderly banker and four other people who 
were top officials of the bank during the second half of the 1970s

secretary of housing and urban development jack 
kemp is very upset by allegations that millions of dollars were 
embezzled from the department by private escrow agents including 
claims by a maryland woman that she siphoned off 55 million to 
give to the poor a hud official said sunday 
kemp ordered hud inspector general paul adams to conduct an 
immediate investigation of alleged embezzlement in huds washington 
field office and on friday kemp placed four employees on leave 
without pay frank keating huds general counseldesignee said 
the washington post reported the embezzlement losses could reach 
10 million in the washington office while the new york times said 
investigations also were under way in hud offices in denver 
houston new orleans and los angeles about milliondollar diversions 
in texas reba louise lovell has been indicted on charges she 
embezzled 25 million from the sale of 55 homes in the dallas area 
a twoyear investigation in the washington office led to an 
inspector generals audit 
marilyn harrell an escrow agent in maryland whom federal 
investigators have dubbed robin hud claimed that 
extraordinarily lax management allowed her to divert as much as 55 
million during a fouryear period to help feed clothe and house the 
poor in washington 
i figured that as long as i was going to go to jail anyway i 
would help a few people with the time i had left the 46yearold 
temple hills md resident told the times 
in a telephone interview with the associated press on sunday 
keating said that based upon what he has read in the newspapers 
im outraged and i know the secretary is extremely upset that 
acts like this could take place although as noted all of them 
allegedly took place prior to him taking office 
keating would not comment directly on harrells allegations 
attempts to contact harrell were not successful 
keating said kemp ordered a full investigation by the inspector 
generals office and an accounting firm to determine the extent of 
the problem suggest remedies and construct a system which will make 
this kind of conduct infrequent if not impossible in the future 
the fact that in dallas a closing agent could allegedly 
embezzle 2 million and not be noticed the fact that in maryland a 
closing agent could allegedly give 5 million to the poor and not be 
noticed shows serious mangement deficiencies and the secretary 
intends to see that that conduct does not recur keating said 
the investigation is separate from a congressional inquiry into 
allegations that influencepeddling at hud allowed more than a dozen 
former reagan administration officials to benefit from housing 
programs meant for the poor 
as an escrow agent harrell collected money from the sales of 
property that had been foreclosed by the federal housing 
administration the properties originally had been purchased with 
hudguaranteed loans 
agents such as harrell handle the closing on the foreclosures and 
turn over the sales proceeds to the government while keeping a small 
commission 
but in 1985 she used some of the hud money to cover a 37000 
shortfall in her business harrell told the times when several 
months passed without an inquiry from hud it became clear to her 
the department was so poorly run that it was unable to track the 
millions in dollars in payments due from escrow agents she said 
she took more money as much as 55 million by her estimate 
before anyone noticed investigators believe she bought 20 homes and 
nearly 40 automobiles for the needy 
she told the post in an interview published sunday that some of 
the money may have become mingled into improvements on her home 
that included a swimming pool a 2500 widescreen television and 
renovations to her basement 
but she said she used her home as a homeless shelter and 
therefore she could justify the expenses she said she now has 
transferred the home to hud in an attempt to offset her financial 
problems 
her scheme began to unravel last year she said when a hud 
official in the washington field office everett rothschild 
detected the diversion 
rothschild would not comment when contacted sunday but his 
attorney joseph scott was quoted by the post as saying 
rothschilds suspension was an outrage 
rothshcild is the person who came in and tried to do something 
about this scott said 
rothschild is chief of the property disposition division of the 
washington field office keating said rothschild was placed on leave 
without pay along with margaret white who heads the office robert 
warner director of housing management and charle womble a 
supervisory loan specialist 
harrell faces questioning by a grand jury in baltimore and says 
she is cooperating with investigators trying to track the diverted 
funds 
she told the times she was relieved her activities finally were 
out in the open 
christians arent perfect she was quoted as saying 
theyre just forgiven

a mellon bank corp attorney warned in a 
confidential memo six months ago the bank could be subject to 
penalties as a result of some insurance charges imposed on thousands 
of auto loan customers in 1987 and 1988 
attorney charles f miller said the insurance charges may have 
been excessive and even illegal the pittsburgh press which 
recently reviewed a copy of the memo reported in its sunday 
editions miller said penalties could include heavy fines 
forfeiture of interest collected and courtimposed damages 
the press said the dec 20 memo cautioned that attempts to 
correct the problem by refunding money to consumers might result in 
classaction lawsuits by calling attention to the situation 
the insurance charges in question were imposed on an estimated 
22000 pennsylvania auto loan customers according to the newspaper 
the memo was addressed to paul mangelsdorf then an assistant 
vice president in charge of indirect lending he now works for a 
bank in buffalo ny 
neither miller nor mangelsdorf would comment on the memo the 
press said mellon said in a written response that after 
thoroughly exploring the issues raised in the memo it had 
concluded its insurance program is in compliance with all laws and 
regulations 
the pittsburghbased bank said it removed two of the charges 
cited by miller from customers statements earlier this year the 
bank said that action reduced the customers annual insurance 
premium 
mellon told the press it did so because the charges did not 
offer sufficiently substantial benefits to either our customers or 
the bank 
the pennsylvania insurance commission has ruled that the type of 
insurance referred to by miller collateral protection insurance 
must provide benefits to both consumers and the bank 
the insurance plan is called forceplaced insurance mellon 
like many lenders requires new car owners to agree to buy physical 
damage insurance to protect the banks collateral which is the 
vehicle some banks selfinsure on such losses while others write 
off the losses 
if a consumer allows his private insurance to expire mellon 
obtains forceplaced coverage and adds the insurance premium to the 
customers car loan balance the interest charged on the premium is 
the same as that charged on the auto loan mellon said 
under this program a customers monthly car payment does not 
change so the result is a balloon payment due when the loan 
matures miller said the interest on the premiums also accumulates 
until the loan matures 
john sinclair former president of the mellon insurance agency 
said mellons program began as a means of cutting high loan losses 
but quickly became a moneymaker for the bank 
mellon lost 884 million in 1987 and 65 million in 1988 but 
reported firstquarter profits this year of 77 million 
sinclair said he recommended feb 7 that mellon rescind some of 
its premium charges and return money to customers he said he was 
fired for insubordination two days later 
mellon disputed sinclairs account of his firing calling him a 
disgruntled exemployee the bank told the press he was dismissed 
for appropriate business reasons unrelated to the product in 
question 
thats nonsense sinclair replied it was related directly 
to the product in question my position was that if they the legal 
department deemed the product illegal which they did it should 
have been discontinued
