nicolae franghili has not seen his hometown 
just across the prut river in 49 years since the day his parents 
and their six sons fled stalins terror when the soviet union 
absorbed moldavia 
he said he will return once a week if romanias revolution 
against another tyrant nicolae ceausescu opens one of the 
tightest borders in eastern europe 
opening the border is expected to be on the agenda saturday when 
the soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze meets with 
officials of the interim government that took over when ceausescu 
was overthrown and executed last month 
romanians profess to have more serious problems than 
reunification with what is now soviet moldavia taken by stalin in 
1940 but rising ethnic consciousness on the soviet side has made 
moldavia one of the kremlins many headaches 
much broader cultural and economic exchanges and a plan to open 
the border to free travel are among issues soviet officials have 
discussed with the new romanian government mikhail s platon a 
deputy premier of moldavia said in an interview this week in 
kishinev the capital 
franghili across the river is eager 
im just waiting the grayhaired 60yearold construction 
engineer said in an interview tuesday at the dining table of his 
small apartment in this romanian border city of 300000 people i 
want a passport so i can go every sunday 
his father a teamster received a grant of land from the 
soviets after they arrived in 1940 in what had been northern 
romania and everything seemed fine at first 
the soviet government sent material for the residents to make 
clothing the same flowered cloth for men and women alike 
franghili recalled 
he remembers how columns of soviet soldiers with red banners 
unfurled led tanks into his town how positive feelings began 
changing as stalin deported ethnic moldavians and replaced them 
with politically more reliable slavs 
the family fled to western romania when germany and its allies 
in bucharest attacked the soviet union in 1941 in 1946 they hid 
again to avoid being sent back to the victorious soviet side as 
stalin demanded 
franghili has seen the moldavian side of the border only once 
on a tour in 1979 
romanian tour guides refused to allow deviations from tbe 
itinerary even for the reunion of relatives who had not seen each 
other for decades franghili could not travel to the river town of 
kagul about 90 miles south on the soviet side of the border 
such strictness has been standard on the border for 20 years 
after ceausescu refused to take part in the warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia in 1968 the soviet union severely restricted border 
access 
in recent years ceausescus worry that his citizens would find 
life better on the other side prompted romania to limit travel 
ethnic moldavians who make up 64 percent of that soviet 
republics 42 million people began clamoring last year for more 
autonomy from moscow as have people in the baltic republics and 
other regions 
like the baltics moldavia was taken by stalin under the secret 
protocol of the 1939 nonaggression agreement with nazi germany 
until now moldavian activists had no options because ceausescu 
a romanian stalin in the eyes of mikhai ghimpuc leader of 
the moldavian peoples front was on the other side of the border 
soviet officials who for decades tried to convince the world 
that romanians and moldavians were distinct nationalities finally 
gave up in september the cyrillic alphabet stalin imposed on 
moldavia was replaced by the latin alphabet romanians use 
people on both sides of the border understand each other with 
little difficulty and both areas claim to be cradles of romanian 
culture for centuries iasi was a center of romanian learning 
ethnic feelings and passion for reunification are much stronger 
on the soviet side of the border than in romania 
platon said that when the uprising against ceausescu began 
many moldavians told the soviet government they were ready to fight 
for the revolution moscow refused to allow it but offered 
humanitarian aid 
the soviet side is willing to open bridges closed for decades 
exchange theater groups writers and other artists and begin 
closer economic cooperation platon said but reunification is 
another question 
this is not a situation of two germany he said referring 
to calls to reunify east and west germany since the berlin wall was 
opened in november 
he said soviet moldavians whose territory is rich 
agriculturally know they live better than romanians 
officially the new romanian government agrees reunification 
with moldavia or bessarabia as it was known in the russian empire 
is not on the table 
there is no bessarabian problem and in any case it is not 
bessarabia but soviet moldavia said silviu brucan who manages 
foreign policy for the national salvation front now running romania 
franghili and other residents of iasi see reunification as a 
distant goal not to be pursued now when the country must be 
rebuilt

phoenix millionaire charles h keating jr 
denying government charges he plundered his own thrift is 
defiantly accusing the government of driving his lincoln savings 
and loan association into bankruptcy 
keating who is asking a federal court to overturn the 
governments seizure of lincoln said the irvine calif thrift 
would be operating at a profit today if the government hadnt 
interfered in his business eventually taking it away from him 
they took away an association with 55 billion in assets and 
they were supposed to have some reason to do that keating told 
reporters friday after completing nearly six hours of testimony 
before us district court judge stanley sporkin 
this company lincoln made money in my opinion it was well 
managed in my opinion it would have survived in my opinion there 
would have been under the proper handling by the regulator no 
losses he said on the steps of the federal courthouse 
regulators seized lincoln in april and estimated the cost of the 
failure to taxpayers at up to 2 billion making it the largest sampl 
failure yet the government later filed a 11 billion fraud and 
racketeering civil suit against keating and his associates 
the financier is also at the center of a political drama in 
which the senate ethics committee is investigating the actions of 
five senators who accepted more than 13 million in contributions 
from keating and later met with federal regulators on his behalf 
under questioning from government attorneys and the judge 
keating denied the contention of regulators that he used business 
deals and other devices to funnel money from lincoln to american 
continental corp lincolns parent company 
the holding company paid keating a total salary of 37 million 
in 1986 and 1987 and employed many of his relatives 
specifically the government says american continental used a 
taxsharing agreement between lincoln and american continental to 
siphon 94 million from the thrift to the holding company from 1985 
through 1988 
however keating told sporkin with all my heart and soul i 
want you to know that i categorically deny that i had any concept 
remotely related to that 
regulators say keating used sham land transactions to 
generate false profits at lincoln which in turn created a tax 
liability that could be paid to the holding company 
in one lincoln was able to make an 11 million profit and 
create a 44 million tax liability by selling 1000 acres of land 
to westcontinental mortgage co a straw buyer for arizona 
developer ernest c garcia that same day garcia had received a 
20 million loan from lincoln which regulators contend enabled 
garcia to pay for the land 
keating acknowledged lincolns bookkeeping cloaked garcias 
identity as the true buyer of the land but he said that was common 
in land syndication deals 
sporkin who served as enforcement chief at the securities and 
exchange commission before becoming a judge reacted skeptically 
when you run a bank or a savings and loan you have the 
highest responsibility of anyone because youre not dealing just 
with stockholders youre dealing with peoples savings sporkin 
said the only way regulators can ensure that an institution 
is being run properly is if the books and records accurately 
reflect transactions 
garcia through his attorney refused to testify friday 
invoking his constitutional protection against selfincrimination 
friday marked the seventh day of hearings in keatings attempt 
to overturn the seizure of lincoln and the end of the governments 
presentation keatings attorney said he would require nine days to 
present keatings evidence against regulators sporkin said he 
hoped to begin those sessions as early as next week 
the governments case has been presented and completed and to 
me its obvious that they have not made a case our turn now 
starts keating said

gwyneth jones who made her debut at the 
metropolitan opera in 1972 hadnt sung the title role in 
turandot here until the puccini operas first performance this 
season 
her performance was a triumph 
her singing including lots of difficult high notes was strong 
and beautiful vocally and in acting the welsh soprano made 
turandot more womanly and less a monster than usually is done 
since calaf the tenor falls in love with the bloodthirsty 
chinese princess its probably a good idea 
at the friday night performance nello santi conducted with 
control and vigor and received enthusiastic applause 
vladimir popov of moscow has an unusual tenor voice in the 
first act it was focused too narrowly and sounded strained after 
he warmed up it sounded like an irish tenor warm while keeping a 
crisp edge his voice can ring not just on final notes but 
through entire phrases 
the aria nessun dorma is where most tenors display their 
vocal beauty 
popovs voice sounded more beautiful when he was answering 
turandots riddles if he missed shed send him to death and 
later when turandot is feeling emotion for the first time 
aprile millo sang the slave liu we prefer a less rich soprano 
voice for liu as more of a contrast to turandots voice but 
theres no denying that miss millo created some beautiful musical 
moments 
early in act 1 however when liu calaf and his old father are 
on stage john macurdy as the old man sounded best the other two 
were pushing too hard 
the production one of franco zeffirellis elaborate big ones 
was new in march 1987 it wasnt presented last season and much of 
the audience hadnt seen it before judging from the delighted 
gasps for the emperors splendid golden throne room 
a few changes have been made 
act 1 is gray people sampans and shacks the palace once 
shimmering in the distance seems to have been brought forward and 
the banners furled for each riddle now are done by three men 
instead of the silliness of two men pulling them from a backpack 
worn by turandot

when flight 1575 took off from fresno calif 
the passengers thought they were flying to reno nev but the 
federal aviation administration says the pilot and his dispatcher 
had other plans 
the faa which for a time thought the june 17 flight had been 
hijacked proposed friday to suspend the licenses of the delta air 
lines pilot and dispatcher and fine the airline 70000 for flying 
an unairworthy plane to an unscheduled destination 
faa spokesman fred farrar said that when the airline found it 
could not make needed repairs to its rudder control system in 
fresno or reno it allowed the plane to take off with passengers 
and then immediately diverted it to los angeles where repair 
facilities were available 
neither the faa nor delta identified the pilot or dispatcher or 
said how many passengers were aboard the flight 
farrar said letters were sent dec 15 to the airline and the two 
employees informing them of the proposed fine and suspension and 
giving them a chance to respond before it becomes final 
airline spokeswoman jackie pate in atlanta said delta would 
investigate the incident and discuss the proposed action with the 
faa its premature to say anything about what happened she 
said 
the faa said the pilot was in contact with maintenance 
facilities in atlanta ga where the dispatcher was located 
before takeoff the pilot spent 20 or 30 minutes on the ground 
performing various tests in an unsuccessful effort to fix the 
problem the faa said 
according to the agencys letter the captain and dispatcher 
then devised a course of action to takeoff the aircraft from 
fresno with a flight plan to reno with no intent to fly to reno 
but instead on takeoff to immediately divert to los angeles because 
of the mechanical discrepancy 
during the time on the ground the pilot did not communicate 
with the faa control tower 
this together with the unexplained diversion of the flight 
after takeoff prompted the faa to treat the flight as a possible 
hijacking and give it special handling farrar said 
the 727 has three rudder control units including a standby but 
the faa said the aircrafts minimum equipment list requires that 
all three be operating prior to takeoff 
an inoperative system could cause control problems under some 
circumstances such as landing in a crosswind or if there were an 
engine failure during takeoff farrar said

panamanians almost unanimously support the us 
invasion that toppled gen manuel antonio noriega despite 
casualties that personally touched nearly a quarter of the 
population a poll there has found 
more than six in 10 of the 794 panamanians polled expect the 
invading us troops to remain there for six months or longer and 
nearly eight in 10 said they want the soldiers to stay that long or 
as long as necessary 
the survey consisting mostly of inperson interviews was done 
tuesday through thursday by cbs news and belden amp russonello a 
research firm based in washington remote areas were excluded but 
results can be projected to about 75 percent of the population the 
poll has a fourpoint error margin 
interviewing was under way when noriega surrendered to us 
forces wednesday night to face charges in miami of supporting 
international drug trafficking eight in 10 favored his trial in 
the united states 
cbs pollster kathleen a frankovic noted that the findings could 
reflect a post noriegaoutofthere euphoria among panamanians 
followup surveys could find whether the support for the invasion 
is lasting or shortlived 
as things are 92 percent said noriegas reign was mostly bad 
for panama and even more said the panamanian people couldnt have 
ousted him alone with noriega out 90 percent expect the situation 
in panama to improve 
the us invasion dec 20 won equally resounding support 
ninetytwo percent were in favor with most of them approving 
strongly 
eight in 10 moreover believed the united states sincerely 
cared about helping panamanian democracy nearly as many said 
they would have supported a us invasion during a coup attempt by 
panamanian officers in october 
roughly threequarters said us troops used appropriate force 
in the fighting which lasted four days leaving an estimated 600 
people dead and thousands wounded surprisingly 19 percent said 
the invaders used too little force 
the invasions cost was high in any case fifteen percent said 
they suffered some personal loss loss of property or vandalism to 
their home or business ten percent said the main wageearner in 
their home had lost his or her job since the invasion ten percent 
said they had a good friend or relative killed and 13 percent said 
they had a friend or relative wounded 
despite the casualties 87 percent said noriegas ouster was 
worth the price 
respondents gave strong favorable ratings to their new leaders 
and about threequarters expected panama to be truly ruled by the 
civil government rather than by the panamanian military or the 
united states still 57 percent opposed allowing members of the 
military under noriega to join the new military 
on the panama canal 53 percent expected the united states to 
want to renegotiate the treaty turning the canal over to the 
panamanian government in 1999 most found that acceptable seventy 
percent preferred having the canal run jointly by the united states 
and panama instead of either one alone 
as to noriega 71 percent called it completely unlikely that 
he may return to power and 16 percent called that not very 
likely 
the pollsters sought to avoid bias by having interviews 
conducted in spanish by panamanian interviewers who said they were 
doing independent research for television news without identifying 
the network 
about 70 interviews were conducted by telephone with residents 
of the wealthier sections of panama city respondents elsewhere 
were interviewed in person interviews were conducted in 158 
randomly selected neighborhoods excluding more rural communities 
the remote bocas del toro and darien provinces and the indian 
reservation of san blas 
cbs news noted that its efforts were complicated by the 
conditions under which the survey was conducted with neighborhoods 
under curfew and a strong military presence in the streets

after almost two years of legwork police 
got their lucky break in a serialmurder investigation when a 
helicopter pilot circled once more around a park and found a 
suspect and one of his alleged victims 
the pilot followed arthur shawcross a 44yearold paroled 
killer to a nursing home where police questioned him wednesday a 
day later shawcross was in jail charged with killing eight women 
and under investigation in the deaths of three others 
we were just on a search just going over an area that we had 
covered previously said state police sgt ken r hundt one of 
two pilots of the helicopter it was kind of like we saw the 
vehicle first and then the second time around we both saw the body 
as far as im concerned it was just a matter of luck 
rochester police chief gordon f urlacher said shawcross made 
statements to authorities about the murders and told police where 
to find three bodies but he refused to say whether shawcross 
admitted to the crimes 
a state police source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
shawcross admitted to 11 of the murders 
shawcross pleaded innocent friday to eight counts of 
seconddegree murder at his arraignment in rochester city court 
judge john manning regan ordered him held without bail until a 
preliminary hearing wednesday each count carries a possible 
penalty of 25 years to life in prison 
a profile of the suspect began to emerge friday from state 
prison and parole officials relatives and police who investigated 
the 1972 slaying of 8yearold karen hill the rochester girl was 
strangled and sexually molested while visiting watertown 150 miles 
to the northeast 
shawcross was convicted of firstdegree manslaughter for that 
slaying and served 15 years in prison 
i thought he was a very dangerous person said charles s 
kubinski a retired watertown police detective who investigated 
that slaying he was not mentally disturbed he knew what he was 
doing 
after his parole in 1987 shawcross was moved by parole 
officials from three communities because of opposition by local 
residents one of the communities was delhi a town of 3500 people 
about 120 miles northwest of new york city 
i feel that if the people hadnt stood up and showed their 
displeasure with the system then wed have had the problem 
rochester did delhi police chief frank harmer said we dodged 
a bullet 
shawcross eventually settled in rochester finding a job making 
salads in a restaurant 
he appeared to be adapting well to life outside prison said 
edward elwin executive director of the state division of parole

panamanians almost unanimously support the us 
invasion that toppled gen manuel antonio noriega despite 
casualties that personally touched nearly a quarter of the 
population a poll there has found 
more than six in 10 of the 794 panamanians polled expect the 
invading us troops to remain there for six months or longer and 
nearly eight in 10 said they want the soldiers to stay that long or 
as long as necessary 
the survey consisting mostly of inperson interviews was done 
tuesday through thursday by cbs news and belden amp russonello a 
research firm based in washington remote areas were excluded but 
results can be projected to about 75 percent of the population the 
poll has a fourpoint error margin 
interviewing was under way when noriega surrendered to us 
forces wednesday night to face charges in miami of supporting 
international drug trafficking eight in 10 favored his trial in 
the united states 
cbs pollster kathleen a frankovic noted that the findings could 
reflect a post noriegaoutofthere euphoria among panamanians 
followup surveys could find whether the support for the invasion 
is lasting or shortlived 
as things are 92 percent said noriegas reign was mostly bad 
for panama and even more said the panamanian people couldnt have 
ousted him alone with noriega out 90 percent expect the situation 
in panama to improve 
the us invasion dec 20 won equally resounding support 
ninetytwo percent were in favor with most of them approving 
strongly 
eight in 10 moreover believed the united states sincerely 
cared about helping panamanian democracy nearly as many said 
they would have supported a us invasion during a coup attempt by 
panamanian officers in october 
roughly threequarters said us troops used appropriate force 
in the fighting which lasted four days leaving an estimated 600 
people dead and thousands wounded surprisingly 19 percent said 
the invaders used too little force 
the invasions cost was high in any case fifteen percent said 
they suffered some personal loss loss of property or vandalism to 
their home or business ten percent said the main wageearner in 
their home had lost his or her job since the invasion ten percent 
said they had a good friend or relative killed and 13 percent said 
they had a friend or relative wounded 
despite the casualties 87 percent said noriegas ouster was 
worth the price 
respondents gave strong favorable ratings to their new leaders 
and about threequarters expected panama to be truly ruled by the 
civil government rather than by the panamanian military or the 
united states still 57 percent opposed allowing members of the 
military under noriega to join the new military 
on the panama canal 53 percent expected the united states to 
want to renegotiate the treaty turning the canal over to the 
panamanian government in 1999 most found that acceptable seventy 
percent preferred having the canal run jointly by the united states 
and panama instead of either one alone 
as to noriega 71 percent called it completely unlikely that 
he may return to power and 16 percent called that not very 
likely 
the pollsters sought to avoid bias by having interviews 
conducted in spanish by panamanian interviewers who said they were 
doing independent research for television news without identifying 
the network 
about 70 interviews were conducted by telephone with residents 
of the wealthier sections of panama city respondents elsewhere 
were interviewed in person interviews were conducted in 158 
randomly selected neighborhoods excluding more rural communities 
the remote bocas del toro and darien provinces and the indian 
reservation of san blas 
cbs news noted that its efforts were complicated by the 
conditions under which the survey was conducted with neighborhoods 
under curfew and a strong military presence in the streets

us intelligence and law enforcement 
officials hope tons of documents captured by the military in panama 
will yield information on possible double agents and on arms and 
drug trafficking an intelligence community source says 
eight people in panama are working on what has been dubbed the 
document control branch a special interagency group set up for 
the task said the source who has firsthand information about the 
group and spoke on the condition of anonymity 
it could take representatives from the military the cia the 
us customs service the drug enforcement administration and the 
state department some six months sift through the material 
according to the source asked about the group a state department 
official said we have nothing for you on that 
the us military took the documents from panamanian government 
offices in the days following the dec 20 invasion 
the source indicated the law enforcement and intelligence 
workers were based at a us military installation in panama a 
pentagon spokesman said the defense department did not have any 
information on that 
according to the source some of the papers examined by the 
group document arms trafficking by the former regime of gen manuel 
antonio noriega including the channeling of weapons to guerrillas 
fighting the government in colombia 
us officials have long contended that cuba exports 
sovietsupplied materiel to undermine democratic countries in the 
region 
the state department says cuba ships arms to el salvadors 
rebels havana provides the sandinista government in nicaragua with 
most of its weaponry and nicaragua in turn has supplied panama 
with arms american officials contend 
in 1987 noriegas former deputy roberto diaz herrera told 
reporters the panamanian general shipped weapons to the colombian 
guerrillas 
noriega who surrendered to us officials wednesday faces drug 
trafficking charges in miami and the source said the drug 
enforcement administration is seeking additional information on 
drug trafficking in the papers 
in other areas of inquiry the source said 
customs is looking into possible illegal transfers of 
technology and smuggling american officials have contended that 
goods otherwise unavailable to cuba because of trade sanctions have 
arrived on the island through panama 
the cia will be looking for lists of spies attempting to find 
out who may have worked as double agents noriega has been widely 
reported to have established close ties with the cia when he served 
in the 1970s as head of intelligence for the panamanian defense 
forces 
as his internal problems heated up and the americans pressed for 
his ouster noriega sought closer ties with cuba several us 
sources believe the general often worked as a double agent 
providing information to the intelligence agencies in both the 
united states and cuba 
a former noriega aide jose i blandon testified before a 
senate hearing in 1988 that the general began building up a 
criminal organization in the early 1970s which involved money 
laundering drug smuggling and arms dealing

lawyers for former white house aide oliver 
north say his irancontra case convictions should be thrown out 
because former president reagan did not testify at norths trial 
mr reagan was in a position to testify as no other witness 
available to north could about whether the president authorized 
a coverup of a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran north said 
in papers filed friday urging a federal appeals court to overturn 
his convictions 
north testified at his trial last year that thennational 
security adviser john poindexter told north that reagan in a nov 
12 1986 meeting had not disclosed to congressional leaders his 
1985 authorization for the hawk shipment 
that statement by poindexter certainly provided a reasonable 
basis for concluding that mr reagan had made clear that us 
involvement in the hawk shipment should not be disclosed to 
congress norths papers said 
mr reagans expected testimony also would have corroborated 
norths statements that he was ordered to cover up evidence of his 
assistance to the contras by altering classified national security 
council documents the filing said 
us district court judge gerhard gesell quashed norths 
subpoena for reagans testimony saying the court record contained 
no proof the president authorized north to break the law 
court arguments in norths appeal are scheduled for feb 6 he 
was convicted in may of aiding and abetting an obstruction of 
congress in connection with the hawk shipment altering and 
destroying national security council documents that detailed his 
assistance to the contras and illegally accepting a home security 
system from richard secord 
secord enlisted by north to run arms to the contras during a 
congressional ban on military aid to the rebel force will be 
sentenced jan 24 it was disclosed friday secord pleaded guilty 
to making a false statement when he told congressional 
investigators that he was unaware of any money from the irancontra 
operation that had benefited north secord could face up to five 
years in prison and a 250000 fine 
north was sentenced to 1200 hours of community service and 
fined 150000 he is appealing the fine and convictions while 
serving the community service in an antidrug program

researchers at johns hopkins university say 
their discovery of a gene that may play a role in forming colon 
cancers could move science closer to a basic understanding of how 
colon malignancies form 
dr bert vogelstein head of a research team at the hopkins 
oncology center said his laboratory found that a gene on 
chromosome 18 is an excellent candidate for one of four or five 
genes that experts believe may be linked to colon cancer formation 
the gene is called dcc for deleted in colon cancer because 
the hopkins research found it is altered in more than 70 percent of 
the colorectal cancers studied 
a report on the dcc gene was published friday in the journal 
science 
vogelstein said the discovery had no immediate clinical or 
preventative application for colon cancer the nations second most 
lethal form of cancer however he said it could contribute to 
developing methods to detect the disease at an earlier more 
treatable stage 
the hopkins team examined 41 colorectal cancers finding that in 
more than 70 percent of them the cells had only one copy of a part 
of chromosome 18 the missing part contained what they called the 
dcc gene normal cells have two copies of this portion of 
chromosome 18 
normal cells contain 23 different and whole chromosomes which 
form the package for all human genes the genes in a cell direct 
the production of proteins that carry out biological functions 
including the creation of new cells 
when these genes are altered normal protein production is 
affected that can lead to abnormal cell formation and perhaps 
disease 
though discovery of the dcc gene has no immediate application 
vogelstein said it theoretically could lead to a method of early 
detection of colon cancer he said the mutated gene could produce 
an altered protein that might be detected in blood or stool that 
in turn could lead to a direct molecular test for the early stages 
of cancer formation 
it is believed he said that colon cancer forms through the 
mutation of four or five genes 
earlier studies at hopkins identified two other genes called 
ras and p53 that seem to mutate or alter during the formation of 
colon cancer ras is an oncogene a gene whose presence contributes 
to cancer formation p53 is a tumor suppressor whose absence seems 
to enhance cancer formation 
vogelstein said the dcc gene is an excellent candidate for a 
suppressor gene but that the finding needs to be verified by other 
labs 
about 147000 americans were diagnosed with colon cancer in 
1988 and about 61000 die of the disease annually second only to 
lung cancer 
members of vogelsteins research team included eric fearon dr 
kathleen cho janice nigro dr jonathan simons dr j michael 
ruppert dr stan hamilton antonette preisigner and kenneth 
kinzler

a prosecutor accused of inventing a story 
about two men trying to assassinate him was dejected because he 
feared he wouldnt be reappointed a top aide said 
camden county prosecutor samuel asbell now in a psychiatric 
hospital hadnt gotten any indication on his future from the 
states governorelect the prosecutors first assistant dennis g 
wixted said friday 
he was extremely disappointed at the prospect of not being 
reappointed and was sometimes very sad quiet and seemingly 
depressed about it wixted said 
the guntoting prosecutor known for accompanying detectives on 
drug busts resigned and checked into a psychiatric hospital after 
he was caught fabricating the story state attorney general peter 
n perretti said friday 
asbell 46 had claimed that two gunmen opened fire on him 
during a car chase through the streets of camden on new years day 
he said he was showered with glass from his shattered car windows 
but wasnt badly injured in an attack he attributed to his tough 
stance on illegal drugs 
asbell said he fired back with a 12gauge shotgun and pistol he 
kept in the car and that he hit one of the assailants 
i saw his head explode asbell said at a news conference 
tuesday 
state police had found asbell shot out his own windows perretti 
said 
the event was staged by prosecutor asbell apparently acting 
alone perretti said 
he said asbell could face criminal charges depending on his 
psychiatric evaluation 
perretti refused to say why asbell might have staged the 
shooting 
wixted said friday that his boss whom republican gov thomas h 
kean appointed in 1984 had despaired because he had no indication 
he would be reappointed by govelect james florio a democrat who 
takes office jan 16 asbells term expired dec 17 and he had been 
a holdover since 
what developed was that his love for the job basically 
forced him into a situation very difficult to describe wixted 
said 
attempts to reach asbell were unsuccessful friday perretti said 
asbell entered the carrier foundation in somerset county for 
psychiatric evaluation a spokeswoman there said privacy laws 
barred her from confirming or denying his admission there 
perretti said if asbell decided to check out of the hospital 
authorities could move to have him held involuntarily 
the attorney general added that he hadnt found any evidence 
asbells sudden and aberrational behavior affected his work as 
prosecutor 
asbell stuck to his story as late as thursday 
i have met with the attorney general and he made it 
explicitly clear to me that i am a victim of a violent crime 
he very kindly said i have to get in my mind the fact that i am 
not a prosecutor in this matter but i am a victim asbell said 
at a news conference 
while in private practice in 1970 asbell was shot in the chest 
while representing a client whose property was put up for sheriffs 
sale the bullet remains lodged in his chest 
im a handson prosecutor asbell said wednesday the 
public knows me if they know me the drug dealers know me 
kean said that if asbell is found mentally incompetent 
prosecution would not serve any purpose 
the whole situation is very sad kean said he was a good 
hardworking prosecutor in every way 
gloucester county prosecutor richard hickey iii said he 
considered asbell a close friend 
he loved what he was doing i really feel for his family right 
now hickey said

president bush has expressed concern that 
networks use of a split screen to show coffins of gis being taken 
off a transport plane just as the president was making lighthearted 
comments at the white house made him appear callous 
bush at the end of a news conference friday asked the 
television networks to warn him in the future when use of the 
splitscreen technique is anticipated 
the president was referring to the live telecasts of his 
previous news conference held dec 21 just one day after the 
panama operation began toward the end of that session bush 
engaged in some holiday banter unaware that most of the tv control 
rooms also were splicing in a live shot of the solemn arrival 
ceremony at dover afb del for the bodies of the first us 
combat victims in panama 
all the networks except nbc employed the technique 
i got a lot of mail i had some calls said bush 
because when i was speaking here in this room juxtaposed against 
my frivolous comments at the time were some split screen techniques 
that showed american lives the bodies of dead soldiers in their 
caskets dead soldiers coming home 
and all i respectfully request is that if the urgency of the 
moment is such that that technique is going to be used if i could 
be told about it then well stop the proceedings or not if 
its something less traumatic 
but that one i could understand why the viewers were 
concerned about this they thought their president at a solemn 
moment like that didnt give a damn 
and i do bush added his voice catching i do i feel it 
so strongly so please help me with that if you would 
abc news spokesman scott richardson said abc news president 
roone arledge in essence agrees with what the president said 
he arledge called the control room when it came up split 
screen and asked them to go back to full frame richardson said 
peter jennings was quite upset and explained at the end of the 
news conference that the president had not known you were seeing 
the bodies arrive 
cbs news president david burke said in a statement that he 
understood the presidents sensitivity about the incident but 
that the network had planned live coverage of the arrival long 
before bush announced his news conference 
it was our judgment that we had the responsibility to 
broadcast live a brief portion of the arrival ceremony which 
occurred simultaneous with the presidents briefing burke said 
nbc which did not use the split screen said in a statement 
that it was not likely to develop a policy to alert the white house 
of such plans 
as a practical matter its not likely to happen in most cases 
since these decisions are often made in a matter of minutes the 
network said

president bush has authorized the release of 
1846 million in disaster aid to help with recovery from hurricane 
hugo in september and the california earthquake in october 
the white house said in a statement friday that the money would 
be used for school reconstruction debris removal transfer of 
patients to veterans administration hospitals from damaged 
facilities and repairing federal parks forests wildlife refuges 
and medical facilities 
it also will be used for forest fire prevention and 
stabilization of historic properties 
the education department will distribute 628 million for 
school reconstruction and related costs in the virgin islands 
puerto rico south carolina and north carolina the white house 
said 
it said the veterans affairs department will distribute 568 
million for construction and repair of its facilities and transfer 
of patients 
the money comes from a congressionally approved package that 
bush signed oct 26 allocating a total of 285 billion in 
disaster relief for regions that suffered from hurricane hugo and 
the northern california quake 
of that money bush was left 250 million to spend as he saw fit 
on unanticipated needs from both disasters

administration officials say the 1 million 
reward offered by president bush for information leading to the 
capture of deposed dictator manuel antonio noriega apparently will 
go unclaimed although a congressman believes the money should go 
to the papal nuncio in panama 
the administration had offered the bounty on dec 21 a day 
after the us invasion of panama and while noriega was still at 
large 
we dont have any claimants for it at this time said 
justice department spokesman david runkel on friday nobodys 
stepped forward and asked for it and i dont anticipate anyone 
will in view of the circumstances of noriegas surrender and 
arrest 
he said that under terms of the 1 million offer bush put on 
noriegas head if there were claimants the attorney general and 
the secretary of state would determine who would receive it and how 
much 
rep william broomfield rmich said friday in a letter to 
bush that the papal nuncio in panama monsignor jose sebastian 
laboa deserved the reward because he persuaded noriega to 
surrender 
but administration officials who asked not to be identified 
said the vatican probably wouldnt qualify for the reward because 
its role in noriegas surrender was an indirect one 
noriega was holed up in the vatican embassy from christmas eve 
until this past wednesday when he surrendered to us forces

the justice department says it spent 224000 
on a futile attempt to identify the source of an unauthorized 
disclosure of a preliminary criminal investigation involving rep 
william h gray iii 
the department conducted a fivemonth investigation to determine 
who leaked information that the fbi was investigating alleged 
financial irregularities in grays congressional office 
an initial cbstv story that gray was the subject of the 
preliminary investigation prompted a storm of accusations from 
democrats on capitol hill that the republicanrun justice 
department was trying to smear the pennsylvania democrat with news 
leaks 
the department quickly took the unusual step of issuing a 
statement that gray was not a target and was cooperating with fbi 
agents 
the cbs story was particularly embarrassing for attorney general 
dick thornburgh because it was aired as gray was seeking election 
as house majority whip a job he later won thornburgh ordered an 
investigation of the unauthorized leak 
the 224000 included the salaries and travel expenses of 11 fbi 
agents as well as prosecutors and support personnel said justice 
department spokesman david runkel on friday

a federal appeals court threw out the 
nations first damage award in a smokerdeath case and ordered a 
new trial leaving lawyers for both sides haggling over who emerged 
the winner 
the ruling by the 3rd us circuit court of appeals on friday 
set the stage for new and expanded litigation against cigarette 
manufacturers antismoking forces claimed 
the appeals court overturned a lower courts damage judgment 
which would have made liggett group inc pay the family of smoker 
who died of cancer 400000 the lower court found that liggett 
which makes chesterfield and lampm cigarettes had advertised its 
cigarettes as safe 
attorneys for three cigarette manufacturers claimed victory 
citing the reversal of the award which restored their 35year 
noloss record in such cases but their opponents stressed a part 
of the ruling in which the court reinstated broader claims that 
werent fully considered in the first trial 
rose cipollone of little ferry nj a smoker for 42 years 
originally filed the case against liggett and two other cigarette 
manufacturers lorillard inc and philip morris inc mrs cipollone 
died of lung cancer at age 58 in 1984 but her husband antonio 
has carried on the case 
plaintiffs attorneys are back to square one after having 
spent nearly six years and nearly 3 million in lawyer and legal 
fees said josiah murray liggetts general counsel 
he said he was extremely gratified with the reversal but 
declined to comment further on the decision 
charles wall an attorney representing philip morris and 
lorillard also was pleased with the court ruling 
cipollone was out of town and unavailable to comment according 
to his current wife dorothy his lawyers said they had been unable 
to reach him 
marc edell cipollones attorney said the decision is a big 
win for us because he can now seek damages from all three 
companies 
im looking forward to retrying the case he said 
the ruling said cipollone has live claims against the three 
companies on grounds they marketed the product knowing the risks of 
cigarette smoking the district court had barred cipollone from 
making such a claim 
one law professor with ties to antismoking forces said the 
courts ruling on that issue strengthens a plaintiffs ability to 
seek judgment against the tobacco companies 
richard daynard a northeastern university law professor who 
heads a center supporting lawyers suing the tobacco industry said 
the opinion really put tobacco litigation back on the track 
where it was a couple of years ago 
that is far more important than getting the 400000 reversed 
this makes the cases actually very easy to win daynard said 
cipollones lower court victory was on his contention that the 
tobacco companies promised through advertising that their products 
were safe 
the appeals court said district court judge h lee sarokin erred 
on that point by preventing liggett from trying to prove that mrs 
cipollone didnt believe the companies advertisements in the first 
place 
the court said cipollone could pursue other points denied in 
district court such as a general failuretowarn claim 
but the court said cipollone could pursue the failuretowarn 
claim against liggett because his wife smoked its cigarettes before 
1965 when a federal law took effect requiring cigarette makers to 
put health warnings on packages

the land of his ancestors 
michael mcnamee and his wife judy were on a ship celebrating 
their 25th anniversary in august 1988 when they sealed a note in a 
wine bottle and threw the bottle overboard 
it was just a whim that we threw that dumb bottle overboard 
michael mcnamee said friday 
the mcnamees of grand forks said they received a letter in 
october from an irish man billy mccarthy saying he had found the 
bottle off the west coast of ireland they have written to mccarthy 
but havent heard back 
michael mcnamee a department store merchandising manager found 
it ironic that their note would navigate thousands of miles of 
ocean and wind up on irish shore 
i thought the bottle might get to cuba or florida or somewhere 
along the eastern seaboard but ireland no chance he said

the new civilian government sealed 
the ouster of strongman manuel antonio noriega by stripping him of 
his rank as general and firing him as chief of the defense forces 
the papal nuncio monsignor jose sebastian laboa disputed 
statements by an aide and denied friday that he gave noriega an 
ultimatum to leave the vatican mission where the strongman had 
been in refuge before he surrendered to us troops wednesday 
the cabinet issued a decree firing 39 military officers 
including noriegas chiefs of staff at the time of the dec 20 us 
invasion that deposed him and defeated his army 
the government also promoted three former defense forces 
officers president guillermo endara named to head panamas new 
public security force 
two of the officers had been jailed after participating in a 
failed march 16 1988 coup against noriega and were freed by the 
us invasion the third eduardo herrera was ambassador to israel 
when he took part in the coup and has been in exile in the united 
states 
us officials have said all 16000 members of the defense 
forces are accounted for but the commander of us invasion forces 
said friday that about 200 diehard noriega loyalists remain at 
large and are capable of disrupting activities 
our first priority is to capture their leadership lt gen 
carl stiner told reporters at howard air force base he indicated 
they include members of the paramilitary dignity battalions noriega 
created and other holdouts 
stiner accompanied gen colin powell chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff who left for washington after a oneday visit 
he said troops had captured six of the 18 commanders of the 
dignity battalions which took to the streets in defense of noriega 
when the invasion began 
the last four we captured were turned in by the people he 
said otherwise it is like a rabbit hunt we go and flush them 
out 
laboa who sheltered noriega for 10 days before he surrendered 
to us troops and was taken to florida to face drug charges 
denied he gave the strongman an ultimatum to force him to leave the 
mission 
he left of his own accord the nuncio never told him to 
leave laboa said in a telephone interview there was no 
threat there is not a single basis for thinking that 
letters noriega wrote to pope john paul ii the nuncio and 
others before he left show that he left of his own free will 
laboa said 
during the days after noriega took refuge in the mission dec 
24 the vatican said it would not force him out but was urging him 
to leave on his own 
thursday night the rev javier villanueva who was assisting 
laboa during noriegas stay said if he would not have given 
himself up the panamanian government not the us government 
would have been invited to send in forces to take him out we would 
have lifted the diplomatic immunity 
asked about the statement laboa said i dont know how such 
craziness could have come out 
villanueva could not be reached for comment friday night 
the chamber of commerce a staunch opponent of noriega reopened 
its doors after being closed for a year and nearly destroyed in the 
invasion fighting 
chamber of commerce head alfredo maduro called for us aid 
for the real recovery of the country to take place we will need 
the help of our friends he said 
damage from looting following the invasion is estimated at more 
than 2 billion there is no estimate of damage from bombing and 
combat in the invasion and us economic sanctions against the 
noriega regime 
the white house said the 1991 us budget had no aid money to 
repair invasionrelated damage to panama 
undoubtedly there will be some international funds some bank 
loans and that sort of thing that would be involved and at this 
point we just cant say how any aid might be financed said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
powell said the number of us troops in panama will be reduced 
to close to the preinvasion level of 12000 over the next few 
weeks about 14000 troops participated in the assault 
a us survey said panamanians overwhelmingly approve of the 
us invasion even though nearly one in four had a relative or 
good friend killed or wounded in the fighting 
cbs news and belden amp russonello a research firm based in 
washington interviewed 794 panamanian adults most in person 
tuesday through thursday remote areas were excluded but results 
can be projected to about 75 percent of the population the poll 
has a 4point error margin 
noriega was arraigned on drug charges thursday in miami and a 
judge entered a plea of innocent on his behalf after he refused to 
recognize the courts jurisdiction on grounds he is a political 
prisoner

moammar gadhafi said capitalism and 
westernstyle democracy could ravage reformist eastern europe and 
he invited jews to leave israel and settle in libya 
there is no place for capitalism which is dictatorship based 
on exploitation of basic human rights that are completely crushed 
in western europe and the united states gadhafi said friday 
referring to the democratic reforms that have swept the east bloc 
he told a news conference that said if eastern europe adopts a 
western european system with its multiparties and capitalism i 
warn you of unemployment and beggars of inflation crises and in 
the end war 
wearing a dark suit under a flowing brown cape gadhafi sat at a 
chair with a low table in front of him and a globe of the world at 
his side there were none of his usual female bodyguards only a 
few men watching the news conference 
at one point he waved a green handerkchief he had been holding 
to call for order from the estimated 100 arab and foreign 
journalists invited to his headquarters at bab aziziya just 
outside the capital tripoli 
eastern europe must adopt the new socialism calling for 
partners not wageearners parties destroy the causes of 
democracy and revolution the future reality will be the 
jamahiriya he said expounding from his third series of 
universal writings known as his green book 
written and published in the mid70s the green book calls for a 
new economic and political system to replace capitalism and 
communism in a jamahiriya or masses that has people representing 
themselves without parties or parliaments 
the other thing is the question of jews despite the fact that 
i am an arab and i know arabs are targets of zionism i admit the 
jews are oppressed in the world gadhafi said 
this is a crime committed by europe and the rest of the world 
with the exception of the arabs at least of libya which would 
welcome them back 
speaking calmly gadhafi accused europe and the united states of 
plotting to rid the world of jews by placing them in palestine 
the tomb of jews the mass oven for jews they jews must leave 
the oven before it gets too hot 
there had been no hint of the content of his news conference 
which some believed would address the revolution in romania and 
allegations of libyans fighting alongside security forces loyal to 
ousted dictator nicolae ceausescu 
however gadhafi made no reference to the allegations 
asked about western economic sanctions against libya gadhafi 
said we are not interested in the european siege the companies 
working here need libyan money they need libyan oil 
we put our conditions not they if they dont like them they 
can go to hell 
he said no progress has been made toward a settlement with 
american oil companies that suspended operations libya 
there is no progress we are ready to talk but there is 
nothing new he said

residents of noriega drive and noriega 
lane say they like the names of their streets just fine and dont 
plan to surrender them 
but they have been targets of some kidding since deposed 
panamanian dictator manuel noriega was brought to the united states 
to stand trial on drug trafficking charges 
the streets in this florida panhandle city were named for a 
family of noriegas that arrived here more than 200 years ago but 
many residents dont realize that 
the other night i called dominos pizza and the girl taking my 
order asked my address said reyn voeltz a 10year resident on 
noriega drive 
when i told her she yelled noriega and asked are you in 
panama i said no thats the name of my street voeltz 
said i then heard a guy in the background yell dont deliver 
dont deliver then the girl said dont worry about paying for 
the pizza if you are who i think you are there is a 1 million 
reward for you 
glenn griffith another noriega drive resident said he gets the 
same kind of kidding 
whenever someone asks my address and i tell them noriega 
drive their first reaction is laughter griffith said and 
then they say oh manuel 
the streets really take their names from a pair of josephs a 
father and son 
the first joseph noriega arrived in 1781 when the spanish won 
the city back from the british in the battle of pensacola said 
sandra johnson curator of the pensacola historical museum 
his son was born in 1788 and was one of the early brickmakers in 
the area between 1810 and 1830 she said 
the noriegas received tracts of land from the spanish crown near 
escambia bay where noriega drive is situated

lawyers for ousted panamanian dictator manuel 
antonio noriega say they arent seeking a plea bargain and will 
move ahead with plans to bombard a federal court with motions to 
dismiss drugtrafficking charges 
meanwhile noriega remains hidden from the public eye 
reportedly in a subterranean room at the federal courthouse where 
he has met several times with defense attorneys 
a man who is innocent is not receptive to any plea bargain 
defense laywer steven kollin said friday after a twohour 
conference with noriega general noriega is not guilty of these 
charges and if we can find a jury of 12 people who will have an 
open mind general noriega will be acquitted 
kollin said he has absolutely ruled out a plea bargain with 
the government justice department officials have been quoted in 
published reports as saying they might be interested in striking a 
deal in exchange for information about latin american drug networks 
federal prosecutors also said they were gearing up for a trial 
we are not seeking any kind of agreement of any sort 
justice department spokesman david runkel said we are preparing 
for trial 
president bush who announced friday that he is sending vice 
president dan quayle on a latin american diplomatic mission in 
hopes of repairing relations with those nations after the panama 
invasion also denied that the administration was seeking a deal 
with noriega 
bush refused to rule out a plea bargain however he said 
noriega has the same right as any federal prisoner to seek a deal 
speculation on a plea bargain is linked to the possibility 
noriegas trial might expose embarrassing details of his longtime 
connections with the cia 
kollin promised to seek noriegas cia files 
were looking for the truth and the only way to get to the 
truth is to get to those documents he said 
frank rubino another of noriegas attorneys said a number of 
motions are planned to challenge the us district courts 
jurisdiction over the 51yearold noriega who could be sentenced 
to 145 years in prison and fined 11 million 
among the planned motions will be claims the case is politically 
motivated and noriega is a head of state subject to diplomatic 
immunity rubino said other charges will be that the us invasion 
of panama dec 20 violated international treaties he said 
rubino said it could take nine months to prepare for trial 
noriega who surrendered to us troops in panama city wednesday 
night is charged with taking 46 million in bribes from 
colombias medellin drug cartel to turn his nation into a way 
station for the cocaine trade 
noriega was among 16 people indicted by a federal grand jury in 
miami in february 1988 noriega and five others named in the 
indictment have been arraigned 
federal officials refuse to divulge noriegas whereabouts but 
us marshals have assured the miamibased defense team that 
noriega can be made available within an hour 
his demeanor is fine rubino said hes cheerful and very 
relaxed 
during arraignment thursday before us district judge william 
hoeveler the judge entered a plea of innocent after noriega 
refused to answer to charges noriega was ordered held without bond 
noriega was spirited into the downtown miami courthouse early 
thursday after arriving at homestead air force base aboard a c130 
plane he surrendered to us troops after 10 days inside the 
vatican embassy in panama city 
the capture of noriega has led to an exodus of panamanian exiles 
returning to their homeland from south florida also fbi agents 
have reportedly been sent to panama to review bank records of 
suspected american drug dealers according to newspaper reports 
cuban activists in miami meanwhile have begun distributing 
3000 postcards addressed to noriega with the message fidel 
abandoned you referring to noriegas alleged close ties with 
cuban leader fidel castro

ammunition sales would be banned for a week 
before new years day and the fourth of july under proposals aimed 
at stopping revelers from firing guns into the air to celebrate 
those holidays 
plans offered friday by mayor tom bradley and councilmen joel 
wachs and richard alatorre also would provide rewards of up to 500 
for tips leading to conviction of people illegally firing guns in 
the city 
we have a reign of terror when it comes to new years eve 
wachs said 
six people were wounded by falling bullets in the city on new 
years eve and two men were wounded by police when confronted while 
allegedly shooting police made 75 arrests and seized 134 weapons 
citywide 
bradley said he was disgusted to discover some gun stores 
stayed open late in order to supply lastminute bullet buyers 
the mayor commended the police department for an aggressive 
education campaign that appeared to reduce the amount of shooting 
over new years but observed that many stores had long lines of 
bullet buyers over the weekend 
police received 706 complaints about new years gunfire a 
decrease from the 1249 incidents a year earlier a falling bullet 
killed a 13yearold boy during new years gunfire three years ago 
no one was killed this year 
wachs said there may be some discussion on the length of the 
bans but predicted differences will be ironed out and a law enacted 
by the 15member council 
at western surplus a southside general store that sells weapons 
and ammunition operator al campbell wondered whether the ordinance 
would be effective 
the ban may cause people to buy ammunition one week earlier 
he said

a defense ministry communique ordering 
the execution of traitors in the event of a us invasion has 
sparked a war of words between supporters and opponents of the 
leftist government 
the sixpage special communique issued following the dec 20 
us invasion of panama announced actions to be taken by the armed 
forces in case of a similar american military attack in nicaragua 
point no 3 says 
at the start of the yankee intervention all permanent 
military units reserves peoples militias and 
counterintelligence in close cooperation with state security 
apply the plans of neutralizing cutting off and executing all 
recalcitrant traitors who openly or covertly have been encouraging 
the yankee intervention 
luis sanchez sancho spokesman for the 14party national 
opposition union running against the government in next months 
election said the communique effectively calls for committing 
murders against the nicaraguan opposition who are invariably 
accused of being traitors by the sandinistas ideological 
criteria 
danilo lacayo another union spokesman accused the sandinistas 
of encouraging aggression against political leaders and 
justifying such an aggression by saying it is done to protect the 
national sovereignty 
in an open letter published by la prensa the countrys only 
opposition newspaper nicaraguan bar association secretary orlando 
castillo sobalvarro said called the dec 27 communique an 
instigation to the crime of genocide 
on friday adrian meza castellanos a leading attorney responded 
with a letter to the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario 
calling bar members traitors the letter also accused the bar 
of asking the us government to intervene in our country 
mariano fiallos president of the supreme electoral council 
supervising the campaign for the feb 25 general elections asked 
the government for an explanation 
defense minister humberto ortegas reply in a letter published 
by the sandinista newspaper barricada on friday said the 
communique stated that it had absolutely nothing to do with the 
electoral process 
it has to do exclusively with the legitimate extraordinary 
and exceptional measures that an eventual armed intervention would 
force the nicaraguan government to impose for the defense of the 
motherland the letter said 
the defense ministers brother president daniel ortega is 
seeking reelection his main opponent is violeta barrios de 
chamorro candidate of the national opposition union and publisher 
of la prensa 
although fiallos himself is a sandinista party member his 
councils impartiality has met with the approval of a united 
nations and other foreign observer missions here to monitor the 
electoral process 
iqbal riza of pakistan head of the un observer mission also 
expressed concern to fiallos about the communique he went to the 
council to raise the issue said his spokesman angelica hunt 
nicaragua and the sandinista government have been on edge since 
the panama invasion with the military on maximum alert and 
tanks rolling through managuas streets amid gun emplacements 
then last week troops surrounded the us embassy in managua 
with tanks and armored cars in retaliation for us troops 
encircling the nicaraguan and cuban embassies in panama city us 
military officials said they took the action to prevent deposed 
dictator manuel antonio noriega and his henchmen from seeking 
asylum 
the military cordon around the embassy in managua was withdrawn 
but last weekend the sandinistas expelled 20 american diplomats in 
retaliation for an american military search of the nicaraguan 
ambassadors residence in the panamanian capital 
president bush called the search a screwup and the state 
department said the sandinistas were trying to shrink the us 
mission to prevent it from monitoring the electoral process 
ortega promised the elections in return for the demobilization 
of the usbacked contras fighting the sandinista government 
on thursday president ortega called for the immediate 
withdrawal of us troops from panama saying their goal of 
capturing noriega had been achieved

a prosecutor investigating the deaths 
of a five members of a family found buried under a muddy barn floor 
says the killings may have been human sacrifices a grand jury 
indicted 13 people in the slayings 
the grand jury returning the indictments late friday in 
painesville charged reputed religious cult leader jeffrey 
lundgren his wife son and 10 members of his group in the deaths 
of the family 
lake county prosecutor steven c latourette said those indicted 
are not crazy they are the coolest most inhuman people this 
county has ever seen theyre going to die in the electric chair 
for these crimes 
the five dead are believed to be dennis avery 49 his wife 
cheryl 42 and their three daughters trina 15 rebecca 13 and 
karen 7 
the averys found wednesday and thursday at lundgrens kirtland 
farm apparently were killed because of lundgrens religious 
concept and a prophecy latourette said 
originally this prophecy was that 10 of them had to die 
said latourette who said members regarded killing as a cleansing 
execution 
seven of those charged were arrested in the kansas city area by 
friday afternoon said george rodriguez of the federal bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms six others were being sought 
we now have four people who have given us a full confession of 
their involvement said dave true an atf spokesman in kansas 
city 
the averys apparently were targeted as victims because they were 
less active in the group than others latourette said 
the averys were falling out of grace he said 
he said the averys apparently never attempted to flee the 
communal farm about 20 miles east of cleveland latourette said 
the averys may have been killed over a relatively short period of 
time april 1618 but not en masse 
while the bodies have yet to be positively identified 
latourette said an informant confirmed the identities of the 
victims and kirtland fire chief richard a martincic said a 
picture of the avery family was found in the barn 
each of the victims was shot at least twice according to an 
autopsy by elizabeth balraj the coroner in neighboring cuyahoga 
county 
no federal charges were filed in the case and rodriguez said 
the defendants will be extradited to ohio 
five of those in custody waived their right to fight 
extradition two other suspects face extradition hearings monday 
rodriguez said the averys were members of a splinter religious 
group led by lundgren a former lay minister of the reorganized 
church of jesus christ of latter day saints 
lundgren 39 his wife alice 38 and son damon 19 were at 
large early today lundgren and damon were charged with five counts 
of aggravated murder and mrs lundgren was charged with five 
counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder 
dave true a spokesman for the atf in kansas city said lundgren 
was thought to be somewhere in missouri 
lundgren left the reorganized church of jesus christ of latter 
day saints in 1988 after his ministry credentials were revoked and 
formed his own religious group said dale luffman president of the 
northeast ohio chapter of the rlds the rlds is separate from the

a woman who set a record for living the longest 
on an artificial heart before receiving a heart transplant has died 
of a heart attack brought on by her battle against infection 
carolyn stadler 57 of st charles died friday at st louis 
university hospital where she had received two transplants 
officials said stadler the mother of four lived 440 days on a 
jarvik7 artificial heart before receiving a heart transplant last 
fall 
hospital officials said mrs stadler was kept alive by the 
jarvik7 after her body rejected a first donor heart given her june 
30 1988 
she had been diagnosed as having idiopathic cardiomyopathy a 
degenerative heart condition she spent the last 1 years at the 
hospital where she showed an inner grace and faith that 
strengthened her family her husband roger said 
dr leslie miller of the hospitals cardiology staff said mrs 
stadlers case provided muchneeded information about reaction to 
transplants women are more likely to reject heart transplants than 
men miller said 
the jarvik7 artificial heart was developed by robert jarvik at 
the university of utah school of medicine in salt lake city it is 
capable of replacing the function of both of the hearts pumping 
chambers the right and the left ventricles and is intended to 
keep a patient alive while awaiting a donor heart 
william devries first implanted the jarvik7 in 1982 in barney 
clark who survived for 112 days 
miller said at a friday news conference that the federal 
government is examining artificial hearts as permanent devices 
approval for some hospitals to begin testing them as permanent 
heart replacements is expected within the next year miller said

veterinarian alyn mcclure there had to be more than one they 
had to be very strong and they were in some kind of killing

nine chinese un employees are protesting 
orders to return home when their contracts expire and say their 
prodemocracy activities are being held against them un staff 
officials said 
but un spokesman francois giuliania said friday the cases were 
examined and that the contracts cannot be renewed unless their 
government asks us to do so 
the un employees union has protested to secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar on their behalf and its officials have said 
they will support the chinese if they seek political asylum 
some of the chinese also protested the requirement that they 
turn over their paychecks to the chinese mission and receive a 
small monthly stipend a common practice among many communist 
countries at the united nations 
the complaint to the secretarygeneral was lodged by the un 
staff committee president lowell l flanders 
of the 12338 un staff employes in new york geneva and 
vienna about 275 are from china flanders said the complaint 
concerns five employees in new york two in geneva and two in 
vienna they include typists translators and chinese language 
reporters 
yuan shibing counselor at the chinese un mission said 
friday their contracts have expired and it is normal practice 
that they should go home because normally our people work in 
rotation 
although some of the chinese employees took part in 
demonstrations against the crackdown on the prodemocracy movement 
last spring yuan said it has nothing to do with that 
chinese troops killed hundreds perhaps thousands of people 
when soldiers marched on beijing june 34 and crushed the 
studentled prodemocracy movement 
since then there have been sympathy demonstrations petitions 
and vigils by chinese government employees overseas including some 
at the united nations

musician more than 74000 to cover recording costs for a record 
album the former beatle wanted to silence 
superior court judge clarence cooper who issued a permanent 
injunction in november preventing produer chips momans company 
from releasing the 1987 album ruled that starr must pay moman 
74354 to cover costs of the recording sessions and 7 percent 
interest 
starr contended he was under the influence of alcohol at the 
time the album was recorded and said he wasnt satisfied with the 
results after listening to the tapes 
he sued moman and his crs records of college park ga to block 
the albums release

a judge ruled that the small town where 
the ku klux klan was born enacted a mostly unconstitutional set of 
ordinances aimed at blocking kkk marches but he upheld one part 
that spoils a planned protest 
us district judge john t nixon on friday said most of 
pulaskis parade ordinances were an unconstitutional abridgement of 
free speech but he said the limit of one parade per day in the 
town of 8000 was reasonable 
on jan 13 when the kkk wanted to march in pulaski to protest 
the martin luther king jr holiday another group beat the klan in 
signing up first to march 
the kkk will instead demonstrate on the date in lawrenceburg 
the towns are 25 miles apart and south of nashville near the 
alabama line 
the holiday honoring the civil rights leader slain in memphis 
in 1968 will be observed jan 15 
he struck practically all parts of the ordinance except the 
one that we were interested in thom robb national director of 
the knights of the ku klux klan told a news conference after the 
hearing 
the judge struck down provisions of the pulaski ordinance that 
barred parade permits to those advocating violence to people based 
on race national origin or religion and to those wearing masks or 
disguises 
pulaski is the birthplace of the original kkk in the late 19th 
century residents say they are tired of the distinction the 
paradelimiting ordinance was passed following an october march by 
members of a white supremacy group the aryan nations 
the kkk has marched in pulaski to protest the king holiday for 
the past three years and robb said up to 400 people might take part 
in this years march 
robb said the klan would parade in pulaski in february possibly 
on other dates in january and throughout the year 
george barrett a nashville lawyer arguing on behalf of the 
american civil liberties union reminded nixon that the ordinance 
restricting parades was similar to laws enacted 25 years ago to try 
to thwart civil rights marches including those led by king 
the best way to honor dr king is to vindicate the first 
amendment barrett said vindication of the first amendment is 
the legacy of dr king 
of the judges ruling from the bench barrett said im very 
pleased i think the basic thrust of the lawsuit was the 
unconstitutionality of the ordinance i dont think it was a 
victory for the klan or a defeat for the good people of giles 
county

more former reeducation camp inmates 
and relatives arrived here today from vietnam en route to new lives 
in the united states whose forces they fought alongside during the 
vietnam war 
it was the second day of the first major resettlement of people 
who were imprisoned because they served the usbacked south 
vietnam government that communist forces toppled in april 1975 
a total of 151 former inmates and their families arrived in 
bangkok this n morning and afternoon charter flights from ho chi 
minh city said komol srinakul of the international organization 
for migration the agency handles medical processing and 
transportation of the refugees on friday 156 arrived 
the vietnamese will join relatives in california and other 
states after a few days at a thai immigration center 
state department spokesman richard boucher said friday the 
administration hopes at least 7000 former detainees and their 
relatives will be resettled by sept 30 
those who arrived in bangkok friday expressed joy at finally 
reaching the free world after many years of internment and 
waiting some described conditions in the vietnamese camps as very 
bad and one claimed he saw guards shoot dead 25 prisoners who 
tried to flee 
they said vietnamese citizens were watching closely the 
prodemocracy movements in eastern europe and hoped the revolution 
would come to their country 
the agreement on resettling former inmates was reached between 
hanoi and washington in july the us negotiator senior state 
department official robert l funseth said at the time it would 
help heal the last big wound remaining from the war 
hundreds of thousands of vietnamese were subjected for years to 
a spartan regimen of manual labor and political study after the 
fall of the south vietnamese government 
one of the thousands headed for the united states is p nguyens 
brotherinlaw who was interned for 12 years 
hes coming next month nguyen of los angeles said friday 
we prayed for him every year this is a dream come true my 
sister who is here is very happy hes coming home to his children 
tomorrow is my nephews birthday and his birthday gift will be 
his father coming home 
nguyen said he and some of his relatives were lucky enough to 
escape from vietnam in 1975 
according to a us source in bangkok washington believes about 
100000 former camp inmates are among the 600000 vietnamese who 
have applied to emigrate to the united states he said hanoi 
estimates former inmates and their families total 550000 people 
vietnam has freed hundreds of the prisoners in recent years and 
in june foreign minister nguyen co thach said only about 120 
people remained interned 
hundreds of thousands of vietnamese have been resettled in the 
united states since the war but political bickering had hindered 
progress on emigration of the former inmates the two countries 
still do not have diplomatic relations mainly because the united 
states has opposed vietnams 1978 invasion of cambodia

the radio broadcast monitored by the british broadcasting 
corp did not say whether smith and doe discussed the number of 
liberians who reportedly have fled into neighboring ivory coast to 
escape the violence 
diplomats have said it is difficult to determine the number of 
liberians fleeing because the border area is heavily forested and 
communications are poor however some reports have put the figure 
as high as 10000 
smith also displayed identity cards he said were taken from the 
dissidents in the fight three of which he claimed showed that some 
of the rebels were ivorian nationals the radio said 
liberia repeatedly has accused ivory coast of harboring does 
opponents a charge the ivorians deny justice minister jenkin 
scott said tuesday the invaders whose numbers he put at 96 had 
been trained in burkina faso and libya burkina faso has denied the 
claim

rebels entered the country from ivory coast intent on overthrowing

dissidents have tried to infiltrate from ivory coast 
the dissidents led by charles taylor a former civil servant in 
does government call themselves the national patriotic front and 
appear to have no connection with liberias opposition parties 
according to diplomats 
officials of the united peoples party the largest opposition 
group in liberia have condemned the invaders for using 
unconstitutional methods against the government 
doe is a prowestern former military officer who runs liberia on

government that ousted and executed nicolae ceausescu and the 
agenda was expected to include stronger economic ties 
the common border that divides romanians from their ethnic 
brethren in soviet moldavia also was expected to be a topic 
shevardnadze was welcomed at otopeni airport by foreign minister 
sergiu celac and other romanian officials the staterun rompres 
news agency reported 
shevardnadze met soon after with ion iliescu president of the 
ruling national salvation front council rompres said the talks 
were held behind closed doors and no details were disclosed 
security was tightened in bucharest to protect the prominent 
soviet visitor soldiers lined the streets from the soviet embassy 
to the airport a 20minute ride and tanks and armored personnel 
carriers were positioned at the airport as shevardnadze arrived 
unlike other east european movements toward democracy romanias 
revolution last month strengthened rather than weakened ties with 
moscow strained for decades by ceausescus maverick foreign and 
trade policies and further hurt by his resistance to the reforms of 
mikhail s gorbachev 
shevardnadzes trip will be a brief oneday affair but silviu 
brucan a foreign policy expert in the leadership of the national 
salvation front running romania has said bucharests new 
government has high hopes for the trip 
moscow already has pledged aid including natural gas and oil 
supplies to ensure that romanias 23 million citizens get adequate 
heat and light both strictly rationed during the past eight 
winters by ceausescu 
in an interview with bucharest radio broadcast friday 
shevardnadze said the romanian revolution has enormous 
significance for the interests of europe and has an echo which can 
justifiably be considered as universal important for the entire 
world 
one touchy issue likely to be on the agenda is relations with 
soviet moldavia which consists largely of territory annexed from 
romania by josef stalin in 1940 under a secret protocol to the 
hitlerstalin pact 
many moldavians pushing for more autonomy from moscow hope 
romanias revolution will open one of eastern europes most tightly 
closed borders and boost cultural and other exchanges severely 
restricted in the past 
on economic matters lt gen victor stanculescu who is in 
charge of the economy for the front said in an interview published 
friday that some trading partners agreed to accept exports of 
industrial products instead of food he did not name the countries 
but food has been one of romanias exports to the soviet union 
ceausescu the hardline communist dictator ousted dec 22 and 
executed with his wife elena on christmas day exported vast 
quantities of food especially meat to the soviet union to ensure 
energy supplies from moscow 
but he used most of them for his pet industrial projects 
imposing strict rationing that forced romanians to wear thick coats 
in their homes and offices in winter and had opera orchestras 
playing in gloves and fur hats 
the new government has overturned the energy restrictions and 
many of ceausescus most unpopular decrees abolishing the death 
penalty promising free travel and releasing political prisoners 
and others under a general amnesty for those jailed for less than 
five years 
the national salvation front also has promised to unveil a new 
election law by the end of january and hold free elections by april 
but there is mounting concern that the front which reversed an 
earlier decision not to contest the elections will have an unfair 
advantage at the polls because of its control of the media and high 
profile as the interim government 
western politicians visiting bucharest friday called for 
international monitoring to ensure that any elections staged would 
be fair 
us rep frank wolf rva said other fledgling parties hoping 
to contest the elections lacked the tools of democracy and 
called for a national referendum in april on when to hold general 
elections 
otto lambsdorff the former west german economics minister who 
came to bucharest thursday to discuss economic aid also said the 
front could be privileged in elections 
it would perhaps be necessary to assure international 
supervision for the results of the elections to be completely 
fair lambsdorff told a news conference 
the halfdozen political parties in the two weeks since 
ceausescu was ousted have argued that they lack even such basic 
resources as typewriters which under ceausescu had to be 
registered so the government could trace dissident documents 
they want the elections postponed until the second half of 1990 
when romania will be one of five warsaw pact countries holding the 
first free elections since stalin decreed in the late 1940s that 
communist parties should take over in all the east european 
countries liberated by the soviets at the end of world war ii

east germanys communist party today proposed 
that both german states cut their armies in half this year and 
undertake other drastic measures to demilitarize central europe 
party leader gregor gysi also proposed that all foreign troops 
be phased out of the two germanys by 1999 according to the 
official adn news agency which reported on a special meeting of 
the communist party leadership 
communists retain control of the interim east german government 
pending free elections in may and the call for sweeping 
disarmament measures is probably aimed at strengthening the partys 
image as the political force most capable of reshaping the nation 
cutting defense expenditures would free up state funds for 
restructuring industry pulling east germany out of its economic 
morass 
gysi urged cutting the west german and east german armies by 50 
percent by next year and said both nations should agree not to 
modernize or expand their weapons arsenals 
west germanys army stands at 480000 and there are 250000 
american soldiers on its soil east germany has an army of 170000 
backed by 400000 soviet troops 
west germanys readiness to go along with such measures probably 
would be restricted by its commitments to the north atlantic treaty 
organization which depends on west germany as its defensive front 
line against the warsaw pact 
but as east germany and west germany have closed the gap in 
their relations in recent months the role of the two military 
alliances has come into question and experts have predicted they 
could eventually be dissolved as europes postwar divides are 
healed 
the military policy expert in west german chancellor helmut 
kohls political party has proposed establishment of a european 
security union to protect the peace in a united europe 
in an article to appear sunday in the hamburgbased bild am 
sonntag otto hauser proposes a military force independent of 
washington and moscow which he told the newspaper would serve as 
guarantor powers for a new peace order on the continent 
on friday east german media indicated that former leader erich 
honecker ousted from power expelled from the communist party and 
bedridden with illness may be spared imprisonment 
an independent medical team determined friday that honecker is 
in too poor condition to sustain the rigors of prison life and may 
need additional surgery to remove a malignant kidney tumor 
the official adn news agency said honecker was checked by 
doctors sent by a special parliamentary committee investigating 
alleged widespread corruption during honeckers rule 
seven former communist party politburo members have been jailed 
pending investigation of charges they abused their power and bilked 
the nation of billions in hard currency 
the 77yearold honecker ousted on oct 18 is reported to be 
seriously ailing and confined to bed at the wandlitz estate where 
he and other party elite indulged daily in luxuries while the rest 
of the nation endured spartan living conditions 
he underwent surgery in august to remove gallstones and never 
fully recovered east german media have said 
honecker was placed under house arrest more than a month ago 
after corruption charges were filed against him adn said thursday 
the house arrest was lifted several weeks earlier 
honecker must be moved from wandlitz by the end of the month 
because the estate is being converted to a facility for the 
handicapped 
meanwhile west germanys construction minister announced friday 
that bonn will provide aid of 4 billion to renovate crumbling 
cities and rebuild housing in east germany to ease the acute 
shortage of living space in both nations 
gerda hasselfeldt and her east german counterpart minister for 
construction and housing gerhard baumgaertel told a news 
conference that four seriously deteriorated east german cities will 
be rebuilt as a pilot project for cooperation 
the first beneficiaries will be meissen the elbe river city 
near dresden famed for its handmade porcelain the former 
political and cultural center of weimar brandenburg and stralsund 
those cities and many other urban areas of east germany 
require major restoration following damage to buildings during 
world war ii general neglect under a communist system that gave 
priority to industry over living conditions and the devastating 
effects of the browncoal haze choking major cities 
it is my hope that by pursuing all means of improving housing 
and construction in this country that our housing market can be 
eased as well ms hasselfeldt said 
east germany suffers a serious housing shortage because many 
residential buildings are unfit for habitation 
west germanys housing problem is due more to a lack of space 
and the prohibitively high costs of construction against uncertain 
returns in a nation where rent control often limits a landlords 
profitmaking ability

christian army units and syrianbacked 
moslem militiamen exchanged artillery and tank fire across beiruts 
dividing green line today the first serious fighting in the civil 
war in three months 
police said two civilians were killed when an artillery shell 
crashed into the sinn elfil residential area on the christian 
side of the threemile sectarian line two other people were 
wounded in the exchanges that engulfed the neraby sodeco and ras 
elnabaa districts 
the morning clash followed the arrival of president elias hrawi 
in syrianpoliced west beirut he moved into an apartment building 
where he will live and have an office he did so to avoid having to 
commute to work in an area where his predecessor was killed by a 
car bomb in november 
thunderous shell blasts and staccato bursts of gunfire echoed 
across the moslem and christian sectors of the divided capital 
both sides accused each other of shooting first 
the fighting eased at noon then resumed in the afternoon 
forcing police and army units to close the green lines midcity 
museum crossing the only gateway linking the two halves of the 
divided capital 
a police spokesman said the fighting was the gravest 
violation of a ceasefire called by the arab league on sept 22 
to halt six months of savage artillery duels between the syrian 
army and troops loyal to the christian leader gen michel aoun at 
least 929 people were killed and 2744 wounded during that 
sixmonth confrontation 
fighting also raged into a third week in south lebanon between 
militiamen of the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and 
the prosyrian mainstream amal but police said no new casualties 
were reported in the intershiite battles today at least 77 people 
have been killed and 275 wounded since fighting flared between the 
two factions on dec 23 
amal and hezbollah have been vying for two years for mastery of 
the 12 million shiites who make up the countrys largest sect 
after moving into the apartment building in ramlet albaida 
hrawi received the credentials of papal nuncio pablo puente that 
reflected the vaticans recognition of his government as the 
legitmate adminstration 
the move totally isolates aoun who has rejected both hrawis 
election and the peace plan parliament approved in october all 
other foreign countries with diplomatic missions in lebanon have 
already recognized the national reconciliation government 
formed in november to oversee implementation of a christianmoslem 
peace plan to end 14 years of civil war 
aoun a maronite catholic called on supporters to stage a 
human chain of demonstrations today along the 25mile route 
from the presidential palace in baabda to puentes residence in 
harissa to protest the vaticans decision 
aoun commands 20000 mainly christian troops who control the 
christian enclave in east beirut and the hinterland to the north 
and northeast 
hrawi also a maronite fired aoun as army commander and 
caretaker prime minister in november but the general remained 
entrenched in the presidential palace refusing to turn over the 
traditional seat of heads of state to hrawi 
aoun had issued a decree on nov 4 dissolving the 99seat 
parliament which approved the lebanon peace accord despite his 
opposition he called for elections on jan 7 an issue which would 
cement the paritition of the country 
but the threeman cabinet he heads decided friday to postpone 
the elections for a month and send an envoy in the meantime to new 
york to request that the united nations send observers to supervise 
elections on feb 7 
with 40000 syrian troops controlling 70 percent of the country 
and israel occupying a 328squaremile enclave in the south the 
chances of holding general elections remain remote 
the united nations which has voiced support for hrawi also is 
unlikely to endorse a request for observers from aoun

million in foreign debt getting other nations involved in the 
recovery effort and facilitating loans for businesses 
recommendations have yet to be drawn up and presented to bush 
but one administration source said theres a sense of urgency

cheney was asked specifically about what the united states would do 
if elections scheduled for february in nicaragua are stolen by

at fridays news conference the president did not rule out a 
plea bargain with noriega in exchange for intelligence information 
the deposed dictator might offer on drug trafficking 
our government is not seeking a deal with noriega bush told 
reporters following his meeting with attorney general dick 
thornburgh to discuss the drugtrafficking indictment against 
noriega 
however when asked if he was ruling out the possibility of a 
plea bargain he replied only im not ruling it in 
im just saying hes got his rights and we ought not to 
stand up here and try to define narrowly what they are he added 
leaving open the possibility that noriega might seek the plea 
bargain 
in miami noriega attorney steven kollin said noriega wasnt 
interested in a plea bargain because he considers himself innocent 
bush said he would bend over backwards not to make any 
comments that would prejudice the case against noriega 
with noriega finally in us custody the president is turning 
his attention to shoring up relations in the latin world quayles 
itinerary is not yet determined nor is the timetable for his trip 
but he will visit countries in both central and south america said 
his press secretary david beckwith 
acknowledging the negative reaction by the latins to his dec 20 
invasion of panama bush said i am concerned because i am well 
aware of how our friends south of our border look at the use of 
american force anywhere 
he said that damage is correctable 
an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said bush is considering a trip to panama but the president said 
he had no plans for such a trip panama could be a stop on 
quayles trip 
bush did not say how much he might spend to help panama recover 
but some estimates of invasionrelated damage have been up to 2 
billion 
one administration official said is it likely the march date for 
certification on whether panamas government is cooperating with 
us antidrug efforts will be moved up if the administration as 
expected reverses panamas current situation of noncompliance 
stemming from the noriega regime its new government could partake 
in various trade and economic benefits 
bush said some 12000 troops stationed at us bases in panama 
before the invasion would be left there but would not serve a 
police role 
some 2900 of the 14000 additional combat troops that conducted 
the invasion were brought home this week the pentagon said 
bush also said 
he envisions no change in us policy against intentionally 
sending military women into combat although he would weigh such a 
recommendation if presented to him by the pentagon 
he deplores the death of an american nun in nicaragua but 
noted the usbacked contra rebels denied responsibility he 
called the matter of blame extraordinarily murky

police trap 
indian newspapers frequently report monkeys terrorizing school 
children snatching their lunch boxes and even raiding homes in 
search for food 
monkeys are a common sight in india many hindus do not hurt 
them because they evoke images of the monkeygod hanuman and his 
band of monkey warriors who defeated a demon king in hindu 
mythology

more than 8000 wild animals 
including endangered species have been dying each year in a 
125milelong irrigation canal in northern namibia a newspaper 
reported saturday 
the star of johannesburg said the canal had won two awards from 
an engineering institute but was considered an ecological 
deathtrap by conservationists 
the canal designed in 1980 and built over the next several 
years is part of a network of reservoirs and pipelines that 
enables water to be carried from the kavango river in northern 
namibia to arid regions 
the canal rarely carries enough water to drown large animals 
but about half the animals that enter the 12footwide waterway die 
because they are unable to climb back out the smooth curved 
concrete sides the star said 
the estimated annual death toll includes 4700 warthogs 1500 
hares 300 baboons and scores of antelopes cheetahs wildcats 
foxes and jackals the star said 
namibias department of water affairs has expressed concern 
about the deaths but says it lacks the funds to cover the canal 
the star said the department reportedly plans to erect a 
20inchhigh wire fence along the waterway which it says will 
reduce the death rate by 90 percent

india and sri lanka reached an agreement 
saturday on withdrawing indian troops from the island nation the 
major irritant in relations between the two countries 
a joint press statement issued at the end of sri lankan foreign 
minister ranjan wijeratnes visit to new delhi said the indian 
peacekeeping force would be completely withdrawn by march 31 and 
possibly earlier 
the two countries will also sign a treaty of friendship the 
statement said 
the sri lankans have been pressing india to speed up the 
withdrawal but they appear to have accepted that it would not be 
logistically feasible to withdraw the 25000 indians soldiers 
before the end of march 
what else can we do we cant push them into the ocean 
wijeratne said in an interview after meeting with prime minister 
vp singh 
the sri lankans were very understanding an indian foreign 
ministry official said speaking on condition of anonymity they 
understood the logistical problem they understood that we had no 
desire to stay longer than necessary 
the official said the indian government would examine the 
possibility of completing the withdrawal earlier 
indias military deployment in sri lanka began in july 1987 and 
was intended to supervise the disarming of tamil militants fighting 
for an independent nation in that country 
but the biggest tamil guerrilla group refused to honor an 
agreement to surrender and turned their guns on the indians 
at the peak of the fighting the indian force numbered about 
100000 men at least 1100 indian soldiers were killed 
the sri lankan government began pressing for a pullout of the 
troops last summer after peace talks with the tamil guerrillas but 
india refused to hastily withdraw its soldiers saying it could 
lead to more violence 
sri lankas president issued a july 29 deadline for the indian 
withdrawal and relations between the countries deteriorated 
quickly after india said it would not adhere to the deadline 
the two countries then decided to complete the withdrawal by 
dec 31 but singh who took office dec 2 said logistical 
problems precluded meeting that date 
about 25000 indian soldiers are in sri lanka now 
the tamil separatist revolt began in 1983 and has left at least 
11000 people dead 
tamils account for about 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people they allege the sinhalese majority discriminates against 
them in jobs education and use of the sinhalese language 
sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population 
india sri lankas northern neighbor became involved in the 
peace efforts because it is the regional power and because of its 
own large tamil population

the cartoonist who created hustler 
magazines chester the molester has been convicted of molesting 
a teenage girl 
dwaine tinsley 44 was found guilty of five child molestation 
counts by a superior court jury on friday jurors agreed tinsley 
had substantial sexual contact with the girl but also acquitted him 
of six charges and deadlocked on another five 
the cartoon created by tinsley depicts a lecherous character and 
his attraction to young girls he refused to talk with reporters 
after the verdict 
defense lawyer george c eskin promised to appeal the guilty 
verdicts arguing as he did during trial that the young woman 
accused tinsley in retaliation for his efforts to halt her drug use 
tinsley faces a maximum prison term of 16 years and a 50000 
fine when he is sentenced march 1 said deputy district attorney 
matthew j hardy 
the molestations started in 1984 when the girl was 13 and 
continued until age 17 he said 
evidence presented at the trial said tinsley told coworkers 
you cant write this stuff all the time if you dont experience 
it 
but tinsleys chester the molester eliminated its focus on 
pedophilia several years ago hardy said 
the prosecutor said the verdicts vindicated the victim whose 
longtime efforts to report the attacks were discredited by adults 
tinsley who now lives in los angeles testified during the 
sevenday trial that the woman made up the story because he 
disapproved of her cocaine habit

with gen manuel antonio noriega 
safely in us custody president guillermo endaras new government 
can start to tackle political and economic problems that will make 
recovery difficult 
we have to start from point zero said endara last week as 
he tried to grab the reins of government this is the first time 
in panamanian history that a new government had to start the way we 
did 
expectations in the small country of 2 million run high since 
the dec 20 invasion toppled noriega he surrendered to us troops 
to face drug trafficking charges in florida 
from the businessmen making deals in the citys commercial hub 
to the people selling cool coconut water under the hot sun 
panamanians think dollars will flow now that the americans are 
coming back as they like to say 
we are living a difficult moment for the worker for the 
businessman said alfredo maduro president of the chamber of 
commerce in panama city for the real recovery of the country to 
take place we will need the help of our friends 
after two years of us sanctions targeted at undermining 
noriega and with the devastation that followed the invasion 
panamanians want the united states to come through with financial 
aid now that noriega is gone they may get at least part of their 
wish 
the revitalization of the panamanian economy is a major 
priority in the months ahead president bush told a white house 
news conference friday as are our efforts for humanitarian 
assistance 
in washington administration sources said us officials are 
looking into building houses for people left homeless helping 
panama pay its 543 million foreign debt and providing loans to 
help businesses recover 
one administration official said theres a sense of urgency 
and we want to move quickly and respond quickly 
but that will not be the end of endaras problems for starters 
he will have to deal with the old conservative oligarchy stifled 
under noriega who feel their time has come again he also has to 
try to check some of his own followers desire for revenge and 
spoils 
at the moment the government has support because everyone wants 
the economy the country to get moving 
to list a few of his other problems 
endara does not have a political party of his own he led a 
coalition ticket in may 7 elections because he had fewer enemies 
than his running mates 
the christian democrat party of vice president ricardo arias 
calderon is best organized to get key government jobs in bitter 
political infighting arias is also justice minister the most 
powerful cabinet post 
the countrys economy is a shambles the construction industry 
was down to less than 20 percent of its normal level unemployment 
is at more than 20 percent and government income is less than 50 
percent of what it was a year ago 
the invasion itself caused damages estimated at at least 2 
billion including the savage threeday looting of panama city in 
the chaos following the invasion government economists estimate an 
additional 2 billion will be needed to pump up the economy in the 
next four years 
the united states whose hand is guiding the actions of the new 
and inexperienced government wants to mold it in its image as 
a local politico put it and is pressing for the formation of a 
professional military most politicians want to do away with the 
military that has ruled this country directly or indirectly since 
the beginning of the century and form a police force along the 
costa rican model 
there is fear of politically motivated witchhunts by rightist 
groups who feel secure with the us army here 
you are going to have three governments here said an endara 
associate speaking on condition of anonymity the weak endara 
government the stronger government of the christian democrats and 
the overall government of the united states 
already there are reports of dismissals based on political 
allegiances one of the toughest jobs is the reorganization of a 
corrupt judiciary and the the entire legal structure controlled by 
the military 
the question of what to do with the military is a controversial 
subject and a source of friction between members of the old defense 
forces and politicians 
both endara and arias apparently under us pressure have 
backed down from statements about eliminating the military among 
those who wanted the military abolished were economic groups 
opposed to noriega 
a us military source said a professional military would 
provide some of the security the us government requires for the 
panama canal while at the same time check the ambitions of 
competing economic groups 
with noriega gone the us military feel they can work with 
most of the members of his old forces 
the united states maintains 12000 troops in 10 installations 
here the us military has trained the panamanian forces for years 
and knows them well it was noriega and his associates that were 
considered a problem 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
friday the number of us troops here would be reduced to close to 
the preinvasion level of 12000 over the next few weeks 
but panamanian officials privately say the us presence could 
be needed much longer until it is certain panamas government can 
survive on its own

relatives of slain drug enforcement 
administration agent enrique kiki camarena say they plan to 
watch a tv miniseries on his torturemurder at the hands of mexican 
drug traffickers but they know it will mean reliving the pain 
camarenas 65yearold mother dora said from her home in 
calexico calif that she has seen parts of the miniseries 
scheduled to air sunday monday and tuesday on nbctv and it was 
very difficult to watch 
she plans to see the full program but wants to get a videotape 
copy in case she becomes too emotional to watch the tv 
i want a copy of the movie because im not sure i can take 
it she said in a telephone interview last week her words were 
translated from spanish to english by her daughter myrna who 
works for the dea in san diego 
dora camarena who lost one son in the vietnam war and another 
in the drug war said she is grateful to the dea to the media and 
to hollywood for keeping her sons story alive 
her daughter said she would watch the full show even though 
shes seen most of it in advance and i cried a lot that night 
because it brought back memories 
camarenas wife mika has not made any public statements about 
the show 
myrna camarena 35 said she joined the dea in march 1974 and 
her brother followed in june of that year although he was the 
one who talked me into joining dea when he was working as a 
narcotics officer for the calexico police 
he was kidnapped feb 7 1985 in guadalajara a few days later 
a mexican pilot who had worked with dea agents there alfredo 
zavala avelar also was kidnapped their bulletriddled bodies 
showing signs of torture were found march 5 1985 wrapped in 
plastic bags and dumped on a ranch 60 miles southeast of 
guadalajara 
the miniseries drug wars the camarena story recounts 
camarenas efforts to combat drug trafficking in mexico his 
kidnapping torture and murder and dea efforts to pressure 
recalcitrant and sometimes corrupt mexican officials into finding 
the agent and prosecuting those who killed him 
camarenas mother and sister said they were angered that a 
mexican official referred to the miniseries as an amusement 
during an interview with the associated press following a screening 
of the movie in washington 
the mexican embassy minister for narcotics affairs gustavo 
gonzalez baez appointed by the new administration of carlos 
salinas de gortari that has cracked down on drug traffickers and 
corrupt officials said americans are accustomed to seeing this 
kind of series and they realize this is not reality this is just 
amusement 
noting that the yearold salinas administration has convicted 
major drug traffickers and some public officials in connection with 
the murders and has sentenced them to long prison terms gonzalez 
baez said the movie suggests that all the mexican authorities 
were involved in protecting drug traffickers and that is 
absolutely inaccurate 
it hurts for them to say its an amusement because when i saw 
the movie my heart felt the same thing that i felt when it 
actually happened dora camarena said it shouldnt be taken as 
an amusement 
she said she was very pleased that the new president salinas 
is cooperating to end corruption but her daughter said this 
is based on a true story that is reality we all know there is 
corruption in mexico 
dea and state department officials have praised the salinas 
administrations efforts but the miniseries doesnt include that 
recent history 
dea administrator john c lawn said in an interview that he 
considered the miniseries about 80 percent accurate while 
david westrate deas director of operations said theres a lot 
of pretend in there except for lawn and camarena virtually all 
the dea personnel depicted in the miniseries are composites based 
on several reallife people 
for camarenas mother the show brings her sons work back to 
life 
he gave his full strength and everything he could to combat 
the drug trafficking in a foreign country he left an example 
i have a lot of faith and that keeps me going

christian and moslem fighters battled in 
fiery duels across beirut on saturday killing two civilians and 
forcing police to close the only gateway linking the divided city 
it was the first serious flareup in three months 
the clashes coincided with the arrival of president elias hrawi 
in west beirut where he set up his office and residence and 
received credentials of the vatican representative pablo puente 
that marked the vaticans recognition of hrawis government and 
further isolated the christian army leader gen michel aoun in 
his rejection of the government 
aouns supporters at his request staged a human chain of 
demonstrations along the 25mile route from aouns residence to 
puentes home to protest the vaticans move 
other protesters went to puentes home to deliver a message of 
protest from aoun 
thunderous shell blasts and bursts of gunfire echoed across the 
moslem and christian sectors as soldiers of aouns army battled 
with syrianbacked moslem militiamen both sides accused the other 
of shooting first 
a police spokesman said the clash was the gravest violation 
of a ceasefire called by the arab league on sept 22 to halt six 
months of fighting between aouns troops and syrian forces until 
saturday there had been only minor clashes 
an artillery shell crashed into the sinn elfil residential 
area on the christian side of beirut and killed two civilian men 
police said two other people were wounded in exchanges that 
engulfed the nearby sodeco and ras elnabaa districts 
the fighting broke out in the morning eased at noon and picked 
up again in the afternoon forcing police and army units to close 
the midcity museum crossing the only gateway linking moslem west 
beirut and christian east beirut 
the latest deaths brought to 931 the number of people killed in 
christianmoslem duels since aoun in march declared his intention 
to drive syrias 40000 troops out of lebanon 
aoun rejects hrawis presidency became it came about as a result 
of an arab league plan aimed at ending the 14yearold civil war 
but not setting a deadline for the withdrawal of the syrians 
all foreign countries with diplomatic missions in lebanon have 
recognized hrawis national reconciliation government which 
was formed in november to oversee implementation of the plan 
puente said during the vatican credentials ceremony that the 
holy see favored dialogue to resolve the crisis between hrawi and 
aoun 
but a stung aoun later emerged from his residence outside beirut 
and told cheering demonstrators there is no room for dialogue 
he drew wild applause when he vowed to bring to justice hrawi 
and all parliament members who approved the peace accord 
aoun commands 20000 mainly christian troops who control a 
310squaremile enclave comprising east beirut and the region to 
the north and northeast he claims the syrian troops deployed in 
1976 to quell civil war fighting violated their mandate by siding 
with the moslems and he declared a war of liberation in march 
to drive them out 
hrawi who like aoun is a maronite catholic fired aoun as army 
commander and interim prime minister in november 
hrawi and his wife mona arrived in a 10car convoy escorted by 
lebanese army and police units in west beiruts seaside ramlet 
albaida district 
he set up both his residence and office in the same building to 
avoid commuting in the city his predecessor rene mouawad was 
killed by a bomb nov 22 as he drove from his office to his home 
which was in the same building hrawi is using 
meanwhile fighting raged in south lebanon between militiamen of 
the proiranian hezbollah and the syrianbacked amal no new 
casualties were reported 
at least 77 people have been killed and 275 wounded since the 
latest battles flared between the shiite moslem militias on dec 
23 amal and hezbollah have been vying for two years for mastery of 
the 12 million shiites lebanons largest sect

seventeen historically black 
universities across the south are getting ready to mark the 100th 
anniversary of their admission into the nations landgrant college 
system 
officials at the 1890 schools are hoping a lot of people 
will hear about the party 
it gives us an opportunity to show the country the value of 
these institutions to society said william hytche president of 
the university of marylandeastern shore and chairman of the 
council of presidentschancellors of the 1890 schools 
in 1862 congress passed the national landgrant act introduced 
by rep justin smith morrill of vermont giving the states millions 
of acres of public land to establish state schools 
twentyeight years later morrill then a senator pushed the 
second national landgrant act also known as the second morrill 
act mandating that opportunities for higher education be extended 
to blacks 
twelve schools already established including florida aampm 
university in tallahassee were chosen for inclusion in the system 
the other five schools were founded over the next 22 years 
since then some 600000 students have graduated from the 
socalled 1890 schools 
centennial celebrations will be organized on each of the 
campuses throughout next year as well as in washington in april 
1990 the aug 30 1890 signing of the second morrill act will be 
commemorated at lincoln university in missouri founded in 1866 as 
the nations first college for black students 
the centennial must be celebrated within the context of the 
struggle said joyce payne director of the office of advancement 
of public black colleges in washington kept alive by the 
inequities of segregation the schools have had to struggle for 
resources 
theyve done more with less than other institutions 
agreed sharon worthy a spokeswoman for the us department of 
agriculture thats a given 
the schools which are either in or near rural often 
povertystriken areas have maintained a special interest in 
agriculture and engineering even as they developed their liberal 
arts programs 
everybody knows about george washington carver and peanuts 
ms worthy said referring to the work done at tuskegee university 
in alabama 
famu is committed to the landgrant notion said frederick 
humphries president of florida aampm the only historically black 
school in the states university system we fill a very special 
role of working with the limited resource farmer 
the 1890 schools try to help small farmers find a way of making 
ends meet humphries said 
in north florida that means experimenting with crops such as 
blueberries grapes and christmas trees 
elsewhere current projects range from jointresearch with the 
national aeronautics and space administration into alternative 
foods for outer space to working with farmers in third world 
countries in africa and the caribbean 
ms payne praises the 1890 schools also for their social 
accomplishments saying that they generally have high levels of 
integration and large numbers of foreign students 
white enrollment at the 17 schools is probably in the 1015 
percent range said eddie jackson spokesman for florida aampm 
we see the rich legacy of the landgrant tradition remaining 
preeminent on the campuses of these 17 campuses ms payne said 
listing teaching research and public service as the missions of 
landgrant schools 
hytche who expresses high hopes for the next 100 years said 
establishment of rural economic incubators was one priority 
such centers would increase efforts already being made at the 
universities to promote small and rural businesses and would help 
them for three or four years as well as train displaced workers

president bush who a few months back was 
fending off charges of timidity is reaping foreign policy and 
political gains from the success of a daring military operation in 
panama 
bush just knocked one out of the park one political analyst 
said the w wimp word will not be heard again said another 
the us intervention in panama and subsequent surrender of 
dictator manuel antonio noriega to us forces is allowing bush to 
bask in praise from leaders of both parties something rare for a 
president a full year into his term 
bushs gamble may have left him in the strongest position yet 
since he took office as he awaits the return of congress on jan 23 
with his popularity soaring in public opinion polls 
and while analysts and political leaders differed on the 
longrange payoff few disputed the shortterm value to bush and 
his party particularly in this congressional election year 
the president goes into this session of congress with enormous 
credibility whether on defense spending or domestic policy said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas 
and no harsher a critic than sen edward m kennedy dmass 
proclaimed the surrender of noriega a triumph for diplomacy and a 
triumph for justice 
at a news conference on friday bush dismissed an assertion by 
lee atwater chairman of the republican national committee that 
the panamanian venture was a political jackpot 
a presidents called on to take certain actions were not 
going in to try to furbish a political image thats ridiculous 
bush said 
but leslie goodman a spokeswoman for the rnc said atwaters 
basic point was that anytime an american president does what he 
says hes going to do the public approves wildly thats what 
happened with panama and thats the political jackpot 
most analysts seemed to agree 
bush just knocked one out of the park said stephen hess a 
political analyst who specializes in the presidency at the 
brookings institution a generally liberal research organization 
and in international terms he reminded the rest of the world 
that they cant take him for granted 
this was a highwire act this was a big risk hess added 
think of all the ways he could have fallen off the wire and yet 
he got from one side to the other 
mitch daniels political director in the reagan white house and 
now a scholar at the conservative hudson institute in indianapolis 
said bushs success in bringing noriega to justice cant be 
overstated 
there are defining events that tend to be remembered after the 
event itself has been forgotten this was clearly a complex 
operation and the president clearly was personally directing 
events and it worked daniels said 
the w word will not be heard again he added 
although bush has not been called a wimp since early on in 
his presidential campaign democratic critics including senate 
leader george mitchell dmaine were accusing him of timidity in 
foreign policy as recently as a few months ago 
bush was attacked for failing to stand up to the chinese 
government in the aftermath of the bloody tiananmen square 
crackdown for reacting too slowly in promising aid for poland and 
other emerging new democracies of eastern europe and for failing 
to seize the moment during an abortive coup attempt against noriega 
last october 
over the long run in retrospect it would have been much 
better to have intervened in that indigenous coup rather than to 
handle it this way said norman ornstein of the conservative 
american enterprise institute 
we would have been abetting rather than initiating and 
carrying out ornstein said and we would have been less 
responsible for panama now panamanians are going to look with 
some justification to us to bail them out 
even so ornstein said bushs popularity has gone up praise 
for him is across the spectrum no one will be able to take away 
from him the victory that comes when you say im going to do 
this and its done and when he is called weak wimpish and 
indecisive again as he will be it will have less sting 
the president often has referred to himself as a cautious man 
against the backdrop of this caution therefore the bold panama 
strike stands out in even greater relief political analysts said 
but bush himself while clearly savoring the praise and happy 
with the success of the operation offers a more cynical assessment 
of how democrats in congress will react once the initial glow has 
faded 
at fridays news conference he was asked is this the last 
time george mitchell can ever accuse you of having a timid foreign 
policy 
bush knowing george hell find a reason hell find a way 
and thats his job look were going into an election year

the greek communist party in a policy 
reversal has denounced the warsaw pact invasion that crushed 
czechoslovakias reform movement in 1968 the partys newspaper 
said saturday 
the policy reversal comes at a time when communism has been 
discredited by popular uprisings throughout eastern europe 
hardline communist regimes have fallen in czechoslovakia poland 
east germany hungary bulgaria and romania 
the greek partys central committee also supported political 
reforms initiated by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev who has 
given the countries in the soviet bloc new freedom to determine 
their own political destinies 
the partys initial decision to support the warsaw pact invasion 
caused some members to leave the organization and to form the greek 
left party 
the policy reversal could heal that rift and lead the two 
parties to merge 
last year they cooperated in greeces general elections under 
the banner of the coalition of the left and progress 
the coalition emerged as the power broker when the vote ended 
inconclusively an allparty government was eventually formed to 
govern until new elections later this year 
the party said it reversed its decision because it decided that 
while many east bloc nations deviated from orthodox socialism 
during the cold war that can be justified by the diverse styles 
of regimes that governed those countries according to the party 
newspaper rizospastis

will work out 
the smoking rules went into effect on new years day in this 
city of nearly 200000 people located in the heart of north 
carolina tobacco country 
despite vocal opposition from the tobacco industry the 
controversial measure passed by a slim 173vote margin out of 
nearly 30000 cast in a november referendum 
meetings have since been held between city officials and 
business owners so there would be no surprises many restaurants 
and retail stores already were complying with the restrictions 
said city spokesman jack gardner 
a lot of them were glad they didnt have to alienate their 
customers we were he said 
while greensboro doesnt rank up there with tobacco towns such 
as winstonsalem or durham it is the home of lorillard inc which 
makes newport kent and true cigarettes and employs 2300 people 
north carolina produces about twothirds of the nations 
fluecured tobacco which is used to make cigarettes 
with 14000 tobacco farmers the states annual crop is valued 
at 900 million north carolinas cigarette manufacturers produce 
about 56 percent of all domestic brands 
if this was indiana or some other state where tobacco isnt 
grown there would be far less criticism said gardner 
the ordinance bans smoking in elevators and grocery and 
department stores and requires restaurants seating 50 or more to 
set aside at least 25 percent for nonsmokers 
customers who ignore the warnings can be fined 25 after a 
oneyear grace period the grace period doesnt apply to 
businesses which can be fined immediately for failing to post the 
nosmoking signs or asking a customer to extinguish a lighted 
cigarette 
we have a whole year to figure out how to enforce it said 
gardner we wont be going into restaurants and shops looking for 
violators 
mary lacklen president of the 75member guilford county 
restaurant association said most restaurant owners prefer a 
voluntary program 
since its not voluntary weve taken it upon ourselves to 
educate our members so the transition can be smooth she said 
mrs lacklen owns berts seafood grill which seats 52 
before this ordinance we had already set aside 70 percent of 
our seats for nonsmokers because of customer demand she said 
at woolworths shoppers were greeted by large no smoking 
signs at the door outside the sidewalk was littered with dozens 
of crushed cigarette butts 
inside part of the lunch counter that was desegregated by 
blacks during the 1961 civil rights sitins was set aside for 
nonsmokers 
robert t taylor who ate a sandwich while sitting at one of the 
four nonsmoking tables at donnies likes the new restrictions 
after a while it will become second nature just like 
integration he said

defense secretary dick cheney said saturday 
the us invasion of panama should not be viewed as heralding a new 
bush doctrine under which the united states would be inclined 
to intervene militarily in other countries where democratic 
elections are subverted 
interviewed on cable news networks evans and novak program 
cheney was asked specifically about what the united states would do 
if elections scheduled for february in nicaragua are stolen by 
the ruling sandinista regime 
cheney responded that the panama action is not the beginning 
of the new bush doctrine where under every circumstance we would 
always use military force to intervene in order to enforce if you 
will the outcome of a free electoral process 
under further questioning about nicaragua the pentagon chief 
said i think as a general proposition we always reserve all of 
our options when we look down the road but at this point i would 
not want to indicate that we plan to use force there 
our hope is that there will in fact be a fair election and 
that the outcome of the election will be honored by the current 
government of nicaragua he said 
cheney said there were different circumstances in panama 
including the us right to be in panama under the canal treaties 
the killing of an american marine and harassment of other 
servicemen by the panama defense forces and president bushs 
obligation to protect the lives of thousands of americans living in 
panama 
he said the united states used military force in panama very 
reluctantly we exhausted all other options to try to deal with 
that situation and finally moved only when it was clear that 
american lives american interests were in fact in jeopardy 
cheney said that judging by the huge quantity of weapons 
found in caches in panama it was reasonable speculation that 
former strongman gen manuel antonio noriega was involved in the 
international arms trade 
when i was there right after the operation i visited several 
of the sites that at that time we thought had maybe 30000 or 
40000 weapons now it looks like 75000 we have one report that 
may take it as high as 100000 he said 
cheney noted that for a military force of some 4500 people it 
doesnt make any sense at all to have weapons of that magnitude

this account is based on reports from leaders of 
romanias revolution the romanian media and information gathered 
by associated press reporters in bucharest and elsewhere 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
nicolae ceausescu ruled romania with an iron hand for 24 years 
scorning the changes swirling around him in eastern europe but in 
four swift december days he was brought down by a revolution 
hunted captured imprisoned in an armored car tried and executed 
by a firing squad 
he liked to cast himself as the hero of a romanian epic and at 
the end he defiantly told the prosecutor at his summary trial i 
am the president of romania and the commander in chief of the armed 
forces 
his power crumbled so quickly he couldnt even flee the country 
and the soldiers he once commanded drew lots for the honor of 
shooting him 
of ceausescus heroic plans for himself and romania only one 
wish came true he was granted a request to die together with his 
wife 
ceausescu had a huge security apparatus with legions of 
specially trained fiercely loyal troops a secret tunnel network 
under his capital of bucharest and seemingly endless resources for 
his own protection but unrest that started dec 15 in the western 
city of timisoara sparked a national revolt against the hardship 
and terror of his reign 
hundreds were reported massacred in timisoara dec 17 by the 
security police ceausescu apparently confident he could ride out 
this protest left for a threeday state visit to iran 
he returned on afternoon of dec 20 greeted as usual at the 
airport by chanting crowds and children with bouquets 
then ceausescu began to blunder he went on television and 
denounced the timisoara protesters as hooligans by dec 21 
disorder began to move to bucharest largely as a result of a 
miscalculation by the 71yearold ceausescu who had shrewdly 
survived other popular protests and even an attempted 1984 coup 
he held two rallies in bucharest and faced shouts of protest at 
both stunning occurrences for his tightly controlled state at 
the second rally on dec 22 the leader was shouted down with 
chants of death death abandoning his palace security forces 
secret tunnels and his own dignity he fled bucharest in 
presidential helicopter no 1 a sleek white craft with a range of 
600 miles 
no one can be certain what ceausescus precise plans were 
apparently he and elena were bent on fleeing the country but it 
is not clear where he might have expected asylum 
silviu brucan a senior member of the national salvation front 
now running romania told the french newspaper le monde that 
ceausescu was headed for a north african country possibly 
libya other reports mentioned china 
from accounts of his flight from bucharest the escape was 
frantic and confused the helicopters pilot vasile malutan told 
the newspaper romania libera he desperately radioed for 
instructions while one of ceausescus bodyguards pointed a gun at 
his head throughout the flight 
ceausescus trusted adviser emil bobu and maria manescu wife 
of another confidant were the only leading figures who accompanied 
the ceausescus on the flight which was so cramped the copilot had 
to sit on the dictators knees 
the craft headed for snagov a village north of bucharest where 
ceausescu had a summer residence bobu and mrs manescu left there 
she kissed the presidents hands 
from snagov the helicopter flew to a military airport at 
boteni northwest of bucharest ceausescu apparently fearful of 
being shot out of the air or falling into rebel army hands at an 
airport ordered malutan to land away from any airfield 
according to one account from brucan published in the financial 
times ceausescu was surrounded by peasants as soon as he landed 
and was handed over to the army 
but in a later account the deputy interior minister col gen 
jean moldoveanu said ceausescus bodyguards hijacked a private car 
for the couple who sped off two traffic police recognized 
ceausescu at a checkpoint 
they caught up with the ceausescus at a factory in cimpulung a 
town at the foot of the carpathian alps some 100 miles northwest 
of bucharest moldoveanu told the newspaper adevarul he said the 
couple was alone 
the two policemen planned to surrender their prisoners to the 
army but as they drove south toward tirgoviste 40 miles 
northwest of bucharest citizens tried to stop the car believing 
the policemen wanted to escape with the ceausescus moldoveanu said 
after a dramatic chase through tirgoviste the two policemen 
managed to outfox the pursuing citizens and drove to a wood where 
they covered the car with tree branches and leaves and stayed until 
dark 
moldoveanu said they took the ceausescus to a military base near 
tirgoviste where they were put under heavy guard 
several hours after their capture the base was attacked from 
land and air by proceausescu security forces but the military 
there knew how to defend themselves and their prisoners 
moldoveanu said 
soldiers put the ceausescus in an armored car that was kept on 
the move for nearly three days to prevent the securitate or secret 
police from discovering their whereabouts maj mihai lupoi later 
told british television 
ceausescu suffered from diabetes but refused to take insulin 
during his detention lupoi said 
lupoi who was appointed tourism minister for his role in the 
revolution said the armored car was the one that delivered 
ceausescu to the secret military tribunal that sentenced the 
dictator to death 
on television romanians saw ceausescu as he struggled in 
ungainly fashion out of the armored vehicle losing his astrakhan 
hat 
they saw a doctor test the fallen leaders blood pressure and 
then saw the dictator and his wife in scarf and thick light brown 
coat defiantly answering their unseen military accusers the 
charge against ceausescu and his wife his secondincommand was 
the genocide of 60000 people during their years in power 
im not guilty im not guilty i will answer only in front of 
the grand national assembly parliament and in front of the 
working class these are lies ceausescu yelled near the end of 
the summary trial i dont recognize this court 
at the end ceausescu interrupted a prosecutor who addressed him 
simply as defendant 
i am not a defendant i am the president of romania and the 
commander in chief of the armed forces and i want to answer before 
the grand national assembly 
the prosecutor replied i have nothing to discuss with you 
when ceausescu again tried to interrupt he was told sternly the 
sentence cannot be appealed 
romanians did not see the christmas day execution the videotape 
closed with a shot of the couples bodies crumpled close together 
beneath a bulletshattered wall 
later accounts said so many soldiers wanted to be in the firing 
squad that a lottery was held among 300 volunteers when the ruling 
couple walked toward their end the soldiers barely waited for the 
order before opening fire 
the accounts said the couples last wish was to die together 
and so they did riddled with 90 bullets at a military base outside 
tirgoviste 
the peoples last glimpse of the fallen ceausescu was a closeup 
of his face eyes open the right side of his head stained with 
blood 
the couples burial place remains unknown most likely the 
leaders that executed the couple buried them secretly near where 
they died thus preventing either desecration of the grave by angry 
romanians or an attempt by security men to recover the bodies

more than 2000 lawenforcement officers sealed 
off the area surrounding the state capitol this morning and 
maintained order as about 50 white supremacists and 100 
counterdemonstrators rallied 
the klanled rally ended without any confrontations after about 
75 minutes however a shouting match broke out as klansmen 
returned to their cars counterdemonstrators a halfblock away 
began jeering and the supremacists responded with shouts and 
nazistyle salutes 
as a klan motorcade left the capitol area counterdemonstrators 
burned a figure made of sheets as a ku klux klan effigy 
officials said 1594 georgia national guardsmen 300 atlanta 
police officers 184 state troopers and 145 agents from the georgia 
bureau of investigation were present during the rally separating 
the klan contingent from about two dozen counterdemonstrators who 
marched two blocks away 
about 30 of the white supremacists were dressed in white klan 
robes while others wore camouflage fatigues or pseudonazi garb 
chants from the counterdemonstrators and the rumble of police 
and television helicopters drowned out the klan 
randall w smith grand dragon of the southern white knights of 
the kkk said that considering the violence tht erupted during 
demonstrations the last two years the klan welcomed the security 
wed rather they keep them out we really appreciate the 
security smith said 
civil rights leaders had urged blacks to stay away from the 
rally which was organized by the southern white knights of the 
kkk it was to be followed by an afternoon rally in forsyth county 
the virtually allwhite county north of atlanta where brotherhood 
marchers were pelted with rocks in 1987 prompting a second march 
by 20000 civil rights supporters 
the ad hoc committee against the klan called this week for 
counterdemonstrators to gather nearby in opposition to the klan 
several civilrights leaders endorsed a less confrontational 
approach an ecumenical prayer vigil for peace at the martin 
luther king jr international chapter on the campus of morehouse 
college several miles from the capitol 
among those supporting the vigil were southern christian 
leadership conference president joseph e lowery and the 
southeastern regional director of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people earl shinhoster 
the best reception for racist hate groups is empty streets 
and churches full of blacks and whites in prayer lowery said 
rep john lewis dga a longtime atlanta civil rights leader 
called on blacks to stay away from the klan 
the klan represents the past not the future lewis said 
they represent the dark not the light ignore this group leave 
them to themselves and allow law enforcement officials to take care 
of the matter 
last january a white supremacist rally and march in downtown 
atlanta turned violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators 
gathered to oppose a handful of white protesters 
racial tensions have been heightened in the southeast recently 
by the mailbomb killings of robert vance an alabama judge on the 
11th us circuit court of appeals based in atlanta and robert 
robinson a savannah attorney 
a letter written after the bombings indicated they were racially 
motivated and said others would follow

iran dismissed an iraqi proposal for 
reviving peace talks between the two countries as a new campaign 
of public deception irans official islamic republic news agency 
said saturday 
the dispatch monitored in cyprus said iraqs threepoint plan 
offered friday only reworded previous iraqi demands talks on a 
permanent end to the eightyear conflict have been stalemated since 
a ceasefire in august 1988 
the announcement came as iraq displayed new weaponry including 
iraqibuilt missiles during its annual army day 
iran did not reject president saddam husseins offer outright 
but described it as a new campaign of public deception to 
undermine un security council resolution 598 the ceasefire 
resolution 
in fact saddam reiterated iraqs previous proposals that were 
extraneous to the resolution only giving them a new wrapping it 
said 
resolution 598 adopted in july 1987 calls for a ceasefire 
withdrawal of troops to prewar borders the repatriation of 
prisoners of war and settlement of the conflict through 
negotiations 
it noted that saddam failed to address simultaneous withdrawals 
of troops and repatriation of pows key iranian demands for 
progress in the talks 
iran claims iraq holds 1065 square miles of its territory but 
united nations experts say the iraqis occupy only 260 square miles 
both sides blame each other for the deadlock in negotiations 
the last session was held in april and un efforts to revive the 
negotiations have foundered 
saddam proposed a direct dialogue between the iranian and iraqi 
leaderships be held alternately in baghdad and tehran under un 
supervision 
he suggested exchanging all ailing and disabled pows and 
prisoners who have been detained since the early days of the 
conflict which broke out in september 1980 
his proposal called for opening offices for the two countries 
national airlines in the capitals and reviving air links which 
were cut shortly before the war began it said this would provide 
an atmopshere of peace that would help push efforts for a 
settlement 
the parade marking iraqs army day underlined saddams policy of 
building up iraqs military capabilities until tehran signs a peace 
treaty to formally end the war 
with both sides devastated by the war most analysts do not 
believe there is much likelihood the conflict will erupt again 
the red cross has registered 50182 prisoners held by iran and 
19284 in iraqi camps but un officials and diplomats say there 
are at least 100000 pows 
the red cross mediated an agreement to repatriate the ailing and 
crippled pows immediately after the ceasefire but the accord 
broke down after the release of only 400 prisoners with both sides 
accusing each other of falsifying the number of captives who were 
seeking asylum 
the red cross estimates 1000 ailing or disabled pows are still 
held by both sides 
iraq has demanded that a new border accord be worked out giving 
it total control of the shattalarab waterway it also has 
insisted on an agreement for clearing the channel of debris 
under a 1975 accord the border between the two countries ran 
down the middle of shattalarab which is iraqs main outlet to 
the sea

east germanys communist party on saturday 
proposed that both germanys cut their armies in half this year 
seek the withdrawal of all us and soviet troops by 1999 and 
discard their chemical weapons 
in west germany chancellor helmut kohls party called for a new 
european security force independent of moscow and washington 
reflecting the growing sentiment among germans for a united and 
neutral europe 
the moves position the dominant parties in both germanys for 
election campaigns focusing on how to balance german unity with 
european fears of a new military threat rising on the continent 
east germanys communist party leader gregor gysi laid out a 
detailed plan for drastic troop and arms reductions at a special 
meeting of the party leadership according to the official adn news 
agency 
gysi said both the west german bundeswehr and the east german 
volksarmee should be cut in half by 1991 thereby lending 
credibility to promises that a united germany would pose no threat 
to european neighbors 
the communists oppose formal reunification of germany but they 
have agreed to seek a treaty community that would give a more 
formal basis to relations with west germany and possibly result in 
a german confederation 
both german states must begin the demilitarization of central 
europe and fix their treaty community with a cooperative security 
policy gysi said 
east germanys defense ministry on thursday announced it was 
cutting the compulsory army service term from 18 months to 12 
months and gysi urged bonn to take similar action 
he also proposed that both nations pull back any defense 
installations within 30 to 50 miles of the intergerman border 
arms production should be considerably reduced and chemical 
weapons should be removed from both states by 1991 gysi contended 
in his disarmament program titled model for security 2000 
it also calls for all arms modernization to be halted and for 
both sides to refrain from selling weapons outside their military 
alliances 
under the proposal all foreign troops would be removed from 
germany by 1999 
west germanys army of 480000 is backed by about 250000 us 
troops while the east german force of 170000 is reinforced by 
400000 soviet soldiers 
leading defense officials of kohls christian democratic union 
unveiled a new west german military strategy in interviews with the 
hamburgbased bild am sonntag 
the newspaper distributed its report to news agencies ahead of 
sunday publication 
military policy expert otto hauser was quoted by the newspaper 
as saying that a united europe requires new concepts in 
defense and that reduction of the west german compulsory service 
term should not be ruled out 
kohl and defense minister gerhard stoltenberg have made plans 
for reorganizing west germanys military structure which they 
expect to begin putting into force after a conventional arms 
agreement is reached between nato and the warsaw pact at 
negotiations in vienna the newspaper said 
asked about the newspaper report defense ministry spokesman 
winfried dunkel in bonn refused to say what changes west germany 
might consider in the wake of a vienna agreement expected this 
summer 
the parliamentary defense policy expert from kohls party bernd 
wilz urged the european parts of nato and the warsaw pact to 
realign themselves into a european security force independent of 
the superpowers 
our answer to moscows security considerations is a new 
european peace order whose freedom peacefulness and stability 
would be guaranteed by a new european security union wilz told 
the newspaper 
as the postwar divisions in europe have been mending in the wake 
of eastern europes turn toward democracy defense experts have 
predicted that the two military blocs eventually will be dissolved 
germans in both states have expressed strong support for ending 
the eastwest division of europe that has separated them into rival 
political blocs for four decades 
the defense proposals were announced by the two german states 
almost simultaneously but there was no indication that either the 
communists in east germany or kohls party had consulted with the 
other state 
east germans vote may 6 in the first free competitive and 
secret elections in the nations 40year history and the issues of 
german unity and european security are high on the campaign agenda 
cutting defense spending would free up state funds that could be 
devoted to upgrading industry and improving the provision of basic 
goods and services to the nation of 16 million which is mired in 
economic crisis 
in west germany kohls party holds a slight lead over the 
opposition social democrats in polls conducted since the berlin 
wall opened nov 9 and relations between the germanys began 
warming west german elections are scheduled for december

residents of the closeknit catholic 
neighborhood where charles stuart grew up say they knew him well 
the way everyone knows each other in a working class churchgoing 
community now theyre not so sure 
its like something out of a bad detective novel said steve 
reardon stuarts cousin who runs a familyowned downtown 
restaurant where stuart and his three brothers worked when they 
were younger 
stuart 29 killed himself thursday by jumping off a boston 
harbor bridge after his youngest brother implicated him in his own 
shooting and the fatal shooting of his pregnant wife carol 
stuart had told police they were shot by an assailant after they 
left a childbirth class at a boston hospital last oct 23 the baby 
was born prematurely and died 17 days later police now say 
stuarts story isnt true 
how could someone like carol with the character and 
reputation that she had have gotten involved with chuck if chuck 
had been the madman it looks like he may have been reardon said 
you just dont know what goes on behind closed doors it all 
looked so good on the outside 
but almost immediately after the shootings the rumors began 
that stuart had drug problems that he was hoping to cash in on 
life insurance policies on his wife that he was not the father of 
the infant 
police are investigating the life insurance angle but so far 
they know only that he collected 82000 on a policy from his 
wifes job as a lawyer investigators also have ordered tests to 
check the babys parentage 
but checks so far show no criminal background no confirmed link 
with drugs and no evidence stuart was anything but the way friends 
and police had come to see him a nice guy 
never ever did i get a tip to suspect charles stuart said 
john dawley the stuart family attorney who represented charles 
until he became a suspect the guy was a remarkable guy and i 
dont say that lightly i say it in light of everthing i know 
there are still only hints of a darker side 
nothing was substantiated i think there were a number of 
people who had a knowledge that something was amiss said acting 
police chief james russo in revere north of boston as far as 
him being squeaky clean i cant say that but i dont want to add 
further to the burden of the family 
stuart was one of four vigorous athletic brothers in an active 
family 
his father charles stuart sr was the one people called when 
they needed a toastmaster at the knights of columbus a catholic 
mens group he and his wife dot raised six children two 
daughters from stuarts first marriage and their four sons 
charles jr michael mark and matthew 
i heard the rumors and i just said that cant be said 
joanne bogus who lives two doors from the stuart familys red 
shingle house it is just around the corner from the construction 
site for a new immaculate conception roman catholic church 
attended by the stuarts and most neighbors 
ive been living here for 14 years my son was a little 
younger than the four stuart boys but chuckie and the others would 
always be out there playing with the kids street hockey 
basketball baseball you name it this is just too hard to 
understand she said 
maureen and john vajdic neighbors of the stuarts in reading 13 
miles northwest of boston said the couple seemed happy and they 
saw nothing untoward when they were in the house after the 
shootings to care for the couples two black retriever dogs but 
mrs vajdic said mrs stuart had once asked if she heard a loud 
argument late one night after stuart came home 
ted kakas one of the owners of the fur store that stuart 
managed on the posh newbury street in bostons back bay said 
theres nobody in this store of 50 employees who isnt blown away 
by this 
one of the few glimpses of a possible other side of chuck stuart 
comes in reviewing his accounts of his college days he told others 
he went to brown university to play football and then to salem 
state college college officials at brown say there is no trace of 
him he only briefly attended salem state 
you see these stories on the television news you analyze them 
and then forget about it but then something like this happens 
where you know the people it just leaves you wondering said

oh say can you sing the national anthem 
most people cant says a congressman from indiana who wants to 
scrap the starspangled banner as the nations official song in 
favor of the less straining america the beautiful 
rep andrew jacobs also says the poem penned by francis scott 
key after american troops repelled british forces at baltimores 
fort mchenry in 1814 is unsuitable because it celebrates war and 
because the tunes origin is an old drinking song and an english 
one to boot 
jacobs introduction of a bill to make the change though 
nothing new has provoked a spirited defense 
who says you cant sing it demanded maryland historical 
society spokeswoman darlene frank 
the society held a contest in september to commemorate the 175th 
anniversary of the writing of the anthem and found more than 300 
patriotic americans who loved the song enough to want to sing it in 
public and a capella no less frank wrote in a letter 
dismissing jacobs proposal 
the democrat has introduced the bill nine times in 12 years 
without gaining any appreciable support 
its not a burning issue in my existence jacobs said 
still he does not plan to forego the campaign america the 
beautiful is gradually eclipsing the starspangled banner as 
the song of choice at official functions he said 
in maryland gov william donald schaefer has asked the states 
congressional delegation to oppose jacobs bill the frederick 
md keys a minor league baseball team named for the composer 
also opposes the change 
karen stuart head librarian at the maryland historical society 
said the latest attempt to replace the anthem has prompted more 
outcry that in the past 
the public may be more sensitive because of the emphasis on the 
pledge of allegiance during the 1988 presidential campaign and the 
supreme courts ruling last summer that the burning of the flag is 
a protected form of free speech 
key wrote the anthem to commemorate the defense of fort mchenry 
where citizen soldiers withstood 25 hours of bombardment from 
british ships during the war of 1812 
key almost certainly took some poetic liberties in his most 
famous verse historians say it is unlikely he saw the flag 
gallantly streaming because it would have been soggy after a 
night of pounding rain and stuart said some scholars question 
whether the rockets red glare was sufficient to illuminate the 
banner through the smoke and mist from as far away as the truce 
ship which key was aboard 
flawed or not the starspangled banner enjoyed immediate 
popularity in the young nation the melody was to anacreon in 
heaven the slightly bawdy theme song of a private mens club in 
london the tune became wellknown on both sides of the atlantic 
but didnt get official recognition until 1931 
its rival the tribute to spacious skies and amber waves of 
grain was written in the late 19th century by a wellesley college 
english literature professor katherine lee bates 
jacobs said he was impressed by the story of how bates was 
inspired to write america the beautiful not by an armed 
conflict but by the beauty she beheld from the peak of a colorado 
mountain 
but neither song is jacobs personal favorite among patriotic 
tunes 
i like this land is your land he said

thousands of bulgarias slavic majority 
defied their government and kept up protests in at least four 
cities saturday to try to overturn new laws granting religious and 
cultural freedom for ethnic turks 
turks to turkey and listen to the voice of the people 
shouted at least 2000 people outside parliament in sofia the 
capital demonstrations continued for a third day in the southern 
town of kardzhali and in the northern cities of shumen and razgrad 
the turkish government and a spokesman for the ethnic turks said 
the nationalistic protests which have resulted in the countrys 
biggest work stoppages in more than four decades were instigated 
by communist hardliners opposed to the ouster of hardline leaders 
and the implementation of democratic reforms 
protesters are demanding that the new communist leaders reverse 
a decision dec 20 to allow ethnic turks and moslems to use their 
own names and languages and to allow the practice of moslem 
religious rites without restrictions 
parliament president stanko todorov said late friday that the 
government would not reverse itself 
turkey on saturday denounced the demonstrations and said it 
supported the bulgarian government turkish foreign minister mesut 
yilmaz said the protests were organized by people still loyal to 
ousted communist leader todor zhivkov 
zhivkov who was ousted nov 10 tried to forcibly assimilate 
the ethnic turks by giving them bulgarian names prohibiting them 
from speaking turkish in public and restricting their religious 
rights 
nationalists among the majority slavs fear the 15 million 
ethnic turkish minority is growing too fast in number and poses a 
threat to the country 
the protests continued despite government appeals for calm 
todorov on saturday went to razgrad to meet with local officials in 
an attempt to defuse the crisis 
on friday protest strikes paralyzed kardzhali where nearly 
half the 50000 inhabitants are ethnic turks in nearby haskovo 
25000 people rallied friday under such slogans as the central 
committee sold out bulgaria 
protesters are demanding a nationwide referendum on the ethnic 
question a major rally was expected sunday outside parliament 
bulgaria drew world criticism last may after zhivkov granted 
passports to ethnic turks and an estimated 320000 emigrated to 
turkey saying they feared persecution if they stayed in bulgaria 
turkey closed its borders about 50000 bulgarian turks later 
returned complaining about lack of jobs and proper housing in 
turkey 
slav nationalists have been suspicious of the loyalties of the 
bulgarian turks and ethnic bulgarian moslems known as pomaks 
since bulgaria won independence in 1877 from the ottoman empire 
after 500 years

communist leaders on saturday voted to 
disband their crumbling party at a congress later this month and to 
form a leftist party with a new name and platform that rejects 40 
years of communist slogans 
the communists who last year surrendered control of the 
government and lost their leading role in society are hoping to 
regain some credibility and hold onto what power and members they 
still have by cutting ties to their past 
the new party will be created with great effort party 
leader mieczyslaw f rakowski said in a speech concluding a party 
central committee plenum it will have a new structure and 
program 
the first day of the threeday congress scheduled for jan 27 
will be devoted to abolishing the communist party and the following 
two days to forming a new party from its remnants politburo member 
leszek miller said 
after hungary poland would become the second east bloc nation 
to disband its communist party which ruled for four decades until 
ceding control to solidarity it would be another in a series of 
historic changes that in the past year have changed everything from 
polands name to its staterun economy 
party members will be polled before the congress on choices for 
a new party name miller told the policymaking central committee 
before it voted to recommend the changes to the party congress 
likely the communists last 
the 230member central committee was presented with a proposal 
for the poll it included six possible names and space for a 
writein nomination for a name to replace the polish united workers 
party as the party is now called 
the names being considered are the socialist party of poland 
socialist party of working people social democratic party of 
poland polish party of working people polish party of the 
socialist left and polish labor party 
a new party is needed referring to the hopes which working 
people have in achieving leftist ideals miller said 
an allparty poll conducted in september and presented to the 
central committee saturday indicated that 72 percent of those 
queried favored transforming the party and adopting a new program 
and name 
the idea of a new party is not the result of nostalgia of past 
importance it is a consequence of the assessment that the 
party cannot effectively meet the challenge of the new times 
miller said 
in a draft declaration for a new program to be voted on at the 
congress the party leaders rejected such communist slogans as the 
dictatorship of the proletariat and collectivization and 
said stalinism was imposed from abroad and had nothing to do with 
the roots of the polish left 
the declaration said the party believes the future of poland 
lies not with capitalism but with democratic socialism which 
it defined as freedom democracy social justice and solidarity 
the draft said the new party hopes to work with trade unions and 
the leftwing of solidarity and that it felt close to ecology and 
peace movements 
following a precedent set at the last plenum reporters were 
allowed to attend the morning session 
the sweeping victory of the solidarityled opposition in 
elections last june sent the communist party scrambling for a new 
identity 
blamed for polands crippled economy the communists crisis 
deepened last summer with the election of solidarity editor tadeusz 
mazowiecki which ended more than 40 years of communist control of 
the government 
constitutional amendments adopted last month stripped the party 
of its leading role in state affairs 
at the beginning of 1980 the party claimed membership of 3 
million now membership has slipped to 2 million miller said 10 
percent of the current members were not interested at all in 
preparations for the congress 
party unity has dissolved in recent months with some communist 
deputies in parliament dropping out of the party caucus and with 
other communists threatening to split from the party 
but miller said the possibility of a serious conflict going into 
the congress had subsided 
we are going to the congress as a single party he declared 
he did not exclude the possibility of conflict at the congress 
however unity of the postcongress party is the to be or not to 
be of the polish left he said 
the congress is scheduled to last three days with the first day 
devoted to passing resolutions to end the partys activity and the 
following two days to the creation of a new party

a crippled iranian tanker that spilled 19 
million gallons of oil off the moroccan coast was towed past the 
canary islands saturday in its search for calm seas to transfer its 
remaining cargo 
cape verde morocco portugal and spain turned away the khark 5 
which made an arc saturday around the canaries before heading south 
across open seas 
the salvage company smit tak which is commanding the three tugs 
towing the khark 5 said it planned to take the 1120foot tanker 
toward sheltered waters with little wind and less than twofoot 
waves 
the 53 million gallons of oil still estimated to be inside the 
khark 5 will then be transferred to a second iranian tanker said 
daan kaakebeen a spokesman for the dutch salvage company 
smit tak has been trying to find a haven for the khark 5 since 
an explosion ripped through the ships hull dec 19 when it was 400 
miles north of las palmas in spains canary islands 
morocco 400 miles west refused to let the tanker dock there 
and a 100squaremile oil slick threatened moroccos coastline 
pollution experts said thursday nearly all the oil had dissipated 
and that there was no danger of an environmental disaster 
kaakebeen said spains decision to deny a request for the khark 
5 to perform the transfer of oil inside the 200mile territorial 
zone around the canaries would delay the transfer by seven or eight 
days 
but he added that milder weather off africas atlantic coast 
lessened the possibility of new spills the tankers condition was 
stable and it had not leaked crude since wednesday he said 
as long as the ship is out in the open water with a cargo 
there is always a percentage of danger that a heavy storm will 
damage it kaakebeen said but the weather is improving 
the ship was heading west around the canaries on saturday 
morning kaakebeen said 
the spanish navy vessel atrevida and the punta mayor a merchant 
marine tug equipped with floating barriers and chemical dispersants 
were following the tanker merchant marine officials said 
in cape verde a republic of 15 islands about 1200 miles south 
of the canaries merchant marine head humberto morais issued a 
statement thursday forbidding the khark 5 from entering its waters 
we wont accept this supertanker in cape verde for any 
money the state news agency capopress quoted morais as saying

the soviet union to quell unrest in the region

ford motor co is trying to sell its aerospace 
division a major supplier of missiles flight training and 
satellite technology a published report said saturday 
the washington post said the parent company wants to sell its 
ford aerospace corp because of uncertainties over government 
defense spending and a need to focus on automaking in the face of 
fierce global competition 
ford officials would not comment on the report calling it 
speculative ford spokesman bill peacock in dearborn mich 
said he was unaware of any prospectus that the post said was 
being circulated 
i would not say there is nothing out there peacock said 
im not sure what that document is i cant say whether 
descriptive material might exist 
ford is holding a regularly scheduled board meeting thursday 
but peacock said he was not privy to the agenda and did not know 
whether a sale would be discussed 
peacock said there had been some speculation in trade 
publications spokesman thomas foote said its not a new rumor 
the report occurs against a backdrop of concern among defense 
contractors that the thaw in eastwest relations will mean 
reductions in government spending on weaponry 
chrysler corp announced last month it was pulling out of the 
defense business general motors has denied any interest in selling 
its hughes aircraft co subsidiary which started laying off 6000 
of its 75000 workers in the second half of 1989 
the ford aerospace and communications division received 2 
billion in contract awards both civilian and military in its 
fiscal 1989 it employs 17000 people and division spokesman 
norman black said 70 percent of its business is with the military 
ford aerospace produces the chaparral and sidewinder missiles 
and is one of the largest makers of satellites supplying the 
superbird to the japanese it is heavily involved in satellite 
tracking services and runs the militarys jet pilot training ranges 
the division also runs the national aeronautics and space 
administrations mission control center in houston and is building 
parts of the us space station that is to orbit later this decade 
peacock said the division is in good financial shape and has 
extensive civilian contracts 
it is solidly profitable and has a big communications activity 
with civilian customers both in this country and japan peacock 
said 
when chrysler chairman lee iaccoca announced the sale of its 
chrysler technologies corp he cited the need to go back to basics 
and compete headtohead with the japanese automakers 
when asked whether ford was planning a consolidation like 
chryslers ford spokesman foote said if somebody comes along 
who wants to talk to us about anything well talk to them 
fords auto sales dropped 22 percent in late december compared 
with a year earlier but it was the only domestic automaker last 
year to increase its market share the post said 
ford has about 2 billion in cash on hand ford acquired 
britains prestigious jaguar auto company in november for 25 
billion and in august acquired associates first capitol corp the 
nations thirdlargest independent finance company for 34 
billion 
ford would not do it for any immediate financial reason 
alone said auto analyst arvid jouppi he said he would not be 
surprised at such a move 
whenever one of the big three does something the other ones 
do the same 
the economies are essentially the same for all companies of 
the big three 
industry analyst wolfgang demisch of ubs securities inc told 
the post such a move would make sense but he noted that ford 
aerospace within the last year acquired bdm international a 
government services firm with extensive military contracts

gen manuel antonio noriega used his power as head 
of panamas intelligence unit its military and then the entire 
country to give aid comfort and shelter to colombian cocaine 
traffickers in return for millions of dollars the indictment 
against him charges 
noriega has been accused in testimony of detailing soldiers as 
bodyguards for colombian drug traffickers allowing military planes 
and airfields to be used for drug shipments providing traffickers 
with intelligence information about us antidrug operations and 
sending armored cars to transport drug money 
and when colombian drug lords were angered over a raid on a 
cocaine lab in panama the indictment recounts cuban president 
fidel castro got them and noriega together in havana to mediate a 
settlement 
by utilizing his official positions manuel antonio noriega 
and trusted associates were able to assure drug traffickers that 
panamanian military customs and law enforcement personnel would 
not interfere with their operations in panama as long as 
substantial fees were paid to noriega says the indictment 
handed up in miami on feb 4 1988 
since his arraignment in miami on thursday noriegas attorneys 
have been working on challenges to the indictment and the courts 
jurisdiction they say the indictment was political and that 
noriega claims innocence 
he could face up to 145 years in prison and more than 11 
million in fines on charges that include conspiracy and 
racketeering 
the indictment names 15 other defendants ranging from brian 
alden davidow a jailed miami college student charged with meeting 
with noriega to arrange cocaine shipments to pablo escobar 
gaviria the reputed medellin cartel cocaine kingpin being pursued 
by colombian authorities 
while us officials have accused leaders of other governments 
particularly cuba of helping drug traffic to the united states for 
political reasons noriegas prime motivation seemed to be money 
officials say 
us authorities say they have identified at least 10 million 
kept in european banks by noriega who rose from a poor family and 
reputedly supplemented his 60000 annual salary with interests in 
casinos liquor stores news media outlets and banks 
money attracted him to drug traffic noriega really loves 
money and luxury said ambler moss a former us ambassador to 
panama 
the miami indictment details at least 46 million in payments 
noriega allegedly received for protecting cocaine and drug money 
shipments selling seized ether and acetone used in making cocaine 
to colombian drug traffickers and for giving sanctuary to drug 
dealers in 1984 when the colombian government went after them 
following the assassination of a justice minister 
noriega also is accused of allowing establishment of a cocaine 
laboratory in panamas darien province and helping the manufacture 
of cocaine in another laboratory in the nearby colombian area 
dubbed tranquilandia 
a separate indictment in tampa says noriega agreed to protect 
two marijuana shipments totaling 14 million pounds for 4 million 
of which he received 1 million 
when he announced the 12count miami indictment thenus 
attorney leon kellner noted that the case was unprecedented but 
added that noriegas influence in panama was so pervasive that he 
was able to guarantee protection for trafficking 
general noriega controls panama and he utilized his position 
to sell the country of panama to traffickers kellner said at the 
time kellner now in private practice in washington said last 
week he wouldnt comment on the noriega case 
convicted drug smuggler floyd carlton caceres told a us senate 
hearing in 1988 that he acted as a gobetween in 1982 getting 
noriega 200000 a flight from the medellin cartel for protecting 
drug flights through panama carlton sentenced to nine years in 
prison in 1988 in miami has been called a key witness by 
prosecutors 
boris olarte morales a convicted colombian drug smuggler may 
testify about a 4 million bribe the indictment says he paid 
noriega 
other possible witnesses include convicted drug smugglers ramon 
milian rodriguez cubanborn and stephen kalish a houston native 
prominent in the tampa case against noriega they have testified 
that the noriega package of protection included armored car 
transport of their money use of military airfields immediate 
credit for deposits into panamanian banks and intelligence 
information 
another crucial witness is expected to be jose blandon a former 
noriega confidant who broke with him in january 1988 and testified 
before the senate and federal grand jury 
blandon said that in june 1984 panamanian authorities raided 
the darien processing plant and arrested 23 colombians and lt col 
julian melo secretary general of noriegas staff blandon has said 
the colombian traffickers saying they had paid melo 5 million to 
protect the operation were outraged by the raid which occurred 
while noriega was in paris 
castro was contacted by the colombians blandon has said and 
arranged a meeting at which noriega was assured there would be no 
reprisals from the traffickers melo and the colombians were soon 
freed blandon said and equipment and 3 million were returned to 
the traffickers 
castro and noriega have both denounced blandons charges as lies

a city police chief whose officers 
nearly clashed with demonstrators in november committed suicide and 
left a note saying he couldnt stand being blamed for the incident 
a news report said saturday 
the demonstration occurred during the popular uprising that 
eventually swept the hardline communist leadership from power in 
czechoslovakia 
the police chief was the third official associated with the 
former power structure to commit suicide or attempt it last week 
in other developments saturday 
the communists central committee meeting for the first time 
since its formation in december elected a new 24member executive 
body to replace the former ruling politburo 
former communist party leader milos jakes said the monopoly on 
power that the communists enjoyed until recently left them without 
the political skills needed to meet the challenges of 1989 
an american congressional delegation said the united states may 
award czechoslovakia most favored nation trading status soon a 
development that could help the nations economy 
josef petracek chief of police in the northern city of teplice 
75 miles north of prague was found dead friday morning after 
having shot himself with his own gun the state news agency ctk 
reported 
he left a goodbye note saying the reason for his suicide was 
pressure on him and the responsibility he felt for the police 
action on nov 1113 in teplice against demonstrators demanding a 
better environment ctk reported 
when several hundred people protested severe pollution in the 
region riot police moved in to disperse them but the officers 
were called off by a local communist party leader who agreed to 
talk with the demonstrators 
the protest marked one of the first instances of officials 
agreeing to talk to the people as popular unrest spread in 
czechoslovakia eventually ending four decades of communist party 
supremacy 
the news report did not say where petracek was when he shot 
himself 
on wednesday jiri becvar a senior police official in prague 
also shot himself to death he was charged with participating in a 
bloody police crackdown on students nov 17 
antonin kapek former prague communist party boss attempted 
suicide thursday citing what he called the unbearable pressure he 
was facing he survived and was hospitalized in a psychiatric 
institution media reported 
jakes who was ousted as party leader on nov 24 discussed the 
communist partys problems in an interview broadcast saturday on 
the europe express program on londons channel four in britain 
excerpts of the interview were released by the program in advance 
of the broadcast 
the partys problem was that because of centralized control 
the partys power monopoly and the lack of an opposition we 
couldnt fight political battles any more he said 
jakes has been expelled from the communist party he was widely 
held to be responsible for the purges of party members that 
followed the warsaw pact invasion in 1968 that crushed the 
reformist government of alexander dubcek 
jakes contended he was not responsible for the purges 
thats a false version that is years old he said the 
purge was ordered by the party central committee i wasnt on the 
central committee i headed the control and audit commission we 
just heard appeals against the decision of other party bodies 
though the soviet union and its allies have recently said the 
1968 warsaw pact invasion was a mistake jakes said it is too early 
to judge it wasnt considered a mistake then but a step to 
strengthen the socialist community history will be the judge its 
only been 20 years thats too little while those who took part 
are alive one cant be objective 
from the point of view of todays events like perestroika 
glasnost democratization it seems a mistake but history cannot 
be changed 
regarding the trade development a group of us congressmen 
led by rep john j la falce dny said the mostfavorednation 
trading status could be granted as soon as czechoslovakia 
implements planned economic reforms and further political changes 
ctk reported 
the united states will award czechoslovakia the mfn clause as 
soon as some of the expected political and economic changes take 
place it is a matter of several months possibly weeks ctk 
reported 
in december 1989 the new noncommunistdominated czechoslovak 
government declared its intention to pass several new laws 
guaranteeing among other things freedoms of gathering association 
and private enterprise 
some of these laws could be passed as early as february sources 
say 
the communists new executive body which replaces the 
politburo includes the partys chairman ladislav adamec first 
secretary vasil mohorita and three newly elected secretaries ctk 
said 
adamec speaking to the central committee supported the idea of 
national understanding but stressed that differences between 
czechoslovakias current political forces remain

residents accused of using a car to 
solicit a prostitute or driving with a suspended license can have 
the vehicles confiscated under a new law that city officials think 
is the first of its kind 
since the forfeiture law went into effect dec 15 about 15 
vehicles have been seized from people accused of driving with 
licenses suspended under a prior drunken driving charge police 
spokesman dave simpson said friday thirteen vehicles were taken 
from prostitution suspects including an 11ton delivery truck 
the city has been seizing vehicles of all those arrested who fit 
the provisions of the law a police spokesman said saturday but it 
probably wont keep many of the cars and trucks it seizes although 
the ordinance allows it 
the forfeiture part of the law has raised the ire of the 
american civil liberties union which has threatened to challenge 
the ordinance 
the ordinance is aimed at discouraging drunken driving and 
prostitution not at raising money for city coffers officials say 
the average john is a married man with a job said city 
commissioner bob koch whose staff drafted the ordinance its 
going to be awfully hard for a guy to go home and explain to his 
wife where the car is 
administrative costs probably will exceed the value of the 
vehicles seized said deputy city attorney paul elsener 
i dont even think it the forfeitures will cover the cost of 
this program i think its a money loser he said 
elsener said that while a 20000 chevy blazer was seized from a 
man accused of soliciting a policewoman posing as a prostitute 
most of the vehicles taken from those with suspended licenses were 
valued at less than 1000 
the city attorneys office is drafting criteria to use in 
deciding which vehicles to keep elsener said they may include 
value the history of the person and other types of extenuating or 
mitigating circumstances he said 
meanwhile the aclus lawyers committee plans to meet wednesday 
to discuss whether to challenge the ordinance in court because a 
vehicle can be forfeited before its owner is convicted 
i understand the enormous frustration caused by lack of space 
to incarcerate people but now theyre trying to violate peoples 
rights said stevie remington executive director of the state 
chapter 
we dont think theres anything wrong with impounding a car if 
someone is drunk and keeping it for a short period of time but 
certainly not until after a conviction should there be a 
forfeiture 
the mere fact that someone is acquitted does not imply that 
hell get his vehicle back elsener said 
a person can file a claim to the city to get his car back and 
take the matter to court if the claim is denied elsener said 
those whose cars are seized but not forfeited still must pay 
towing and storage costs he said 
the provisions intended to deter drunken driving are unique in 
the nation elsener said he believes the same is true for the 
prostitution provisions 
koch said the new ordinance should make a dent in the citys 
prostitution problem 
our real goal here is to convince the marketplace that the 
cost of street prostitution is too high and the johns will stay 
away from the city koch said were going to see a decrease in 
prostitution

a teenager who helped run a computer 
bulletin board service showing how to make explosive devices was 
sentenced to three years in prison for his part in a bombing 
intended to scare a 17yearold girl 
david overeem 18 gaithersburg md received the sentence 
friday from montgomery county circuit judge john j mitchell the 
computer service pyromaniac production systems reportedly 
gave formulas for homemade bombs to users as far away as 
california prosecutors said 
authorities said overeem was one of the leaders of a group of 
acquaintances who called themselves damage incorporated 
assistant states attorney constance junghans said in court that 
the group loaded the bulletin board with recipes for an array of 
explosive devices including rockets car bombs pipe bombs bottle 
bombs and land mines 
overeem was a junior at gaithersburg high school at the time of 
his arrest in april and was described by prosecutors as an 
emotionally troubled young man of superior intelligence 
overeem pleaded guilty to making a pipe bomb that allegedly was 
detonated by a friend of his on march 26 outside the girls home in 
germantown which like gaithersburg is a distant suburb of 
washington dc 
the bombing was intended only to frighten the girl who a former 
girlfriend of overeems friend prosecutors said 
no one was injured but a piece of shrapnel tore through a wall 
and into a room where three children were asleep authorities said 
i dont know when some cowardly yellowbellied soandso 
is going to place one of these devices just for fun in someones 
home or car or office mitchell told overeem 
he imposed the maximum 20year sentence for the offense of 
manufacturing a destructive explosive device but suspended all but 
three years of the term 
after overeems arrest investigators said extensive computer 
records found in his bedroom showed that hundreds of people had 
access to the bulletin board including some of the four teenagers 
killed dec 31 1988 in the accidental explosion of a pipe bomb 
they were building in a bethesda md garage

forecasters said saturday there is 
only a 40 percent chance that weather at the kennedy space center 
will be satisfactory on monday to launch space shuttle columbia on 
a 10day mission 
it does not look all that good right now said terri 
brasher a spokeswoman for air force weather forecasters she 
ticked off potential problems poor visibility a thick layer of 
clouds hanging low over the launch area and rain but said we 
remain optimistic 
ed priselac the space shuttle weather officer said odds 
against a launch on monday because of bad weather were 60 percent 
because of a front moving into florida under nasas inflexible 
rules rain in the launch path or visibility less than seven miles 
would cause a launch to be scrubbed 
a postponement would be the fourth for columbia whose mission 
on this 33rd shuttle flight is to launch one satellite and to 
retrieve another by doubling the time in space from the normal 
five days nasa hopes to acquire data on the astronauts long 
exposure to weightlessness as well as that of their ship 
the object is to modify columbia alone among the three 
shuttles for long duration flights a 16day flight is planned for 
1992 to be followed eventually by missions of up to 28 days 
these are stepping stones for a permanently manned space station 
in which astronauts would spend six months in orbit and for 
flights to mars which could take up to two years 
only once before in novemberdecember 1983 has a shuttle 
remained in space for 10 days 
the space agency reported no problems in readying the ship for 
its ninth flight since the countdown began thursday 
nasa test conductor mike leinbach said the weather outlook would 
be evaluated late sunday night before workers start the flow of a 
half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into 
columbias fuel tanks 
plans are for columbia to catch up with the long duration 
exposure facility a 30footlong satellite launched from the 
shuttle in 1984 move in front of it and grapple it from above 
with the shuttles robot arm 
the satellite was to have been retrieved after one year of 
exposing 57 experiments to the rigors of space but budget problems 
and the challenger disaster delayed the rescue mission until now 
bill kinard chief scientist on the project said the extra time 
in space has been a bonanza 
almost all the experiments have benefited he said ldef 
is a virtual treasure trove of science and technology information 
included among the materials exposed to space are 12 million 
tomato seeds which will be distributed among students from grade 5 
through university levels to study genetic and other changes 
if not retrieved and brought back to earth in columbias cargo 
bay the satellite is expected to reenter the atmosphere and burn 
up by march 9 its scientific mission would be wasted 
columbia is scheduled to lift off monday between 810 am est 
and 908 the day of the satellite retrieval depends on the exact 
time of launch and could be thursday saturday or sunday 
first however 24 hours after the liftoff the astronauts will 
release a navy communications satellite the fifth in a series 
from their cargo bay 
the astronauts who flew here friday from their training base in 
houston were briefed on the weather and other aspects of the 
flight today 
commander dan brandenstein and pilot jim wetherbee practiced 
shuttle landings in a jet outfitted to operate like the shuttle

players in the world of consumer electronics 
were given an upbeat assessment of the industry saturday then 
fanned out over acres of gadgetry to get an idea of whats hot for 
the 1990s 
the consumer electronics show dubbed a disneyland for adults 
kicked off its fourday run on an optimistic note with industry 
leaders challenging manufacturers and dealers to build on the 
successes of the 1980s 
some 70000 manufacturers dealers and journalists from the 
united states and 80 foreign countries will view thousands of 
products showcased over 800000 square feet of display space before 
the show ends tuesday 
some 1400 exhibitors are displaying 95 product lines at the 
citys convention center and four major hotels 
wholesale consumer electronic sales reached 322 billion in 
1989 a 6 percent increase over the previous year frank myers 
president of wellsgardner electric corp told delegates in a 
keynote address 
he predicted that figure for 1990 would reach 334 billion 
most economists believe the us economy is heading for a 
soft landing in 1990 rather than the recession that was widely 
predicted earlier myers said 
bernard brennan chairman of montgomery ward amp co acknowledged 
that the difficult economy and competition among many stores 
selling electronics present challenges for the 1990s 
successful retailers will have a passion for serving 
customers he said the winners will be entrepreneurial they 
will be opportunistic 
a major factor that will affect the 1990s is the graying of 
the consumer base brennan said 
this change in demographics to an older population is 
developing the concept of cocooning that is spending a great 
deal of time in ones home this trend offers all of us an 
opportunity to fulfill the home theater needs of this growing 
consumer group brennan said 
one of the highlights of the show is the merger of audio and 
video products to create a home theater 
this years show also features vcrs compact disc players fax 
machines talking auto alarm systems high definition television 
laptop computers wholehouse home automation products and cellular 
phones 
also spotlighted will be the growing trend of home offices 
recent statistics show that nearly 25 million americans work at 
home and about 25 percent of those households contain two 
homebased professionals said dennis corcoran the shows vice 
president 
you are going to see a lot of personal electronics at the 
show items that can be used in the home office such as 
translators computers and hand held items you can take on the 
go said show spokeswoman cynthia upson now you can take a fax 
machine and cellular phone with you and can fax something back to 
your office 
another feature is home automation which was introduced in the 
infancy stage at last years show 
this system enables all the different appliances and consumer 
electronics products to talk to each other ms upson said you 
can use your telephone to lock doors while youre away turn on 
alarm systems turn on the dishwasher program the vcr set heating 
or air conditioning

nicolae ceausescu was a morose boy 
who dreamed of power while fellow children in his hometown pursued 
more innocent ideals the former dictators cousin recalled 
saturday 
florea ceausescu who has spent his life a stones throw from 
his infamous cousins modest childhood home depicted him as a 
cruel and selfish man with no time for anyone outside his immediate 
clique and other longtime scornicesti residents concurred 
even as a youngster he had the feeling that he would lead the 
people the 71yearold said of his cousin nodding toward 
ceausescus first home he was a cruel man who worked only for 
his own people and had no feelings for outsiders 
florea ceausescu lives across the street from the threeroom hut 
where ceausescu spent his first 12 years he said ceausescu showed 
no interest in neighbors on his rare visits and we had no chance 
to talk to him because he was always surrounded by bodyguards 
municipal officials painted a picture of an inward 
unapproachable man whose dreaded securitate secret police took 
over the town of 13000 whenever the dictator visited 
they would never announce his coming mayor ilie manea said 
around 500 securitate would converge in town and in the 
surrounding hills and forests and the mayors and local polices 
only job was to find enough people to get together a cheering 
crowd 
the town about 120 miles northwest of bucharest showed little 
sign saturday of the violent upheaval that toppled ceausescu and 
led to his and his wifes execution dec 25 
but there was evidence of the depth of feeling against the 
dictator and his clique 
the dirt floors of ceausescus childhood home were covered with 
shards of glass from broken portraits of the ironfisted leader and 
his parents the inside of a luxurious adjoining villa belonging to 
ceausescus sister elena bobulescu was in disarray its cupboards 
ripped open and their contents strewn about 
florea ceausescu his face bearing uncanny resemblance to his 
cousin except for several days growth of beard and deep lines 
etched by a hard life smiled when asked if his name would cause 
him trouble 
i will change my name he declared everyone will now say 
that we are all bad because of the name 
ceausescu said he had little contact with his cousin after the 
future leader moved to bucharest at age 12 and became an apprentice 
cobbler 
but he recalled a moody strange youth with a sense of mission 
he would play for awhile and then he would suddenly stop for 
no reason and say ive had enough he said he was a little 
strange he never laughed he was serious all the time 
nicolae ceausescus thirst for power was at least initally 
intertwined with idealistic strivings to improve the lot of a 
backward people his cousin suggested 
shortly after his move to bucharest the young ceausescu was 
arrested for illegal activities tied to his activism in the 
communist party and he reappeared briefly in scornicesti at age 14 
after two years in prison 
before world war ii the communists were a tiny group viewed as 
anarchist troublemakers by romanian authorities 
my father asked him why did you go to jail florea 
ceausescu said he answered i went to jail so we can work the 
land with heavy machinery and we can raise production 
but all idealism appeared to be extinguished in the last years 
of ceausescus 24year tenure at the helm of the country 
the 1980s were marked by growing privation across the nation 
the meager amount of national income left by ceausescus drive to 
pay off a massive foreign debt was consumed by extravagant 
construction projects of questionable value 
the only thing important to nicolae was not people but 
building monuments his cousin alleged saying his own small 
house nearly fell victim to the dictators grandiose scheme to raze 
traditional village homes and move their owners into impersonal 
apartment blocks

the aircraft carrier john f kennedy has been 
chosen to lead an antidrug interdiction effort off the coast of 
colombia but final decisions about when the warship may be put to 
work havent been made yet a defense department source said 
saturday 
the carrier and an accompanying guided missile cruiser the uss 
virginia left norfolk va on thursday to engage in routine 
training exercises in the atlantic a pentagon official said but 
he added that a question mark remained as to when and if the 
warships would see duty in a proposed uscolombian antidrug 
interdiction effort 
thats the group the jfk is the one to be used said the 
official but its still a question when theyd be put to use 
two colombian radio networks caracol and rcn on saturday 
quoted unnamed pentagon sources as saying the ships were headed 
toward colombia to begin setting up a blockade to try to stop drug 
smugglers 
but the pentagon official speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the final plans were still being worked out on a 
pentagon proposal to launch a virtual air and sea blockade of the 
colombian coastline as part of an effort to help colombia curb the 
illicit narcotics exports of its drug cartels 
an administration us official saturday denied that any 
blockade was under way 
nothings been initiated in terms of activating such 
efforts he said 
we are consulting with the colombians and will continue to 
do so over the next few days the administration official said he 
declined to say when the heightened military operation might begin 
and said it should not be called a blockade 
white house spokeswoman alixe glen said us ships had been 
scheduled to sail to colombia to help with the antidrug effort 
but she did not know when or have any more details on the operation 
we knew the boats were going down there glen said 
defense secretary dick cheney is expected soon to announce a 
white houseapproved plan for getting us military forces more 
deeply involved in the international drug battle 
president bush is scheduled to travel to colombia in february 
for an antidrug summit of the leaders of the andean nations 
a senior defense department official said last month the air and 
sea effort was expected to be enacted prior to bushs trip to 
colombia 
after that report appeared white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater acknowledged that final plans were being made 
under the reported antidrug effort the navy was to operate an 
aircraft carrier battle group off the caribbean coast of colombia 
on a rotating basis each carrier group would be in position for 
one or two months a time frame similar to normal training 
deployments 
the senior pentagon official had said that much of the money for 
operating the battle group would come from training funds 
the pentagon official also emphasized that us navy fighters 
would not be given the authority to shoot down suspected 
drugrunning planes that enforcement role he said was to be 
handled by colombian officials 
an aircraft carrier normally has eight or 12 smaller ships as 
part of its battle group along with an aircraft wing composed of 
about 3000 men and dozens of observation and tracking planes and 
those would be in the forefront of the surveillance efforts 
pentagon officials long have said the hightech radar and 
surveillance equipment owned by the us navy would be their main 
weapon in keeping tabs on suspected drug dealers boats and planes

a lutheran bishop who fled el 
salvador under death threats returned saturday escorted by a group 
of clerics for protection 
the rev medardo gomez now head of the protestant demonination 
in central america said he was forced to leave nov 26 because the 
governments persecution of church workers was tremendous 
in november in the middle of the biggest leftist guerrilla 
offensive in el salvadors decadeold civil war president alfredo 
cristianis rightist government indicated church workers were 
suspected of cooperating with the rebels 
i am not a criminal i am not a terrorist i am a pastor and 
our work is to worry about the poor and is not inspired by any 
social ideology gomez told a news conference on his arrival 
during the monthlong offensive dozens of roman catholic 
anglican lutheran episcopal and baptist clergy and church workers 
suspected of cooperating with the rebels were rounded up by 
government troops and thrown out of the country 
six jesuit priests all leading educators along with their 
housekeeper and her daughter were fatally shot and their bodies 
mutilated at their home church leaders blamed the army for the 
massacre and the government promised an investigation 
gomez 44 then the leader of el salvadors lutheran church 
left after receiving several death threats 
he flew in saturday from the united states accompanied a dozen 
clergy including the revs roger white anglican bishop of 
milwaukee arthur mcgovern a jesuit priest from detroit peter 
rogness lutheran bishop of milwaukee and cristina gronn vice 
president of the evangelical lutheran church of america 
gronn said the delegation would celebrate the feast of the 
epiphany with salvadoran religious communities provide security 
for gomez and express support for all those church workers still 
being persecuted 
gomez did not say how long he will remain in el salvador 
i know conditions do not exist for me to live freely doing my 
work there are military groups who are persecuting the 
church he added 
but he said he does not want to hold the military high 
command responsible because they have officially told us the armed 
forces have nothing against the churches 
my struggle now will be to pray and speak abroad about 
dialogue and negotiations and create conditions for a pacification 
process in el salvador he said 
talks for a ceasefire and eventual peace broke off shortly 
before the offensive began with government and rebel leaders 
accusing each other of not negotiating in good faith 
gronn said the delegation has asked president bush to suspend 
military aid to the cristiani government to pressue him into 
resuming the ceasefire talks 
the united states currently provides 15 million daily in 
economic and military assistance 
we are worried by the escalation of violence in the salvadoran 
conflict and the role of the united states which supplies military 
assistance that perpetuates the violences we are in favor of a 
political and not a military solution gronn said 
gomez then added as a church we condemn all forms of 
violence and must pronounce ourselves against all assistance that 
promotes this violence regardless from where this military aid 
comes from 
more than 71000 people have been killed in the civil war

joyful panamanians applauded the gis who 
ousted dictator manuel antonio noriega but for many elsewhere in 
latin america the us invasion left a bitter taste 
in an angry response to the dec 20 invasion peruvian president 
alan garcia initially suspended antinarcotics operations with us 
agents in his country and said he would not show up at a drug 
conference with other andean leaders and president bush 
mexico traditionally a critic of american military 
intervention announced it would continue relations with panama but 
said it would not send back its ambassador carlos planck to 
panama city 
a leading political opposition group the conservative national 
action party called the american invasion a transgression of the 
most elemental principles of international law by a country who 
says it is respectful of juridical norms 
panamanians took to the streets to applaud noriegas surrender 
to us authorities wednesday and his departure to florida to face 
us drug trafficking charges public opinion polls show wide 
panamanian approval of the us actions 
but independent newspapers in mexico chile and brazil mindful 
of a history of us intervention in latin america lambasted the 
invasion 
calling noriegas capture a tiny war trophy for the biggest 
power on earth chiles ultimas noticias said 
we dont like general noriega nor the way he ruled his 
country nevertheless neither his bragging nor his links to 
corruption nor his lack of respect for the verdicts of the polls 
justify that the united states which always likes to pontificate 
about juridical principles tramples these in order to get its 
way 
the brazilian newspaper jornal do brasil called the capture a 
pyrrhic victory for the united states and praised the vatican in 
whose embassy noriega was a refugee for more than a week for 
maintaining an impeccable line of conduct the same cannot be 
said for us intervention 
the occupation forces established an aggressive ring around 
the vatican embassy invaded the nicaraguan ambassadors residence 
and dealt violent blows to continental cooperation jornal do 
brasil added 
the brazilian newspaper folha de sao paulo said us policy in 
central america will not advance positively so long as there is a 
predisposition in undertaking adventures of this type to the 
detriment of coherent strategies for economic and social 
development 
the mexican newspaper el universal referring to the us 
action said the end does not justify the means 
garcia hoisted the panamanian flag alongside that of the 
peruvian colors in his presidential palace in lima as a gesture of 
solidarity with the panamanian people and foreign minister 
guillermo larco cox called president guillermo endara who 
succeeded noriega in power the judas of central america 
peru initially suspended joint antidrug patrols and said it 
would boycott the antidrug summit in protest 
but peru on dec 26 resumed usperuvian drug patrols in its 
country and us and peruvian officials said last week that peru 
had reversed its decision not to attend antidrug talks with the 
united states bolivia and colombia peru says garcia will not 
attend the feb 15 meeting with bush 
but the lima newspaper expreso had criticized garcias protests 
saying the panamanian people preferred an american invasion 
rather than continue suffering the dictator 
the bolivian newpspaper ultima hora attributed what happened in 
panama not only as the result of the forced and resigned 
submission of the people but to the lack of a true latin american 
system that defends the justice freedom and sovereignty of its 
countries 
in honduras the closest us ally in the region the newspaper 
tiempo called noriega a coward and a poor devil and said 
the dictators cause was never that of the panamanian people

a plane carrying 61 romanian children whose 
adoptions by french parents had been blocked by nicolae ceausescus 
government landed saturday to a joyful welcome from their new 
families 
we are in debt to the romanian people for winning freedom for 
these children said jacques lellioz of st nazaire in western 
france who waited more than three years for his adopted daughter 
maeva 
i would have liked a little more intimacy with everything 
more discreet lellioz said amid the tumult of reporters and 
television cameras covering the arrival of the governmentchartered 
plane at orly airport 
also saturday an italian air force plane flew from bucharest 
the romanian capital to italy with more orphans for longwaiting 
parents 
philippe chabins daughter roxanna opened presents from her 
new french cousins after rushing into the arms of her adopted 
father who had staged two hunger strikes to try to pressure the 
romanian government into letting her go 
we will adopt other children chabin said but not in 
romania 
in the early 1980s hundreds of french parents sought and found 
children in romania when demand for adoptive children in france was 
greater than the supply 
ceausescus policies encouraging large families combined with 
widespread shortages of food and other necessities produced large 
numbers of children available for adoption 
the prospective parents had to pay thousands of dollars in 
official fees and often thousands more to corrupt officials to get 
a child 
but in july 1988 ceausescus government halted any new adoption 
cases for foreign parents and in january 1989 it refused to allow 
the departure of 89 children whose adoption procedures were 
complete or nearly complete 
after ceausescu was overthrown and executed last month following 
a popular revolution the french foreign ministry said his 
authoritarian government had engaged in blackmail to obtain in 
exchange for the children the resumption of political and economic 
relations which france had broken off because of human rights 
violations in romania 
the new authorities in romania abolished the ban on foreign 
adoptions and the french foreign ministry chartered a plane to fly 
the adoptive parents to bucharest to pick up the children and 
return home 
we are happy for the happy futures of these children 
dumitru mazilu deputy chairman of romanias ruling council of 
national salvation said at a short ceremony organized at the 
bucharest airport 
those who died in the revolution also died for these 
children he said 
some children awaited by adoptive parents were not on the plane 
french officials said in some cases authorities had not had time 
to check back with the romanian families to be sure they still want 
to give their children up for adoption a decision often made 
between two and four years ago 
in other cases the children simply had not yet been brought to 
bucharest from provincial orphanages in time to catch saturdays 
flight and would be brought to their french adoptive parents within 
days the officials said 
many of the children were simply abandoned by their biological 
parents who were forbidden from using birth control because of 
ceausescus plans to increase romanias population of 23 million by 
7 million by the year 2000

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze on saturday pledged to open the sovietromanian border 
and provide oil and gas to allow romanians to turn up their heat 
for the first winter in years 
shevardnadze on a oneday visit spent more than five hours in 
talks with his romanian counterpart sergiu celac premier petre 
roman and ion iliescu president of the national salvation front 
that is running the country 
he promised that moscow would not interfere if romania 
established a multiparty democracy 
romanias interim leaders had high expectations for the visit 
the first by a senior soviet official since communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu was ousted dec 22 in a popular revolt and 
executed three days later 
the soviet chief diplomat invited iliescu and celac to visit 
moscow and iliescu told soviet tv he planned to go this month to 
jointly discuss the fate of the warsaw pact 
celac later issued a statement vowing that romania would honor 
its human rights commitments in accords adopted by 35 nations in 
vienna in january 1989 
ceausescus regime had said it did not feel bound by the 
commitments on freedom of religion and emigration 
the kremlin already had pledged aid to the new romania and 
confirmed moscow would provide oil and gas to help romania through 
the winter 
under ceausescu romanias 23 million people suffered through 
winters with barely any heat or light for their homes as the 
dictator redirected raw material imports to his pet 
industrialization projects 
shevardnadze said the soviet union also accepts that some 
romanian products will no longer be exported to the soviet union 
ceausescu exported vast quantities of food especially meat to 
ensure energy supplies from moscow 
one of the first moves by the interim leadership was to stop 
food exports so it could feed deprived romanians 
at a 45minute news conference after his talks shevardnadze 
said the two countries would start discussion on opening the border 
so that people can go without any difficulties whatsoever to make 
contacts 
the border between romania and soviet moldavia had been one of 
the most tightly closed in eastern europe and cultural and other 
exchanges were severely restricted by frosty sovietromanian 
relations in the past 
romanians in the border region and many soviet moldavians had 
hoped for a more open border 
soviet moldavia consists largely of territory annexed from 
romania by josef stalin in 1940 and rewon by the red army in 1944 
after a threeyear occupation by axis forces in world war ii 
moldavians whose spoken language is identical to romanian have 
been appealing for increased independence from moscow and 
romanias revolution has sparked speculation they could even push 
for a form of reunification 
asked about the possibility of reunification shevardnadze said 
existing european treaties guarantee the territorial integrity of 
all the countries of europe and their existing borders 
that is something that must be taken into account he said 
without elaborating 
security was tight throughout shevardnadzes visit half a dozen 
paratroopers with helmets and automatic weapons stood outside the 
conference room and at least one was posted inside the room where 
the news conference was held 
shevardnadze said he was moved by his visit to romania and spoke 
with disdain of the deposed leader 
never before have i come to a country with such feelings of 
emotion as after the revolution the only one in eastern europe 
that erupted in bloodshed 
romanias ties with moscow had been strained for decades over 
ceausescus maverick foreign and trade policies and in later 
years his staunch resistance to reform 
dictatorship is not acceptable neither a communist 
dictatorship nor a bourgeois dictatorship shevardnadze said 
i can tell you that after my meetings with ceausescu i always 
went back to moscow with unpleasant feelings he said 
both he and celac denied reports of soviet complicity in the 
romanian revolt there were no contacts before the uprising 
shevardnadze said 
celac added there was no conspiracy there was no plot there 
was no plan or scheme to overthrow ceausescu it was an explosion 
of popular discontent a wave of indignation and revolt 
shevardnadze refused to speculate about the type of government 
romania was likely to have after elections tentatively set for 
april saying this is the decision of the romanians 
moscow will respect whatever system is established he said 
a french weekly on saturday quoted iliescu as denying a rumor 
that he and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev were friends 
dating back to their studies at moscow state university 
i have never met gorbachev the conservative le figaro 
quoted iliescu as saying in an interview in bucharesti never had 
any dealings with gorbachev later either

fifty ku klux klan members and supporters 
gathered peacefully at the state capitol on saturday as 2400 law 
enforcement officers kept about 100 counterdemonstrators safely 
away 
the rally took place at a time when racial tensions in the 
southeast have been exacerbated by four mail bombs directed at 
judicial and civil rights targets the bombs killed an alabama 
federal judge and a savannah alderman 
in the northern suburb of cumming an afternoon rally drew about 
60 klansmen and supporters and about 150 spectators 
the 75minute rally at the capitol came off without incident 
the closest the klan and their opponents got was a half of block 
as both groups left capitol hill following the rally 
at that point the two sides jeered each other with kkk members 
giving nazi salutes opponents who shouted and waved signs no 
peace for racists and stop racist terror tried to push past 
authorities to the klan 
the group then tied a small klan figure to a fence and set it 
afire chanting as the flames engulfed the white cloth 
i think burning a small figure of the ku klux klan is great 
when you think about all the burning images of black people in 
history books said lena shapiro a member of the john brown 
antiklan committee its refreshing 
about a dozen klansmen distributed leaflets at a cumming 
intersection for 2 hours saturday afternoon afterward about 60 
klansmen and supporters gathered at cumming city hall for a 
sixblock march around the courthouse and back to city hall 
according to state officials the lawenforcement officers 
brought in to maintain order in downtown atlanta on saturday 
included 1594 georgia national guardsmen 300 atlanta police 
officers 184 state troopers and 145 agents from the georgia bureau 
of investigation 
civil rights leaders and city officials had urged atlantans to 
stay away from the rally despite an antiklan groups call for a 
counterdemonstration 
the klan rally is not worthy of your attention said mayor 
maynard jackson stay home go shopping rake leaves do 
whatever you do on saturdays leave them alone and let them say 
what they have to say to each other 
but tonyalle ross 23 of atlanta said she could not respect the 
leaders requests to stay home 
if you dont protest whos going to know that youre against 
it she said we cant just sit down and ignore it it gives 
them the feeling of power 
last january a white supremacist rally and march in downtown 
atlanta turned violent as thousands of counterdemonstrators 
gathered to oppose a handful of white protesters 
some in the crowd threw rocks and bottles toward the 
demonstrators and their police and national guard escorts and some 
law enforcement officers fought back in what critics called a 
police riot

the parents of a murder victim said 
saturday they are outraged by a legal system that paroled the 
killer who police say killed their daughter and 10 other women 
he should suffer like my baby did said diane stanisci the 
mother of 29yearold elizabeth gibson hose body was found nov 27 
outside rochester 
arthur j shawcross 44 was charged with murdering eight women 
in the rochester area since march 1988 police say he is linked to 
three other slayings including miss gibsons those will be 
presented to a grand jury 
most of the deaths have been tied to prostitution or drugs most 
of the victims had been strangled 
shawcross settled in rochester after he was paroled from prison 
in 1987 he was convicted of strangling an 8yearold girl in 1972 
in watertown 150 miles northeast of here he served 15 years of a 
25year sentence before he was paroled on his seventh attempt 
the punishment should fit the crime said bruno stanisci 
miss gibsons father i think that after killing that little 
girl his life should have been taken what about the rights of the 
people who are dead 
new york state does not have a death penalty 
police had been investigating the deaths or disappearances of 16 
women but now say that five of the slayings are not related to the 
others 
that hurts me said alnora carter the mother of 27yearold 
jacqueline dicker whose killing last summer has not been linked to 
shawcross 
if they dont find nobody that murdered my daughter i dont 
know what im going to do 
shawcross seemed to be leading a normal life since he was 
released from prison april 30 1987 said edward elwin executive 
director of the states parole division he kept regular 
appointments with parole officers and worked for a food service 
company 
since he was paroled he lived a very conforming life as far 
as parole was concerned elwin said 
police said shawcross became a suspect when investigators in a 
state police helicopter spotted shawcross car close to where a 
victims body was recovered 
elwin said he expects a public outcry over shawcross parole 
but he defended the decision to release shawcross 
if shawcross had not been paroled in 1987 he would have been 
automatically released from prison last year because of good 
behavior during his jail term 
you can say i can hold him for another two years or you 
can say he has been good for 15 years what good will it do to 
keep him two more said elwin 
shawcross pleaded innocent friday to the eight murder charges 
and was ordered held without bail 
i feel better knowing they got him but i dont feel better 
knowing what theyre going to do with him dianne stanisci said 
in a telephone interview 
hes going to go to jail and the taxpayers are going to have 
to support him she said

manuel antonio noriegas federal keepers have 
assured his lawyers he will not be moved from miami any time soon 
so he can assist in his defense against drug charges one of the 
lawyers said saturday 
the deposed panamanian dictator was described as generally 
upbeat during his first weekend in custody us marshals are 
believed to be holding noriega in the federal courthouse downtown 
there was little visible security around the courthouse 
saturday a handful of journalists maintained a vigil there should 
authorities decide to move noriega who walked out of the vatican 
embassy in panama city and into us custody jan 3 after us 
forces invaded panama on dec 20 
noriega attorney steven kollin said marshals assured him and 
others on the defense team that noriega wont be moved from the 
miami area any time soon because they need his help in preparing 
legal motions 
kollin said he and attorney frank rubino dont expect to file 
motions for about 30 days their first will likely seek dismissal 
of the 12count federal indictment that alleges noriega helped 
cocaine traffickers in exchange for millions of dollars 
noriega and his lawyers have spent hours together since he was 
flown thursday from panama to miami the attorneys promised us 
marshals not to disclose noriegas location kollin said 
hes generally upbeat kollin said of his client hes 
working with us in preparations there are certain essential facts 
that we need to go over hes necessary for us to go in the right 
direction 
noriega also faces a separate indictment in tampa 
kollin said he and noriegas other lawyers decided not to answer 
questions from tidbithungry news media such as what noriega had 
for lunch 
noriegas lawyers were not surprised at the results of a poll 
published saturday by the miami herald that indicated a majority of 
area residents already believe noriega is guilty 
of 130 dade county residents interviewed by the newspaper 55 
percent said they believed noriega was guilty 40 percent said they 
had no opinion and 5 percent said he was innocent 
kollin said he doubted other cities were different 
the problem is not a change of venue in this particular case 
what it really comes down to is where do you move it he asked 
i think it was impossible for any citizen of the united states 
unless they were stonedeaf not to have heard of this matter 
the orlando sentinel meanwhile quoted anonymous us officials 
as saying that dozens of spanishspeaking fbi agents were flown to 
panama after the us invasion to check bank accounts of suspected 
american drug dealers 
the newspaper quoted a state department official as saying the 
agents were to review bank records in very specific cases he 
would not elaborate the newspaper said

an american container ship and a 
panamanian tanker collided in nighttime fog 20 miles offshore from 
galveston but no one was injured us coast guard officials said 
saturday 
fuel oil from the margaret lykes a new orleansbased container 
ship leaked slowly from a hole in the port side of the 618foot 
vessel early saturday said lt cmdr frank whipple of the coast 
guard marine safety office at galveston 
the bow of the shoun emperor a 323foot tanker registered in 
panama sustained considerable damage in friday nights collision 
but none of its cargo had spilled whipple said 
the bow of the tank vessel is heavily damaged as you can well 
imagine and the margaret lykes has got a hole on the port side 
whipple said the crews about 50 men remained on the vessels 
neither of which was in danger of sinking 
coast guard officials were en route to the scene to decide if 
the vessels could be returned to the port safely whipple said 
were still assessing the damage to see if they can safely be 
brought back without considerable leakage of fuel oil or the threat 
of spilling cargo from the tanker he said 
whipple said a vessel capable of setting up oil spill 
containment equipment also was en route to the scene but he said 
we are not certain that corralling the leaking fuel oil is 
going to help at this point its very lightweight oil and 
containing it is very difficult to do at sea 
officials believe the tanker was headed south to freeport and 
that the margaret lykes was eastbound possibly returning to 
louisiana

south korea on saturday ridiculed a 
north korean claim that seoul had erected a concrete border wall 
akin to the berlin wall in the korean demilitarized zone 
the south korean defense ministry in a statement accused the 
north of trying to mislead world opinion by creating the false 
impression that the south has built such a barrier 
it is very regrettable that north korea has made a false claim 
that concrete border walls that do not exist must be removed as a 
prerequisite to free travel the statement said 
in a new year speech north korean president kim il sung 
proposed talks on demolishing what he said was a concrete border 
wall in south korea to ensure free travel between the two koreas 
kim said north korea has erected no barriers on its side of the 
dmz and was ready to remove barbed wires which mark a boundary 
communist north korea and the capitalist south divided since 
1945 technically are still in a state of war an armistice rather 
than a peace treaty ended the 195053 korean war 
the two koreas are separated by the 25milewide dmz with the 
demarcation line or the border running through the middle of the 
zone barbed wires mark the boundary the zone must not be 
fortified by either side and only a limited number of lightly 
armed troops are authorized to police either side of the zone 
outside the zone however the border area on both sides is 
sealed and heavily fortified by fences concrete bunkers mine 
fields and hundreds of thousands of heavily armed troops 
even inside the dmz the defense ministry statement said north 
korea has erected five to seven fences including an electric one 
while only a single barbed wire fence has been built along the 
southern edge of the zone to prevent infiltration

an artist called off his plan 
to squash a rat between two canvases saturday when the 55pound 
concrete block that he intended to use was missing angry onlookers 
chased him from the scene 
rick gibson of vancouver told a crowd of about 300 people that 
had gathered for his stunt that someone he believed animal rights 
activists had stolen his concrete block after he loaded it onto a 
truck at his home earlier saturday 
he said he had taken sniffy the rat back to the pet store where 
he had bought him and had no plans to try to restage the event 
sniffy probably will be eaten by a snake the reason he was kept 
at the store gibson said 
gibson then suggested that the crowd in front of the vancouver 
public library disperse some onlookers then rushed toward him and 
chased him to a nearby hotel 
where did the bastard go cried one woman at the hotel 
gibson could be heard telling another to let me go 
about a dozen police then dispersed the crowd 
animal rights activists earlier had tried to have the event 
declared illegal but the society for the prevention of cruelty to 
animals had said there was nothing illegal about killing sniffy 
provided he died a quick and painless death 
before the event gibson had said sniffys remains would create 
a thoughtprovoking diptych 
gibson created a stir in london in 1987 when he made earrings 
out of two dehydrated human fetuses as part of a sculpture he and 
a gallery owner were fined for violations of public decency 
moving to vancouver earlier this year gibson was prevented from 
staging an artistic act of cannibalism when police closed his 
gallery show that featured part of a human testicle obtained from 
a medical supply house that he planned to eat

divers failed again saturday to find a murder 
weapon in one of bostons most baffling and still unraveling crime 
cases as the family of the man linked to his wifes slaying came 
out of seclusion to bury him 
forgive whatever wrongs he may have done said the rev 
richard messina during services for charles stuart we cannot 
explain why the events of the past took place and certainly we can 
never understand them 
about 150 people attended a funeral mass at immaculate 
conception roman catholic church two blocks from stuarts 
childhood home in the north boston suburb of revere stuart 29 
committed suicide thursday as authorities sought to arrest him in 
the shooting death of his pregnant wife 
among the mourners were stuarts parents his two stepsisters 
and three brothers including 23yearold matthew who told police 
wednesday that his brothers story that a mugger shot him and his 
wife was a fabrication 
stuarts mother dot wept as they left the church and matthew 
supported his father charles sr as they left a chapel at 
woodlawn cemetery 
no plot had been designated for stuart and his coffin was not 
expected to be interred until monday his wife carol 30 was 
buried in another boston suburb 
police divers meanwhile searched the pines river in revere for 
the weapon used in the shootings but failed to find it they 
planned to resume their search sunday 
stuart had told police that a mugger forced his way into the 
couples car oct 23 as they were leaving a birthing class at a 
boston hospital 
stuart who was shot in the abdomen used his car telephone to 
call rescuers who listened to sirens on approaching vehicles to 
find their car in the mission hill neighborhood mrs stuart died 
after her child was born prematurely by caesarean section the 
infant christopher died 17 days later 
but last week matthew stuart told police that his brother 
instructed him to meet him in mission hill on the night of the 
shooting he said his brother handed over a bag containing a gun 
and mrs stuarts purse apparently after the shootings had taken 
place 
the snubnosed revolver which matthew stuart said he threw into 
the pines river is believed to be the same gun used to shoot 
stuart and his wife 
with matthew stuarts help authorities have pulled from the 
river a bag containing a gucci bag a wallet and other personal 
belongings of mrs stuart he also turned over mrs stuarts 
engagement ring which her husband had claimed was stolen during 
the reported attack 
police have said the case is still being investigated they have 
refused to comment whether there were any other suspects besides 
charles stuart 
the boston herald reported saturday that a source close to the 
stuart family who was not identified said another person was with 
matthew stuart the night of oct 23 
the newspaper also cited unidentified sources who said charles 
stuart underwent treatment for cocaine dependency while he was 
hospitalized for his gunshot wound prosecutors however have 
insisted that they had no indication that stuart was using drugs 
in a related development mayor raymond flynn said saturday he 
was proposing an investigation into leaks to the media about the 
case from the police department prior to last weeks revelations 
william bennett who is black was named in news reports as a key 
suspect in the crime 
flynn and police have been sharply criticized by leaders of the 
black community who claim that officials were too willing to 
accept the story that a black man had attacked a white suburban 
couple 
flynn said the person who leaked bennetts name to the media 
violated grand jury proceedings and the law and he would recommend 
the persons firing and prosecution if identified 
the police clearly had suspicions he said but added the 
police never said william bennett was the guy 
on saturday the mayor and police commissioner mickey roache met 
with community leaders in the mission hill district and in largely 
black roxbury

a cult leader accused of murdering a 
fivemember family in his flock preached that jesus would return to 
earth and destroy everyone but his followers a minister familiar 
with the cult said saturday 
jeffrey lundgren his wife their 19yearold son and two of his 
followers remained at large saturday but eight others have been 
arrested in the shootings on a farm where the small cult lived 
until april 1989 
dale luffman president of the northeast ohio chapter of the 
reorganized church of jesus christ of latter day saints said 
lundgren worked from 1985 to 1987 at a church temple in kirtland 
about 30 miles east of cleveland 
lundgren once a lay minister of the reorganized church 
conducted tours of the churchs 153yearold temple in kirtland 
when he moved here from kansas city mo luffman said 
lundgren lived on church property until he began preaching 
radical doctrines during tours luffman said he was defrocked and 
left the church with some followers to form his cult in 1987 
luffman said 
several of lundgrens followers who left the cult told 
authorities that the leader had violent beliefs which included 
death threats against members of his flock luffman said 
there were some that dropped out luffman said one 
alerted authorities about things that really scared him 
lundgren preached to his followers who were estimated at more 
than a dozen that jesus would destroy anyone not inside the 
historic kirtland temple where he once worked 
the temple was founded in 1836 by joseph smith founder of the 
salt lake citybased mormon church which shares some beliefs with 
the reorganized church based in independence mo but is not 
affiliated with it 
lundgren named two specific dates when jesus was to return to 
earth but the days came and went luffman said 
when that moment was supposed to occur they were to be in the 
temple only those who got in the temple would be saved and the 
unrighteous would be destroyed luffman said they believed 
that they were the only people god could speak to 
the remains of the family including three daughters were found 
wednesday and thursday buried in a barn on the farm that lundgren 
rented about 1 miles east of this northeast ohio community 
authorities have tentatively identified the five as dennis 
avery 49 his wife cheryl 42 and their three daughters trina 
15 rebecca 13 and karen 7 investigators believe they were 
killed in midapril 
in addition to being shot the victims eyes were covered with 
duct tape and some had their hands and feet bound with duct tape 
kirtland fire chief richard a martincic said saturday 
on friday lake county prosecutor steven c latourette said the 
averys apparently were killed because of lundgrens interpretation 
of a prophecy that members had to be sacrificed before the group 
could relocate to the wilderness 
luffman however said he did not believe the slayings were a 
sacrifice but probably came after a dispute over money sex or fear 
the family would leave the cult 
an eighth cult member was arrested saturday but lundgren his 
wife alice their 19yearold son damon and two other cult members 
remained at large 
sharon bluntschley 31 of independence mo turned herself 
into michigan state police in bay city mich saturday afternoon 
said george rodriguez of the federal bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms 
ms bluntschley is charged with conspiracy and complicity to 
commit murder and kidnapping 
in all 13 people were charged with murder or conspiracy in the 
shooting 
kirtland police chief dennis yarborough said his investigation 
of the house where lundgren lived began in april 1988 when he heard 
reports of paramilitary activity and civil rights violations no 
charges were filed yarborough said 
local businessmen who knew the lundgren family say they seemed 
ordinary 
he lundgren was always fishing and hunting and always had 
people around him said ray byers owner of kirtland hardware 
he was a religious guy when i first knew him he was dressed real 
well 
another kirtland resident doris straka said the lundgrens kept 
to themselves they didnt associate much with the community 
she said 
she said the lundgrens renovated the farmhouse and gave it a new 
coat of paint landscaped the yard revived an orchard and set up 
a gymnasium in the barn where the bodies were found 
lundgren left the area in april 1989 and the cult disbanded 
luffman said 
jeffrey and damon lundgren were charged with five counts each of 
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping alice lundgren was 
charged with five counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder 
five counts of kidnapping and five counts of complicity in the 
commission of aggravated murder

an israeli legislator demanded saturday that 
parliament investigate the role played in panama by mike harari 
who has been identified by us officials as a top aide to gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
yossi sarid of the leftwing citizens rights movement said in a 
statement that an attempt to present harari as an ordinary 
innocent businessman in panamais more ridiculous than 
ridiculous 
there is no doubt that harari was noriegas righthand man 
said sarid a member of the parliaments foreign affairs and 
defense committee he said the committee should investigate 
hararis role in panama 
sarids statement was carried by the national itim news agency 
harari once a senior official at israels mossad intelligence 
agency denied in an israel television interview broadcast friday 
that he had served as security adviser to the dictator 
i want to tell you im not noriegas adviser and have not 
been in the pasti have not been in charge of his business 
affairs i have not been in charge or instructed his forces i have 
not organized his personal security im just a private man who 
deals in trade harari said 
on saturday the television broadcast more of the interview but 
indicated it had been censored 
harari said he arrived in panama by chance in early 1968 
planning to spend 24 to 48 hours in the country 
a jewish friend offered me to meet a young major in this case 
it was omar torrijos herrera harari said adding that torrijos 
was described as a person interested in israel 
harari said he was reluctant but then i was pressured and 
askedand when i met this personality and i stress personality 
chemistry was at work between us and instead of 15 minutes i spent 
seven hours with him we became friends 
several months after this young major was promoted to the rank 
of colonel and then led a coup in october 1968 deposing 
president arnulfo arias harari said 
he said he continued to visit torrijos several times a year 
during one of the visits in 1980 torrijos introduced him to 
noriega shortly after torrijos was killed in an accident and 
noriega came to power three years later 
harari said he voluntarily resigned from israeli government 
service in 1980 and became a private businessman 
when i resigned i decided not to deal with intelligence and 
security because this is what i was doing in the past and not to 
engage in weapons tradei tried to deal in agriculture promote 
housing and trade projects and sell equipment but only civilian 
equipment he said 
harari described his relationship with noriega as friendly 
and said 
i knew noriega as a wise energetic patriotic man a cunning 
man who has an oustanding ability to survive to make friends to 
organize to hold the reigns of power and coordinate state affairs 
noriega is an american creaturethe americans have created 
and developed and raised him noriega was proamerican and still is 
proamerican i think in spite of his present position he said 
harari indicated he thought the united states was behind media 
reports about his involvement in panama which he termed a 
campaign of disinformation and psychological war against me 
he denied newspaper reports about his alleged trips to columbia 
and nicaragua saying he had never visited these countries and 
never supplied israelimade weapons to panama harari also denied 
he knew anything about noriegas alleged drug dealings 
he attacked the media for reporting about his activities with 
the mossad saying the reports could turn him into a target for 
revenge actions

operations when he headed the unit trying to kill the leader of the 
palestinian black september group that massacred 11 israeli 
athletes at the 1972 munich olympics

and an evening at the theater 
the bushes tend to honor such occasions without ballyhoo and do 
not exchange gifts aides said however they said the couple 
agreed to remodel some rooms at their kennebunkport maine home as 
a mutual gift both declined to comment when asked through aides 
for a comment on their 45 years of marriage 
on saturday night they dined with family members and friends at 
the white house and went to the kennedy center to see the play a 
tuna christmas 
when the bushes entered the theater the audience stood and 
applauded enthusiastically bush beaming motioned with his hands 
for everyone to take their seats 
they dont make a big deal out of it one aide said 
the bushes usually spend the weekend at the presidential retreat 
at camp david md but they stayed in washington this weekend in 
part because mrs bush is undergoing 10 days of radiation treatment 
at walter reed army medical center for an eye ailment she suffers 
saturday was her fourth consecutive day of receiving the 
10minute radiation dose which aides say causes her no side 
effects or curtailment of activity 
the eye condition is a result of an immune system affliction 
called graves disease it has caused her months of double vision 
and tearing 
mrs bush took her usual onemile swim in the white house 
outdoor pool on saturday according to her press secretary anna 
perez 
later she looked perky in a festive multicolored dress at the 
theater 
the president spent part of the day working in the oval office 
on friday night the bushes hosted a group of friends to see the 
movie always in the white house theater said perez 
the bushes were teenage sweethearts who married jan 6 1945

defense minister humberto ortega said 
saturday that ciatrained specialized commandos of the contra 
rebels are inside nicaragua and he expects them to increase attacks 
to disrupt elections 
ortega told a news conference that a new years day ambush in a 
remote part of northeastern nicaragua during which two roman 
catholic nuns were killed and a third nun and a bishop were 
wounded was part of a contra pattern of intimidation to 
disrupt the elections feb 25 
the three nuns belonged to the order of st agnes based in fond 
du lac wis one of the victims sister maureen courtney was 
buried friday in her hometown of milwaukee 
contra leaders have denied their men were involved in the attack 
over the last two months very specialized commandos have been 
strengthened and have begun terrorist actions under cover of 
the freedoms of the electoral framework ortega said 
the defense minister who is the brother of president daniel 
ortega said the contras are mounting the terrorist campaign 
because they fear the opposition coalition will lose 
this is the central objective that the mercenaries 
contras under the direction of the cia will develop throughout 
until feb 25 he said 
daniel ortega is seeking reelection as president running 
mainly against newspaper publisher violeta barrios de chamorro who 
is backed by the 14party national opposition union 
the president advanced the election date from november and 
promised the process will be free and fair 
us sen christopher dodd said saturday that observers from the 
united nations told him the electoral process is technically fine 
although there are some problems 
the connecticut democrat winding up a twoday visit did not 
elaborate the campaign has spawned several violent confrontations 
between government backers and opposition activists 
defense minister ortega estimated that some 6500 rebels are 
active inside and outside nicaragua out of a total force of about 
7850 of the total he said about 2600 remain within nicaragua 
and another 4000 are in jungle camps in southern honduras 
those figures conflict with previous government estimates that 
the contras had a total of 12000 fighters 6000 of them inside 
nicaragua 
humberto ortega insisted that as long as we fail to reach a 
negotiated solution to the central american conflict the threat of 
a us invasion to nicaragua remains 
should such an intervention as in panama occur in nicaragua he 
said here the cost would be different its another situation 
and here the people are ready to fight 
it is not logical for the united states to invade nicaragua 
he addmitted but when all the logic indicated that a step like 
that in panama would not be taken against all logic the united 
states did it
