fourteen greenpeace members opposed to ocean 
dumping staged an acrobatic protest during wednesday evenings rush 
hour swinging on ropes beneath the triborough bridge as they 
unfurled a huge banner 
new york ap fourteen greenpeace members swung on ropes 
beneath the triborough bridge on wednesday to protest ocean 
dumping and tied up traffic on the span and on the east river 
below authorities said 
the demonstrators took to the bridge at 545 pm dangling 
above the east river with their banner reading stop ocean dumping 
now said greenpeace spokesman andrew davis 
they hoped to block barges carrying sludge for ocean dumping he 
said but tina casey spokeswoman for the department of 
environmental conservation said no barges were scheduled to depart 
during the protest 
so far it hasnt affected us at all she said 
the protest forced officials to shut down two westbound lanes of 
the bridge which links manhattan and the bronx with queens while 
eastbound traffic was at a near standstill due to rubbernecking 
authorities said 
after more than five hours the protesters remained suspended 
about 100 feet above the water forcing the coast guard to stop all 
traffic on the waterway from passing under the bridge said coast 
guard spokesman joe gibson 
basically were waiting it out said gibson theres not 
too much we can do 
it was the second greenpeace action in as many days aimed 
against the wards island sewage station 
davis said the swinging protesters planned to lower themselves 
and deny access to any sewage barges leaving the station which is 
on the east river island 
on tuesday five members of the worldwide ecological group were 
arrested after they chained a dinghy to the rear of a sewage barge 
with a protester chained to a mooring line for the dinghy police 
said 
that protest delayed the departure of the barge for three hours 
authorities said the barge one of four operated by the city was 
heading to an ocean dumping site 106 miles from new york harbor

the writer just returned from an 11day visit to 
libya her third this year 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
libyas new entrepreneurs gather at the 
bus depot until theres at least five or six of them pile into old 
peugeot station wagons used as a taxis and rumble off to tunisia 
they are taking advantage of a recent relaxation of economic and 
travel restrictions 
after a 95mile drive to the border they can buy japanese 
radios televisions furniture or other goods difficult to find in 
libya batteries watches polo shirts 
they also might do some selling many libyans buy up at 
subsidized prices whatever they can find in the poorlystocked 
state supermarkets and sell to tunisians at a profit 
in a speech to the nation on sept 1 the 19th anniversary of 
his seizing power in a coup moammar gadhafi said libyans could 
become bourgeois as long as they dont accumulate wealth by 
exploiting others a few days earlier he declared that black 
markets were fine because its what the people want though the 
revolution rejects capitalism 
as recently as two years ago what the people wanted seemed to 
count little 
following dramatic drops in crude oil prices in middecade 
libya decided to concentrate its shrinking income on the oil 
industry and the military it left foreign companies with hundreds 
of millions of dollars in unpaid bills and stopped virtually all 
imports of consumer goods 
shoppers waited on bread lines and scoured shelves in vain for 
eggs and cheese soap powder toilet paper and toothpaste were 
scarce even on the black market 
such shortages didnt sit well with libyans who under gadhafi 
had grown accustomed to one of africas highest standards of 
living estimated at 6000 per capita by the middle east economic 
digest 
newspapers carried letters from unhappy libyans consumers stood 
up and complained at local meetings of basic peoples congresses 
the grassroots governing bodies 
making matters worse was gadhafis 1985 order expelling tens of 
thousands of foreign workers under the revolutionary system 
libyans are forbidden to work for other libyans except for 
relatives or in profitsharing jobs in industry suddenly farms 
had no tunisian workers hotels no moroccan waiters 
most foreign businessmen and diplomats who spoke on condition 
of anonymity for fear of reprisal say that gadhafi became worried 
about his popularity especially after the united states bombed the 
cities of tripoli and benghazi in april 1986 to retaliate for what 
washington called his support of terrorists 
last october the border between tunisia and libya was reopened 
allowing workers to return a few months later gadhafi liberalized 
trade between the two countries 
the colonel was obtensibly in quest of unity with his north 
african neighbors but economic needs too loomed large in the 
rapprochement 
in march libyan authorities quietly allowed small businesses to 
import some goods for sale until then what imports were permitted 
arrived through giant state companies gadhafi recently criticized 
these firms as corrupt saying their employees often kept the 
goods especially coveted car parts for themselves and friends 
tunisians now stream into libya their cars loaded with 
foreignmade cigarettes appliances and clothing at tripolis 
souk or traditional outdoor market they elbow for space to 
hawk their wares in streets that were virtually empty of shoppers a 
year ago 
there have been other changes 
before we had to sell everything to the government and wait 
sometimes 20 days or a month for payment said a cloth maker in 
his shop in tripolis main souk now everyone comes to the market 
to buy at 11 am its so crowded you cant even move he says 
down the block a man cooks omelettes at an outdoor table and 
stuffs them into rolls for hungry shoppers two elderly women 
shrouded in white spread out a mat on the ground and sell 
barrettes cologne and imported hand lotion arabic music blares 
from a speaker on one table where tapes by popular western 
performers like madonna and sting are also for sale 
some items are still in short supply chicken seems to be 
everywhere but veal and beef are hard to find 
still the goods in the souk put to shame the socalled 
supersouks the staterun supermarkets the government had hoped 
would put an end to private enterprise 
one day this month grocery shelves of one supermarket were bare 
of meat there was little but soap bars locally produced honey 
imported powdered milk and a counter filled with 45 pound 
packages of finnish edam cheese 
some libyans like one 64yearold taxi driver are cautious 
about their economic future he said he and his 16 children would 
like to open their own business but that he wont invest his 
savings until satisfied that gadhafi wont pull in the reins on the 
freer economy 
meanwhile the nation itself has joined in the wheeling and 
dealing keen on generating an income apart from pumping oil libya 
has invested in a chain of gasoline stations in italy libyas 
largest trading partner it is also reportedly looking into opening 
petrochemical plants in europe

us experts are conducting further analysis 
to assure themselves that the united states did not exceed a 
nuclear testing limit during a joint experiment with the soviets 
last month 
the explosive yield from the aug 17 test was supposed to have 
been about 140 kilotons equivalent to 140000 tons of tnt 
however instruments indicated it may have been as high as 153 
kilotons to 160 kilotons 
the corrtex devices used to measure the force of the blast are 
thought to have a margin of error of 30 percent and assistant 
defense secretary ron lehman said wednesday that preliminary 
analysis indicates the blast actually was below the 150 kiloton 
limit set by the 1974 nuclear threshold test ban treaty 
we are doing some chemical analysis lehman said but all 
the signs that we have are that it was under 150 
lehman spoke as us and soviet scientists were conducting the 
second half of the joint verification experiment which americans 
hope will sell the russians on corrtex a system of measuring the 
size of a nuclear blast by means of a cable sunk adjacent to the 
test site 
the soviets for the first time allowed us government 
scientists to monitor an explosion wednesday at a soviet test site 
and permitted american reporters to cover the event from the scene 
the official news agency tass said the explosion had a force 
of 100 kilotons to 150 kilotons 
if the soviets agree to the use of corrtex in addition to 
seismic devices for measuring superpower nuclear tests the two 
sides are expected to sign protocols to the threshold test ban 
treaty and the related 1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty 
limiting the size of nuclear blasts for engineering purposes

president reagans saturday radio talks which 
started six years ago as a vehicle for him to speak directly to the 
people about his programs are sounding more and more like weekly 
campaign speeches for george bush 
there has been no suggestion that the broadcasts be treated as 
paid political advertisements as they were when reagan ran for 
reelection in 1984 but democrats and republicans agree there has 
been a sharp increase in political content 
it is appropriate to make political remarks in the context of 
government and administration programs says white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater also there is a democratic response 
and a democratic opportunity to make the same kind of remarks 
which they take advantage of 
the president has stepped up the heat on the debate said 
another administration source speaking on condition of anonymity 
he has engaged himself more fully in the political dialogue that 
is going on 
its just not unexpected said a democratic source on 
capitol hill where democrats coordinate their weekly broadcast 
response to the presidents speech 
fitzwater said the big difference between now and 1984 when 
reagans speeches became political ads paid for by the republican 
national committee is that the president is not a candidate for 
reelection this year 
the man who is running for his job vice president george bush 
is getting plenty of help from him however 
his name does tend to pop up in the speeches the 
administration source said 
it popped up seven times for instance on aug 13 when the 
president devoted his speech to a preview of the republican 
national convention 
it popped up twice on july 30 when the president talked about 
his central american policies and mentioned that he and bush had 
both visited ailing salvadoran president jose napoleon duarte in 
his hospital room 
it popped up again last saturday when reagan reviewed 
administration educational policy and said george bush and i 
have been there with a sympathetic ear and a helping hand 
and then there was the labor day weekend address on sept 3 
when the president talked about the administrationbacked job 
partnership training act and threw in the fact that it was 
sponsored chiefly by sen dan quayle the gop candidate for vice 
president 
even when he isnt mentioning anybody by name reagans radio 
words are vintage campaign rhetoric 
on aug 6 he said it was just eight years ago that americas 
defenses were in a pitiable state 
on aug 13 he said some in the other party are talking 
about what they claim theyd do if they were elected well while 
they talk we deliver 
on aug 27 he said before we took office in 1981 the globe 
was reeling from an explosion of international turbulence 
on sept 3 he said that in the year we took office the 
average family made only about 70 percent of what it needed to buy 
a new home today that family makes 110 percent of what it needs 
and it can afford to buy the house 
administration officials maintain that the presidents radio 
speeches are for the most part philosophical rather than 
partisan drawing the line between liberals and conservatives 
rather than lambasting the opposition 
that other party that was in party eight years ago however 
is called the democrats

the agriculture department has moved closer to 
implementing new rules to help thousands of farmers rearrange their 
debts and hang on to their land 
a new interim rule that is a major step in putting into 
effect some of the key provisions of the agricultural credit act of 
1987 was officially published wednesday a step in the federal 
rulemaking procedure 
many of the laws provisions have already been put into effect 
but some including massive writedowns of farmers debts to the 
farmers home administration will take effect this fall 
proposed rules were initially announced may 23 and specified a 
30day period for public comment the next step was adoption of the 
interim rule 
by doing this the farmers home administration served notice 
that it intends to put the new rules into effect in 30 days or on 
oct 14 in addition the agency specified a 60day comment period 
meaning the public can have its say until midnovember before fmha 
makes its decisions final 
meanwhile according to fmha officials the interim rule clears 
the way for agency field offices to begin carrying out some of the 
most important parts of the 1987 credit act including 
restructuring or writedown of debt 
this provision will allow fmha to reduce a farmers delinquent 
debt to the recovery value of the collateral which is usually land 
or farm equipment depending on cash flow and other factors 
a preliminary regulator impact analysis was published by the 
agency last may and a summary of the report was updated and 
included in the interim rule published this week 
the analysis showed that of about 118000 borrowers delinquent 
in early 1986 about 37000 were considered able to resolve 
delinquency through normal servicing actions including 
subordination rescheduling and deferral of debt 
of the remaining 81000 borrowers eligible for consideration of 
restructuring with writedown of debt about 16000 were estimated 
to be able to show they could repay their remaining debt thereby 
qualifying for the writedown 
an estimated 54000 were estimated to be unable to show 
repayment ability and would be rejected for writedown 
the remaining 11000 were said to be ineligible for writedowns 
because their debt was less than recovery value from liquidation of 
their assets 
according to the analysis the loss to fmha could total 27 
billion for writedown of debt owed by the borrowers able to cash 
flow and 67 billion for those unable to qualify however those 
losses could be reduced by an estimated 1 billion through 
provisions allowing fmha to recapture some of the debt 
the agencys document summarized some of the 247 comments 
received after the initial proposal was made last may some of the 
general comments received by fmha included 
i am happy to see that small farmers can have their debts 
written down to where they can handle it and stay in business 
the regulations are unfair to those who have to pay their debts 
in full at higher interest rates 
the regulations are discriminatory 
keeping these farmers in business adds to the surplus on one 
hand while on the other hand the government buys up the surplus 
and supports prices 
credit is too easy the government should foreclose 
many fmha borrowers are poor managers they spend money they do 
not have

the agriculture department says it erred in 
giving out a telephone number for people to call offering comments 
on a proposal to allow a mixture of salvaged meat and bone in 
hotdogs without stating the ingredients on labels 
a terse correction notice by the departments information 
office said wednesday that all comments should be submitted in 
writing by nov 8 
dave warren usda press chief said agency officials were not 
prepared to take oral comments so theyll have to be in writing 
the proposal was announced by usda on monday it would allow 
processors to include a mixture of salvaged meat including small 
bits of bone to be used in up to 10 percent of the meat content of 
hotdogs and similar items without showing the ingredients on 
product labels 
the salvaged product designated as mss or mechanically 
separated species such as pork or beef is made by grinding up 
ribs neckbones and other hardtocarve parts of slaughtered 
animals and forcing the mixture through sieves 
most of the bone particles are screened out but some about 
the size of ground pepper flakes remain in the mixture 
current regulations permit the mss to comprise up to 20 
percent of the meat portion of hotdogs bologna and other sausages 
but the labels must state the contents 
processors who asked for the exemption from the labeling rule 
said they cant sell consumers on the idea of having such a mixture 
in hotdogs under the present labeling requirement 
the written comments can be sent by nov 8 to policy office

an internal review of the red crosss blood 
service regions indicates that more than 2400 blood products were 
released improperly over a sixmonth period 518 of them without 
complete testing for deadly diseases 
the review found no indication that any red cross center 
issued blood for transfusion that had a confirmed positive test for 
aids or hepatitis b said dr s gerald sandler of red cross 
blood services told a news conference wednesday 
despite this he noted that the 518 blood products had been 
issued before all record checks or testing had been completed 
that information was not known at the time of their release and 
the products should not have been released sandler said 
dr ernst r jaffe chairman of the organizations blood service 
committee meanwhile announced that the red cross in compliance 
with the recommendations of its review board signed a voluntary 
agreement with the food and drug administration to help avoid such 
errors in the future 
less than a year ago red cross discovered that the increase 
in the number of tests conducted and blood samples quarantined also 
increased the potential for human error he said 
following the release of improperly tested blood products at 
facilities in washington dc earlier this year the red cross 
committed itself to a national zero error goal and launched a 
nationwide review to determine the extent of these mistakes and 
to develop ways to reduce their potential jaffe said 
the investigation revealed that of 6 million blood products 
576426 were quarantined or destroyed properly while 2420 were 
released improperly including the 518 released before all testing 
was completed he said the sixmonth period when this occurred was 
september 1987 to march 1988 
most mistakes involved donations that tested negative for 
aids but for various reasons were not in compliance with red cross 
or fda directives that require such donations to be quarantined 
andor destroyed victor w schmitt vice president of red cross 
blood services said in a statement 
an example given is the situation in which a donor who 
received previous falsepositive test results gives blood again 
fda and red cross require that any subsequent donations be 
quarantined andor destroyed even when they test negative for aids 
and hepatitis b 
in the cases in which improperly tested blood products had been 
released sandler said the donors were contacted for retesting to 
assure that no tainted blood had been transmitted 
the review found that 88 percent of the mistaken releases were 
concentrated in four red cross regions the carolinas region based 
in charlotte nc the midwest region based in omaha neb the 
missouriillinois region based in st louis and the tidewater 
region based in norfolk va 
the survey also found that serious deviations from fda and red 
cross directives occurred in five regions the midwest region the 
missouriillinois region the carolinas region the tennessee 
valley region based in nashville and the northeastern new york 
region based in albany ny 
meanwhile 26 of the 56 red cross centers were found not to have 
released any blood products improperly another 20 centers had 
fewer than 10 improper releases each with eight of those having 
only one erroneous release apiece 
corrective measures being implemented by the red cross include 
the suspension or replacement of top medical administrative 
personnel 
the institution of a new national clearance system for plasma 
that will recheck each unit prior to processing 
ongoing evaluation and development of improvement in computer 
systems 
retraining staff in fda practices and red cross standards as 
well as specific procedures for laboratory and computer operations 
completing a review of regional standard operating procedures 
with the fda and initiating a further comprehensive review of all 
operating procedures in order to update and advise regions of the 
requirements

nicholas f brady is heading to his first 
international meeting as treasury secretary with the overwhelming 
but not unanimous support of the senate 
brady cochairman of the wall street investment house dillon 
read amp co was confirmed on a 922 vote wednesday by senators 
anxious to give him strong support before next weeks meeting of 
the group of seven composed of finance ministers from the united 
states and its six leading trading partners 
if we did not confirm nick brady he would go with a little 
bit of a cloud over his head said sen bob packwood of oregon 
ranking republican on the senate finance committee 
he was joined in a plea for unanimity by sen daniel patrick 
moynihan dny 
but two democratic senators annoyed by a brady comment that 
they say minimized the seriousness of the federal budget deficit 
declined to join in the bipartisan praise and voted no 
kent conrad of north dakota and harry reid of nevada opposed the 
nomination citing a statement by brady in his confirmation hearing 
tuesday that the federal government could grow its way out of the 
budget deficit 
brady said the deficit needs to be worked down but struck 
an upbeat note by saying i do think we can grow our way out of 
this and adding at another point i see no reason at this 
moment why taxes have to be raised 
mr brady says dont worry well grow out of it well the 
truth is different and the truth will out conrad said in remarks 
on the floor before the vote 
reid did not speak on the nomination but his press secretary 
mary odriscoll said reid was angered by bradys statement that 
we are going to grow out of the deficit he thought that was 
irresponsible and he does not think a treasury secretary should 
believe something like that 
brady after taking office will be the third treasury secretary 
to serve under president reagan donald regan who later became 
white house chief of staff held the cabinet post from 1981 to 
1985 turning it over to james a baker iii who resigned aug 17 
to head republican george bushs presidential campaign 
although brady is expected to do little more than serve as a 
caretaker this year he likely will stay at treasury if bush wins 
in november 
white house spokesman bj cooper said a swearingin ceremony 
for brady had not been scheduled but said it will be soon 
brady a wealthy man who lives on a 4000acre estate in new 
jerseys horse country served eight months in the senate in 1982 
appointed by the governor of new jersey to replace democrat

some of the nations largest airlines have an 
unfair competitive advantage because they own the computer 
reservation systems that travel agents use to book passengers a 
congressional report says 
the general accouting office study released wednesday 
concluded that the department of transportation should try to 
correct the anticompetitive features of the reservation 
systems the gao is congress investigative agency 
chairman norman mineta dcalif whose house aviation 
subcommittee held a hearing on the report criticized the 
transportation department for not acting sooner 
the department appears to be unwilling to take any action on 
computer reservation systems without substantial prodding and 
adverse publicity he said 
the computer systems which the nations travel agents use to 
reserve seats on flights as well as rental cars and lodging are 
owned by some of the nations largest airlines each systems owner 
earns money by collecting a fee from the airline on which a seat is 
selected and by charging travel agents an annual subscription fee 
for use of the computer 
american airlines owns the sabre system which dominates the 
market by garnering 43 percent of the countrys computer 
reservation system revenues united airlines apollo system has 32 
percent of the market pars owned by trans world airlines and 
northwest airlines has 10 percent texas air corps system one 
has 10 percent and delta airlines datas ii has 5 percent 
until the government banned the practice in november 1984 
airlines owning computer reservation systems tended to list their 
own flights first on the display screens making it more likely 
that they would sell more tickets 
but the report cited statistics demonstrating that airlines 
which own computer reservation systems continue to have an 
artificial competitive advantage 
the gao cited a may 1988 transportation department study 
estimating that airlines which own computer reservation systems 
increase their revenues between 9 percent and 40 percent over what 
they would have earned without the computers 
the dot report also said the booking fees charged by the owners 
of the two largest reservation systems about 184 per flight 
are about double the costs the owners incur 
competing airlines who pay the booking fees have little 
alternative to paying those fees if they wish to remain competitive 
in the air travel business gao concluded 
the gao study estimated that in 1986 sabre transferred 343 
million to american airlines from other carriers in fees and lost 
bookings apollo transferred 303 million system one 84 million 
pars 67 million and datas ii 46 million 
these transfers reduce competition in the industry by 
artificially imposing a cost penalty on some carriers and 
subsidizing others the gao report said 
the study also said it is difficult for rival airlines to start 
new computer reservation systems because the contracts travel 
agents sign typically last five years and involve penalties for 
termination 
robert l pettit the transportation departments associate 
deputy secretary said the agency wants to proceed cautiously 
before adopting any regulation that would reduce the vendors 
incentives to upgrade or market their systems or would lead to 
higher costs for participating airlines or subscribers 
american airlines spokesman john hotard speaking from the 
companys offices in fort worth texas said the systems operate 
fairly 
we think the marketplace should be the arena in which this 
battle is fought he said

two strong earthquakes hit japans northernmost 
main island of hokkaido thursday a meteorological agency said 
there were no reports of injury or damage 
the first earthquake struck at 927 am 827 pm edt 
wednesday and was centered off the coast of hokkaidos eastern 
port city of nemuro at a depth of about 30 miles said sotoharu 
taniguchi a seismologist at the sapporo district meteorological 
observatory 
he said a reading on the richter scale was not available but 
added that it registered a 3 on the japanese scale of 7 in nemuro 
608 miles northwest of tokyo 
the epicenter of the second temblor which registered a 5 on the 
richter and hit at 511 am 411 pm edt wednesday was located 
in the southern part of the hidaka mountain range at a depth of 
about 42 miles taniguchi said 
he added that the two quakes were unrelated and the epicenters 
were about 120 miles apart 
a tremor measuring 3 on the japanese scale can shake buildings 
while a 4 will topple vases the scale measures the intensity of an 
earthquake at a particular location and is not convertible to the 
richter scale 
the richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to 
ground motion as recorded on seismographs an earthquake of 5 on 
the richter is considered very strong and a 6 severe 
capable of widespread damage near the epicenter

rice producer and processor groups are calling 
on the government for a major campaign to end japanese trade 
barriers including retaliation if nothing else works 
the time has come for the government of japan to take the 
steps necessary for us to compete in the japanese market sen 
david pryor dark told a news conference wednesday at which the 
request was announced 
rice producer groups petitioned us trade representative 
clayton k yeutter for assistance on grounds that japanese refusal 
to permit rice imports represents an unfair trade barrier 
yeutter must decide within 45 days whether to proceed with the 
case the next step would be negotiation with japan and if that 
failed a request for relief under the 97nation general agreement 
on tariffs and trade a genevabased body that sets and monitors 
international trade rules 
failure in that effort would trigger retaliatory action after 
two years under the new trade law approved by congress and signed 
by president reagan this summer 
the president of japans 55 million member central union of 
agricultural cooperatives mitsugu horiuchi reacted to the us 
industrys action by saying the petition could have a serious 
influence on the political and economic relations between japan and 
the united states 
the move distorts a harmonious agricultural trade climate 
between japan and the us in which the united states has a 
substantial trade surplus said the head of the farm 
organization which is known as the zenchu 
his statement was released in washington by zenchu spokesman 
bill dabaghi who said japan already has made enormous strides 
in opening its agricultural markets by concluding beef and citrus 
agreements with the united states this year 
the zenchu spokesman said the us rice industry had acted 
irresponsibly in raising the issue at the time of a presidential 
campaign and hyperventilating it he said opening the japanese 
rice market to american imports would be a disaster for that 
nations farmers 
japan has been the largest foreign buyer of american farm 
products for more than two decades last year it bought 55 
billion worth and the total for 1988 is forecast at 69 million 
many of these purchases consist of corn and other feed grains 
not grown in large quantities if at all in japan it has set up 
rigid curbs on rice imports to protect its farmers from foreign 
competition 
largescale hightech american farming methods produce rice at 
far below the japanese cost levels if all trade restraints were 
swept away american growers could be expected to command a 
substantial share of the japanese market in short order 
industry officials said rice priced at 300 a ton in the united 
states would cost 2500 a ton in japan 
they told the news conference however that they have no 
intention of trying to wipe out japanese rice farming 
we are not looking for an opportunity to flood the japanese 
market said j stephen gabbert president of the rice millers 
association the group filed the trade petition in a joint effort 
with the rice council for market development a growers group 
the petition seeks to gain 25 percent of the japanese rice 
market in the first of a fouryear phasein and expand to 10 
percent or 1 million tons by the fourth year 
senators from riceproducing states were on hand to push the 
petition with sen pete wilson rcalif declaring the industry 
had tried to get the japanese to import american rice voluntarily 
as always the response has been a virtual stone wall said 
wilson and that is not good enough

massachusetts representative and senator before winning the 
nations highest office in 1960 robert kennedy former attorney 
general and us senator from new york was running for president 
when he was assassinated in 1968 
kennedy campaigned for better and more affordable health care 
better care for the elderly and a crimefree community a campaign 
breakfast sunday attended by his father brother and about 500 
supporters showed that he seems to have a significant following 
among the elderly 
his campaign manager chris nocera mentioned that once kennedy 
was talking to two elderly women who were quite distraught he 
consoled the women and told them to pray on the rosary nocera said 
the religious strength kennedy said is as much a part of him 
as the kennedy name and tradition his grandmother 98yearold 
rose kennedy taught him to have his religious faith above all else 
and if nothing else 
they cant take that away from you kennedy said

michael dukakis his stance on crime under a 
new advertising attack from george bush is responding with a crime 
ad of his own this week and also is airing a new commercial 
promoting his leadership record 
the new ads come at a time when the dukakis advertising team is 
taking on a new look with the executive in charge of john hancock 
insurance cos communications efforts tapped to join the campaign 
and coordinate its advertising efforts 
the new dukakis crime commercial called tough will make 
its debut later this week according to dukakis aides it will 
attempt to counter a new bush commercial attacking dukakis for 
supporting a massachusetts furlough program that until amended 
earlier this year allowed passes to be approved for convicted 
murderers sentenced to noparole terms 
the bush ad began airing this week in california and texas 
which candidate for president can you really count on to be 
tough on crime the announcer in the bush ad asks george 
bush 
dukakis crime ad discusses crimerelated statistics during his 
tenure as massachusetts governor including a 13 percent drop in 
the states crime rate over the past four years a significant 
increase in convictions and jailings of drug dealers and a 20 
percent increase in the number of police in state law enforcement 
agencies 
leadership its getting real results the announcer in the 
dukakis ad concludes 
the other new dukakis ad responsibility began its 
nationwide airing wednesday night 
it also stresses the theme of leadership a line of attack 
dukakis has been using against bush in recent campaign appearances 
michael dukakis balanced 10 budgets in a row and still cut 
taxes five times the announcer in the 30second 
responsibility ad says 
the ad also refers to the rate of personal income growth in 
massachusetts which is twice the national average and the 
governors successful effort to win passage of the first state law 
guaranteeing health insurance to virtually all workers 
thats why americas governors both democrat and republican 
voted michael dukakis the most effective governor in the nation 
the announcer says 
dukakis campaign aides declined to say how much the campaign was 
spending on the new round of ads to be supplemented by a new 
commerical paid for by the democratic national committee 
the naming of john hancocks david dallesandro to head the 
dukakis ad team was characterized by several dukakis aides as a key 
move in an effort to bring more direction to advertising strategy 
the move was orchestrated by john sasso the dukakis confidant 
who recently returned as vice chairman of the democratic campaign 
said dukakis media adviser francis obrien

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen found a piece of his past here in the form of a 
chunk of a b24 bomber mounted on a hangar wall 
bentsen in a campaign speech wednesday at the confederate air 
force reflected repeatedly on how the collection of restored world 
war ii planes brought back memories 
bentsen flew 34 missions in the war in europe although there 
were no b24s on hand when he visited the caf there was a vultee 
bt13 trainer the same type the texas senator used when he was 
learning to fly 
shedding his suit coat for a leather jacket in the moist texas 
heat the 67yearold bentsen climbed into the cockpit and fired it 
up waving from the open canopy as the wind from the prop blew back 
his hair 
i lost my favorite picture of my wife and my wallet flying 
one of these things upside down with the canopy open in alabama 
he recalled 
bentsen then toured the hangar where several planes were in 
various stages of restoration mounted on the wall were the sides 
of old bombers carefully cut to preserve the cheesecake art work 
that graced their flanks 
pinup girls in various stages of undress had titles such as 
night missionsurprise attack and target for tonight 
asked what was on the side of his plane bentsen replied that he 
was a squadron leader and often changed planes one of them was 
double trouble others i dont want to name he chuckled 
bentsen strolled across the hangar to where the display 
continued and it stopped him dead in his tracks 
there it was right near night mission 
double trouble is a painting of twin nude buxom women in a 
swandive from the sky their heads and shoulders back and 
propellers spinning from their thrustout chests 
well ill be damned he said 
could it be from the same plane that bentsen flew more than 43 
years ago 
it looks familiar he said sheepishly 
later on his campaign plane bentsen said he couldnt be sure it 
was the same one but he was glad his wife ba was campaigning 
elsewhere at the time

studying the crowds at political events isnt a very scientific 
measure of how a candidate is doing but its a lot more 
entertaining than political polls 
sometimes the reaction is more news than the candidate such as 
when bentsen was booed by the veterans of foreign wars when he 
mentioned the name of his running mate democratic presidential 
nominee michael dukakis 
other times on the bentsen campaign the heckling and protest 
signs seem less ominous and can be downright funny 
who the hayle is quayle protested a placardwaving iowan 
when bentsen spoke in amana last week 
students at virginia tech from both sides of the political 
spectrum came to hear him speak it was hard to tell the fans from 
the foes 
bimbo and lloyd go for the gold as one sign read seemed 
to imply indiscretions but it was a compliment bimbo being a 
virginia tech star athlete on his way to the olympics 
lloyd dude was a favorite of young democrats while 
avoid the lloyd was brandished by the gop troops political 
science club welcomes sen bentsen was a sign that upheld 
tradition 
the audience at a rally near detroit repeatedly called for 
bentsen to kiss his wife ba while they snapped pictures the 
courtly texan obliged but mrs bentsen confided later he just 
wanted to run from the room 
in the middle of a speech in san diego bentsen was giving his 
stock stump speech attacking president reagans veto of the trade 
bill 
and do you know why he vetoed that bill he asked 
rhetorically pausing 
because hes a bum shouted someone in the crowd

polls inaugurating the fall presidential race 
give the early advantage to george bush indicating he has seized 
the agenda in the campaigns final stretch but his lead pollsters 
warn is tenuous 
surveys this week found bush delineating key issues and boxing 
michael dukakis into a defensive corner some put the race at a 
tie two polls found an eightpoint bush lead on the issues 
analysts said bush was stronger 
bush has control of the agenda and he is setting the tone of 
the campaign at least for now kathleen a frankovic pollster 
for cbs news said wednesday his attacks are hurting dukakis 
but frankovic and others said the very factors that allowed bush 
to turn the tables on dukakis make his current lead precarious 
voters choices remain unusually tentative making rapid changes 
possible 
its all very volatile its still to be won or lost said 
humphrey taylor president of louis harris amp associates even if 
bush was to go 10 or 12 points ahead it would not mean he is 
certain to win by any means 
taylor cited two chief reasons voters are less tightly 
constrained by party loyalty than ever before and neither bush nor 
dukakis has engendered either strong attachments or strong 
antipathy 
one measure was a gallup poll this week that found just 38 
percent of the voters with a strong preference for either 
candidate at this time in 1984 by contrast 49 percent had strong 
feelings for the nominees 
and in this weeks cbs newsnew york times poll almost 40 
percent of the voters are undecided or say their minds could still 
change frankovic said thats a lot of people 
although bush led dukakis by eight points in the cbstimes and 
gallup polls the share of voters saying they strongly supported 
the republican was down in gallups survey from 27 percent last 
month to 21 percent now 
he has widened the gap but he has widened the gap with soft 
support said larry hugick political pollster for the gallup 
organization so even though he has a wider lead over dukakis he 
hasnt built a solid lead 
unsettled opinions can make polls results more sensitive to 
differing survey techniques los angeles times cnnusa today and 
roper organization polls released this week found statistical dead 
heats and the latest poll an abc newswashington post survey 
conducted sept 7 through tuesday put the race at 48 percent for 
dukakis to 45 percent for bush another dead heat based on a margin 
of error of 3 percent 
more significant than any numerical advantage were gauges 
indicating bush has taken control of campaign issues he outscored 
dukakis on defense and foreign policy gained with the pledge of 
allegiance issue challenged the democrat on the environment and 
even won on competence an issue dukakis had sought to make his own 
what we see in these latest surveys is a consequence of 
relatively extensive campaigning by bush and therefore more 
press coverage said michael traugott another gallup pollster 
he has had success in elevating his visibility and in also 
structuring the agenda discussed in the media 
bushs approach in some cases has reached beyond the media to 
the voters an example is his criticism of dukakis for vetoing a 
bill requiring teachers to lead pupils in the pledge three in 10 
voters in the gallup poll said they liked dukakis less for his 
handling of the issue and the cbstimes poll also found support 
for bushs position 
bush also showed gains with his ideological assault on dukakis 
only 15 percent in the cbstimes poll called themselves liberals 
the lowest share in more than a decade while 37 percent called 
dukakis a liberal 
the gallup poll found that bushs support was based more on 
policy agreement and less on party loyalty than was dukakis 
another sign that bushs message has worked to greater effect and 
the polls gave dukakis his highest unfavorable ratings of the 
campaign 
although the surveys indicated a reversal of fortunes for 
dukakis who led by as many as 18 points less than two months ago 
pollsters stressed that the race could swing again either on 
tactical moves or on events such as the debates scheduled for next 
month 
bush has the edge but there is plenty of volatility here 
said hugick the gallup pollster until we see a firming up of 
the vote we have to be very cautious about reading too much into 
that lead

costandini cosma says her eyesight was so poor 
she could hardly see before the virgin mary began weeping at 
st nicholas albanian orthodox church now her eyes feel much 
better 
i believe the 74yearold parishoner said wednesday 
she believes the icon that appears to be shedding tears rewards 
those who have faith and like thousands of others she has stood 
in line for hours to get a look at what st nicholas pastor calls 
a phenomenon a miraculous sign 
its the second time the icon shows wet streaks under the eyes 
the first time started in december 1986 and lasted seven months 
attracting millions to the small 17pew church on chicagos 
northwest side 
last week a man who entered the church to pray spotted the 
streaks 
we had just finished a prayer service and i was in the banquet 
hall said the rev philip koufos the pastor he came running 
in saying he saw something strange in the eyes 
we feel very blessed said koufos the mother of god is 
saying im still with you 
the church is open only three days a week and despite the 
interest in the icon koufos says he has no plans to extend the 
hours as he did in 1987 
so at 10 am on wednesday saturday and sunday the line starts 
at the altar rail and snakes to the back of church through the 
vestibule and into the adjacent banquet hall 
when the viewer gets to the rail the icon hangs about 10 feet 
away behind a plexiglass shield an usher helps visitors get the 
best angle to see what koufos calls the trickles of tears 
after a few seconds another viewer steps up 
people sometimes go around a number of times koufos said 
some stay in the church for hours 
they come for all sorts of reasons he added some come 
looking for consolation contrition out of curiosity for every 
possible reason some are looking for cures 
the queue has parents carrying children people toting bibles 
and the devout clutching basil leaves an albanian orthodox 
practice all bear a desire to witness what most consider a bizarre 
yet pious mystery 
i believe it said eleanor chiczewski of elmwood park i 
need help i came here hoping she could help me im roman catholic 
but its god jesus and mary its all the same 
patricia slove 22 of chicago considers the tears a miracle 
when i came here i saw a streak she said on tv i saw a 
stream of water maybe she was crying harder then its a mystery 
to me why is there glass in front of her is it for reflection 
you cant study it they move you right along 
dorothy duke of niagara wis stopped at the church while 
visiting her sister 
not for any deep faith experience ms duke 54 explained 
but i had hoped to feel a little different maybe ill come 
back 
a collection basket is kept at the rear of church and all 
donations go to the poor koufos said many people drop dollar 
bills at the altar rail after viewing the icon 
in 1987 when the tears lasted more than half the year an 
archbishop of the eastern orthodox faith visited the church and 
pronounced the weeping an inexplicable sign of religious 
importance 
koufos says the icons significance is mostly personal 
determined by the people who pass through the church 
i see miracles all the time on peoples faces its 
beautiful he said i feel the mother of god is preparing us 
strengthening us for something its a very positive thing

drama was unfolding at the site of the high point of his pilgrimage 
the popes strange odyssey began 75 minutes after takeoff from 
gaborone botswana when the air zimbabwe boeing 707 taking him to 
tiny lesotho an enclave surrounded by south africa gave up 
efforts to land at the airport in maseru 
circling and bumping in clouds so thick they covered the 
wingtips the airliner carrying reporters and the papal party 
veered west at 7600 feet over maseru and climbed back to cruising 
altitude 
its johannesburg announced vatican spokesman joaquin 
navarro walking to the back of the plane 
in the not too distant future navarro added jokingly 
making a change in the advance text of a papal speech in which the 
pontiff said he was looking forward to visiting south africa soon 
in the prepared address which was to have been delivered 
wednesday afternoon in lesotho the pope said he was confident that 
all those in a position of responsibility will continue to 
promote a climate that will make such a visit truly fruitful for 
all the people of south africa 
the pope is a vocal opponent of south africas policies of 
apartheid under which the countrys black majority has no say in 
national affairs 
navarro said the pope who was reading a book of philosophy when 
informed of the flight change smiled and remarked this was not 
on the schedule 
after nearly two hours the plane landed at jan smuts airport 
outside joahnnesburg and capt robin cartwright a zimbabwean 
provided an explanation over the loudspeaker 
cartwright said he found out after takeoff that the two radio 
beacons at maseru airport were out of order any descent without 
instrument assistance to the airport situated in a bowl surrounded 
by mountains of 30004000 feet would have been perilous he said 
the pilot had told reporters the night before that he had never 
landed at maseru 
cartwright said he first considered maputo the capital of 
mozambique which the pope will visit friday as well as manzini 
in swaziland but both were also plagued by bad weather 
the gaborone airport was reporting worsening weather and the 
only airport with safe landing facilities nearby as the fuel level 
was dropping was johannesburg he said 
in the meantime south african officials who in august had 
unsuccessfully suggested the pope celebrate a mass during a 
technical stopover at jan smuts midway through the fivenation 
trip quickly moved into action 
security forces with telescopic rifles and machine guns 
surrounded the boeing 707 foreign minister pik botha rushed from 
pretoria to the plane for a formal greeting and a teasipping 
briefing with the pope in the vip lounge to discuss the evolving 
hijack drama in lesotho 
in a noticeable departure from custom john paul did not kiss 
the ground in johannesburg and he made no public statements there 
after less than three hours in johannesburg authorities had 
rounded up a dark bulletproof limousine three buses and six 
whiteandorange traffic police cars with flashing lights and 
sirens for the 270mile drive to lesotho 
helicopters whirred over the convoy while roads and highways 
were sealed off by soldiers or police along the way in an 
astonishing display of military organization as the convoy first 
skirted the skyscrapers of johannesburg then sped through the 
prairies of the orange free state 
after dark the convoy crossed a narrow bridge over the caledeon 
river into lesotho and john paul was greeted by hundreds of people 
wrapped in traditional multicolored blankets ululating in 
highpitched shrieks of welcome 
the pope arrived in maseru just 20 minutes before police stormed 
a bus loaded with nuns and other pilgrims that had been hijacked by 
gunmen who demanded to meet john paul and lesothos king 
authorities said three hijackers and a hostage were killed in 
the action which ended a twoday hostage crisis

the sponsor of legislation authorizing the 
united states to negotiate with mexico over cleaning up the rio 
grande says hes optimistic the mexican government will support 
stopping the largescale dumping of raw sewage 
the bill cleared the senate foreign relations committee on 
wednesday if passed by the full senate without amendment it would 
go to president reagan for his signature 
rep e kika de la garza dtexas author of the bill 
which passed the house last fall said he met with officials in 
mexico a week ago and they assured him of their cooperation 
his counterparts in mexico expressed an interest and will be 
recommending positive action on an agreement to both the incoming 
and outgoing presidents as soon as passage i hope within 60 days 
to have ready for presentation a cleanup proposal to the 
president of mexico hopefully nuevo laredo will be the first 
project de la garza said 
under the bill the state department acting through the head of 
the us international boundary water commission would negotiate 
with mexican officials to find ways to clean up the rio grande and 
make recommendations on building treatment facilities 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas said 25 million gallons of raw 
sewage is dumped daily into the rio grande at nuevo laredo across 
the border from laredo texas 
the large volume of raw sewage garbage and industrial wastes 
routinely dumped into the river has so polluted the rio grande that 
it will take unusual and substantial efforts to sanitize it 
bentsen said in a statement 
the most distressing problem is that every day at several 
points along the border tens of millions of gallons of raw 
untreated sewage is dumped into the river bentsen said 
sen phil gramm rtexas called the bill a solid first step 
although he had sought a more comprehensive approach

fbi director william sessions says top bureau 
officials will face disciplinary action if there are more abuses of 
the kinds that occurred in a terrorism probe of opponents of the 
reagan administrations central american policy 
sessions disciplined six lower and midlevel bureau personnel 
wednesday but he told the senate intelligence committee that 
under the procedures that were in place at the time 
higherlevel officials had no reasonable way to know the bureau 
was collecting information on administration opponents whose 
activities had nothing to do with terrorism 
during the probe of the committee in solidarity with the people 
of el salvador there was no requirement that higher level 
officials be advised when certain investigative activities were 
being used said sessions 
he said the activities include surveillances at public rallies 
and attendance at meetings 
in the future he said higherlevel officials will be required 
to determine whether a particular investigation merits the use of 
techniques that have the potential for infringing on constitutional 
rights 
sources familiar with the action by sessions identified five of 
those being disciplined as gary penrith deputy assistant director 
of the fbis intelligence division and former assistant special 
agent in charge of the dallas fbi office stanley klein special 
agent in charge of the new haven conn office and former head of 
the terrorism section at fbi headquarters george van balen chief 
of the international terrorismglobal unit at fbi headquarters in 
washington ronald davenport a supervisory special agent in the 
washington headquarters and parks stearns a supervisory special 
agent in dallas another supervisory agent in washington also was 
disciplined 
sessions said that under revamped procedures in the future i 
would think highlevel personnel would face discipline if similar 
problems arise 
the investigation of allegations that leaders of a group in the 
united states were supporting terrorism in central america was 
unnecessarily broadened in october 1983 to encompass all 180 
chapters of the committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador sessions testified 
he said there were 178 spinoff investigations from the cispes 
probe focusing on nine other groups and 169 people the cispes 
investigation and spinoff probes ended in june 1985 a year after 
the bureau concluded that its main informant in the case frank 
varelli was unreliable 
the cispes investigation was an aberration an unfortunate 
aligning of mistakes in judgment at several levels that 
cumulatively led to an investigation of which the fbi is not 
proud sessions said 
there was no reason to believe that all cispes members 
nationwide knew of or had any involvement in support of el 
salvadoran or us terrorists testified sessions the decision 
to widen the investigation was made at a comparatively low level 
and supervisory personnel at fbi headquarters who should have 
reviewed and analyzed this decision and appreciated its 
significance failed to do so 
he called for a redrafting of the attorney generals guidelines 
on international terrorism investigations which he said dont 
describe the extent to which leaders and rankandfile members of 
groups in the united states may be investigated 
he said that in the cispes probe the most critical area 
requiring attention was how to conduct investigation of groups 
where legitimate first amendment activities were being undertaken 
by the rankandfile members 
sessions instructed additional training for agents on how to 
deal with activities protected by the first amendment

a house antidrug initiative is moving toward 
a zero tolerance policy as lawmakers tack on amendments that 
stiffen penalties for recreational drug use 
the house sent its latest message to drug users wednesday 
passing an amendment that would subject anyone possessing 
personal use amounts of illegal drugs to civil penalties of 
10000 per violation 
the vote was 293115 with 128 democrats and 165 republicans 
supporting the proposal there were 112 democrats and three 
republicans in opposition 
as house members began wading through changes to the drug bill 
last week they signaled that any drug use was intolerable in the 
first test of this policy lawmakers voted 33567 for an amendment 
that would deny many federal benefits to those convicted of two 
drug offenses including possession 
still to come is a proposal that would deny states a portion of 
their federal highway money if they fail to take away drivers 
licenses of those convicted of one drug offense the initial 
conviction would bring a sixmonth suspension while repeat 
convictions within a fiveyear period could bring revocation for a 
year 
the theme of this years drug bill is user accountability 
rep hamilton fish rny said in support of the civil fines 
amendment sponsored by rep mickey edwards rokla 
the overall antidrug legislation would add some 2 billion to 
the 39 billion federal effort to combat illegal drugs it 
includes money and programs for law enforcement education 
treatment rehabilitation and virtually every other avenue to try 
to stem both the supply of drugs and demand for them 
the house likely will complete the legislation next week the 
senate has yet to begin consideration of its own major antidrug 
bill 
the civil fines envisioned in the edwards amendment would not 
replace current criminal penalties for possessing marijuana 
cocaine or other drugs the justice department would set the 
amounts of drugs that would trigger the civil penalty 
in the major difference between civil and criminal cases a 
defendant in a civil proceeding needs only to be found guilty by 
clear and convincing evidence this is a far easier burden for 
the government than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard it 
must prove in a criminal case 
in assessing the penalties the justice department would take 
into account an individuals income and net assets 
after a penalty was proposed the defendant could ask for an 
administrative hearing and also could appeal to a federal court 
the reagan administration coined the term zero tolerance to 
emphasize its policy that drug possession is as unacceptable as 
drug dealing 
supporters of the civil fines said their amendment was needed to 
enforce such a policy because overburdened prosecutors and 
overcrowded prisons cannot handle criminal cases involving 
personal use possession cases 
nobody thinks its worth taking them to court edwards said 
calling the amendment a response to a sense of frustration in 
america the inability of our criminal courts to effectively stop 
drug use 
rep william j hughes dnj chairman of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on crime opposed the amendment saying it would 
either have the effect of decriminalizing drug possession or 
abandoning the criminal justice system 
weve told our children possessing drugs is a crime he 
said what message are we sending in the edwards approach its a 
confusing signal we are saying its an administrative matter

white house aides believed president reagan 
was so depressed and inattentive in the midst of the irancontra 
scandal that the possibility of invoking the 25th amendment to 
remove him was raised to former chief of staff howard baker jr 
the los angeles times reported 
former white house aide james cannon confirming reports in a 
new book said in an interview wednesday that he wrote a march 1 
1987 memorandum on the aides concerns 
the amendment added to the constitution in 1967 provides the 
president may be removed if the vice president and a majority of 
the cabinet declare him unable to discharge the powers and duties 
of his office 
baker with cannon and two of his own aides spent part of a day 
observing reagan before concluding the president was competent to 
perform his duties according to the book 
baker later said that even though he accepted cannons concerns 
as legitimate he never seriously considered invoking the 25th 
amendment 
i didnt take cannons memo lightly baker said in the 
interview but from the first time i saw him reagan he was 
fully in control and i never had any question about his mental 
competence 
the white house refused to comment the times reported 
the existence of cannons memo is reported in landslide the 
unmaking of the president 198488 by jane mayer a wall street 
journal reporter who covered the reagan white house and doyle 
mcmanus a los angeles times reporter who has covered the 
irancontra scandal 
even more chilling was the portrait that white house aides drew 
of reagan himself cannon told the authors of landslide 
they told stories about how inattentive and inept the 
president was he was lazy he wasnt interested in the job they 
said he wouldnt read the papers they gave him even short 
position papers and documents they said he wouldnt come over to 
work all he wanted to do was to watch movies and television at 
the residence 
cannon told the times that he interviewed 15 to 20 white house 
officials including senior aides and the overwhelming 
majority painted that portrait 
landslide reports that baker on the weekend before becoming 
chief of staff early in 1987 sent longtime aides cannon and thomas 
griscom to look into reports of white house disorder in the wake of 
the irancontra scandal 
cannon and griscom were shocked by what they found chaos 
cannon reported in his memo to baker 
cannon who had served as an aide to vice president nelson a 
rockefeller and as domestic policy adviser to president gerald r 
ford that he began his memo to the incoming chief of staff with 
this startling recommendation 
1 consider the possibility that section four of the 25th 
amendment might be applied 
at a meeting in the white house on march 2 baker cannon 
griscom and baker aide ab culvahouse bracketed reagan at the 
cabinet table so they could watch his every move to cannons 
surprise reagan seemed attentive and alert charming and glib 
the same ronald reagan he had known for years

senate democrats are calling on republican 
presidential candidate george bush to reverse course and support 
strong economic sanctions legislation against whitedominated south 
africa 
just barely overcoming solid opposition from republican members 
the senate foreign relations committee sent the sanctions bill to 
the full senate on wednesday on a 109 party line vote 
the bill would impose a trade embargo against south africa and 
require the withdrawal of most us business investment until that 
nation ends its apartheid system of forced racial separation 
a much milder sanctions bill was passed over president reagans 
veto two years ago but the republicans who supported that step 
apparently will refuse to embrace the present legislation 
republicans have insisted democrats are pushing sanctions 
legislation in an election year to gain political advantage for 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
sen edward m kennedy dmass quickly moved to cast the issue 
in political terms and called for bush to support the bill 
were not trying to embarrass the republicans they are 
embarrassing themselves and embarrassing the united states as 
well kennedy told reporters 
kennedy said bush has undergone a number of electionyear 
conversions during the campaign citing the candidates 
apparently changed positions on day care and increasing the minimum 
wage 
we have welcomed these electionyear conversions on the part 
of mr bush kennedy said we would certainly welcome his 
support on this measure he has indicated he wanted to broaden his 
mandate he now has an excellent opportunity to speak to that 
measure were asking for his help and support on this issue 
bush has opposed sanctions as unlikely to bring change in south 
africa and as a step that would remove all us influence on the 
south african government the 1988 democratic platform labels south 
africa a terrorist state and dukakis has supported a sanctions 
policy 
sen alan cranston dcalif a principal author of the 
sanctions bill told reporters that if republicans maintain a solid 
front against the measure it will be difficult to cut off a 
threatened filibuster against it or to override a nearcertain veto 
by reagan should it clear the senate 
so far only one republican sen lowell weicker of connecticut 
has announced support for the sanctions measure 
cranston said the senates democratic leadership might consider 
attaching the sanctions bill as an amendment to some other 
legislation in an effort to assure there is a recorded senate vote 
on sanctions before congress adjourns next month 
asked about the prospects for the bill cranston replied im 
hopeful but i make no predictions until i ascertain that we have a 
solid republican party against this action if discipline is 
enforced on republican senators we have a problem 
the bill would force american companies to withdraw from south 
africa six months to a year after its enactment it imposes a ban 
on exports to and imports from south africa with the exception of 
a list of strategic minerals

a memory enhancing medicine derived from a 
chinese plant has been reproduced in us laboratories and holds 
promise for the senile and victims of alzheimers disease 
scientists say 
this is not a cure cautioned alan p kozikowski professor 
of chemistry and behavioral neuroscience at the university of 
pittsburgh 
its one hurdle in the path to trying to find something that 
can be used in treating this disease and helping to alleviate some 
of the symptoms 
for centuries the chinese have brewed tea from the leaves of 
the plant huperzia serrata and served it to the elderly to 
improve their memory 
in 1986 scientists at chinas shanghai institute of materia 
medica isolated the specific compound in the plant responsible for 
improving memory since then us researchers have been trying to 
synthesize the compound an alkaloid known as huperzine a 
kozikowski said he succeeded last week 
the synthesis is particularly important because we can attempt 
to improve on nature we should be able to make something better in 
terms of its ability to get into the brain and work on specific 
enzyme systems he said 
zaven khachaturian director of the national institute on 
agings office of alzheimers disease research said kozikowskis 
discovery is encouraging 
anything thats done on this type of identification of plant 
material to improve memory would make a significant contribution to 
alzheimers disease said khachaturian whose agency is financing 
kozikowskis research 
the disease is such a devastating disease if you can keep 
somebody out of the hospital for even six months or a year its a 
major achievement 
an estimated 25 million americans suffer from alzheimers and 
most are older than 60 according to the alzheimers association 
about 100000 people die annually as a result of the disease 
there is no known cause or cure for the progressive 
degenerative illness which attacks the brain and results in 
impaired memory thinking and behavior researchers suspect as 
culprits genetic predisposition virus or other infectious agents 
and environmental toxins 
a new experimental drug to help alzheimers patients known as 
tetrahydroaminoacridine or tha is being tested at 16 us 
research centers preliminary results of the drugs safety and 
effectiveness are expected early next year khachaturian said 
kozikowski said huperzine a like tha blocks the enzyme 
responsible for breaking down a primary neurotransmitter in the 
brain known as acetylcholine this neurotransmitter is deficient in 
alzheimers patients whose brain cells gradually die 
to enable a cell on the verge of dying to live longer or 
function normally even for a brief period thats a tremendous 
gain khachaturian said 
you help the neurotransmitter thats left there to work a 
little bit better help alleviate symptoms kozikowski said in 
many cases thats the best one can hope for 
while more potent than tha huperzine a appears to be less toxic 
and remains active longer in the brain kozikowski said side 
effects of tha include dizziness and nausea also present in 
huperzine a but in lesser amounts 
chinas natural plant compound has been tested there on 200 
people with impaired memories according to kozikowski the chinese 
reported the subjects memories improved significantly 
improvements also were reported in tests on rats and monkeys in 
the united states and switzerland 
the synthesized compound will be tested in this country on rats 
and other animals before being tried on humans said kozikowski 
kozikowski is synthesizing other compounds that he said one day 
may help prevent alzheimers disease huntingtons disease and 
other neurodegenerative disorders and even improve the memory of 
healthy individuals 
it sounds a little bit like fantasy he said but theres 
good reason to imagine you can do this

one year after a navy f14 tomcat shot down an 
air force reconnaissance jet the navy released an investigative 
report that blames the accident on a basic error in judgment 
and an illogical act by the young fighter pilot 
the report recently declassified under the terms of the freedom 
of information act was obtained wednesday it tracks the findings 
of a previously released air force inquiry into the sept 22 1987 
loss of an rf4c reconnaissance jet over the mediterranean sea 
the two air force crewmen managed to eject and parachute to 
safety but their twinengine jet blew up and was lost at sea it 
was shot out of the sky by an f14 assigned to the carrier saratoga 
like his air force counterpart the navy investigating officer 
capt jw lovell concluded the navy and air force aviators had 
been engaged in a routine exercise right up to the second the 
f14s pilot armed and fired a live sidewinder missile 
the pilot lt jg timothy w dorsey was 25 at the time and a 
rookie fighter pilot with just 245 hours of flight time in the f14 
lovell found that even though dorsey earlier that day had 
concluded the rf4c was a friendly plane and knew he was on an 
exercise he reacted to a radio command from his carrier 
authorizing a simulated attack by doing the real thing 
the september 22 1987 destruction of usaf rf4c was not 
the result of an accident but the consequence of a deliberate 
act the investigator wrote his dorseys subsequent reaction 
to the radio command demonstrated an absolute disregard of the 
known facts and circumstances 
he failed to utilize the decisionmaking process taught in 
replacement training and reacted in a purely mechanical manner the 
performance of lieutenant timothy w dorsey on september 22 1987 
raises substantial doubt as to his capacity for good sound 
judgment 
the investigators findings were accepted by rear adm jeremy 
boorda who ordered the inquiry 
the investigating officer and endorsers of this investigation 
are faced with attempting to precisely determine the reason for 
what amounts to an illogical act boorda who was then the 
commander of cruiserdestroyer group eight said in a statement 
accompanying the report 
what remains is an act by a pilot who for a moment left the 
exercise world he was a part of and reacted in a rote manner to 
what he perceived as an order to actually destroy an aircraft that 
moments before he believed to be a friendly 
vice adm kendall e moranville until last month the head of 
the us 6th fleet agreed we necessarily rely on the 
selfdiscipline and judgment of pilots to prevent such incidents 
we have no other choice nothing in my opinion can mitigate 
lieutenant dorseys basic error in judgment 
dorsey was transferred to a job ashore after the incident and 
disciplined with an order that will prevent him from ever flying a 
navy plane again 
the investigative report and written endorsements up the 
chain of command also disclose that in the wake of the accident 
the navy ordered f14 pilots to verbally advise their radar 
intercept officers whenever they have armed the planes weapons 
the radar intercept officer flying with dorsey didnt know the 
pilot had actually armed his missiles and was no longer just 
pretending to shoot 
the report further shows that new steps were taken in the wake 
of the affair to ensure that navy fighters wouldnt be launched off 
carriers for war games with air force jets carrying live weapons 
the navy already had a directive in place to that effect and 
moranville faulted the top officers of the saratoga for the 
failure to comply with the clear terms of the exercise operations 
order

republican presidential nominee george bush 
wooed hispanic and asian voters wednesday with a pitch on 
patriotism and a declaration that only one man can carry 
americas peace and prosperity into the 1990s 
at a colorful rally in a chinatown park bush said i am here 
to tell you that i am that man 
a noisy band of demonstrators heckled the vice president 
chanting down with bush and carrying signs opposing offshore 
oil drilling bushs supporters far outnumbered the protesters 
the crowd included a buddhist monk described as the great 
master who blessed bush there also were young men dressed in 
costumes of yellow and red dancing dragons they were accompanied 
by youths whose drums and cymbals helped drown out the protesters 
but at union square across the luxury st francis hotel where 
bush was to deliver a speech about 400 demonstrators gathered 
some pushed over police barricades spilling out into the street 
stopping automobile traffic and the citys famed cable cars 
the protesters chanted wheres george and money for aids 
stop the war us out of el salvador police said at least one 
person was arrested 
at a 1000perperson fundraiser tuesday night bush said the 
united states should seek continued economic prosperity for reasons 
other than riches it is legitimate to ask what is the end 
purpose of economic growth is it just to be rich what a shallow 
ambition is there really any satisfaction to be had in being the 
fattest country 
he said prosperity would bring greater strides in the arts and 
sciences and things of the spirit but it also means just giving a 
helping hand to a fellow citizen who needs it 
in unusually poetic comments bush attempted to elaborate on his 
vow to make america a kinder gentler nation he told the 
gathering he is almost haunted by the lives being lead by the 
children of our inner cities but he said government cant solve 
their problems and that he hoped as president he could be a 
gentle persuader to rally our people to help our children 
bush began the day campaigning at a mexican restaurant in los 
angeles and then flew to the san joaquin valley to visit the 
sunmaid growers cooperative of raisin producers 
in los angeles he credited the reagan administration with 
restoring pride in the united states and said sales of american 
flags have been booming since the democrats left the white house 
in chinatown democrats distributed fortune cookies with 
messages reading vote dukakis and where was george a 
refrain made popular at the democratic national convention 
using a similar tactic bushs hosts gave him a huge fortune 
cookie with a message reading november brings good fortune 
bush said the election poses a key choice you can choose to 
keep going with the policies that have launched the longest period 
of economic growth in history or you can choose to go backwards 
he said 
and you can choose a candidate with experience and leadership 
to keep democracy on the move or you can choose one who lacks 
experience in foreign affairs bush said only one man is 
pledged to build a better america through low taxes and high 
opportunity and only one man wants laws against crime tougher 
laws and creative programs for our schools 
only one person only one person can carry americas peace 
and prosperity into the 1990s 
earlier bush tried to win votes from farmers and growers in the 
central valley bush said he opposed the grape boycott which has 
been led by cesar chavez to protest alleged exposure of workers to 
pesticides and he expressed support for a trade complaint filed 
against japan by rice millers he said dukakis supports the boycott 
with 47 electoral votes at stake in california bush set his 
sights on large hispanic and asian populations two swingvoter 
groups that could determine the outcome of the states close 
presidential race 
before a hispanic audience in los angeles bush said nobody 
can tell us we cant get the job done 
he said there was new pride in america demonstrated by the 
performance of a flagmaking company in new jersey 
without identifying the flag manufacturer bush said its flag 
sales have taken off after doing poorly under jimmy carters 
democratic administration 
craig fuller the vice presidents chief of staff denied that 
bush was questioning dukakis patriotism 
after complaints from dukakis about the vice presidents jibes 
about patriotism and the pledge of allegiance bush has frequently 
said on the campaign trail that he was not questioning his 
opponents patriotism merely his judgment bush omitted that line 
in los angeles 
stressing a theme of economic prosperity bush said nearly 18 
million new jobs have been created during the reagan administration 
and that unemployment has been cut to 56 percent 
he said hispanics have shared in the good news with an 
employment rate growing at three times the rate of that for the 
entire labor force he said unemployment among hispanics has fallen 
almost twice as fast under president reagan as it did when 
democrats were in the white house 
moreover bush said per capita income for hispanic americans 
adjusted for inflation rose 13 percent between 1980 and 1987 
rising annually since the economic recovery began after falling 
during the carter administration 
later standing in a field in the san joaquin valley surrounded 
by crates of raisins oranges peaches and grapes bush cited new 
trade figures showing that the trade deficit fell to a smaller than 
expected 953 billion in july

the state department is accusing nicaraguas 
leftist government of a cynical political move by suspending a 
177 million us program to aid nicaraguan children who have been 
orphaned or injured as a result of civil war 
spokesman charles redman rebuked sandinista authorities 
wednesday after they served notice that the program will not be 
allowed to continue at a time when the congress is considering a 
new aid program for the contra rebels 
in managua president danel ortega said it doesnt make sense to 
receive aid from the same body that is considering an assistance 
package to the very group responsible for the plight of nicaraguas 
children according to nicaraguan embassy spokeswoman sarali porta 
us private groups were told the suspension would become 
permanent if congress approves additional assistance to replace an 
aid package that expires at the end of this month a 27 million 
humanitarian assistance bill approved by the senate is awaiting 
house action 
redman said it is deplorable that sandinista government has 
chosen to sacrifice the wellbeing of nicaraguas children in an 
effort to pressure the united states congress 
he said that although the sandinistas have never fully 
cooperated with this humanitarian program it would be tragic if 
they persist in this cynical effort to play politics with the 
health and wellbeing of nicaraguan children 
ms porta said her government does not draw a major distinction 
between military and humanitarian aid she said the latter keeps 
the rebels alive enabling them to pursue the war effort 
after the sandinistas and the contras reached an interim 
ceasefire agreement last march congress approved a 48 million 
aid package 177 million of which was to be used to assist needy 
or disabled nicaraguan children 
most of the rest of the package was in the form of food 
clothing shelter and medical care for the insurgents 
redman said that since april 1 the agency for international 
development has authorized more than 12 million in new health 
programs for nicaraguan children about 27 million has been spent 
for medical supplies 
meanwhile secretary of state george p shultz met wednesday 
with contra leader adolfo calero and five other members of the 
rebel directorate 
afterward calero expressed confidence that the 27 million aid 
package will win final congressional approval 
he said the rebels are prepared to resume peace negotiations 
which were suspended three months ago but that the sandinistas 
definitely have to create a climate to ensure progress will be 
made 
were open to hear what the sandinistas have to say calero 
said 
a fragile ceasefire agreed to six months ago remains in place 
but there has been no progress between the two sides on reaching a 
final settlement to their sevenyear old conflict

steak and potatoes is one of americas 
most popular meals but you wouldnt think so from the recipes of 
the 62 top cooks in the 15thannual national beef cookoff 
no one is using potatoes which is strange because meat and 
potatoes are supposed to go together said sarah lynn quinn who 
is in charge of obtaining ingredients for next weeks contest 
were buying plenty of tomatoes though and alfalfa sprouts 
dill pickles avocados and every kind of lettuce you can imagine 
she said wednesday were buying about 10 to 15 pounds of 
onions 
the contest runs monday through thursday and the public is 
invited to watch the cooks in action thursday a 5000 award will 
go to the firstplace winner in each of three categories 
conventional barbecue and microwave with a 10000 bonus for the 
best overall recipe 
last years overall winner was patricia yee of california who 
won for her warm beef and blackeye pea salad 
the contest is sponsored by several beef industry groups to 
promote the use of beef 
quinn said she has been kept busy chasing down sometimes 
frustrating ingredient demands by the competitors 
one contestant wants orange chrysanthemums she said we 
thought it was a flower we found every color but we couldnt find 
orange ones it turns out its a garnish you make out of an orange

neil frank one of the nations best known 
hurricane experts is getting his first inperson taste of a big 
atlantic storm as powerful hurricane gilbert neared texas 
but instead of his nearly constant appearances on all the 
television networks from the national hurricane center in coral 
cables fla frank is delivering his storm forecasts from the 
studios of houston television station khou 
im not going to compete with them he said wednesday of his 
former colleagues at the hurricane center not with all the 
resources they have its a different operation were a 
communication operation theyre a research operation 
frank whose distinctive flattop haircut and exuberant sharp 
voice made him familiar to millions of people along the atlantic 
and gulf coasts left the hurricane center about a year ago after 
25 years in florida and moved to houston television 
although frank is left with only several monitors a computer 
screen and a wall full of weather charts he doesnt see his 
absence from the florida headquarters as an intense disadvantage 
i can secondguess most of what theyre doing and thinking 
he said of the hurricane center that comes from 25 years of 
experience i know what theyre looking at but i dont see all the 
details and the models theyre looking at 
frank said he can still show viewers dramatic satellite views of 
gilbert and put the storm in motion 
but when you come to forecasting were not doing a lot better 
than when i went to the hurricane center 25 years ago he said 
its fairly easy to communicate but forecasting is a whole other 
dilemma 
ironically if the eye of hurricane gilbert came ashore at 
houston and galveston it would be the first time frank has been in 
the middle of an atlantic hurricane while a forecaster in the air 
force and stationed on okinawa he went through three pacific 
typhoons in 195657 but while in florida he never took a direct 
hit 
he remembers the first typhoon because he jumped in his car at 
the end of his shift to go home 
the first thing that happened i turned on my windshield 
wipers and they blew off he said laughing 
despite his new job frank remains in demand for his expertise 
his first commitment however is the station then the cbs 
network of which khou is an affiliate 
if we can satisfy other commitments then were doing so he 
said 
nevertheless the station has received scores of calls asking 
for franks thoughts on gilbert which he calls the worst storm 
hes ever seen the calls are so incessant the news departments 
executive producer is acting as franks agent during the storm so 
he can do his work 
and where does frank think gilbert is going 
if you want to bet id bet the hurricane doesnt come over 
our head he said from houston the thing that makes me most 
concerned is that people would want and really need more accurate 
information than we can provide

a new species has surfaced recently in 
south korea the olympic visitor regardless of its size color or 
demeanor it has evoked a new fad among south koreans olympic 
friendliness 
welcome to korea says a young man at a bus stop 
can i help you asks a businessman on his way to work 
thank you for coming to korea says a restaurant owner 
schoolgirls on the subway giggle and one says where you 
from a reply elicts excited conversation in korean 
a man on the subway peeking over the shoulder of a foreigner 
writing a korean name points to the word and says put in letter 
k the man smiles pleased with his contribution welcome to 
korea he says 
excuse me says a smiling policeman asking a foreigner to 
stop for traffic 
as recently as a few weeks ago such happenings would have been 
unusual never it seems have so many south koreas smiled so often 
at foreigners and said welcome to korea 
south koreans are usually reluctant to speak to strangers and 
foreigners and by upbringing they shy away from initiating 
conversation without proper introductions 
in anonymous public situations other people are treated as 
though they simply do not exist writes local columnist edward w 
poitras chong the word for warm emotion is reserved for those 
one knows not strangers 
to speak to a foreigner not to mention in a language in which 
one might not be proficient takes enormous effort but as members 
of an authoritarian society south koreans are quick to follow 
direction 
they have been told over and over again that hosting the olympic 
games which begin saturday is the countrys most important 
achievement and that its urgent that all citizens cooperate in 
making olympic visitors feel at home 
in recent weeks the government olympic organizers radio and 
television announcers and local neighborhood associations have 
stepped up efforts to urge citizens to initiate contact with 
foreign visitors 
we are reminded that foreigners think its okay to speak 
first said a student we are reminded that foreigners like to 
hear welcome to korea 
a spokeswoman for the korean broadcasting company says that 
although there are no special programs on being kind to foreigners 
many of the announcers on olympic television and radio programs 
urge citizens to exude friendliness 
announcers are encouraging people to be more positive about 
foreigners says lee jungwon of kbs they dont want to push 
the public because that might have a negative reaction its more 
like a suggestion 
the rival mbc network has broadcast english language lessons 
since last january listeners are reminded that even a few words 
makes foreign visitors feel welcome 
kim seungho a spokesman for the seoul olympic organizers said 
there had been no program training people to be friendly but he 
says there has been encouragement indirectly

violinist isaac stern was guest soloist with the 
new york philharmonic for the 100th time on the night the 
philharmonic opened its 198889 season in avery fisher hall 
but wednesdays concert concentrated on fine music and didnt 
allow that milestone or the audience dressed for a party 
afterwards to turn the evening into a mere event 
stern played beethovens concerto for violin and orchestra 
as that music speaks to a listeners soul it is obvious once again 
why beethovens music has endured and is so often played 
stern was hitting each tone right in its center his entrance in 
the piece was high and pure and later solo parts held pure sweet 
pianissimo the new york philharmonic audience even those who pay 
gala benefit prices and may not often attend again during the 
regular concert season knows that the etiquette is not to clap 
between movements however the audience roundly applauded stern 
after the first movement 
as the music went on stern played a firm though delicate in 
volume thread of sound and he made his pianissimo silver notes 
sound warm 
the orchestra which returned last weekend from playing 16 
soldout concerts in 13 cities in 11 european countries sounded 
fresh on the seasons opening night after last season ended the 
philharmonic played in russia mrs neal gilliatt chairman of the 
openingnight gala conceived the banquet and dance afterwards as a 
welcome home for the musicians and music director zubin mehta 
decor in the party tent was meant to evoke central park with 
twinkling lights in trees 
mehta opened the program with schuberts rosamunde overture 
this overture begins with broad strokes of which mehta took full 
advantage and later sings with gaity the orchestra played with 
eagerness and clarity throughout 
after intermission the orchestra played orchestral music from 
wagners gotterdammerung this was very grand and emotional 
fitting the opera applause was lavish and mehta conducted an 
encore the ride of the walkures from wagners die walkure 
although this music makes an opera goer want to hear a wagnerian 
soprano sing with it the concert ended on an exuberant mood 
upbeat for the season to come

jesse jackson said he has seen some moves in 
the right direction by the south african government and refrained 
from referring to it as a terrorist state after a meeting with 
that countrys ambassador 
jackson met ambassador pieter koornhof for an hour wednesday to 
ask for the protection of three men who sought protection at the 
us consulate in johannesburg 
the three men in south africa had been jailed without trial for 
as long as 21 months and entered the consulate tuesday after 
escaping from their guards at a hospital 
before the meeting took place though the south african 
government already said the three antiapartheid leaders would not 
be rearrested if they left the consulate 
jackson had demanded that the democratic party condemn south 
africa as a terrorist state in its platform but he would not 
utter those words as he stood on the porch of the embassy 
instead he spoke of hopeful signs in south africas foreign and 
domestic policies 
in the last few weeks some things have happened that are in 
the right direction and they must be encouraged said jackson 
adding that he was encouraged by south africas decision to 
withdraw from angola and by the elections in namibia 
but of course the heart of the matter remains apartheid must 
end he said 
koornhof said after the meeting i hope that the conciliatory 
note that you have noticed here today will not be lost on the 
american people neither on the south african people 
before his meeting at the south african embassy jackson told a 
meeting of black owners of radio and television stations to back 
drives to register more black and hispanic voters 
you rise as the power rises jackson said who else but 
you has the interest or the capacity to create voter fever

a 46yearold woman barred from living in a 
retirement community with her husband can now be a guest in her 
own home but only for 60 days a year according to a court 
settlement 
an agreement signed by middlesex county superior court judge 
john e bachman allows mary ann romer to be treated as an owner and 
nonresident of the rossmoor condominium association 
the agreement allows mrs romer to buy property with her 
60yearold husband theodore but restricts her from living with 
him for more than 60 days a year until she reaches the communitys 
minimum residency age of 48 said her attorney samuel h davis 
she is entitled to all the rights and privileges of any person 
who is not a resident davis said wednesday 
leonard j coates an attorney for the association said the 
settlement means she can be a guest in her own home 
the dispute began in november when the romers decided to buy a 
unit at the 3500resident complex 
mrs romer was denied membership because of her age her 
husband who is semiretired was denied membership because he was 
married to a woman younger than 48 coates said 
coates said the couple bought the unit anyway leading the 
association to sue them charging that the purchase violated its 
rules a township ordinance mandates that residents of retirement 
communities be 48 years of age or older coates said 
the romers will use the apartment on weekends since they 
maintain a permanent residence in new york city davis said 
theyve made many friends over there and they enjoy the place

the solution to africas vast and complex food 
problems will require the heavy use of farming technologies adapted 
to local methods says the office of technology assessment a 
nonpartisan research agency of congress 
existing ways of farming which can vary greatly across the 
continent should be made more productive the ota said wednesday 
it is this lowresource agriculture that offers the best hope 
of producing enough food to keep pace with a growing population 
the agency said in its report to congress that building on 
existing lowresource systems used in african farming herding and 
fishing would work better than trying to replace those methods 
african agriculture faces a major challenge in the next few 
decades the report said it will need to double production to 
keep pace with a growing population and provide an adequate source 
of household income to purchase additional food 
the report said it is uncertain whether technology exists to fit 
africas food problems and whether it can transform lowresource 
agriculture but the report said it is clear some technologies 
and practices do exist and could be used to improve african 
agriculture 
the study was requested by a number of senate and house 
committees involved in hunger science and agriculture the report 
concentrated on that part of africa south of the sahara desert a 
region where food and population problems are most acute 
rep mickey leland dtexas chairman of the house select 
committee on hunger said the ota report was a clear and sharp 
picture of the importance of lowresource agriculture in 
subsaharan africa and the vital necessity of directly assisting 
the poor african farmer in increasing crop production to combat 
chronic hunger 
sen claiborne pell dri said the study shows that the 
lesson of the 1980s is that we can no longer afford the tradeoff 
between shortterm agricultural production increases and longterm 
ecological degradation new methods of agricultural development 
are needed if africa is to achieve a modicum of selfsufficiency 
in its food systems he said 
the ota report said african agriculture for the most part has 
effectively adapted to meet changing conditions but never has the 
pressure been so great 
paramount is the pressure created by rapidly growing 
populations and the consequent demands on the land the report 
said the african continent has the most rapidly growing 
population in the world 29 percent per year in 1988 even if 
this rate slows slightly as expected the continent will have 
triple its current population to feed within just 40 years 
with intensified land use erosion deforestation and other 
abuses yields have declined the report said per capita food 
production and income along with nutritional levels are dropping 
in most areas 
from the late 1960s to the late 1970s africa changed from a 
net exporter of staple foods to a net importer the report said 
in 1986 the value of exports in 22 countries was not sufficient 
to pay for imports

abnormally low amounts of a hormone that controls 
appetite may play a role in bulimia the cycles of binge eating and 
purging suffered by some young women a study published today 
concludes 
the preliminary report found that some people with the disorder 
make unusually small amounts of cholecystokinin a hormone produced 
by the intestines that makes people feel full or sated after a 
meal 
we conclude that patients with bulimia do not have normal 
satiety and have impaired secretion of cholecystokinin in response 
to a meal the researchers wrote in the new england journal of 
medicine 
between 1 percent and 4 percent of young adult american women 
and a much smaller number of men are believed to have the disorder 
victims tend to eat large quantities of food then purposely purge 
themselves with vomiting or laxatives 
other studies have shown that antidepression medicine is an 
effective way to curb binge eating and the latest research found 
that the drugs also seem to increase levels of the appetite hormone 
after a meal 
however the researchers cautioned that further study will be 
necessary to see if correcting the apparent hormonal abnormality is 
important in controlling bulimia 
the study by drs thomas d geracioti jr of the national 
institute of mental health and rodger a liddle of the university 
of california san francisco compared the hormone levels after 
eating in 14 women with bulimia to 10 healthy volunteers 
in an accompanying editorial drs david b herzog and paul m 
copeland of massachusetts general hospital cautioned that it is 
premature to conclude that low hormone levels make people 
susceptible to binge eating 
but they added investigating bulimia nervosa from the 
perspective of defective satiety offers a promising avenue of 
research

scientists reported today they have compressed 
nuclear fuel to record densities by bombarding it with two dozen 
laser beams a step in developing a new kind of nuclear power 
technology 
but still higher densities will be needed to trigger a nuclear 
reaction called fusion the process that powers the sun 
researchers wrote in the british journal nature 
fusion releases energy as the nucleus or core of one hydrogen 
atom fuses with another todays nuclear plants use another 
reaction fission in which uranium atoms are split to release the 
energy that holds them together 
the new experiments focused on an approach to fusion called 
inertial confinement 
researchers used glass pellets only two to three times the width 
of a human hair the pellets contained the nuclear fuel a frozen 
mix of two forms of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium 
each pellet was bombarded by 24 laser beams the energy heated 
the skin of the pellets causing part of it to blow off that 
provided a rocketlike thrust toward the center of the pellet from 
all sides squeezing the fuel to the high densities 
the fuel reached average densities of 100 to 200 times that of 
its liquid state said robert mccrory of the university of 
rochester who reported the results with rochester colleagues 
to achieve fusion researchers will have to produce densities 
approaching 1000 times that of the liquid state the scientists 
wrote in a telephone interview mccrory said an average of 500 
times typically would be enough because portions of the pellet 
probably would reach the higher mark 
robert kauffman a physicist at the lawrence livermore national 
laboratory in livermore calif called the report another step 
on the way to scientifically demonstrating the feasibility and 
potential of inertial confinement fusion

coordinator for the show who became a mason salesman through a mail 
advertisement 
the chippewa falls company conducts most of its business through 
such ads which mason said result in doortodoor sales and sales 
to friends and relatives 
is there any way that from now on in the catalog we can refer 
to these as dave boots letterman asked as he slipped out of his 
athletic shoes and into the new boots 
i think we could or we could put a star on it for you

the reallife governor of the state john r mckernan 
mckernan is planning a trip to california this fall to hobnob 
with producers in hopes of luring more film industry business to

air france says it has fired the pilot of the a320 
airbus jetliner that crashed during an air show in eastern france 
in june killing three passengers as hundreds of people watched 
michel asseline a senior pilot with air france for eight years 
was fired wednesday following a particularly grave failure for 
which he was held responsible and which made his continued 
employment with air france impossible a company spokesman said 
the firing followed a recommendation by the disciplinary council 
of frances civil aviation authority that punitive action be taken 
against asseline and copilot pierre mazieres an air france pilot 
for about two months at the time of the crash 
the councils action marked the first independent official 
conclusion that blamed the crash on pilot error 
air france said it would make a decision on the fate of mazieres 
before the end of the month the spokesman said he spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
transport minister michel delebarre was expected to make a 
decision in the next few days on whether to revoke the two pilots 
commercial pilots licenses as recommended by the council 
hundreds of spectators witnessed the accident at the 
mulhousehabsheim air show one of the first domestic 
demonstrations of the new plane which went into service last 
spring 
although three people died in the crash 137 passengers and crew 
escaped 
the sophisticated aircraft is controlled by computers rather 
than mechanical cables in a system known as flybywire 
airbus the european consortium that manufactures the a320 
invested millions of dollars in its development it has called the 
a320 the fastestselling plane in aviation history and has received 
hundreds of orders from around the world 
the day after the crash french transport ministry officials 
called a news conference to say the pilots were flying too slow and 
low in violation of normal safety regulations they said the plane 
was not at fault 
the pilots maintained they were unfairly blamed and said the 
plane had failed to respond quickly to attempts to raise it

with little debate for a change the senate 
has approved a bill to redesign the reverse sides of the penny 
nickel dime and quarter 
the legislation approved on a voice vote wednesday also calls 
for issuing special coins commemorating the centennials of six 
states and the 100th birthday of president dwight d eisenhower 
the senate sent the three separate bills to the house where at 
least one and possibly two of them may face strong opposition the 
most controversial measure at least in the house calls for 
modernizing the coin designs 
the bill suggests the redesigned coins reflect such american 
constitutional ideas as freedom of speech and assembly the right 
to trial by jury the right to vote the separation of powers and 
the right to equal protection under the law 
the first redesigned coin to be issued would be required to have 
a design commemorating the 200th anniversary of the constitution 
that design would be replaced with another theme after a twoyear 
period 
rep frank annunzio dill chairman of the house banking 
consumer affairs and coinage subcommittee is strongly opposed to a 
general redesign of the nations coins and says he will fight any 
attempt to bring that bill to the house floor before congress 
adjourns next month 
a second bill would require the issuing of fivedollar 
commemorative coins to celebrate the centennials in 1989 and 1990 
of idaho montana north dakota south dakota washington and 
wyoming 
the bill requires that up to 350000 coins be minted for each 
state and that they be made largely of palladium a silverwhite 
metallic element related to platinum 
the measure requires that the palladium be mined and refined in 
the united states 
curtis prins an aide to annunzio said the congressman has 
big problems with that provision because he said the only 
operating us palladium mine cannot produce enough of the mineral 
for the coins and still meet other requirements the only other 
sources of palladium are south africa and the soviet union prins 
said 
the third and least controversial bill introduced by senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas calls for the minting of a 
onedollar coin to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth 
of president eisenhower on oct 14 1890

the newly industrialized economies of east 
asia are enjoying a surge of exports but economic growth in the 
worlds developing nations as a whole is slipping the 
international monetary fund said in a new report 
the imf a 151nation body based in washington also said in its 
annual report that third world countries failure to reduce their 
debt is the main cloud over the world economy 
the economic outlook in western europe asia and the united 
states has improved it said despite the continuing large us 
trade and budget deficits 
in the developing world especially among the newly 
industrialized nations of east asia many countries have 
benefited from vigorous export growth the report said 
nonetheless the average growth rate in the developing 
countries fell from 42 percent in 1986 to 34 percent in 1987 
it said this was due in part to stagnation in oilexporting 
countries where increasing oil prices were offset by higher prices 
for those countries imports 
much of 1987 and the first part of 1988 were characterized by 
continued expansion in world output and trade the report said 
but it added there is no room for complacency 
the imf said that besides indebtedness primarily in africa and 
latin america other concerns are 
the trade deficit and foreign debt of the united states 
the lack of economic growth in africa 
the return to high inflation in latin america 
the total debt of the developing countries increased to 12 
trillion last year from 11 trillion in 1986 the report said 
governments and international organizations such as the imf 
loaned about 34 billion to developing countries during the year 
while commercial banks and other private lenders were virtually 
drying up as a source of needed new loans the report said 
new private lending totaled 8 billion far short of the 43 
billion still needed by the developing countries it said 
on the positive side it said real output in the industrial 
countries expanded by over 3 percent in 1987 somewhat faster than 
in 1986 
efforts by the united states and its allies to reduce the value 
of the dollar and increase other currencies like the yen and the 
deutsche mark have paid off in helping to reduce the us trade 
deficit the imf said and it singled out japan for undertaking 
reforms to stimulate domestic demand 
the moves have increased imports in japan and west germany but 
dampened demand for imports in the united states it said the 
dollar dropped 13 percent between february 1987 to april 1988 
bringing it near its previous lows of 1978 by mid1988 however 
the dollar had stopped dropping and had begun rising it said 
still the us current account deficit covering the 
broadest measure of trade including merchandise and services 
continued to widen last year this was due in part to increased 
payments of interest and dividends on us government and private 
debt to foreigners

new easytouse heart shock machines are a 
very very important advance that improve the odds of saving 
many of the 400000 americans who die each year of cardiac arrest 
researchers reported today 
researchers in seattle found that giving the devices to 
firefighters allowed them to revive heart victims who would have 
died if care were left to paramedics who arrived just minutes 
behind them 
there is no question that this is a very very important 
advance in treating prehospital cardiac arrest victims said dr 
donald d brown who has worked with the devices at the university 
of iowa 
the machines cost between 4000 and 7000 and are highly 
sophisticated versions of the defibrillators which doctors and 
paramedics have used for decades but unlike their forerunners 
these devices are so automated they require little training to 
operate 
when attached to the chest of someone who has collapsed the 
device will check the victims heart and deliver a shock if it 
finds cardiac arrest a disastrous interruption in the hearts 
bloodpumping rhythm if given soon enough the shock almost always 
restarts the stalled heart 
dr w douglas weaver of harborview medical center in seattle 
who directed the study recommended that the devices be available 
in police cars fire trucks ambulances office buildings stadiums 
and anywhere crowds gather 
many communities that have not been able to deliver definitive 
care to cardiac arrest victims will be able to do so with the 
advent of this new technology weaver said in an interview 
weavers work was published in todays new england journal of 
medicine 
in an accompanying editorial dr jeremy n ruskin of 
massachusetts general hospital called cardiac arrest the most 
important public health problem in the united states 
the seattle results with the automatic defibrillator provide 
strong support for its use by those first on the scene he wrote 
their conclusions are very important and very valid said 
dr philip podrid of boston university medical center this is an 
electrical problem it requires immediate response and definitive 
therapy 
during cardiac arrest the heart suddenly stops pumping blood 
due to a disruption in its electrical signals and the victims 
falls unconscious unless the heart starts beating within four to 
eight minutes brain damage or death are likely 
most victims have not had heart attacks so if their heartbeat 
is restored quickly they often live for years without permanent 
heart damage 
frequently the first to respond to cardiac arrest are 
firefighters or police who administer cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation but not electric shocks 
you can do the best cpr in the world and unless you can 
deliver a shock in that eightminute window the likelihood of 
survival goes down dramatically weaver said 
in the study seattle firefighters were given four hours of 
training in use of the new defibrillators firefighters who arrived 
first to treat someone gave shocks to 276 patients while 228 
others got only cpr until paramedics showed up a few minutes later 
thirty percent of those treated first by the firefighters survived 
compared with 17 percent of those given shocks by laterarriving 
paramedics 
just how many people would be saved if the devices were widely 
available is unclear however weaver estimated that in communities 
where only 5 percent or 10 percent of cardiac arrest victims are 
saved the devices might raise survival to 25 percent and in areas 
with more sophisticated emergency services a third or a half might 
be saved

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen 
has found some resistance as he battles to sell defenseminded 
texans on the idea that running mate michael dukakis is an advocate 
of a strong military 
bentsen was heckled constantly on wednesday by a cadre of george 
bush supporters in a homestate audience of defense industry 
employees who heard him present the democratic tickets position 
that the republicans put too much emphasis on space weapons and not 
enough on conventional forces 
charges that dukakis would weaken defense were wild charges 
and innuendo from the vice president and his handlers bentsen 
told employees of the ltv missile division thats campaign hot 
air a hitandrun attack staged for the evening news network 
if i believed there were a thread of truth in that tapestry of 
partisan blame i would not be campaigning with mike dukakis he 
said 
bentsen fought repeated shouts from hecklers as he delivered the 
message for a short time one man shouted rebuttals to nearly 
every statement bentsen made including yelling bull each time 
the texas senator listed a dukakis position in favor of a military 
program 
the normally unflappable bentsen fumbled over parts of his 
speech at one point calling the location of the plant grand 
rapids instead of grand prairie before catching himself 
at the end of the speech when he asserted that dukakis would 
set higher moral standards to complement the weapons bentsen said 
that included the right to speak of hecklers like that one 
bentsen planned to announced today that a texas business group 
would work for the democratic ticket he was then traveling to 
shreveport la a campaign stop that might be shelved depending on 
hurricane gilbert and to memphis tenn 
it was announced wednesday that bentsen would debate indiana 
sen dan quayle the republican vice presidential nominee on oct 
5 in omaha neb 
bentsen in a statement wednesday afternoon said he was looking 
forward to the meeting it will be an opportunity to compare our 
records of experience and accomplishment in the us senate he

researchers say they created a human 
mouse by transplanting the human immune system into rodents 
providing a powerful new tool to study and combat aids cancer 
herpes and many other human diseases 
in separate studies the scientists said they used human blood 
cells or tissue from aborted human fetuses to develop mice that 
produced human antibodies and t cells the class of white blood 
cells attacked by the aids virus as it cripples patients immunity 
with human immune systems the mice should make excellent 
standins for people allowing researchers to more rapidly develop 
and test new drugs and vaccines against a variety of diseases said 
the scientists from stanford university and the la jollabased 
medical biology institute 
weve developed a system in which we can study human cells 
directly in a small laboratory animal dr mike mccune chief 
author of the stanford study said wednesday 
mccune and coauthor dr irving weissman also said such mice 
could lead to development of better methods to transplant organs 
and reduce researchers need to use dwindling populations of 
chimpanzees for studies of human ailments 
i consider it a major accomplishment especially in the 
fight against aids said daniel koshland jr editor f the journal 
science which will publish the stanford study sept 23 
the british journal nature today published the other study 
conducted by dr donald mosier and others at the medical biology 
institute and the veterans administration in la jolla 
dr david katz the institutes president said the researchers 
succeeded in making a human mouse 
it is not human in the real sense because the mouse is walking 
around and behaving like a mouse only it is protected by a human 
immune system katz said during a telephone interview 
mice and other animals normally serve as only approximate models 
or standins for people when researchers infect them with human 
diseases and test possible new drugs and vaccines on them such 
studies often are difficult or impossible to perform on humans for 
various ethical and practical reasons 
the deadly aids virus cripples the immune system leaving 
patients vulnerable to death from various infections and cancers 
but the virus doesnt infect normal mice and behaves differently in 
chimps and monkeys than in people 
however mice with human immune systems should suffer the same 
kind of aids symptoms as humans making them extremely valuable for 
testing possible new drugs and vaccine the researchers said 
katz said mosiers team injected mice with peripheral blood 
leukocytes a type of white blood cell to successfully 
reconstitute a fully functioning human immune system in mice 
suffering severe combined immune deficiency an inherited absence 
of immunity 
such mice normally would die quickly from infections but have 
been kept alive up to eight months he said adding that the mice 
also produced human antibodies against tetanus 
the stanford team gave 300 of the same kind of mice partially 
functioning temporary human immune systems lasting two to three 
months by implanting them with aborted human fetal tissue 
containing stem cells and other building blocks of the human 
immune system mccune said 
with the consent of abortion patients the scientists took liver 
cells and bits of thymus and lymph glands from the fetuses then 
injected the liver cells into the mice and surgically implanted 
pieces of thymus and lymph glands into the rodents 
the same mice also can be used to study many other human viral 
diseases and possible drugs and vaccines against them using a 
human system outside the human body so you dont have to expose a 
human subject to these treatments katz said 
mccune and katz said such diseases include certain leukemias and 
other viruscaused cancers various forms of hepatitis and herpes 
simplex mononucleosis and other ailments caused by members of the 
herpes virus family 
the mice also could be implanted with a variety of human tissues 
and wouldnt reject the tissues mccune said that would let 
scientists use the mice to study the progression of many nonviral 
human diseases including diabetes arthritis and cancers and 
drugs that might treat the diseases 
koshland said science released the stanford study early because 
the la jolla study was being published and because federal 
officials are considering the reagan administrations proposed ban 
on experimental use of aborted human fetal tissue 
this is an excellent example of the carefully scientifically 
controlled use of fetal tissue to attack major human disease 
problems said koshland who opposes the ban

the ferocity of hurricane gilbert has prompted 
cbs weekly news show 48 hours to mobilize for a live broadcast 
tonight postponing the taped report on infertility that had been 
planned 
the news show normally examines a news subject by editing 48 
hours worth of videotape into a kind of instant documentary but 
the fastapproaching hurricane didnt give cbs much time to tape 
anything so much of tonights program will be live said executive 
producer andrew heyward 
what we always said is that we would respond to breaking news 
when we thought we could add something to it heyward said 
this is really a kind of hybrid between 48 hours and 
specialevents coverage we think the story is potentially so big 
were doing a special edition of 48 hours that looks ahead to the 
story even though we didnt spend two days taping it 
well see if it works but the notion is that the people are 
hungry for information we can provide and we will look ahead 
he said the news division originally had planned to dispatch 
crews to tape 48 hours of coverage when the storm hit that would 
have been turned into next weeks show which would have been a 
quick turnaround 
so whats really 48 hours about it were doing it on less 
than 48 hours notice heyward said wednesday soup to nuts 
this is even less in fact we jokingly said around here today we 
should call it 48 hours 
dan rather will anchor the broadcast reports will come from 14 
correspondents who were hurriedly dispatched to the caribbean 
where the storm has caused devastation in jamaica to mexico which 
was battered wednesday and across the gulf coast areas of the 
united states which were bracing for the arrival of the storm 
i dont want to sound corny but i do think its a genuine 
public service said heyward it wont be as stylish as what we 
normally do nor should it be but were going to deliver important 
information

the house has unanimously approved a bill that 
would increase fines against convicted wall street insider traders 
lengthen their prison terms and penalize investment firms that 
permit the practice 
the measure was passed wednesday by 4100 but its fate is 
unclear in the senate where the legislation may not advance unless 
the house approves a senatepassed banking bill 
when the house measure was debated on tuesday supporters cited 
the steady stream of bigmoney insider trading cases that have 
attracted widespread public attention in recent years 
just last wednesday the investment firm drexel burnham lambert 
inc was named in a civil complaint filed by the securities and 
exchange commission charging insider trading fraud and other 
violations 
the single drumbeats that began two years ago have threatened 
to become a deafening symphony of illegality that would drown out 
the voices of those honest small investors and market professionals 
who seek to be heard in our securities markets said rep edward 
markey dmass chairman of the house telecommunications and 
finance subcommittee where the bill originated 
the legislation would expose securities companies to fines if 
the firm knew or recklessly disregarded that its employees 
committed insider trading violations the fines would be up to 
triple the profits gained or loss avoided or 1 million whichever 
was greater 
maximum criminal fines for insider trading convictions would be 
boosted from 100000 to 1 million for individuals and from 
500000 to 25 million for companies the maximum jail term would 
be doubled to 10 years 
the sec would be allowed to award bounty payments to people 
whose tips result in insider trading prosecutions the bounties 
could be as much as 10 percent of penalty imposed or the settlement 
reached with the convicted trader 
in addition investors who lost money because of insider trading 
would be allowed to seek damages from the insider traders 
sen william proxmire dwis chairman of the senate banking 
committee said last week he is considering withholding similar 
legislation unless house leaders reverse course and agree to move a 
measure giving banks new power to underwrite securities

in central america 
maj manuel urbina spokesman for the public security forces 
said four americans who protested in front of the embassy were 
being held at the casamata prison in the capital 
another 12 who staged a onehour protest at the us air base in 
palmerola about 40 miles northwest of the capital were being held 
at a police jail in comayagua four miles away urbina said 
he said the arrests were made without resistance and the 
americans would probably be expelled 
us officials in honduras could not be reached immediately for 
comment 
urbina said none of the demonstrators carried passports or 
identification 
in guatemala city four americans threw blood on the steps of 
the us embassy wednesday and chained themselves to the gates of 
the compound in a protest against us policy in central america 
the protests were organized by a group called project 
independence and held one day before central american countries 
celebrate the anniversary of their independence from spain in 1821 
john mateyko a spokesman for the group in washington said the 
protest was religiousbased and nonviolent against what he 
called the immoral and dangerous policy of the reagan 
administration in central america 
mateyko identified the four demonstrators in tegucigalpa as john 
bach 41 of hartford conn teri allen 30 of hartford patricia 
mccallum 47 of cambridge mass and mark fryer 31 of west 
creek pa 
the names of those being held in camayagua were not immediately 
available 
mateyko identified the demonstrators in guatemala city as 
charley litky 57 a congressional medal of honor winner for his 
service as a roman catholic priest in vietnam and sara story 26 
both of washington dc dale asheradavis 34 of baltimore md 
and john schuchardt 49 of leverett mass 
at this time of remembering central american independence from 
spain weve come to join with central americans in declaring its 
independence from us domination a declaration read by the 
group said 
in eight years neither president reagan or vice president 
george bush seems to have figured out that thats all these people 
want it said 
the demonstrators who threw blood on the embassy steps before 
chaining themselves to the gates were demanding an audience with 
the us ambassador to guatemala james michel 
by wednesday evening the four were still chained to the embassy

textile industry supporters confess they are 
worried over plans to send their embattled trade bill to a 
housesenate conference committee just weeks before congress 
adjourns 
the quickest way would be to get it over to the president 
because you can get delayed in conference rep ed jenkins 
dga a leading textile industry supporter said wednesday he 
expressed fear that wed get it into conference and never get a 
vote 
designed to protect american manufacturers from foreign 
competition the bill would freeze textile and apparel imports at 
1987 levels and limit growth to 1 percent annually starting next 
year 
nonrubber footwear imports would be frozen at 1987 levels with 
no provision for any increase in the share of the american market 
that foreign manufacturers already command 
textilestate lawmakers say the bill is needed to save american 
jobs critics counter that it would raise prices narrow consumer 
choices bring retaliation against us exports and cost more jobs 
than would be saved 
president reagan in an interview published in the washington 
times on thursday said the version of the bill passed by the 
senate is purely protectionist and must be vetoed 
the ways and means committee decided on a voice vote to send the 
measure to a conference committee to resolve differences between 
the house and senate versions dashing hopes of textile forces that 
senate changes would be quickly accepted and the bill whisked to 
reagans desk 
other delays already have plagued the bill the senate passed 
the measure last week but has been unable to send it back to the 
house opponents have kept it bottled up on a technicality 
the senate was expected to vote today to break that grip and get 
the measure moving again 
an earlier version of the measure drew a reagan veto in 1985 
and the administration has again been sprinkling the debate with 
veto threats 
so far sponsors have failed to muster the twothirds needed in 
both chambers to override a presidential veto but they have been 
attempting to speed the bill to reagans desk to prevent him from 
exercising a socalled pocket veto the president can stop a bill 
from becoming law merely by refusing to sign it when congress is 
not in session 
lawmakers have set oct 5 as a target date for adjournment 
although a oneweek extension would not be surprising 
sponsors say the political price paid by critics would be higher 
if reagan were forced to wield his veto pen rather than blocking 
the measure merely by stuffing it into a desk drawer 
lawmakers urging a conference committee said they were concerned 
over four changes made by the senate after house passage a year ago 
one would set up a oneyear pilot program providing for the 
auctioning of import licenses and quotas to us importing firms 
some lawmakers said it represented too large a change from current 
policy to accept without study 
also a focus of concern was a senate provision that would 
guarantee other countries larger textile and apparel quotas in the 
us market if they increased their purchases of american 
agricultural goods 
the idea is to ease concern among farm lawmakers over possible 
retaliation on the part of asian textile nations that are among the 
largest purchasers of american agricultural products but some 
urban lawmakers were unimpressed 
only two other differences exist between the house and senate 
versions the house bill passed 12 months earlier would freeze 
imports at 1986 levels textile forces say they would not object to 
the senate version the senate measure also would set up a special 
import quota for silk neckties

hurricane gilbert damaged 80 percent of 
jamaicas homes devastated crops and left eastern sections of the 
island looking like hiroshima after the atom bomb said prime 
minister edward seaga 
speaking to reporters wednesday after a fivehour inspection 
flight over the island he estimated damage at 8 billion and said 
one out of every five homes was destroyed 
staterun jamaican broadcasting corp operating by generator 
said at least 19 people were killed when the storm whipped across 
the island on monday 
the hurricane the most intense on record also killed five 
people in the dominican republic on its sweep westward through the 
caribbean before slamming into mexicos yucatan peninsula wednesday 
with 160 mph winds 
the jamaican embassy in washington said 500000 of jamaicas 23 
million people were rendered homeless and the government estimated 
that about 150000 people were in distress shelters set up around 
the island in sports stadiums churches government buildings and 
movie theaters 
in the dominican republic officials reported widespread crop 
damage the countrys main electricity relay station remained out 
of service wednesday leaving half the capital of santo domingo 
without power 
heavy crop damage also was reported in the islands of st lucia 
guadeloupe and st vincent 
seaga told reporters the storm wiped out 100000 of jamaicas 
500000 homes with another 300000 damaged we saw whole 
villages where not a single building was left standing it looked 
like hiroshima after the atom bomb 
the storm which dumped up to 10 inches of rain on the island 
wiped out the islands banana crop and poultry industry and heavily 
damaged the coconut industry and garden crops seaga said 
two days after the hurricanes passing jamaica remained without 
electricity most regions still had no water 
seaga said damage was widespread along the southern coast west 
of kingston although not as devastating as on the eastern end 
the northern coast where jamaicas vital tourist industry is 
based escaped the worst of the storm and only two of the regions 
luxury hotels appeared to have suffered noticeable damage 
in kingston jamaicas capital city of 750000 trees zinc 
roofs telephone poles and billboards littered the streets 
military and civilian volunteers worked in virtually every street 
pulling down collapsed roofs sweeping up debris and bringing food 
to the homeless 
at the national chest hospital officials had to contend not 
only with storm damage but with looters who stole mattresses and 
other supplies 
seaga said he had no doubt that this is going to be the worst 
disaster that we have experienced in our modern history 
he said he would hold an emergency cabinet meeting today to 
reevaluate government reconstruction priorities and projected 
costs as well as jamaicas requirements in international aid 
now our first priority is to provide shelter and 
sustenance the prime minister said its obvious well have to 
spend much more money than we thought initially wed have to 
the united states has sent in navy cargo planes with plastic 
roof covering and collapsible water storage tanks offers of aid 
have come from canada britain france west germany and israel 
seaga said 
government officials said kingstons norman manley airport 
severely damaged by gilbert would reopen to air jamaica flights 
today or friday 
part of the tarmac for smaller aircraft was littered with 
twisted and bent planes wednesday a 10seater sat against a row of 
palms its bruised nose to the ground 
the embassy in washington said airports were open for emergency 
traffic only and communications were extremely limited it said it 
had no reports of american victims 
power outages forced doctors to conduct surgery by flashlight at 
many hospitals where the winds had caused floods and torn off 
roofs 
the tiny cayman islands began returning to normal wednesday with 
no reported deaths few injuries and much less damage than feared 
the islands 23000 people got on their knees and said thank 
you said local journalist carol winker

a hearingimpaired boy who apparently cannot 
speak was abandoned in a church playground by a woman who then 
disappeared police say 
the 3 or 4yearold boy was found saturday after an anonymous 
caller said she saw a woman leave the boy that afternoon in the 
playground of the first methodist church 
he appeared to be well taken care of detective tony sanchez 
said wednesday he can make noises but nothing understandable 
officers are calling the boy david gallup and have placed him in 
state social services custody 
i dont think hes from around here because we would have 
heard something from someone by now sanchez said 
doctors said the boys developmental level seemed low but that 
might be attributable to his hearing impairment and apparent 
inability to communicate sanchez said 
his case seemed similar to that of a hearing impaired boy found 
wandering the streets of ciudad juarez mexico earlier this year 
that child eventually was reunited with his mother in mexico

mikhail s gorbachevs reforms have ignored soviet 
women who spend their days doing backbreaking physical labor in 
poor conditions but have no significant political power women 
complained in two soviet newspapers 
in articles published in wednesdays edition of pravda the 
countrys leading newspaper and the sept 9 edition of new times 
weekly women complained that their country had created a third 
sex women who do exhausting labor and are not respected as 
women 
im not calling for extremism but most womens voices are 
audible only in their kitchens wrote larisa kuznetsov in the new 
times weekly 
the women also complained that birth control was unavailable and 
the infant mortality rate was too high 
the glittering image of raisa gorbachev the articulate stylish 
wife of the soviet leader has helped obscure the fact that 70 
years after the russian revolution many women here still must work 
at demanding jobs for low or modest pay the women said 
in the pravda article entitled why i cant be a minister 
y barulina an adjuster at moscows zil auto plant wrote that 
almost 35 million of us toil in conditions that dont meet 
occupational safety regulations 
barulina said that although gorbachevs economic reforms should 
in principle improve life for soviet women it isnt happening 
whats more the typical soviet woman no matter how successful 
at her job is expected to bear the burden of housework said 
barulina who is also deputy chairman of the governmentsanctioned 
soviet womens committee 
if lets say i managed to make it to a ministers armchair 
what then would happen with the housework she asked you see 
at home a woman minister must be a housekeeper a wife a mother 
ms kuznetsovas twopage essay in the new times a virtual 
catalog of grievances for soviet women contended the worlds first 
socialist society had spawned a third sex and went so far as to 
call for the beginnings of a womens movement 
in our country for some reason there is not a serious 
womens movement wrote ms kuznetsova whose byline appeared 
above the story but was not further identified with a program 
its right and left wings and if you like with its extremists 
firebrands and leaders 
she said widespread menial work by the weaker sex may have 
become an inescapable aspect of soviet life 
after all is said and done we have made many eves do jobs 
that adams should do female labor by no means ennobled by 
redeeming technology has insidiously wormed its way into the very 
marrow of our economy ms kuznetsova wrote 
as for birth control she said the situation with 
contraception in our country is more or less like what it is with 
personal computers there arent any 
every fourth abortion on the planet is ours she wrote 
this tops the practice of developed capitalist countries by six 
to 10 times 
soviet infant mortality statistics are also high 26 per every 
1000 births ms kuznetsova wrote and in several central asian 
republics the situation is completely awful 50 or 60 infant 
deaths per 1000 births 
the soviet womans vital economic role is not accompanied by any 
significant political clout kuznetsova said 
no women are on the 13member communist party politburo the 
nations ruling body and only one woman alexandra biryukova sits 
on the partys no 2 group the secretariat 
when we repair railway lines and lift railway ties we are so 
to say not women at all ms kuznetsova said noting that nearly 
a third of all railway workers or 65000 people are women on 
the other hand when we want a part in decisionmaking we are just 
ladies 
she urged that gorbachevs drive for perestroika or social 
and economic reconstruction open more top government offices to 
women 
many women are irked by the spate of male perestroika 
eloquence they are sick and tired of the complete absence of at 
least a few small islands of material impact in perestroika she 
wrote it is high time too that we saw women among the countrys 
leaders

her she did mention to someone here that it was a culture shock 
moving from arkansas to new york city 
she said she didnt feel safe in the neighborhood she was 
living in shay added 
after her first night at the restaurant ms wrappe took a 
subway to brooklyn and was one block from the dormitory where she 
lived with three roommates when she was accosted prestia said

shot hit her in the chest and escaped with the handbag prestia 
said

guards are assigned to patrol at night he said 
judith had last spoken to her parents on sunday her mother 
said she was happy and getting settled into school she was 
going to look for work i guess she found it

a biography that portrays john lennon as a 
drugaddled anorexic bisexual who raged his way from liverpool to 
new york city is totally fiction yoko ono said in a national 
radio broadcast 
its amazing that somebody took such a poetic license i dont 
see john in there its a very dramatically described something 
but its not about john ono said wednesday night in her first 
broadcast comments on the book by albert goldman 
the usually reclusive ono agreed to the interview to counter 
goldmans the lives of john lennon which presents the 
exbeatle as a violent drugaddicted drunk who wanted to dump his 
wife 
as for ono goldman shows her as a golddigger who snorted 
heroin up to the time of lennons death goldman also charges she 
was responsible for paul mccartneys 1980 marijuana bust in japan 
had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a 
divorce as lennon 
ono refuted virtually all of these charges and countered 
through taped interviews with lennon friends and employees that 
goldmans book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes 
its totally fiction yoko said during the hourlong 
program which opened with lennons song gimme some truth and 
coincided with the books national release wednesday 
these people in this book are not us its not john and me 
ono continued its unfair hes been assaulted and cant hit 
back for some reason this book is attempting to rob both john 
and i of the basic human dignity that were entitled to 
the ono interview was taped aug 28 at the dakota where the 
lennons lived and yoko still lives with their son sean lennon 
was murdered by mark david chapman outside the dakota on dec 8 
1980 
the interview was broadcast nationwide via the westwood one 
network spokeswoman laurie wilde said an exact figure on how many 
stations picked up the broadcast was not available 
also appearing were sean and lennon other son julian ono was 
interviewed by longtime associate elliot mintz who is described in 
goldmans book as a spy for yoko a charge mintz denied during the 
show 
it is for one very upsetting but most of all it is lies 
untruths the whole thing is just sickening said julian who 
also refuted goldmans tales of lennon as a violent father 
mintz read excerpts from the book to yoko who then responded to 
the allegations point by point she denied that lennon was 
homosexual that he was using drugs while living at the dakota with 
his son sean that he had become a reclusive rock n roll howard 
hughes 
she did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late 
1970s but rejected goldmans assertion that she had a 
5000aweek habit 
the book has already drawn angry responses from friends of 
lennon and ono mccartney who contradicted one anecdote involving 
lennon smashing a painting in pauls home has urged a boycott of 
the book 
after yokos rebuttal listeners were invited to dial 900digit 
telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate 
portrayal of the lennons life results were not expected until 
later today 
goldman who conducted more than 1200 interviews for his lennon 
book has written controversial biographies of comedian lenny bruce 
and elvis presley

after returning an 819200 contempt fine a 
federal judge told yonkers officials and other parties in the 
citys desegregation case to move quickly on any changes to a 
proposed housing plan 
us district judge leonard sand who ruled in 1985 there was 
housing segregation in the states fourthlargest city said 
wednesday he would allow revisions in the plan but insisted they 
be finished by sept 30 
sand added that he expected both sides in the desegregation 
lawsuit would get together and work things out because the city had 
learned what one councilman termed a very expensive civics 
lesson 
we must move forward with as much speed as circumstances 
permit said sand noting that the case was 8 years old and that 
not a single yonkers resident had enjoyed improved housing 
opportunities as a result of the lawsuit 
the new plan designed to lessen the impact of 200 units of 
lowincome housing by mixing some of it with middle and 
upperincome units must be approved by the justice department and 
sand 
it must then be formally approved by the city council before it 
can replace the original plan sand imposed 
that plan was resisted by the council prompting sand to fine 
the city 1638300 for contempt of court before the council 
finally gave in early saturday in voting to approve incentives for 
sands plan the council asked that the substitute plan be 
considered 
sand returned a check for 819200 on wednesday essentially 
refunding the fine incurred the day before the council meeting that 
ended the battle 
the refund meant that yonkers contempt had cost it 450505 
although the escalating fines had totaled 819100 before last 
thursday 368595 of that had been designated for city schools

blacks and whites gather tonight in the 
church where four black girls were killed by a ku klux klansman 
exactly 25 years ago in memory of the victims and the civil rights 
struggle that changed birmingham 
we as a city are merely looking at ourselves and saying that 
we remember said betty lee a member of a biracial group that 
planned the memorial service at the 16th street baptist church 
among those scheduled to speak are the rev john cross pastor 
of the church when the sept 15 1963 bombing occurred and mayor 
richard arrington a black man whose election was one result of the 
fight for equal rights that racked the city in the 1950s and 1960s 
the four girls were killed minutes after a sunday school lesson 
on a love that forgives cross said thats what we really 
had to practice for the next several weeks and months and years 
and even now 
although some city leaders had worked for healing prior to the 
church bombing it was that event among numerous bombings and 
civil rights demonstrations that spurred the city to make major 
changes 
the city council now has six blacks and three whites chris 
mcnair father of one of the bomb victims was elected to the 
legislature and now sits on the jefferson county commission 
i cant erase it out of my life he said of the bombing

a federal judge has barred the apparent 
frontrunner for president of a teamsters local from seeking 
office ruling that his victory could restore mob influence to the 
first union taken over by courtappointed trustee 
normally the members should be free to elect incompetent 
unwise or even dishonest officials if they choose us district 
judge dickinson r debevois said wednesday however more than 
mere competence wisdom or honesty is involved here there is 
involved the question of the renewed subjugation of a major union 
local to an organized crime group 
ballots are to be mailed nov 4 and counted dec 6 in the first 
contested election since the 1960s at union citybased teamsters 
local 560 which was placed in trusteeship in 1986 to rid it of 
alleged control by members of the gambino crime family 
local 560 trustee edwin stier is to step down after the 
elections 
the judges ruling which was sought by the government was 
aimed at joseph sheridan and michael sciarra the favorite for 
president of the 8000member local 
we lost but dont ask me why an angry sciarra said i 
think were better off in poland than in the united states of 
america its supposed to be the united states of america but i 
dont think it is 
sciarra was president and sheridan vice president from 1984 to 
1986 while the union appealed the trusteeship decision 
the judge relying partly on wiretaps of reputed mobsters said 
the government had shown illegalities under sciarra including the 
continuation of sweetheart contracts intimidation mafia efforts 
to control union affairs and the failure of sciarra and sheridan 
to repudiate the locals dark history 
sciarras attorney alan zegas called the ruling truly an 
unwarranted intrusion into the election process and said he would 
appeal 
zegas said it was wrong for the judge to act before the 
election if sciarra won the judge could then consider his 
removal zegas argued 
debevoise said he had the power to act under the federal 
racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law under which the 
government brought suit to remove the unions executive board 
the public interest in racketeerfree corporations and unions 
overrides the interest of stockholders of corporations or members 
of unions freely to select their officers he wrote 
russell viggiani a candidate for local 560 president said the 
ruling was a disappointment because it would cast a cloud over the 
outcome 
im hoping that after this election is over the ticket that 
is elected will have the support of the entire rank and file he 
said

solidarity leader lech walesa sat down 
with government leaders today to discuss setting up broader talks 
on the future of the banned labor movement 
walesa is taking a tough line and demanding that his independent 
trade union be legalized solidarity was suppressed in a december 
1981 military crackdown and was outlawed the following fall 
todays talks followed a similar meeting aug 31 after polands 
worst labor unrest since the crackdown 
walesa was accompanied by mediator andrzej stelmachowski and the 
rev alojzy orszulik of warsaw interior minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak and alternate politburo member stanislaw ciosek the head 
of a national unity group known by its polish initials pron 
represented the communist government 
the labor leader traveled from his home in gdansk to warsaw late 
wednesday and refused to discuss a government report that he would 
be meeting with officials led by kiszczak 
the ruling politburo in a statement issued by the staterun 
news agency pap wednesday said a desire to narrow down the 
talks to bargaining in line with the unfortunate principle of 
everything or nothing is a great misunderstanding 
earlier government spokesman jerzy urban said walesa would be 
meeting with a group similar to the one of aug 31 when he 
gathered with kiszczak ciosek and roman catholic bishop jerzy 
dabrowski 
that session brought walesa and government officials together 
for the first time in six years 
four days later after the government promised roundtable 
talks at which solidaritys reinstatement would be discussed the 
last strike was called off 
urban said todays talks would be taking place in a 
conciliatory atmosphere 
andrzej stelmachowski president of the club of catholic 
intelligentsia said in a telephone interview today that he could 
not comment on the talks he has been acting as a gobetween in 
setting them up 
you must understand that the situation is very delicate now 
he said 
the 19day strike wave that ended sept 3 idled polands two 
biggest ports and crippled production of highgrade coal for export 
walesa was sharply criticized by some union members for ending 
the strike without a firm guarantee that the union would be 
legalized a solidarity conference held over the weekend in gdansk 
said that legalizing the union must precede any real dialogue on 
the countrys future

caribbean resort into a nightmare for thousands of stranded 
tourists sheltered in cramped hotels and public buildings 
believe me i will not come back here said pete fournier of 
long island ny 
his wife sheila bemoaned their evacuation from the villas 
playas hotel it had an oceanfront view which is now washed 
away she said 
bringing winds of up to 218 mph when it hit this yucatan coastal 
city wednesday morning gilbert forced about 6000 tourists to 
leave their beachside hotels and seek shelter according to an 
official with the national civil defense system 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 30000 
workers and residents also sought temporary shelter on the island 
off the yucatan peninsula a popular vacation spot for americans 
jennie valdez a us consular representative in cancun said 
she did not know how many tourists were in cancun but that 40000 
and 65000 people visit the resort city each month 
as the storm shattered windows twisted utility poles and 
flattened homes about 150 tourists were crammed into a 
20by50foot room in cancuns city hall 
gilberts fierce winds ripped police and radio antennas off the 
roof above and stiff palm fronds crashed into windows 
however some newlyweds took in stride the forced exchange of 
beachfront views for boardedup windows 
the first two days were great said joseph camuccio of 
philadelphia who arrived in cancun sunday he said he and his wife 
had not eaten in 24 hours and were trying to figure out how to get 
out of cancun 
even as gilbert closed in on cancun many residents resisted 
attempts by authorities to move them to safer areas 
there were people who did not want to leave said an army 
official who checked the area for stranded residents it was 
something new they didnt know what a cyclone was 
he said most people particularly those in lowlying areas 
changed their minds once the storm hit 
mexicos national weather service ordered the evacuation of 
everyone living less than 15 feet above sea level and within 2000 
feet of the caribbean coast 
some tourists said that winds made shrieking sounds at the 
height of the storm others compared the noise to the pounding of 
heavy surf 
broken windows in the commercial area of the tourist mecca 
invited bands of young looters 
theyre looting all the stores said alfredo moro sanchez of 
the state judicial police about three or four people were 
arrested city police director juan manuel arteaga said 
city officials said wednesday they knew of only two minor 
injuries caused by the storm they also reported five births during

the bush people for several weeks and he hasnt handled it well

of the states gop voters support among democrats has grown to 14 
percent from 9 percent six weeks ago

rickety dune shacks on cape cod that 
provided a retreat for artists and writers such as eugene oneill 
and jack kerouac belong on the national register of historic 
places says a state commission 
with the massachusetts historical commissions unanimous 
recommendation wednesday the register must decide whether to grant 
historic status to the 18 shacks and list them along with mount 
vernon and monticello 
a vocal group of supporters argues that the shacks are no less 
significant to the state and the nation 
just as thoreau taught us the value of living simply so do 
the cottages said julie schecter a member of a cape cod group 
fighting to preserve the shacks the cottages continue to let 
people live in the same way that early dune dwellers lived 
three shacks were razed recently according to gail cohen who 
has lobbied for their preservation the national park service 
planned to tear down the remaining 18 arguing that they lack 
architectural significance required of buildings placed on the 
national register 
the shacks are nestled in a twomile strip of dunes in truro and 
provincetown at the far end of the cape the coast guard built them 
around the turn of the century of rough wood and salvage material 
they were used as shelters from harsh coastal weather in the 
1920s as provincetown attracted artists and writers they became 
retreats in 1961 with the creation of the cape cod national 
seashore the shacks became part of the park service domain 
artist joyce johnson of truro who has painted in a dune shack 
off and on for 15 years told the commission it is no surprise to 
her that so many writers have done their best work there 
the sometimes overwhelming awareness of nature the wind 
sound of the sea songs of birds allow the creative forces to 
clarify and congeal in ideas that might take months in another 
space johnson said 
the final decision will be made in 45 days according to beth 
savage an architectural historian from the register who will be 
responsible for the decision 
architectural significance is only one way you get on the 
register savage said if the shacks played a significant role 
in the history and development of the area then sure theres a 
possibility

operators of a sludgeladen barge outsmarted 13 
greenpeace demonstrators who attempted to stop it by swinging from 
ropes beneath the triborough bridge the vessel simply took 
another route to sea to dump its load 
the demonstrators tied up traffic on the bridge and the east 
river before climbing back up shortly before 2 am today eight 
hours after they lowered themselves from the span and unfurled a 
huge banner reading stop ocean dumping now 
andrew davis spokesman for the worldwide ecological group said 
the protesters had hoped to block barges carrying treated sewage 
sludge for dumping 106 miles at sea 
they dangled some 100 feet above the water forcing the coast 
guard to stop all traffic from passing under the bridge said coast 
guard spokesman joe gibson 
but the barge departed as scheduled shortly before midnight 
traveling north via long island sound to the ocean instead of 
south said lt cmdr larry brooks 
we couldnt let them transit under the bridge because of the 
safety to these people brooks said so they asked if it was ok 
to take an alternative route and we thought it was perfectly 
suitable 
police sgt ed burns said 13 people who swung from the bridge 
and 11 others who assisted were arrested and would be charged with 
criminal trespass disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental 
administration all misdemeanors 
on tuesday five greenpeace members were arrested after they

israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir 
said today that israel and hungary have agreed to gradually restore 
diplomatic ties after a 21year break and pledged close contacts 
with central europes largest jewish community 
shamir on a private visit to hungary is making the first trip 
by an israeli prime minister to a soviet bloc country other than 
romania since 1967 
he is also the first israeli government leader to visit hungary 
since the establishment of the jewish state in 1948 his aide 
aviezer pazner termed the twoday visit an important milestone 
for relations between israel and the soviet bloc and said 
diplomatic ties will be restored 
on wednesday shamir met with communist party leader and premier 
karoly grosz in the highestlevel bilateral contact since all 
soviet bloc nations except romania broke diplomatic ties with 
israel in 1967 over the six day war 
today shamir reported that grosz favors close contact between 
israel and the jewish community in hungary 
accordingly we will try to establish very close contacts 
shamir pledged in a lunchtime toast delivered in hebrew to about a 
dozen jewish community leaders 
pazner said relations between hungary and israel are getting 
closer and will result at some point in full diplomatic 
relations 
he gave no timetable for establishing full diplomatic ties but 
said the two countries had reached the point when we feel the 
moment of full normalization cant be too far away 
pazner said there was no reason why israel and hungary and all 
countries of the socialist bloc shouldnt have normal relations 
shamirs stay in budapest was described as a private working 
visit but he met grosz foreign minister peter varkonyi and deputy 
premier jozsef marjai 
in september 1987 hungary became the second soviet bloc state 
after poland to renew lowlevel diplomatic relations with israel 
last march economic interest sections were set up by both 
countries at the swedish embassy in tel aviv and the swiss embassy 
in budapest 
the movement toward renewed ties comes as israel agreed to begin 
assisting hungary in the economic and industrial development 
fields nflation in hungary already has reached 18 percent this 
year and the country has a foreign debt of 18 billion 
grosz has introduced an austerity program to stimuate the 
economy in 1986 trade between hungary and israel totaled about 
22 million 
the president of hungarys state office for church affairs imre 
miklos visited israel earlier this month and israels foreign 
minister shimon peres came to budapest in may 
andras losoenci the president of hungarys jewish community 
which numbers about 80000 said shamirs visit to budapests main 
synagogue the largest in central europe was of historic 
significance 
he recalled that 600000 hungarian jews were killed by the nazis 
in world war ii 
its difficult now not to think that if israel was founded 50 
years ago and not 40 you would represent not 80000 jews but 1 
million shamir told about a dozen jewish community leaders in a 
lunchtime toast 
about 2400000 jews of hungarian origin live in israel 
shamir stopped at the synagogue and paid tribute to raoul 
wallenberg the swedish diplomat who helped hungarian jews escape 
the holocaust and disappeared after being captured by the soviets 
in january 1945 
security was very tight during the brief visit to the memorial

the international olympic committee 
today awarded the 1994 winter games to the norwegian city of 
lillehammer dashing us hopes of hosting the games in anchorage 
alaska 
in the norwegian city of 22000 people danced in the streets 
and were served free breakfast along the main street as they 
celebrated the announcement 
this is an enormeous challenge for all norway and especially 
for lillehammer and the districts around said prime minister gro 
harlem brundtland in oslo 112 miles away 
lillehammer has been given a preliminary budget of 312 million 
to stage games the norwegian government said 
the announcement was made by ioc president juan antonio 
samaranch following a vote by members of the organization 
lillehammer will become the second norwegian city to host the 
winter games oslo organized the 1952 games 
mrs brundtland of norway was in seoul this week lobbying for 
lillehammer among members of the ioc she called norway the 
cradle of winter sports and praised lillehammers compact 
sports center 
sofia bulgaria had been widely expected to be chosen as the 
first east bloc nation to hold the games based on the strong 
support from its allies 
anchorage and ostersund sweden were the other contenders for 
1994 
when samaranch made his announcement following a vote by the 
86member body a group of norwegian representatives in the crowd 
shouted in joy and waved their countrys flag 
lillehammer is the smallest of the contending cities and is 
located on lake mjoesa norways largest lake 
the city has already begun building a sports center that offers 
compact facilities that will not necessitate extensive travel by 
competing teams 
the ioc voted in 1986 to stagger the winter and summer olympics 
and lillehammer will be the first to host the new onceintwoyears 
cycle 
sweden submitted a bid the last four times for the winter games 
and the country has tried 12 times in all to be a winter olympics 
host 
the four cities made their final presentations wednesday using 
speeches films and slide shows to try to convince the ioc that 
their bid was best anchorage lillehammer and sofia all were 
losers two years ago when albertville france was awarded the 
winter games for 1992

the reagan administrations top health 
official said today there are some good pros and some good cons 
to using aborted fetal tissue in the experimental treatment of 
various diseases 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen told reporters 
he has not taken a position on the controversial issue of whether 
to recommend federal backing for such research and does not expect 
to until a national institutes of health advisory committee has 
completed a full review of the matter 
bowens comments were his first since the disclosure last week 
that gary bauer a white house domestic policy adviser had drafted 
an executive order that would ban using tissue from intentionally 
aborted fetuses in research 
bauer told bowen in an accompanying memo that he would like the 
secretarys response by last friday because white house officials 
wanted to put the ban into effect as soon as possible 
bowen said today that we have not responded and added that 
he did not intend to make any recommendations until the nih panel 
has completed its work 
asked if he considered the bauer memo an order from the white 
house bowen said i do not know whether it was a direct order 
from the president and i dont know that i will know unless someone 
tells me 
one day after the bauer memo was disclosed white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the draft executive order was just 
a starting point for discussions and did not represent an official 
white house position 
bowen emphasized that he does not approve of abortion but 
added inasmuch as abortions are legal being unable to utilize 
the tissue would result in the waste of a resource that is 
lifesaving and curing for several diseases 
at the same time he said there are some big dangers in the 
widespread use of such treatment including the possibility for a 
sale of fetal tissue by those who intentionally become pregnant and 
then have an abortion with the intent to sell the tissue that 
would be totally wrong 
bowens remarks came during an informal breakfast meeting with 
reporters as the nih panel he referred to was beginning its second 
day of hearings focusing on some of the same ethical issues raised 
by bowen 
a ban against federal financing of such research is likely to 
remain in effect for several months at least 
the nih panel of outside experts consisting of medical legal 
and religious leaders is scheduled to make recommendations friday 
which will be passed on to a standing nih advisory committee and 
ultimately nih director james b wyngaarden 
the threeday meeting of the special advisory panel that started 
wednesday was an outgrowth of a decision by the no 2 official at 
the department of health and human services assistant secretary 
for health robert e windom to deny permission for nih scientists 
to transplant fetal tissue into parkinsons patients pending a full 
airing of legal and ethical questions 
leatrice ducat founder of the juvenile diabetes foundation and 
now operator of a nonprofit organ exchange operation headquartered 
in philadelphia told the group she favored much wider research 
using fetal tissue for diabetes and other diseases 
however she said her organization does not collect and 
distribute fetal tissue to researchers now because the emotional 
climate which makes hospitals and other institutions where 
abortions are performed reluctant to donate fetal tissue 
william f colliton a retired gynecologist and obstetrician 
representing right to life of maryland appeared before the panel 
to oppose the research 
this proposition further devalues our preborn brothers and 
sisters and lends an aura of respectability to the elective killing 
of these patients who today have no protection under the law he 
said 
dr myron genel a pediatrics professor and associate dean for 
government and community affairs at the yale university school of 
medicine told the committee the association of american medical 
colleges and the association of american universities favor fetal 
tissue transplant research with proper safeguards 
while the decision to halt federal involvement in this 
research was guided by ethical concerns equally compelling ethical 
concerns are raised by proposals to enjoin this research 
permanently and thereby to preclude the alleviation of suffering 
and illness in the living genel said 
although not spelled out his reference to proposals for a 
permanent ban apparently referred to a proposed white house 
executive order distributed to federal officials the document 
disclosed by news reports last week had not been intended for 
public consumption 
genels suggestion that ethical questions also would be raised 
by a permanent ban echoed the sentiments expressed earlier 
wednesday by a swedish physician who is one of the few people in 
the world to have transplanted fetal tissue into the brains of 
parkinsons patients 
dr lars olson professor of neurobiology at karolinska 
institute in stockholm told the panel the technique also has been 
used in mexico china england and cuba 
there are no known cases of fetal tissue being transplanted as a 
treatment for parkinsons disease in the united18

afer donning a military helmet and jump suit and 
taking one of the armys 60ton m1 abrams tanks out for a spin 
michael dukakis asked his observers for a review 
what did you think he asked did i look like i belonged 
up there in that tank 
the full answer wont be in for a while though the democratic 
presidential nominee has spent this week doing his utmost to make 
the picture of himself perched atop the nations military machinery 
seem reasonable and natural 
stung by republican assaults on him as weak on defense dukakis 
sounded downright hawkish at times he delivered three major 
addresses that were an attempt to stake out positions of strength 
on weapons ussoviet relations and national security all the 
while presenting himself as no newcomer to toughness 
were going to have strong strategic forces were going to 
have strong conventional forces and were going to clean up the 
mess in the pentagon he said wednesday in annapolis md his 
final national security speech before heading west today to view 
fire damage in yellowstone national park wyo and meet with 
western governors 
dukakis was motivated in part by polls suggesting republican 
george bush has succeeded in raising questions about the democrat 
on defense matters in a new york timescbs news poll this week 
four in 10 voters said dukakis would weaken the nations defenses 
while only one in 10 said he would strengthen them 
what emerged from dukakiss efforts was a fairly conventional 
and unstartling view of eastwest relations the expected 
democratic emphasis on arms control was coupled with tough talk 
about soviet intentions he called soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
a leninist who has not abandoned soviet world goals 
he added to that eyesopen view of the soviets the prospect that 
improved soviet behavior in world affairs may be achieved by 
holding out the carrot of enhanced economic ties and fuller 
admission into the world economic community 
on weapons systems the area where bush has scored points with 
his scornful assaults on the democrat as the stealth candidate 
dukakiss positions appear to be still emerging 
the massachusetts governors ride in the m1 tank in a grassy 
field by a general dynamics test and design facility in sterling 
heights mich on tuesday provided the pictures to go along with 
his talk of military might it fit nicely into the area of weaponry 
that he most likes to discuss his call for improvements in 
conventional forces and his accusation that the reagan 
administration has been willing to make sacrifices in personnel and 
nonnuclear spending to pay for its strategic defense initiative 
and more nuclear arms 
dukakis did not however answer the question of how he would 
modernize the landbased leg of the nations nuclear triad land 
air and sea nor did he offer specific explanation of how he holds 
open the possibility of modernization while opposing the options 
that are available 
speaking at georgetown university in washington on wednesday he 
ruled out the mx missile deployed on rails as a pearl harbor 
style target he struck a noticeably more favorable note than 
before on the proposed smaller midgetman missile calling it 
strategically sound but he dismissed it as too expensive and 
three times the cost of submarinebased warheads 
aides said dukakis views the question of the next generation of 
landbased nuclear missiles as still evolving and that he would 
await further study of those missiles and other lesser known and 
lesser developed possible alternatives as president 
after blasting republican blue smoke and mirrors on nuclear 
missiles dukakis dismissed the modernization issue this way 
so im going to work with the congress to find a sensible 
affordable way to maintain the effectiveness of the landbased 
missile leg of the triad 
dukakis committed himself to production and deployment of the 
stealth bomber which he pointedly noted was begun under president 
carter he visited general electrics ohio plant where engines for 
the stealth and other aircraft are made and was met with a chorus 
of boos from skeptical workers whose jobs depend on defense 
contracts 
though he didnt acknowledge it his pledge to complete the 
stealth appeared to go beyond previous qualified support for 
stealth research that left open a decision on deployment until the 
plane is fully tested 
dukakis restated his concerns about the b1 bomber which he 
says is too expensive and unreliable as a bomber capable of 
penetrating enemy territory he pointed to his support for the new 
trident ii submarinebased missile and for advanced cruise missiles 
on sdi the star wars antimissile defense project dukakis 
continued to ridicule reagan administration spending while at the 
same time backing 1 billion a year worth of sdi research about a 
quarter of current spending 
a week earlier dukakis raised eyebrows when at a news 
conference after addressing the american legion he suggested he 
would deploy a star wars program if it was essential to our 
national security but at the same time he said star wars 
deployment would violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
abm which he said remains in the nations best interest 
he has taken what is essentially a middle ground supporting 
some research on the hope a successful defense against nuclear 
weapons is possible through technology while opposing larger 
spending that he contends will come out of conventional forces or 
other programs 
in his georgetown speech dukakis spoke of star wars as 
undermining the stability of the nuclear balance 
if were going to make our defense dollars count weve got to 
stop pouring billions and billions into this program and do some 
hard thinking about what were trying to achieve he said

activity against israeli targets down from 1019 in the previous 
two weeks according to the davar newspaper 
in gaza city on wednesday assailants tossed a firebomb from the 
salah edin mosque at troops on night patrol in a jeep hitting the 
patrol commander in the leg the army and arab reports said 
an army spokesman said the arab boy was killed when soldiers

in london israeli foreign minister shimon peres today

about whether he wants peace with israel 
he said arafats palestine liberation organization was in a 
confused state torn between proponents of compromise with israel

at a news conference winding up a visit to britain peres did 
not spell out whether israel now agreed to talk to the plo and 
accept an independent palestinian state 
peres said arafats latest policy pronouncements during a visit 
last week to the european parliament in strasbourg france were 
an escape from the issue

iraq said today it would have been 
technically impossible for the iraqi army to use poison gas against 
kurds as washington has charged and indicated baghdad may not 
allow a un probe into the issue 
turkey said it would not agree to a un request to send experts 
into its country to determine whether iraq used poison gas against 
its kurdish population 
if the kurds are iraqis its an internal issue so what is 
the role of the united nations in this case iraqi defense 
minister adnan khairallah told a news conference 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar asked the iraqi 
government on tuesday to let un chemical experts conduct such an 
investigation in iraq 
khairallah said the offensive that drove tens of thousands of 
kurds into neighboring turkey lasted from aug 27 to sept 5 and 
cleaned out insurgents from a strip three to 12 miles wide along 
the border 
if it gas was used as the american media claims it was 
technically impossible particularly in the mountainous area he 
said 
the minister said chemical weapons create a heavy gas which 
would have clung to the valleys and made it impossible for iraqi 
troops to enter the area 
the area does not need to be attacked in such a way he said 
he said the strip was too narrow to use such weapons which 
should not be used in an area of less than 50 square kilometers 
19 square miles 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz acknowledged on july 1 that 
his country had used deadly chemical weapons in its 8yearold war 
with iran but he claimed the iranians had used them first 
the united nations and other international bodies have several 
times censured iraq and iran for using chemical weapons in the 
conflict 
the general rule is not to use it khairallah said but if 
there is this rule then each rule has an exception 
khairallah appeared to mute iraqi criticism of the united states 
over last fridays senate vote to impose economic sanctions against 
his country over use of chemical weapons 
the un investigation request prompted by the united states 
japan britain and west germany also called for a team of experts 
to be sent to turkey where 60000 kurds fleeing iraqi attacks have 
been given sanctuary 
in ankara a foreign ministry spokesman said turkey wouldnt 
accept the team 
although there has been no official request made to turkey 
yet our answer is negative for any future attempt of this sort 
inal batu the spokesman told reporters at a weekly briefing 
wednesday 
batu said turkey had uncovered no evidence of gas attacks 
turkey has repeatedly condemned the use of chemical weapons 
during the iraniraq war batu said but in our examination of 
those given sanctuary we found no evidence to support these 
claims of poison gas use 
batu said only two kurdish refugees had returned to iraq so far 
following a proclamation of amnesty by iraq for the kurds 
about 20 million kurds who live in a region where the borders of 
turkey iran and iraq converge have been fighting for independence 
for the past century 
after iran and iraq declared a ceasefire in their 8yearold 
war beginning aug 20 iraq turned on kurdish guerrillas the 
kurds claiming iraq was bombing their settlements with chemical 
gas fled into turkey

american industry operated at 837 percent of 
capacity in august the fourth consecutive monthly increase and the 
highest level in more than eight years 
but the slight 01 percentage point increase from july did not 
raise concerns about inflation because it was attributed entirely 
to a surge in activity at utilities producing electricity to power 
air conditioners during the summer heat wave 
the federal reserve board said the overall operating rate at 
us factories mines and utilities was the highest since march 
1980 when it was also 837 percent the 01 percent gain followed 
a much sharper 06 percent rise in july 
it was the fourth increase in a row at utilities where rates 
rose from 807 percent in july to 824 percent in august the 869 
percent operating rate at electrical utilities in august was last 
exceeded in 1979 
however the operating rate for manufacturing plants eased in 
august to 838 percent down 01 percent from the month before the 
rate for the mining sector which includes oil and gas drilling 
fell from 830 percent in july to 829 percent 
analysts have been worried by a steady rise in operating rates 
at factories fearing that prices would rise if shortages occurred 
because manufacturers had to strain to produce both exports and 
goods for us consumers 
economists believe an overall operating rate of 85 percent 
clearly signals a pickup in inflation 
the rate at factories making durable goods big ticket items 
expected to last three or more years held steady at 823 percent 
in august while the rate at factories producing nondurable goods 
fell from 861 percent in july to 859 percent

michael k deavers attorneys presented 
evidence today that the former white house aides judgment and 
memory were impaired by alcoholism when questioned under oath about 
his lobbying activities 
the evidence that deaver was an alcoholic at all times 
relevant to this case was offered to give the court 
understanding of the offense behavior for which mr deaver was 
convicted defense attorney randall j turk told us district 
judge thomas penfield jackson 
the former deputy white house chief of staff and close friend of 
president reagan and his wife nancy is scheduled to be sentenced 
sept 23 for three counts of lying under oath about his lobbying 
activities 
he could receive up to five years and a 6800 fine for each of 
the three convictions 
testimony by doctors who treated deaver for alcoholism shortly 
after he left the white house in may 1985 would show deavers 
memory was impaired both by alcohol withdrawal sedatives he was 
given while hospitalized for two days turk said 
it was during this period that deaver had telephone contacts 
with reagan administration officials about trans world airlines 
attempt to stop a takeover bid by financier carl icahn according 
to evidence at the trial 
deaver was found guilty among other things of saying he 
couldnt recall any contacts with thentransportation secretary 
elizabeth dole her deputy james burnley and roger porter a white 
house aide 
possibly all of the three contacts took place while he was in 
the hospital while he was going through acute alcohol withdrawal 
and while he was sedated turk said 
the doctors would say that deavers subsequent failure to 
recall what he was doing at the time was quite understandable 
but independent counsel whitney north seymour jr argued that 
deavers treatment records would show there is nothing to support 
any finding that his memory was impaired 
mr deavers ability to recall was absolutely functioning it 
was just that he decided to select what he wanted to recall said 
seymour who is expected to call a medical expert to rebut 
testimony deavers lawyers plan to present during the twoday 
proceeding 
turk said that deaver had been an alcoholic for many years 
before he sought treatment and that both his parents are recovering 
alcoholics 
before he testified in may 1986 before a house subcommittee 
deaver took a valium tablet that doctors say may have impaired his 
memory when questioned about his lobbying activities turk said 
deaver was convicted of one count of lying to the house energy 
and commerce investigations subcommittee the other two perjury 
convictions stem from statements he made to a grand jury that was 
impaneled after deaver requested an independent counsel to 
investigate charges he violated conflictofinterest laws by 
lobbying former reagan administration colleagues

washington correspondent vittorio zucconi in la repubblica 
liberal of rome sept 14 just 50 days from the elections it 
is still not clear which america isolationist protectionist 
attacking or retreating president bush or president dukakis has 
in mind 
the answer is not in their words but in their actions 
each is trying to conquer the same part of the voters they are 
both eyeing what once was called the center and today is defined 
as the reagan democrats 
bush is afraid of being unmasked and seen as he really is an 
elitist and aristocratic republican not a reactionary one and far 
away from the reaganist populism 
dukakis doesnt dare to present himself as the liberal he 
has always been someone who believes in a reasoned but strong role 
of the public hand in the economic and civic life of the nation

dukakis is vulnerable to the republican attack on his lack of 
foreign policy experience dukakis has the bad luck not to have 
been part of the broad public majority that supported the reagan 
administrations military interventions over the years 
that is an admirable but dangerous weakness indeed his 
notion that foreign policy should be carried out according to 
international rules of the game has no sex appeal with the voters 
the more americas role in the world is brought to the fore in 
the campaign the more points george bush will collect

yediot ahronot conservative of tel aviv sept 14 the 
reason for the relatively small gap between the two candidates is 
that the middle class even though it is generally satisfied with 
its situation is nervous and concerned about the future 
the real campaign is beginning only now the television 
campaign has not yet begun and the two television debates between 
bush and dukakis and vice presidential candidates bentsen and 
quayle have yet to take place 
dukakis has a reputation for being a better debater than bush 
and bentsen also seems to have an advantage over the younger 
quayle the general feeling is that if anything happens to the 
president bentsen is far more suited to take over than quayle

leaders of the federal governments judicial 
branch said today they want congress to create 73 new judgeships 
but a judicial spokesman said the realities are that nothing 
will happen during an election year 
the us judicial conference which sets policy for the nations 
federal courts voted to request the new judgeships as a means of 
eliminating backlogs and easing workloads spokesman david sellers 
said 
case filings have increased sellers said noting that the 
last increase in the judicial workforce was in 1984 when congress 
authorized creation of 86 judgeships 
the conference 28 judges who act as a board of directors for 
the federal courts approved the judgeship request in a closed 
meeting wednesday 
the request seeks 14 new appeals court judges and 59 trial 
judges but 22 of the trial judgeships would last only five years 
the conference in 1986 sought 56 additional trial court judges 
and 13 appeals court judges a proposal that went nowhere in 
congress 
the request announced today represents an adjustment of the 1986 
request 
there currently are 158 appeals court judges and 548 trial 
judges 
sellers said the judicial conference also approved spending 
70000 to 90000 on closedcircuit television cameras to monitor 
high risk trials 
he said stationary cameras capable of scanning a courtroom will 
be installed in 10 or 12 major cities the cameras will provide a 
video monitor feed to a marshals office 
the us marshals service proposed the security measure 
the conference also authorized a twoyear experiment in making 
videotapes the formal record of court proceedings 
the experiment to be conducted in six trial courts and two 
appeals courts is noteworthy because federal courts ban electronic 
coverage of courtroom proceedings 
sellers said the experiment patterned after a program already 
in place in kentucky state courts is aimed at determining whether 
videotapes should replace written records during the experiment 
videotaping will supplement a stenographic record 
public access to the videotapes is something that has not been 
determined yet sellers said

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle said today he was not worried about either michael dukakis 
comments or a new poll concerning doubts about his qualifications 
for national office 
i am delighted the governor of massachusetts wants to talk 
about my qualifications for being vice president as compared to his 
qualifications for being president quayle said at a news 
conference 
he is the one who does not have the comprehension and 
understanding of national security issues quayle said i will 
be delighted to compare my qualifications to his 
asked about a new cbsnew york times poll in which just 
onethird of the respondents said quayle was qualified to be 
president compared to threefifths who said democrat lloyd bentsen 
was quayle said 
were going to continue to talk about the issues of the 
campaign in due time the american people are going to see the 
real dan quayle 
the indiana senator also indicated he was tired of hearing 
dukakis refer to him as j danforth quayle a tactic the governor 
has adopted in recent days the name quayle said comes from a 
friend of his family who was killed in world war ii 
that is my namesake it is not a family name quayle said 
one day earlier quayle denounced demonstrators at an event in 
new mexico and declared hoarsely after a spirited shouting match 
with them im just beginning to have fun 
the republican vice presidential candidates tactic appeared to 
mark a change in campaign strategy though such protests have 
occurred on many of his appearances most of them have been ignored 
or dismissed by the candidate 
but the event wednesday at the new mexico state fair in 
albuquerque turned into a display of the senators youthful 
exuberance his aides who acknowledged that the senator had known 
the protesters would be present appeared delighted with the 
results 
he just decided to take them on said david prosperi 
quayles spokesman 
the indiana senator who had his first press conference today 
since sept 1 has had little spontaneous contact with the media 
this week during his midwestern campaign swing 
instead his media events have been limited to the staged 
rallies such as those wednesday in new mexico and colorado 
in albuquerque quayle was serenaded by a pair of mexicangarbed 
balladeers and heralded by a mariache band before he rose to 
address a rally of several hundred state fair goers 
dozens of people holding dukakis signs began chanting go home 
quayle in the most vociferous protests quayle has faced recently 
some held signs reading quayle stayed home to feather his 
nest and quayle ducked vietnam a reference to allegations 
quayle pulled strings to get into the national guard and avoid 
combat in vietnam 20 years ago 
as you listen to this babble over here you cant help but 
think of the dukakis positions quayle told the crowd they 
have no positions theyre loud but they dont have any ideas 
as his supporters cheered quayle warmed to the theme his voice 
growing hoarser as he shouted over the chants im just beginning 
to have fun 
they have the freedom of speech but so do we and speak we 
will he said 
he denounced the democrats and their supporters as the party 
of doom 
all they can do is say no he said 
asked by reporters later if he thought he overreacted to the 
crowd quayle said no we had a good discussion they have 
their right to free speech and so do we 
at an earlier rally in colorado springs colo quayle also ran 
into hecklers he said they keep walking around in circles 
while we have a message to talk about 
quayles message this week has been to portray dukakis as 
wrongheaded on matters of defense and national security 
he told a denver audience that wednesdays testlaunching by the 
soviets of an ss25 mobile intercontinental ballistic missile 
showed the united states needs to develop mobile strategic 
missiles something he said would never happen under dukakis 
the soviets have two mobile icbm missiles the ss25 and the 
ss24 
the united states does not have mobile intercontinental 
ballistic missiles although two such missiles the midgetman and 
the rail mobile mx have been under development us 
intercontinental ballistic missiles presently are in concrete silos 
buried in the ground 
dukakis is opposing modernization of our landbased missile 
force while the soviets are already ahead of us quayle said 
the governor has already stated that he opposes flight testing 
of our missiles so even if he wanted to develop a deterrent his 
flight test ban would prevent us from ensuring that the system 
would work quayle said

a senate panel today voted to seize a 
development site adjacent to the manassas national battlefield park 
in suburban virginia rejecting several compromise plans that would 
have acquired only part of the parcel 
the energy and natural resources committee approved a measure 
that would authorize congress to acquire the entire 542acre 
william center development tract close two heavilytraveled 
commuter routes running through the civil war battlefield and pay 
up to 30 million for construction of new roads around the park 
the measure introduced by sen dale bumpers dark and 
identical to a bill that passed the house by a 30798 vote last 
month prevailed over a compromise measure by sen john warner 
rva that would have acquired just 80 acres of the tract warner 
claimed that his proposal would preserve the most important 
historical aspects of the site at a cheaper price 
however bumpers maintained that the entire tract was 
historically significant 
if we dont act to preserve that property you can go down 
there three weeks from now and it will be gone for all intents 
and purposes bumpers said in reference to the frenetic building 
pace developer john t hazel is carrying out on the property 
itll be a shopping mall 
warner estimated that his measure would cost only 20 million 
while estimates for the bumpers proposal are 60 million or higher 
sen j bennett johnston dla the committee chairman said he 
hoped the bill would reach the senate floor by next week 
one potential hangup for the legislation is that it has not gone 
through the normal budget process and could be subject to a 
parliamentary challenge on the senate floor if such a challenge 
arises 60 votes will be needed to override the procedural question 
in addition president reagan has already threatened to veto any 
legislation similar to the bumpers bill 
hazel is planning to build a 12 million squarefoot shopping 
mall 17 million square feet of office space and 560 homes 
adjacent to the 4200acre park historians claim that the 
development which traffic experts say would generate 80000 cars 
per day would ruin the historic integrity of the stillrustic 
ground on which the first and second battles of manassas were 
fought 
in addition the development site includes a hill from which 
confederate gen robert e lee commanded his troops in second 
manassas historians also claim that union and confederate dead lie 
in unmarked graves scattered throughout the development area

voting on a contract offer seeking 161 million in wage cuts 
eastern is seeking cuts of 10 percent to 20 percent for 
mechanics and sharper cuts for the lessskilled workers a 
maintenance worker with three years seniority for example would 
be cut from 1347 an hour to 672 an hour the offer would also 
cut vacation time and other benefits 
the company and its largest union have been in mediation since 
january eastern wants the mediator to declare an impasse leading 
to a 30day coolingoff period management said would spur a 
settlement the union believes the company wants a strike 
the machinists leadership scheduled the vote on the contract 
offer to rebut management claims it doesnt represent rankandfile 
sentiments in negotiations management has said the contract vote 
is another delaying tactic 
the machinists still represent nearly onethird of eastern 
employees but the union and company estimate its current numbers 
at about 9000 possibly below that because of layoffs firings 
and attrition the union had 13000 members when the texas air 
corp took over two years ago 
the members put their votes in sealed envelopes and turn them 
into their union stewards who will send them to union 
headquarters general chairman roy anderson said 
workers at other company bases began voting thursday while 
miamibased union employees will vote monday the machinists union

the soviet union should cut mandatory military 
service in half because it is not threatened with attack leading 
dissident andrei d sakharov said in an interview published 
thursday 
the weekly political magazine new times quoted the 67yearold 
nobel peace prize laureate and nuclear physicist as saying the 
kremlin should cut service time now two years to reduce the size 
of the military and use the resources elsewhere 
at present the soviet union is not threatened by any 
aggression he said there are no hitlerites now 
in addition to nazi germanys aggression under dictator adolf 
hitler world war ii was brought on by soviet dictator josef 
stalins mistakes and crimes which frightened the west he said 
but he said the soviet union and the wests attitude toward it 
have changed 
there is really not a single government which would threaten 
the ussr with attack there isnt even with a halving of soviet 
armed forces this is absolutely excluded sakharov told new times 
a reduction of the soviet armed forces would help improve 
conditions for scaling back conventional weapons in europe and the 
entire world he said a force reduction also would allow the 
soviet union to transfer resources and manpower now used for the 
military to civilian uses he said 
since the united states and soviet union agreed in december to 
eliminate their arsenals of mediumrange nuclear weapons many 
western politicians have called on the soviet union to cut back 
conventional arsenals in which they claim the kremlin has an 
advantage 
new times said it interviewed sakharov while he was in the black 
sea resort of dagomys at an international conference of scientists 
this month 
sakharov who was virtually blacklisted before mikhail s 
gorbachev became the soviet leader has been quoted with increasing 
frequency in the soviet press in the past six months 
last december the weekly moscow news published a letter from 
sakharov proposing that the kremlin change its position on how to 
cut the superpowers longrange nuclear arsenals 
the scientist helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb and later 
was a founder of the soviet human rights movement he was awarded 
the nobel peace prize in 1975 
in 1980 he was exiled to the city of gorky for criticizing the 
soviet intervention in afghanistan gorbachev who has waged a 
campaign for openness on selected topics allowed him to return to 
moscow in december 1986

trucks equipment and personnel from two dozen 
federal agencies are standing ready to respond along the texas 
coast if hurricane gilbert comes ashore there officials said today 
its fair to say that we recognize that we face the greatest 
weather threat we have ever faced in our part of the country we 
want to be certain our preparation is up to the challenge sen 
phil gramm rtexas told a briefing at the federal emergency 
management agency which coordinates disaster assistance 
gramm and fema official grant peterson said the paperwork has 
been prepared so that president reagan can immediately declare a 
disaster and set in motion relief efforts 
we are taking the hurricane very very seriously as we would 
urge all of the citizens in the area to do peterson said 
maj gen jd smith of the defense department said the pentagon 
has streamlined its procedures to ensure that this is not a 
bureaucratic slowmoving turtle 
peterson said trucks at femas denton texas regional 
headquarters are loaded down with gear such as communications 
equipment and electric generators and are prepared to move as soon 
as needed 
he and gramm said federal agencies will be dispatching 
spanishspeaking personnel and spanishlanguage forms and pamphlets 
to help communication with the large hispanic population along the 
coast 
private groups were also joining in the relief effort 
the american red cross said wednesday it had begun sending 
emergency supplies to four hurricane watch districts being 
established at several texas cities 
the red cross said thousands of blankets cots comfort kits and 
cleanup kits were on their way to corpus christi harlingen 
houston and beaumont texas in addition volunteers and staff 
members have been sent to san antonio texas and birmingham ala 
which have been established as staging areas for deployment after 
the storm hits 
gramm said wednesday that an undetermined number of active duty 
military personnel and equipment including trucks helicopters and 
bulldozers would be sent from fort hood in killeen texas and 
possibly fort bliss in el paso he said 
gramm also announced that the army corps of engineers had opened 
an emergency office in galveston to handle flood control and 
emergency construction along the coast 
the idea is the better organized we are in advance of the 
potential dangers of the hurricane the less we will have in terms 
of property damage and personal injury he said 
separately the agency for international development said the 
united states was sending 396000 worth of relief supplies to 
jamaica including 360 rolls of plastic sheeting 200 tents 3966 
water jugs 18 water tanks 10 chain saw kits and 9600 cotton 
blankets 
a portion of the assistance was flown by the military from a 
us stockpile in panama on wednesday 
partners of the americas a group of 60 countries including the 
united states and nations in latin america and the caribbean 
announced it had set up a special relief fund to help the people of 
jamaica and mexicos yucatan peninsula 
the group is seeking cash donations to purchase roofing 
materials plastic sheeting strong soaps disinfectants 
mattresses beds and bed linens said william reese president of 
the group which was established in 1964 as part of the alliance for 
progress 
the group is not in a position to accept clothing or food 
donations reese said 
individuals interested in contributing to either relief effort 
can do so through their local red cross chapter or send donations 
to 
the american red cross po box 37243 washington dc 20013 
and 
partners of the americas hurricane gilbert relief fund 1424 k

officials said thursday that they are intensifying their efforts to 
block the importation of dangerous toys 
the crackdown is a joint effort of the consumer product safety 
commission and the customs service 
we are serving notice to importers and foreign toy 
manufacturers that the commission and the customs service will not 
tolerate violative toys being shipped into us commerce said 
terrence m scanlon chairman of the safety agency 
so far this year the two agencies have blocked the entry of 
478000 toys with a retail value of 137 million scanlon reported 
most imports enter the country in september through november in 
anticipation of the holiday toybuying season he said thus the 
two agencies are looking closer at imported toys during this 
season with a particular emphasis on toys with small parts that 
may present a choking hazard and high lead levels in paint

house speaker jim wright is urging the 
chambers ethics committee to wrap up its case against him in the 
next month but one member of the panel said today that timetable 
might be difficult to meet 
we seem to be raising more questions than answers said rep 
john t myers rind a member of the panel formally known as the 
committee on standards of official conduct myers said the 
committee has an obligation to be thorough and said he believed 
most members see the probe taking longer than they had hoped 
the committee met behind closed doors for the second straight 
day this time to review progress in the case with its special 
counsel chicago attorney richard j phelan on wednesday the 
speaker himself spent 5 hours presenting his defense to the panel 
it was very friendly very frank very candid and open 
wright dtexas said of his unusual daylong closeddoor session 
with the committee wright was accompanied by his attorney william 
oldaker 
i said lets come to a resolution of it after all the 
facts are clear if they discover that i have done something wrong 
inadvertently they should say that but wright said he did not 
anticipate such a result 
nobody has suggested in this whole days hearing that i did 
he said 
committee chairman rep julian dixon dcalif said wrights 
testimony was completed but he declined to say how far the 
investigation had progressed 
wright declined to discuss with reporters the details of his 
testimony which was given under oath but said i answered every 
question 
in a statement issued by wrights office he said he had given 
the panel a factual clarification of the erroneous incomplete 
and misleading charges which have been made 
the committee since june has been investigating charges that 
wright received unduly high royalties on a book he wrote with help 
from taxpaid staff and published through a longtime friend in fort 
worth who had done campaign work for the speaker 
other allegations are that wright improperly intervened with 
federal regulators on behalf of texas businesses and that he used a 
fort worth condominium owned by a family with whom he had business 
ties 
it should be abundantly clear that the charges against me hold 
no water whatsoever wright said i believe that is clear to 
the committee 
wright also said the investigation is a reminder that members 
of congress do live in glass houses we should be prepared to 
conduct our affairs with such rectitude that people cant find 
anything wrong 
but he said he fully expected that the investigation will be 
completed by the time the house adjourns in early october i do 
not want it left dangling i want it resolved he said 
he pronounced himself very very happy to finally be called 
to testify ive looked forward to this for more than three 
months he said 
the ethics committee has subpoenaed numerous witnesses in 
connection with the complaints filed against wright by his chief 
accuser rep newt gingrich rga and already has interviewed 
many of them wednesdays session was wrights first appearance 
before the panel 
wright brought with him several dozen books which he called 
part of the documentation one group of books was volumes he 
said were published under 50 percent royalty agreements by 
smallscale publishers an additional 50 books on a cart wheeled 
into the hearing room were by members of congress and contained 
acknowledgements of help from taxpaid staff members the speaker 
said 
among books on wrights list prepared with staff help was a 1986 
volume strategic defense and the western alliance by sen dan 
quayle the gop vice presidential nominee man of the house a 
1987 book by former house speaker thomas p oneill jr was 
written with help from 32 staff members according to the list 
one allegation against wright is that he made unduly high 
royalties on his book reflections of a public man which was 
prepared in part by workers on his congressional office payroll 
expenses of one aide matthew cossolotto to fly to fort worth to 
complete the book were paid from wrights congressional office 
expense account 
wright made more than 55000 in royalties on the book which 
was published in 1984 by a wright friend in fort worth who also had 
handled hundreds of thousands of dollars of campaign work for the 
speaker wrights royalty was 55 percent of each copys 595 
selling price 
the speaker said he took the books to show the ethics committee 
that what he had done was a very customary thing

the us industrial operating rate rose for 
the fifth consecutive month in august but economists played down 
the inflationary effect of the increase because it was entirely 
attributable to a temporary summer surge at utilities 
the federal reserve board said thursday that the nations 
factories mines and utilities operated at 837 percent of capacity 
last month a 01 percentage point increase over july when the 
rate had risen a sharp 06 percent 
it was the fifth consecutive increase and the highest rate in 
more than eight years industry last operated at 837 percent of 
capacity in march 1980 
economists believe an overall operating rate approaching 85 
percent signals higher prices as industry strains to meet demand 
the operating rate at utilities jumped by 17 percentage points 
in august to 824 percent the rate at plants churning out 
electricity to meet the demand of air conditioners during the 
summer heat wave soared 19 percentage points to 869 percent the 
highest since 1979 
however analysts expect the strain on utilities to ease as the 
weather cools and they pointed to a slight decline in the operating 
rate in the closelywatched manufacturing sector the first since 
february as the more significant number in thursdays report 
overall the manufacturing rate eased from 839 percent in july 
to 838 percent in august 
the rate at factories making durable goods big ticket items 
expected to last three or more years held steady at 823 percent 
in august while the rate at factories producing nondurable goods 
fell from 861 percent in july to 859 percent 
i think industrial capacity has peaked thats the highest 
its going to get for awhile said michael k evans a private 
economist in washington thats good news for inflation 
fighters 
evans said the export boom of the past year which has pushed 
manufacturing operating rates up by 23 percentage points since 
august 1987 is starting to wane 
exports are still growing but at a more normal pace he 
said 
durable goods manufacturing held steady despite a 05 percentage 
point jump in operating rates at steel and other metal 
manufacturing plants the august level 91 percent was 8 
percentage points higher than a year ago 
however rates at auto plants fell to 704 percent last month 
down from 714 percent in july and a peak this year of 753 percent 
in june 
the rate for the mining sector which includes oil and gas 
drilling fell from 830 percent in july to 829 percent

republican george bush today ripped into 
michael dukakis economic record as governor and said the 
democrats pledge to do for the nation what he did for 
massachusetts sounds like a threat 
bush told a packed ballroom breakfast at the commonwealth club 
that dukakis has presided over an era when massachusetts taxing 
and spending has increased more than in any other state 
my opponent still says he wants to do for the nation what he 
has done for massachusetts that slogan is beginning to sound more 
and more like a threat he said 
bush challenged dukakis to state whether he would repeal the 
reagan administrations 1981 tax cuts 
if he thinks they were such a bad idea does he plan to repeal 
the 25 percent tax cuts which i supported for the american people 
i think the american people have a right to know bush said 
bush ridiculed the dukakis claim of an economic massachusetts 
miracle saying the state has turned a surplus into a growing 
budget deficit 
if this were the olympics his composite score would make him 
the gold medal winner in the taxandspend competition bush said 
on wednesday night bush told a 1000aperson fundraiser that 
he he is the candidate capable of bringing the nations current 
peace and prosperity into the next decade 
it is legitimate to ask what is the end purpose of economic 
growth is it just to be rich what a shallow ambition is there 
really any satisfaction to be had in being the fattest country 
he said prosperity would bring greater strides in the arts and 
sciences and things of the spirit but it also means just giving a 
helping hand to a fellow citizen who needs it 
in unusually poetic comments bush sought to elaborate on his 
vow to make america a kinder gentler nation a phrase he used 
in his acceptance speech at the republican national convention last 
month 
he told the gathering he is almost haunted by the lives being 
lead by the children of our inner cities but he said government 
cant solve their problems and that he hoped as president he could 
be a gentle persuader to rally our people to help our children 
a newly published poll completed sept 12 showed that bush had 
overcome a deficit of 16 percentage points in late july and was 
running neckandneck with dukakis in california 
according to the california poll released thursday dukakis 
lead of 52 percent to 36 percent over bush six weeks ago had shrunk 
to 46 percent to 45 percent which is a tie within the polls 4 
percent margin of error poll director mervin field called it a 
phenomenal reversal but cautioned that people can easily change 
their minds 
as he spoke at the fundraiser held at the luxury st francis 
hotel about 400 demonstrators gathered across the street in union 
square some pushed over police barricades spilling out into the 
street stopping automobile traffic and the citys famed cable cars 
the protesters chanted wheres george and money for aids 
stop the war us out of el salvador police said at least one 
person was arrested 
at a colorful rally in chinatown earlier in the evening bush 
said voters must decide whether to keep going with the policies 
that have launched the longest period of economic growth in history 
or you can choose to go backward 
only one man is pledged to build a better america through low 
taxes and high opportunity and only one man wants laws against 
crime tougher laws and creative programs for our schools bush 
told the raucous crowd only one person only one person can 
carry americas peace and prosperity into the 1990s 
i am here to tell you that i am that man bush said 
the vice president received a blessing from a buddhist monk 
described as the great master and watched as young men dressed 
in costumes of yellow and red dancing dragons made their way 
through the city streets 
bush supporters outnumbered the noisy hecklers who chanted 
down with bush and carried signs opposing offshore oil 
drilling some democrats in the crowd distributed fortune cookies 
with messages reading vote dukakis and where was george 
a refrain from the democratic national convention 
california with the largest number of electoral votes 47 is 
a key battleground and bush is spending two and a half days 
campaigning in the state 
earlier at a rally in fresno at sunmaid growers a cooperative 
of 1500 raisin growers in the san joaquin valley bush accused 
dukakis of using the phrase economic patriotism as a code 
word for protectionism 
we will not have it he told the rally of several hundred 
people

and doors with plywood and shatterproofing hurricane tape 
offshore oil workers headed inland 
classes were canceled or cut short today in some communities 
southwestern bell co bracing for downed phone lines loaned 
cellular phones to corpus christi and other cities authorities set 
up shelters and stockpiled sandbags 
the military began flying aircraft inland from coastal bases in 
mississippi and texas to wait out the storm at midland 
international airport 
it sounds facetious but people can stay as long as we can 
fingerprint them so we can identify them later said bob 
pinkerton jr mayor in the coastal resort of south padre island 
where 1000 residents were told to evacuate 
early today gilbert appeared headed for texas possibly hitting 
land by friday afternoon the national weather service issued a 
hurricane warning this morning for the southern half of the 
370mile texas coast from brownsville to port oconnor a stretch 
that includes corpus christi mexicos northern coast also had a 
hurricane warning

brownsville moving westnorthwest at about 15 mph the weather 
service said 
a hurricane watch remained in effect for the remainder of the 
texas coast from port oconnor north to port arthur 
the highest probabilities that we have are in the brownsville 
texas area as far as the center is concerned robert sheets 
director of the national hurricane center in miami said on cbss 
this morning if it takes the north turn it could actually 
rake a good portion of the texas coast 
those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairly 
tight close to the center but the impacts are going to be felt 
over most of the texas area 
the giant hurricane considered one of the strongest ever was 
blamed for dozens of deaths in the caribbean and left 500000 
jamaicans homeless before it struck mexicos yucatan peninsula on 
wednesday forcing thousands to evacuate 
it weakened somewhat as it passed over the peninsula falling 
from a category 5 the strongest rank to a category 3 as top 
sustained winds eased to 120 mph from 175 mph but forecasters said 
they expected it to go back up to a category 4 now that it was back 
over the gulf with winds of at least 130 mph

texas medical branch on galveston island were being evacuated said

on the bolivar peninsula outside galveston bay most beachgoers 
and about 3000 residents left by sundown wednesday packing the 
bolivar ferry to galveston all day long said police chief farris 
collier of crystal beach 
some of them are being stubborn and are saying theyre staying 
no matter what he said but if it hits here they wont be 
here any more 
if i wasnt the city manager id evacuate myself but im 
required to stay galvestons doug matthews said today on abcs 
good morning america weve never seen anything like this 
type of hurricane in the gulf its going to kill 
galveston mayor jan coggeshall said on cbs that her greatest 
fear was that people would decide to stay and wait out the storm 
two galveston residents were arrested for trying to sell plywood 
for windows and doorways at an inflated price just hours after the 
city council passed an emergency ordinance designed to stem price 
gouging by merchants 
hurricane frenzy also was apparent in cameron parish la a 
thin layer of lush marsh just above sea level that has been a 
frequent front door for hurricanes over the years 
the parish of 10000 residents boasts about 5000 head of cattle 
well be working all night to get them out francis bride a 
lake charles physician said as he helped shove the rumps of balky 
steers into a packed trailer 
the impact of the 450milewide storm was felt even in areas not 
expected to be hit by gilbert 
state emergency officials in montgomery ala began making 
preparations to receive thousands of people who could take refuge 
there from the storm 
we did a survey of hotels from montgomery to mobile and found 
that people from mississippi and louisiana were making hotel 
reservations in large large numbers said j danny cooper 
director of the alabama emergency management agency 
floridas gov bob martinez canceled a trade mission to france 
because of the storm 
once it gets in the gulf theres only one way out to have a 
landfall said martinez its that kind of storm where you 
dont sit around and have a hurricane party 
in texas clements late wednesday suspended elections planned 
for harris and brazoria counties 
in corpus christi where hurricane allen killed two people in 
1980 all five school districts called off class for today and 
friday even though it wasnt known where or when gilbert would 
strike

employees are more likely to sue now 
when theyve been fired than they were at the start of the decade 
according to a study released thursday 
the average employees initial demand was slightly less than the 
average payment after trial and businesses considering legal 
expenses only would be better off paying initial demands rather 
than going to trial the study said 
the study was conducted by james n dertouzos elaine holland 
and patricia ebener of the rand corps institute for civil 
justice rand is a nonprofit private thinktank that analyzes 
national security and public welfare issues 
the researchers reviewed nationwide case law and trial patterns 
through january 1987 sampled los angeles superior court filings 
since 1980 and analyzed california trials from 1980 to 1986 
trials were 2 times more likely in california indiana 
massachusetts montana and north dakota which rand described as 
the five states with the most liberal interpretations of the law 
the study found that in los angeles superior court alone 
wrongful termination lawsuits grew from 90 in 1980 to 600 in 1986 
the researchers found in the california cases that initial jury 
awards averaged 650000 but that figure was inflated by a few 
multimilliondollar judgments the median award was 177000 
however posttrial reductions in jury awards to successful 
plaintiffs averaged 45 percent 
the typical california plaintiff was 45 years old eight years 
of seniority and yearly earnings of 36000 more than 89 percent 
of plaintiffs were white and nearly 69 percent were men middle 
managers accounted for 398 percent of filings compared to 136 
percent by executives 
in 806 percent of firings the employers claimed inadequate 
performance external economic factors were cited in the other 
discharges 
jury awards rose with the plaintiffs age peaking at age 50 
womens awards appeared to be considerably lower than mens 
the study found 
dertouzos concluded unless you have a very good case dont 
bother very few people are getting big payments if you deserve to 
be fired the likelihood of getting big money is very small 
attorneys collected 40 percent of plaintiffs winnings the 
study found and in california that meant the average lawyers 
share was 81000 lawyers for both sides collectively pocketed 60 
percent of the money changing hands in wrongful discharge cases 
the study said

unhealthy air is blanketing many of the worlds 
cities subjecting many of the worlds 18 billion urban dwellers 
to respiratory ailments and other health hazards according to a 
un study released thursday 
the study billed as the first comprehensive global assessment 
of air pollution said many countries have made progress in 
reducing air pollution but that the situation is still very 
serious especially in third world nations 
the 100page survey prepared by the world health organization 
and the un environment program is based on data from up to 15 
years of monitoring in more than 60 countries 
dr michael gwynne director of the environment programs global 
monitoring system said the survey represents the most 
comprehensive detailed and informative study ever carried out 
the study focuses on two main pollutants sulfur dioxide and 
suspended particulate matter emissions of sulfur dioxide are 
estimated at up to 180 million tons per year and emissions of 
smoke and dust are estimated at more than 100 million tons a year 
continuous exposure especially among children can result in 
acute or chronic respiratory problems 
dr gwynne said 625 million people mostly in developing 
countries are exposed to unacceptable levels of sulfur dioxide 
and that 550 million more live just within the range of tolerable 
levels set by the world health organization 
he said dust and smoke are worse and estimated that about 125 
billion city dwellers live in unacceptable conditions and 200 
million more live in conditions that are only marginal 
data from 54 cities suggest that the average annual sulfur 
dioxide level during the 198084 monitoring period was highest in 
milan italy 
but seoul rio de janeiro and paris were also among the cities 
where the average range was above who guidelines melbourne 
australia tel aviv israel toronto chicago and munich were among 
those with the lowest averages 
a separate 33city survey said sulfur dioxide concentrations 
were declining in 21 cities all in the industrialized west while 
the upward trend was strongest in new delhi india in poland it 
soared by 80 percent within a decade 
emissions in the soviet union were not included in the listing 
but the study cited an estimate of 28 million tons in 1979 well 
above the united states estimated total of 23 million tons 
suspended particle emissions also decreased in western 
countries while going up spectacularly in poland 
in 18 out of 41 cities the annual suspended particle emissions 
average was above the who limit kuwait topped the list which also 
included new delhi beijing jakarta indonesia and manila 
philippines chicago was the only western city above the who limit 
the study said nitrogen oxides produced mainly by automobiles 
are rising in several of the larger european cities including 
london amsterdam and frankfurt west germany it noted that most 
european countries do not have the stringent standards for 
automobile emissions that the united states and japan have 
implemented 
the issue of nitrogen oxides is also of concern because of their 
role in the formation of other oxidants including ozone the study 
said there are worrying indications that ozone levels are on 
the rise in many european and north american cities 
the study is less detailed on emissions of carbon monoxide 
which are believed to exceed the combined emissions of all other 
major air pollutants 
again most western countries reported reduced carbon monoxide 
emissions while they were up in poland and hungary increased use 
of unleaded gasoline contributed to an even sharper reduction in 
estimated lead emissions in western countries with the united 
states total down from 147000 tons a year in 197375 to 21100 
tons a decade later 
in developing countries automobile emissions of carbon monoxide 
and lead are increasingly major issues of concern the report says 
careful urban planning is needed to minimize the buildup 
of these pollutants it says

the reagan administrations top health 
official said thursday he will not take a position on a proposed 
white house ban on using intentionally aborted fetal tissue for 
medical treatment until a national institutes of health advisory 
committee has completed its review of the issue 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen told reporters 
that while he remains personally opposed to abortion there 
are some good pros and some good cons about using aborted fetal 
tissue for experimental treatment for parkinsons and other 
diseases 
he said a task force of the best minds going was studing the 
issue at a threeday nih meeting and that he had no intention of 
taking a position until the review is completed probably not for 
several weeks 
bowen said he could not predict whether the issue will be 
resolved during the last few months of the reagan administration 
even though a white house official gary bauer is pushing for 
quick implementation of an outright ban 
inasmuch as abortions are legal being unable to utilize the 
tissue would result in the waste of a resource that is 
livesaving and curing for several diseases bowen told reporters 
at a breakfast meeting he spoke at about the same time the nih 
panel he referred to was opening a second day of hearings to focus 
on moral and ethical issues 
bowen said it was his judgment that we cant in a good common 
sense way come up with an answer until we hear from the advisory 
panel 
if i had parkinsons i think i would want some of those 
transplanted cells said bowen emphasizing that such a 
personal observation does not eliminate the broader ethical 
questions 
he made clear he did not feel rushed to recommend an 
administration position even though a bauer memo disclosed in news 
accounts last week instructed bowen to make his comments by last 
friday 
we have not responded bowen said i do not know whether 
it was a direct order from the president and i dont know that i 
will know unless someone tells me 
procedurally the special nih committee will make its 
recommendations to a standing nih advisory committee dec 1 and 
that panel in turn will make a recommendation to nih director james 
b wyngaarden the nih director reports to bowen through dr robert 
e windom who ordered a temporary ban on federally financed fetal 
tissue research pending consideration of moral and ethical issues 
father don mccarthy a roman catholic church leader from 
cincinnati told the nih committee the issue draws a clear 
distinction between induced abortions and natural abortions 
one might say that the american public becomes accomplices 
after the fact for these induced abortions if its institutions 
embrace policies that could tend to assign a medical value to 
having an abortion he said 
several witnesses and committee members used the term custom 
pregnancy as short hand for the concern that a woman might become 
pregnant just to produce a fetus for abortion and subsequent 
research use either for financial reward or in hopes of helping a 
sick relative 
i dont think people are as callous about abortion as that 
premise suggests said thomas h murray director of the center 
for biomedical ethics at the case western reserve university in 
cleveland if we get to that point im deeply worried 
murray said he was convinced that guidelines could be drawn to 
insure that a womans decision to have an abortion would be kept 
totally separate from the decision to allow the remains to be used 
for research 
robert j levine of the yale university school of medicine told 
the committee his institution has drawn its own guidelines that 
would exclude transplanting the tissue of an fetus into a relative 
of the mother 
he said that was done out of safety considerations that 
whatever caused the disease in the relative might somehow be 
present in the offsprings genes but coincidentally also serves 
to negate concern about custom pregnancies 
ezra c davidson jr head of the obstetrics and gynecology 
department at kingdrew medical center in los angeles said he was 
distressed that some committee members seemed to underestimate 
the intensity of the drive for many women to have abortions to 
resolve a very complex set of problems without any encouragement 
from researchers or others 
i just wish i had the capacity to translate the reality of 
that to the people in this room he said

for those who have ever stuffed something 
down a suggestion box and thought it might as well have been a rat 
hole take heart 
or take edward a anderson for example 
anderson 51 of yorba linda calif has been named suggester 
of the year for submitting nine little gems that were adopted by 
his company and resulted in costsavings improvements totaling 22 
million in 1987 
the suggestions were not only lucrative to andersons employer 
hughes aircraft co but they put extra money into his pockets as 
well and patents have been awarded on five of andersons ideas 
improving on methods of assembling communications satellites 
the company program does not provide for direct financial 
rewards but theres a direct relationship between your 
suggestions and your salary raises says anderson 
im motivated by a desire for recognition by the management 
when you come up with a really good idea you know you did 
something important its my way of keeping on top of the christmas 
tree 
one of his suggestions saved about 15000 hours of labor 
another lightened the weight of satellites cutting down on launch 
costs 
anderson a senior scientist in the materials and process 
laboratory of hughes space and communications group is a 
compulsive suggester 
in 14 years he submitted 200 ideas of these his bosses say 
100 were adopted providing cost savings totaling 75 million 
andersons selection was announced in orlando at the annual 
conference of the national association of suggestion systems which 
includes administrators of suggestion systems for 900 member 
companies with a combined total of 13 million employees throughout 
the country 
runnerup to anderson was richard makaiwi who recommended the 
use of a penuematic underground piercing tool for installation of 
natural gas services to customers of pacific gas amp electric co of 
san jose calif 
the suggestion will provide an estimated savings of more than 1 
million in each of the next five years and enriched makaiwis bank 
account by 25000 
finishing third in the annual competition was rickey d tison 
who works for the air force at tinker air force base in oklahoma 
city his idea led to the development of a machine part used in the 
repair of the engine afterburner of an f111 jet fighter the 
suggestion also earned tison 25000 
nass officials said the air force suggestion program saved a 
record 309 million in fiscal 1987 
member companies reported savings of more than 2 billion in 
1987 as a result of their employees suggestion programs nass 
said employees received a total of 150 million in award payments 
for suggestions adopted 
the oldest employee suggestion program in this country was set 
up in 1898 by the eastman kodak co and is still in operation 
shortly after that general electric westinghouse metropolitan 
life insurance parke davis pharmaceuticals and others set up 
systems 
after world war ii a federal law allowed widespread 
establishment of such programs in federal state and local 
government agencies 
and to emphasize that somebody actually reads and counts all 
the tips ideas and comments nass member companies reported that 
they received 1023421 suggestions last year 13 suggestions from 
every 100 eligible employees 
of these 247920 were adopted

escaped with hundreds of thousands of dollars thursday police said 
police marksmen unaware the robbers had fled burst into the 
national westminster bank in this northwestern town at noon and 
freed the unharmed employees said chief inspector bill caine of 
the lancashire constabulary 
police launched a national search for the four robbers 
twenty police marksmen ringed the fourstory bank building in 
the towns center for more than two hours backed up by 100 other

and gagged and thrown into the back of a van 
ball was driven to his home where four men held him his wife 
and daughter until 4 am thursday the three were then bound

after intense lobbying by forces favoring and 
opposing gun control the house was ready to decide thursday 
whether a major antidrug initiative should include a sevenday 
waiting period for handgun purchases 
gunowner and proregulation groups have fought their latest 
allout battle over the waiting period with both sides bringing 
rankandfile police officers to lobby house members 
the waiting period is already included in the comprehensive bill 
that would add some 2 billion to the nations 39 billion drug 
fighting effort 
the weeklong delay would permit police where the purchaser 
lives to conduct a background check but would not require one 
president reagan has publicly supported a handgun waiting 
period but has not specifically endorsed the drug bill provisions 
of the brady amendment the measure was symbolically named 
after presidential press secretary james brady who was shot along 
with reagan in the march 30 1981 assassination attempt against 
the president 
bradys wife sarah has become a leading gun control 
spokeswoman on behalf of handgun control inc the powerful national 
rifle association is her main opposition 
rep bill mccollum rfla has authored an amendment to 
eliminate the waiting period 
his amendment would order the justice department to develop 
within 180 days a system that would allow gun dealers to check 
whether the applicant is a convicted felon 
mccollum has said the system which would be submitted to 
congress could include a telephone check such as the one that 
stores use to verify that credit cards are valid 
the waiting period would require a gun dealer within a day of a 
purchasers application to send a sworn application from the 
purchaser to the chief law enforcement officer where the buyer 
lives 
the application would include a description of the pistol its 
serial number the name address and birth date of the purchaser 
taken from a photo identification and a statement that federal law 
does not prohibit the receipt of the gun by the buyer 
the purchaser could pick up the weapon if nothing is heard from 
his hometown police agency within seven days or the police issue a 
certificate that the buyer requires the gun due to a threat on his 
or her life 
if a dealer receives a police report after the seven days 
stating that the transfer would violate the law the dealer must 
notify police in his own area and give police in the buyers home 
area all information about the transaction 
the police agency that permitted the transaction must destroy 
the records within 60 days after the date on the applicants 
statement unless the purchase involved a violation of law 
violating the requirements could bring a maximum 1000 fine and 
a oneyear prison term 
states that already have at least a seven day waiting period and 
a mandatory background check could enforce their laws instead of 
the federal provisions in all other cases the federal language 
would prevail 
the bill would leave unchanged the categories of buyers who are 
ineligible to purchase a handgun convicted felons the mentally 
ill drug addicts fugitives illegal aliens and those dishonorably 
discharged from the military 
the waiting period would take effect 90 days after the drug bill 
became law

14yearold girl and a 55yearold man died from the wednesday

three gunman and the schoolgirl died during the shootout while 
the fourth hijacker and the other passenger died today from 
injuries the sabc reported twenty pilgrims including two nuns 
were injured in the shooting papal officials said 
the pope made his first public comment on the incident at the 
end of a mass he celebrated today to beatify a french evangelist 
two million worshipers had been expected to attend the mass at a 
race course but only 50000 turned up in damp chilly weather 
i have come to southern africa as a pilgrim of peace bearing 
with me a message of reconciliation the pontiff said i am 
saddened to learn that others on their way to join me in this 
pilgrimage have been the victims of a hijack that caused such 
anguish and ended in bloodshed 
later the pope visited the queen elizabeth ii hospital and met 
with several of the injured 
one of the hostages frenchcanadian nun favrea blanche told the 
star a johannesburg daily that the shootout lasted 15 minutes and 
that the hijackers had behaved politely and said they wanted peace 
in lesotho 
the gunmen were from the dissident lesotho liberation army and 
had demanded a meeting with the pope and lesothos king moshoeshoe 
ii officials said 
they spoke gently with us said sister blanche 63 who has 
lived in lesotho for 37 years they even had pills to treat 
people with headaches and tummy problems 
the pope resumed his fivenation southern africa tour after a 
dramatic day in which bad weather forced the papal plane to divert 
to johannesburg in south africa which the pontiff had been trying 
to avoid 
a heavily guarded 10vehicle convoy took the pope to lesotho by 
road through south africa where racial issues had led catholic 
bishops to advise against a papal visit minutes after john paul 
reached maseru shooting broke out between police and gunmen 
holding about 70 catholic pilgrims hostage in a bus in the capital 
one of our students is dead said sister rita brassard an 
american with the papal visit office 
survivors said there were bullets everywhere these little 
grenades went off they tried to jump through the windows she 
said 
south african police invited by lesothos military government 
led the assault against the gunmen after the hijackers started 
shooting and tried to drive the bus into the grounds of the british 
high commission or embassy one gunman was taken alive the 
hijackers had complained that britain was training lesothos 
security forces 
vatican spokesman joaquim navarro said the pope learned of the 
shooting after he returned from an evening mass in a small church 
at the tomb of the rev joseph gerard at roma outside maseru 
the ceremony to beatify father gerard the first step toward 
sainthood took place under a cliff overlooking a large meadow at 
the edge the city cows grazed in some areas cordoned off for 
worshipers 
catholic officials said they believed cool and cloudy weather 
news of the bus hijack and the cost of temporary housing in maseru 
had cut the numbers of pilgrims far below expectations some tents 
erected for worshipers were rented for 20 a night a huge sum for 
many africans 
father gerard was a missionary in southern africa in the 19th 
century and was the first to take the catholic faith to the basotho 
people before his death in 1914 he met little success in changing 
tribal customs of polygamy and traditional medicine he failed to 
convert moshoeshoe i the basotho king 
miracles were reported after gerard died in 1914 a young girl 
placed soil from his grave around her neck and reportedly was cured 
of blindness in 1928 king moshoeshoe ii whom john paul was to 
meet later thursday is a catholic and 40 percent of lesothos 16 
million people are catholics

termites taste like fish palm grubs 
resemble pork sausages and ants can remind one of gooseliver 
pate says anthropologist darna dufour 
sound tasty well dufour says in the jungle insects are 
good to eat 
that was the theme of her lecture on insect cuisine wednesday at 
the university of colorado museum it was a prelude to the museums 
bug day afternoon saturday when children and adventurous 
adults will scour fields for large grasshoppers not to eat but to 
enter in the big hopper competition 
dufour dined on such delicacies as ants termites beetles and 
caterpillars during a 16month study of the eating habits of the 
tukanoan indians of eastern colombia 
in her research along the colombianbrazilian border dufour 
found that the tukanoans consumed insects as a food supplement and 
sometimes as a sole source of nourishment when fish werent 
available 
natives preferred to harvest some of the insects particularly 
termites and ants in larvae stages when theyre highest in fat 
and protein content she said sometimes insects like ants are 
used as a spread for bread and the ants resembled bacon bit sort 
of things she said 
although some caterpillars are saved most of the insects 
collected are eaten rapidly its a handtomouth situation with 
insects she said 
dufour said that after overcoming some initial queasiness she 
learned to like some insects 
while westerners are repulsed about consuming caterpillars she 
added the tukanoans dont particularly like some foods either 
milk makes them want to vomit she said and eggs and 
chicken are out because chickens are seen as scavengers

former president jimmy carter taking issue with 
republican campaign attacks centered on the pledge of allegiance 
says he respects the flag but probably would refuse to recite the 
pledge if ordered to do so by the government 
republican presidential nominee george bush has criticized 
democratic nominee michael dukakis the governor of massachusetts 
for vetoing a proposed law that would have required teachers to 
lead students in the flag pledge 
carter in remarks to students wednesday night at emory 
university where he is a professor said the issue is an important 
one for dukakis 
i think dukakis was taken aback caught by surprise that he 
didnt know what to do i think he is in a hole now said carter 
a cochairman of dukakis georgia campaign if he can explain it 
away it could give him a victory or it could cost him 
as for the issue itself carter said i have great respect for 
the flag but if the government passed a law saying that i 
had to pledge allegiance to the flag i dont think i would do it 
he continued i have always felt that i lived in a country 
where if i wanted to worship god as a baptist i could do so if i 
were an atheist i could be one if i wanted to be a catholic but 
was born a jew theres no condemnation from a government 
authority 
carter also expressed displeasure over the decision of his 
former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski to join the 
bush campaign as an adviser 
i dont like it at all carter said but he praised 
brzezinski for not criticizing carters policy after carter left 
the white house

the reagan administrations top health 
official said thursday he will not take a position on a proposed 
white house ban on using intentionally aborted fetal tissue for 
medical treatment until a national institutes of health advisory 
committee has completed its review of the issue 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen told reporters 
that while he remains personally opposed to abortion there 
are some good pros and some good cons about using aborted fetal 
tissue for experimental treatment for parkinsons and other 
diseases 
he said a task force of the best minds going was studing the 
issue at a threeday nih meeting and that he had no intention of 
taking a position until the review is completed probably not for 
several weeks 
bowen said he could not predict whether the issue will be 
resolved during the last few months of the reagan administration 
even though a white house official gary bauer is pushing for 
quick implementation of an outright ban 
inasmuch as abortions are legal being unable to utilize the 
tissue would result in the waste of a resource that is 
livesaving and curing for several diseases bowen told reporters 
at a breakfast meeting he spoke at about the same time the nih 
panel he referred to was opening a second day of hearings to focus 
on moral and ethical issues 
bowen said it was his judgment that we cant in a good common 
sense way come up with an answer until we hear from the advisory 
panel 
if i had parkinsons i think i would want some of those 
transplanted cells said bowen emphasizing that such a 
personal observation does not eliminate the broader ethical 
questions 
he made clear he did not feel rushed to recommend an 
administration position even though a bauer memo disclosed in news 
accounts last week instructed bowen to make his comments by last 
friday 
we have not responded bowen said i do not know whether 
it was a direct order from the president and i dont know that i 
will know unless someone tells me 
procedurally the special nih committee will make its 
recommendations to a standing nih advisory committee dec 1 and 
that panel in turn will make a recommendation to nih director james 
b wyngaarden the nih director reports to bowen through dr robert 
e windom who ordered a temporary ban on federally financed fetal 
tissue research pending consideration of moral and ethical issues 
father don mccarthy a roman catholic church leader from 
cincinnati told the nih committee the issue draws a clear 
distinction between induced abortions and natural abortions 
one might say that the american public becomes accomplices 
after the fact for these induced abortions if its institutions 
embrace policies that could tend to assign a medical value to 
having an abortion he said 
several witnesses and committee members used the term custom 
pregnancy as short hand for the concern that a woman might become 
pregnant just to produce a fetus for abortion and subsequent 
research use either for financial reward or in hopes of helping a 
sick relative 
i dont think people are as callous about abortion as that 
premise suggests said thomas h murray director of the center 
for biomedical ethics at the case western reserve university in 
cleveland if we get to that point im deeply worried 
murray said he was convinced that guidelines could be drawn to 
insure that a womans decision to have an abortion would be kept 
totally separate from the decision to allow the remains to be used 
for research 
robert j levine of the yale university school of medicine told 
the committee his institution has drawn its own guidelines that 
would exclude transplanting the tissue of an fetus into a relative 
of the mother 
he said that was done out of safety considerations that 
whatever caused the disease in the relative might somehow be 
present in the offsprings genes but coincidentally also serves 
to negate concern about custom pregnancies 
ezra c davidson jr head of the obstetrics and gynecology 
department at kingdrew medical center in los angeles said he was 
distressed that some committee members seemed to underestimate 
the intensity of the drive for many women to have abortions to 
resolve a very complex set of problems without any encouragement 
from researchers or others 
i just wish i had the capacity to translate the reality of 
that to the people in this room he said

pope john paul ii on thursday comforted 
pilgrims injured in a bus hijacking in this mountain kingdom and 
criticized militants who believe violence can solve southern 
africas conflicts 
i am saddened to learn that others on their way to join me on 
this pilgrimage have been victims of a hijack that has caused such 
anguish and ended in bloodshed john paul said the day after 
police stormed the bus with four hijackers and 71 hostages aboard 
all four hijackers and two passengers died including a 
14yearold girl officials said twenty others were injured 
the pope spoke to a crowd of about 15000 standing on a soggy 
field organizers expected 1 million and blamed the hijacking 
rainy winter weather and expensive accommodations such as 
25dollaranight tents for the small turnout 
speaking at an afternoon youth rally john paul urged his 
followers to renounce every form of violence and hatred 
the increase of violence in the world can never be halted by 
responding with more of the same he said 
in an apparent criticism of some militants including activists 
who contend passive resistance cannot overcome south africas 
system of racial segregation the pope said there could be 
nothing further from the truth there is nothing passive about 
nonviolence 
a south african police antiterrorist unit working with lesotho 
security forces gunned down the hijackers wednesday night 27 
hours after the bus driver and the pilgrims including nuns and 
schoolgirls were taken hostage 
the shootout occurred only 20 minutes after the pope drove 
across the border from south africa where his plane had been 
diverted because of bad weather in maseru 
john paul on thursday visited the queen elizabeth ii hospital 
where the injured 11 men and nine women were being treated he 
passed out vatican medals and rosaries as he chatted with them 
earlier at an openair mass he beatified the rev joseph 
gerard a 19thcentury french missionary in lesotho beatification 
is the first step on the road to sainthood 
the lesotho government run by a military council that has good 
relations with south africa said hijacking was ended with the 
inevitable and unavoidable cooperation of our one and very 
powerful neighbor 
the government said the hijackers ordered the driver to crash 
the bus through the closed gate of the british high commission 
while they began shooting the government did not say why the 
hijackers decided to move after more than a days standoff but 
there were unconfirmed reports that the gunmen may have been 
alarmed by police searchlights which suddenly were focused on the 
bus 
several of the rescued hostages said the hijackers rigged the 
bus with explosives 
the government tried to forestall any criticism from african 
countries that have accused it of being too cooperative with south 
africa it said it uses police advisers from britain west germany 
and israel and has a military training program with the united 
states 
the gunman called for a return to civilian rule in lesotho they 
also demanded to meet the pope king moshoeshoe ii and britains 
high commissioner 
king moshoeshoe ii a practicing catholic skipped the 
beatification ceremony without public explanation although his 
name was listed on the program 
queen tabitha however was present as well as the chairman of 
the ruling military council maj gen justin lekhanya 
the 50yearold oxfordeducated king scheduled a meeting 
thursday evening with the pope at the royal palace the ceremony 
was to include some traditional basotho ethnic festivities that 
were canceled wednesday when the papal plane from botswana was 
diverted to south africa

iraq indicated thursday that it may not 
allow the un to come to iraq to investigate allegations that iraq 
used poison gas on kurdish rebels 
it also said it was impossible for the iraqi army to use 
chemical weapons in the kurds mountainous region 
but in washington reagan administration officials said 
intercepted military radio conversations between iraqi forces 
helped convince us officials that iraq had gassed the kurds 
turkey meanwhile said it would not agree to a un request to 
send experts into turkey to investigate the poison gas claims 
iraqi defense minister adnan khairallah told a news conference 
in baghdad that he didnt understand why the united nations should 
be involved in any investigation 
if the kurds are iraqis its an internal issue so what is 
the role of the united nations in this case he said 
on tuesday un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar asked 
the iraqi government to let un chemical experts conduct an 
investigation about chemical weapons use against the kurds in iraq 
the united nations and other international bodies have several 
times censured iraq and iran for using chemical weapons in their 
8year conflict 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz acknowledged on july 1 that 
his country had used deadly chemical weapons against iran but he 
said the iranians used them first 
khairallah on thursday reiterated iraqi claims that no such 
gases have been used against the kurds 
he said it was technically impossible for the iraqi military to 
use gas against the kurds during the antirebel offensive aug 27 
to sept 3 shortly after last months ceasefire with iran began 
the offensive caused 60000 thousand kurds to flee into 
neighboring turkey 
about 20 million kurds who live in a region where the borders of 
turkey iran and iraq converge have been fighting for independence 
for the past century 
the minister said chemical weapons create a heavy gas that would 
have clung to the valleys of the mountainous region and made it 
impossible for iraqi troops to enter the area 
the un investigation request prompted by the united states 
japan britain and west germany also called for a team of experts 
to be sent to turkey 
but in ankara a foreign ministry spokesman said turkey wouldnt 
accept the team 
we trust our own experts and we expect others to do so said 
inal batu the spokesman 
he said the presence of a un team of experts here would 
signify that turkey had a direct part in the affair 
in washington reagan administration officials said iraqi radio 
conversations involving the use of gas turned up in the course of 
routine electronic surveillance in the persian gulf region 
the radio conversations were between iraqi aircraft and ground 
bases and between different iraqi aircraft the sources said on 
condition of anonymity 
one official said the united states did not have what he would 
call incontrovertible evidence like used gas canisters to prove 
that chemical weapons had been used 
but the intercepted radio messages and other signs make it 
clear to us what is going on said another source 
secretary of state george p shultz said this week he was 
quite confident that iraq had used chemical weapons in its 
efforts to put down a rebellion by the kurds but he refused at the 
time to spell out the basis for the assertion 
that assertion prompted the us senate to vote to impose 
economic sanctions against iraq the bill must also pass the house 
of representatives before it goes to president reagan 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman refused to discuss 
the matter on thursday saying he never discussed intelligence 
matters

anchorage learned thursday it wont be 
host for the 1994 winter olympic games but the citys failed bid 
didnt stop some from dreaming about 1998 
hundreds of people jammed the egan civic amp convention center to 
watch the televised announcement of lillehammer norway as the 
1994 host city 
anchorage finished third out of four competing bids two years 
ago the city finished sixth in a field of seven competing for the 
1992 games 
we knew getting the bid would not be an easy task we knew 
that going in but it would have been nice to have seen us place a 
little higher said dennis branson a member of the anchorage 
organizing committees executive panel 
branson said he hoped the committee will reorganize and prepare 
for a 1998 winter olympic proposal 
the third times the charm he said 
alaska sen frank murkowski who headed the delegation lobbying 
on anchorages behalf before the international olympic committee 
said in a telephone interview from south korea that the citys two 
bids would pay off 
anchorage is an oddson favorite next time he predicted 
i think its an investment id be terribly disappointed if there 
was any thought to not going full speed ahead in 1998 
gov steve cowper said he would make a push for a 1998 bid 
alaskans arent quitters weve got what it takes to make 
dreams come true now lets get ready for 1998 he said 
anchorage voters last month voted 21 in favor of the city 
assuming financial responsibility for the 1994 winter olympics 
but not everybody was disappointed with the choice of 
lillehammer 
doug bartko of palmer is a spokesman for alaskans concerned 
about the proposed winter olympics which doesnt oppose the 
olympics only their being in alaska 
he said his group philosophically opposes the selection of 
anchorage people live here to get away from the commercialism 
and hype and there is a lot of that involved in the olympics he 
said 
i think lillehammer is an excellent choice bartko said

afghan air raids and shellings across 
the pakistan border have killed 40 people and injured 114 since 
soviet troops began leaving afghanistan on may 15 a government 
spokesman said thursday 
afghan troops violated pakistani air space and territory 295 
times from may 15 to aug 18 the pakistani official charged 
pakistan afghanistan the united states and the soviet union 
signed a unsponsored accord on april 14 to arrange a pullout of 
an estimated 115000 soviet troops that have been helping the 
afghan government fight usbacked rebels half of them have gone 
home while the rest are to leave by feb 15 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 27 
people were killed and 85 injured in afghan artillery shelling of 
pakistani border areas he said 13 died and 29 were injured in air 
raids and bombings 
he told reporters that more afghan aircraft have been violating 
pakistani air space in recent weeks 
pakistani f16 fighters engaged an afghan warplane on september 
7 and the army has claimed that the plane was shot down 
afghanistan has denied the claim 
pakistan air force has proof on film that the raiding warplane 
was shot down the spokesman said 
he said efforts were continuing to locate the wreckage of the 
warplane 
asked to comment on kabuls allegations that the pakistani army 
is helping anticommunist guerrillas fight afghan security forces 
in southeastern afghanistan the spokesman said its completely 
baseless 
the spokesman said islamabad might play a role in a prisoner of 
war exchange using its influence with the guerrillas to free 
soviet pows 
but there are no soviet pows on pakistani territory and if 
and when there were any we handed them over to the soviets he 
said 
a pakistani newspaper the frontier post reported thursday that 
pakistan is mediating between the soviets and the rebels in 
arranging the release of 300 soviet pows 
it is premature to say that an agreement has been reached 
the spokesman said 
rebel sources have never disclosed the number of soviet war 
prisoners but different resistence groups are believed to hold 
around 50 they say the prisoners are being held in afghanistan

sen lloyd bentsen said thursday the 
republicans negative campaign is backfiring and that the democrats 
are on the upswing 
the democratic vice presidential nominee on a southern campaign 
swing through his native texas louisiana and tennessee told a 
rally in shreveport la that gop nominee george bush had done 
nothing for oilproducing states during his eight years as vice 
president 
in all candor their energy policy is the political equivalent 
of a dry hole bentsen said 
reciting several antienergy positions taken by bush and his 
running mate dan quayle bentsen mentioned quayles opposition to 
an oil import fee which democratic nominee michael dukakis has 
also opposed 
a new washington postabc news poll showed the democratic ticket 
leading the republicans nationwide by 48 percent to 45 percent 
although the lead was within the surveys margin of error bentsen 
said it reflected the democrats success in countering republican 
charges that they were unpatriotic and weak on defense 
weve seen in the last four or five days as weve taken these 
issues on on defense and these outrageous charges on 
patriotism that the polls have turned around bentsen told 
reporters its obvious that we have bottomed out and were 
beginning to come back up 
the democrats grabbed a big lead in the polls after their 
nominating convention in atlanta in midjuly but that lead 
evaporated and they fell behind the bushquayle ticket in some 
recent polls 
bentsen said republicans were trying to impugn the loyalty and 
patriotism of the candidates but they had overreached and they 
are getting a backlash bentsen said 
i think theyve got the problem now said the senator who 
elicited a chorus of boos from his shreveport audience when he 
mentioned the gop campaign 
bentsen was heckled wednesday when he told defense workers near 
dallas that bush had unfairly accused dukakis of opposing most 
defense programs 
on the gun control issue bentsen defended dukakis position 
while seeking to minimize his own differences with the 
massachusetts governor 
bentsen said he would vote against a proposed national 
mandatory sevenday waiting period for handgun purchases which 
dukakis supports 
i think that has some validity to it but i believe it ought 
to be done on a statebystate basis because you have a great deal 
of difference in the urbanization of various states bentsen told 
reporters 
what you might apply in montana could be quite different from 
a heavily urbanized industrialized state that has different crime 
problems he said 
bentsen refused to say what he would do if he were elected vice 
president and as president of the senate had to break a tie floor 
vote on the issue 
but he said dukakis was not the antigun fanatic that 
republicans claim he is 
although dukakis supports gun registration and other 
restrictions hes a man who believes you ought to be able to own 
a gun within the laws of your particular state to protect the 
home and for hunting and recreational purposes bentsen said 
the idea that he is going to confiscate guns without 
compensation as i read one of the charges thats ridiculous 
he said 
bentsens plan was to campaign in north carolina and florida on 
friday and saturday and then return to washington but he might 
alter his schedule because hurricane gilbert was headed toward the 
gulf coast of texas 
he said he ruled out visiting galveston texas on thursday to 
view emergency preparations for the hurricanes arrival because he 
did not want to contribute to the burden of local officials but he 
said he might return to his home state after the storm to assess 
relief needs

the state department acknowledged thursday 
that after 19 months of trying to set up negotiations to reduce 
nato and warsaw pact forces in europe differences with moscow over 
human rights were blocking progress 
the preliminary talks in vienna were designed to overcome a 
stalemate over conventional cutbacks in troops and armor in central 
europe at the same the geography was expanded to cover the 
continent all the way from the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains 
in the soviet union 
the talks opened in february 1987 with a new sense of optimism 
both in washington and in moscow that eastwest tensions could be 
reduced through sizable reductions in the forces the two military 
alliances have concentrated in europe since world war ii 
but charles e redman the state department spokesman said us 
hopes that the soviets would be willing to give equal consideration 
to improvements in human rights conditions at home had not been 
borne out 
we have to have this balance between the arms control aspects 
of this the us official said until we get this there is no 
prospect we are going to conclude negotiations 
next month will mark 15 years of inconclusive negotiations with 
the soviets over reducing nonnuclear forces in central europe the 
talks in vienna were designed to break the stalemate hopes for 
success were heightened as the united states and the soviet union 
successfully concluded a treaty last year to abolish their 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons 
but redman said apart from human rights there were still a few 
areas to be nailed down including technical details of the broad 
area to be covered by the negotiations 
the us official declined to describe the vienna talks as 
stalemated i would not say that redman said its a very 
active negotiations 
redman said the us delegation in the austrian capital would 
keep pushing for an early conclusion to the talks but he 
said it takes two sides to make this work 
the spokesman declined to predict whether negotiations between 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact would be 
opened before president reagan leaves office in january 
there are no artificial deadlines he said there are just 
some very important considerations that need to be met 
he stressed the disagreement over human rights was the principal 
roadblock weve been pushing hard to get this wrapped up and to 
get these talks under way if thats possible but without 
sacrificing this crucial aspect of balance redman said 
the slow progress in vienna is bound to be on the agenda when 
secretary of state george p shultz meets here next week with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze

a communications satellite launched for an 
american company aboard the european ariane rocket has failed to 
achieve a usable orbit and efforts will be made to nudge it into 
its proper place 
we are trying to move the satellite into its orbital 
location said barbara foelber spokeswoman for gte spacenet 
corp which owns the gstar 3 satellite the spacecraft launched 
sept 8 was to have been used for private business communications 
she said engineers dont know the cause of the problem the 
satellite reached the 22300mile altitude required and the rocket 
motor fired to put it into a circular orbit the firing apparently 
was not long enough and the satellite was put into an eggshaped 
course around the earth 
the spokeswoman said engineers will attempt to fire small 
thrusters normally used to keep the satellite from drifting out of 
position to gently push the satellite into a path where its speed 
matches the rotation of earth that maneuver has been performed 
successfully before notably with the tracking and data relay 
satellite launched by nasa in 1983 
the satellite which cost 85 million to 100 million to build 
and launch was insured for 60 million ms foelber said 
we currently have five satellites in orbit she said we 
will be able to provide services needed by the companys 
customers she added 
gte has another in the series of ge astro satellites scheduled 
for launching in april 1991 and ms foelber said the company will 
try to move its launch date ahead

nasas johnson space center all but shut down 
thursday with most employees sent home to prepare for a possible 
assault by hurricane gilbert 
the center normally open for visitors every day but christmas 
was closed at noon all but a core group of employees were allowed 
to go home and told they didnt have to come back until monday 
spokesman james hartsfield said 
if the hurricane causes little or no damage at the space center 
hartsfield said it would probably have no affect on the expected 
launch of the first postchallenger flight at cape canaveral fla 
later this month 
there are more than 9000 workers at the space center including 
government employees and people who work for private companies that 
have contracts with the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
nasa officials wanted to allow employees time to secure their 
homes get supplies or leave the area if they chose to do so 
because of the threat gilbert posed to the texas coast the space 
center is about 25 miles from the coast 
a core group will remain throughout the weekend at mission 
control the strongest building at the center and the place where 
shuttle missions are controlled hartsfield said mission control 
has concrete walls and no windows 
if the storm hurts that were really in trouble he said 
past storms have caused flooding at the center disrupting 
communications and computer operations 
the longawaited launch of discovery is expected to take place 
sometime in late september but nasa officials said wednesday they 
would wait to set an exact date until they knew more about where 
the storm would go they may announce a launch date friday 
at cape canaveral on thursday engineers corrected a tiny leak 
in discoverys engine system the leak traced to a valve was the 
only unresolved technical problem when more than 150 shuttle 
managers and engineers concluded a flight readiness review on 
wednesday 
if a later hurricane headed for the space center area during a 
shuttle flight nasa is prepared to fly a group of flight 
controllers to white sands missile range nm so the shuttle 
could be controlled from there the flight controllers could get to 
white sands within a few hours 
hurricane gilbert was in the gulf of mexico on thursday and 
seemed headed for the south texas coast but weather forecasters 
warned it could turn northward and hit the galveston area the 
space center is located between galveston and houston 
even if the storm did not hit the galveston area there still 
could be heavy rains and winds in the area and possible flooding

john thiry says he was doing motorists a favor 
when he held up a sign telling them to slow down but police on the 
lookout for speeders nearby werent impressed with his citizenship 
they arrested him 
i stopped a lot of people from having a miserable day said 
thiry who acknowledges wracking up 2000 in traffic fines over 
the years people were beeping at me they were waving its 
about time somebody did something 
thiry 22 of pittsburgh was arrested wednesday for obstructing 
traffic after he stood in a street called schenley park plaza with 
a sign saying slow down police ahead with vascar 
thiry was just ahead of where police were using a vascar device 
to catch speeders the device akin to a stop watch calculates a 
cars speed by measuring the time it takes for a car to travel 
between two lines painted across the street a carefully measured 
distance apart 
i stood there for about 20 minutes thiry said that would 
have been about a total of 3000 they would have gotten people 
for 
thiry said pittsburgh police often trap motorists with 
vascar devices they make you go 25 mph where they know 25 is 
an unreasonably slow speed he said try and go the speed limit 
and just see what happens see how many people pass you 
police chief ralph pampena said signs posted throughout the city 
say police use vascar devices to enforce speed limits 
the signs are very clear he said if the signs are posted 
as 25 miles per hour then thats the speed we expect people to 
go 
thiry said he was upset because he had been issued many tickets 
and recently lost his license for the third time and had to leave a 
job as a salesman 
the tickets included at least five in the past two years from 
pittsburgh police using vascar devices plus others for speeding on 
the interstate he said he estimated he has paid about 2000 in 
fines but said has never been involved in a traffic accident 
police sgt leo mccafferty and officer william orourke said 
they noticed that motorists were suddenly driving slower as they 
waited for speeders they said they arrested thiry after a motorist 
informed them about his sign 
thiry who was frisked by police said he will appeal the charge 
of obstructing traffic which carries a fine of 4850 
i wasnt blocking traffic thiry said thursday i dont 
think they had the right to arrest me because i wanted to warn 
people what if i was just yelling thats freedom of speech 
edward patterson commander of the traffic division said the 
officers acted properly in arresting thiry 
anytime youre out in the street youre obstructing 
traffic he said he was standing there calling to attention to 
the contents of a sign it could contribute to an accident

nicotine gum can help smokers quit but many 
doctors give patients wrong instructions for its use researchers 
say 
there is a widespread need for physician education about how 
to use nicotine gum more effectively said one of five studies on 
smoking in fridays journal of the american medical association 
nearly 40 percent of the internists surveyed for the study said 
they would prescribe nicotine gum to help patients cut down on 
smoking violating a key guideline for use of the gum 
the first instruction on the gum package says starting now 
you must give up smoking completely gradually cutting down on your 
tobacco consumption will not work 
the study based on a random survey of 208 internists in the san 
francisco bay area found that doctors misconceptions about the 
gum hurts efforts by smokers to quit 
misuse of the gum is most detrimental because the patients get 
discouraged and dont think it works and then arent able to quit 
smoking said dr steven r cummings an assistant medical 
professor at ucsan francisco cummings conducted the study with 
colleagues at the university of california medical school in san 
francisco 
incorrect advice from doctors also poses potential health risks 
the cummings study concluded 
smoking while chewing the gum may produce higher serum 
concentrations of nicotine than smoking alone and this might 
increase the risk of nicotinerelated adverse effects the report 
said while swallowing juices from the gum could increase the 
chance of gastrointestinal side effects 
most internists prescribe nicotine gum to fewer than 25 percent 
of patients who try to quit smoking the study found 
but the gum a prescription drug marketed under the trade name 
nicorette by lakeside pharmaceuticals of cincinnati can be an 
effective tool for some people trying to quit smoking particularly 
heavy smokers conclude three other studies in the journal 
one study found however that of 538 patients given nicotine 
gum to help them quit smoking 34 or 68 percent were still 
chewing it after a year 
those longterm gum chewers generally heavy smokers also 
represented onequarter of the patients who quit smoking for a 
year said the report by researchers at the university of london 
a researcher in another study said the gum shouldnt be viewed 
as a panacea 
i dont think physicians ought to supply it just 
willynilly said dr stephen p fortmann an assistant professor 
at the stanford university school of medicine 
the gum shouldnt be seen as either a miracle or as a 
necessity but as a useful adjunct foreman said he led a study 
that found the drug effective and also that a large majority of 
smokers trying to quit want selfadministered minimalcontact 
treatment 
a fifth study suggested that nicotine gum might help smokers who 
consume more than 25 cigarettes daily overcome withdrawal symptoms 
caused by their physical addiction 
the manufacturer estimates 2 million people have quit smoking 
using nicotine gum since it introduced in 1985 bill donaldson a 
spokesman for lakeside a division of merrell dow pharmaceuticals 
inc said the company had no reports of patients becoming addicted 
to nicotine from the gum itself

a federal grand jury on thursday indicted 
ashland oil inc on charges it violated federal environmental laws 
when more than 700000 gallons of oil spilled into the monongahela 
river in january fouling drinking water in three states 
the indictment charged ashland with misdemeanor violations of 
the federal clean water act and the refuse act environmental laws 
do not contain felony provisions in such cases so the misdemeanor 
charges were the most stringent allowed said us attorney j alan 
johnson 
the spill occurred jan 2 when an ashland oil storage tank in 
jefferson near pittsburgh collapsed as it was filled with 38 
million gallons of oil about 1 million gallons escaped the 
containment dikes at the facility and more than 700000 gallons 
spilled into the monongahela river 
the government said it was one of the largest inland oil spills 
in the nations history affecting drinking water supplies and 
plant and animal life in pennsylvania ohio and west virginia 
about 23000 suburban pittsburgh residents went without tap water 
for almost a week 
the criminal charges disappointed ashland oil in light of 
ashlands efforts to mitigate the spills impact and the fact that 
the company quickly accepted responsibility for the incident 
said ashland spokesman roger schrum 
ashland has voluntarily paid more than 114 million for 
cleanup costs associated with the spill and to reimburse claims 
from individuals businesses and government agencies schrum said 
we think such actions impair rather than promote environmental 
compliance he said 
ashland disassembled a 48yearold oil storage tank at whiskey 
island ohio in 1986 and then reassembled it at its jefferson 
terminal it was placed in service in august 1987 and then 
collapsed four months later the indictment said 
in may investigators for the battelle memorial institute an 
independent research group that studied the accident said a 
dimesize flaw in the tanks brittle steel walls caused the 
collapse aggravating the condition were the relative weakness of 
the world war iiera steel pressure from the diesel fuel and cold 
weather 
johnson said the federal government still must determine if any 
ashland employees or officials violated the law 
in a separate civil action in july the us justice department 
filed a proposed consent decree requiring ashland the oil company 
to complete the cleanup of the spill and to reimburse the 
government 680000 for emergency response work by federal agencies 
ashland has agreed to the decrees terms

an appeals court has ordered the federal aviation 
administration to review its decision requiring commercial airline 
pilots to retire at age 60 officials said thursday 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals vacated the faas decision 
denying 28 pilots an exemption from the retirement rule even 
though they had passed health tests to establish their fitness to 
fly 
the court ordered the faa to reconsider its decision to deny the 
pilots request for an exemption 
the 28 pilots from several major airlines including united and 
eastern had appealed the faas ruling last year directly to the 
appellate court contending older pilots could be given medical and 
psychological tests to determine if theyre fit to fly big jets 
they also argued that their years of experience in the cockpit 
would enhance safety and compensate for undetected physical 
problems the pilots presented evidence that older pilots have 
fewer accidents than younger less experienced pilots said alan m 
serwer a chicago attorney who represented the pilots 
the age 60 rule may be worsening the effect of a current 
shortage of commercial airline pilots serwer said thurday the 
airlines have lowered their standards for employment and theyre 
promoting young pilots very rapidly into slots being vacated in 
fairly large numbers by captains who reach the age 60 cutoff 
certain crashes of the past few years might have been avoided 
had the planes young pilots had more experience with difficult 
flying conditions or with the specific aircraft they were flying 
serwer contended 
he declined to provide specific examples but said the faa 
itself has expressed concern about the lack of experience in the 
cockpit 
the appeals court ruling was issued monday and disclosed 
thursday by serwer 
we have not seen the decision yet and until we do were not 
going to have any reaction or comment said fred farrar a 
spokesman at faa headquarters in washington farrar also declined 
to respond to any of serwers remarks 
united airlines based in the chicago area also declined to 
comment because it hadnt reviewed the ruling said spokeswoman 
sara dornacker 
the faa instituted the age 60 retirement rule in 1960 for all 
pilots flying commercial airliners that carry more than 30 
passengers serwer said it doesnt apply to pilots flying commuter 
airline jets or planes with fewer than 30 passengers or to flight 
engineers the third person in the cockpit on large airline flights 
in their appeal the pilots didnt challenge the retirement rule 
directly aiming instead at the faas decision to deny them an 
exemption to the rule based on their ability to pass flight tests 
and medical screening for heart disease stroke and other potential 
health hazards 
in the appellate court decision judge richard d cudahy wrote 
that the faas consideration of the petition for exemption was 
incomplete the agency he wrote failed to set forth a 
sufficient factual or legal basis for its rejection of the 
petitioners claim that the older pilots edge in experience 
offsets any undetected physical losses 
serwer also contended the faas strict enforcement of the age 60 
rule was arbitrary because the agency grants thousands of 
exemptions to other restrictions even granting exemptions to 
some pilots diagnosed as chronic alcoholics

the nation will have five times as many aids 
cases in four years with 365000 cases by 1992 the centers for 
disease control predicted thursday 
as of this week 72766 aids cases have been reported to the 
cdc with 41064 patients or 56 percent already dead 
by the end of 1992 the number of cases will total 365000 and 
deaths will reach 263000 or 72 percent of the predicted case 
total the cdc said 
the predictions came in a report summarizing the cdcs latest 
quarterly report on aids to the white houses domestic policy 
council the cdc in 1986 issued its aids predictions for 1991 
which call for 270000 cases by the end of that year 
actual aids reporting has run slightly higher than predicted 
the agency in 1986 predicted 15800 cases in 1986 and 23000 in 
1987 while the actual totals were 17100 and 25200 respectively 
we think theyre very close said dr tim dondero a cdc 
aids specialist i think the message is that at least for the 
first couple of years this method gives some pretty reliable 
estimates 
in the report released thursday the atlantabased health agency 
predicts 80000 cases of aids in 1992 alone with 66000 deaths 
that year a total of 172000 living aids patients will require 
medical care in 1992 at a cost of anywhere from 5 billion to 13 
billion the cdc predicted 
the cdc also reported that its current estimate of between 1 
million and 15 million americans currently infected with the virus 
which causes aids is a reasonable working estimate based on 
mathematical analysis by experts convened by the cdc in april the 
estimate has been criticized in some quarters as possibly wrong 
but the cdc has continued to state that it remains the agencys 
best guess 
the report noted that the national infection estimate has 
remained the same since it was devised in 1986 this does not 
mean that no new infections have occurred the cdc said the 
1986 estimate was based on preliminary data and was probably too 
high at the time 
findings from several specific surveys for aids infection rate 
would tend to confirm the current estimate the cdc said the 
nationwide infection rate researchers believe is approximately 
04 percent to 06 percent recent tests among 18809 hospital 
patients and 65960 job corps entrants found infection rates of 03 
percent and 04 percent respectively 
the report noted that more than 420 different surveys for aids 
infection will be conducted with federal funds in the coming months 
in sexuallytransmitteddisease clinics tb centers hospitals and 
other sites in 23 states puerto rico and washington dc 
additionally government researchers hope to have results by the 
end of this year on aids infection tests on students at 20 
participating colleges

us and soviet planes jointly studied hurricane 
gilbert on thursday ending concern that the two nations were 
competing for airspace over the storm as it moved off mexicos 
yucatan peninsula 
after the confusion we have a coordinated international 
effort to take a hard look at the insides of this very dangerous 
storm said don witten of the national weather service office in 
suburban coral gables thats the resolution 
a soviet an12 took off from cuba and made contact with american 
pilots to work out a deal for probing gilbert as it headed over the 
gulf of mexico witten said 
he said the soviet plane was operating at 12000 feet an air 
force plane was at 10000 and a civilian aircraft from the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration the weather services 
parent agency was at 5000 feet 
in the earlier confusion forecasters at the national hurricane 
center in the coral gables weather service office believed the 
soviet union had permission for exclusive use of much of the 
airspace over gilbert and center director bob sheets feared us 
planes might not be able to gather needed advisory information 
we dont know if they got their permission from mexico but 
that would be the logical place witten said 
there is no higher international authority for arbitration when 
two planes want to fly the same international airspace said roger 
myers of the federal aviation administration in atlanta 
because of the soviet flight the air force plane withdrew from 
the hurricanes eye sooner than planned but it stayed in the area 
to try to make radio contact with the soviet plane said pentagon 
spokesman lt col jim jannette 
contact was made and the us and soviet flight crews 
negotiated proper vertical and horizontal separation limits so 
that both their missions could continue jannette said 
the planes were studying the meteorology of the storm the air 
force reconnaissance plane was also gleaning needed data for 
hurricane warnings such as gilberts barometric pressure and top 
wind speeds said forecaster max mayfield 
gilbert the most intense hurricane of the century until it 
weakened over mexico on wednesday had maximum winds of 120 mph at 
noon thursday and was about 410 miles southeast of brownsville 
texas

thousands of people fleeing hurricane gilberts 
path thursday might wonder at george zamiar and his two colleagues 
they were headed toward the storm steeling themselves for a flight 
into the hurricanes eye 
zamiar an oceanographer with marionbased horizon marine inc 
will be measuring gilberts effect on ocean currents for oil 
companies with offshore rigs in the gulf of mexico 
despite some jitters gilbert doesnt scare me at all after 
flying into florence his first hurricane last week zamiar said 
im concerned but this is what i want to do i need the job 
its a dangerous thing he said theres no doubt about 
that everybody kind of looks at you with the you must be crazy 
look 
zamiar will joined on the mission by john marwitz an 
atmospheric scientist at the university of wyoming and exmarine 
george bershinsky who compared flying in extreme weather to combat 
missions in vietnam 
its not that much different bershinsky said you develop 
an extreme degree of alertness before you go into this i dont see 
any major difficulties were keeping our options open so if it 
gets too rough we can get out 
the three men planned to converge at addison county airport in 
dallas to plot the course of the storm before taking off early 
friday morning in a twinengine beech aircraft king air 
the specially equipped plane rented from the university of 
wyoming is large and sturdy enough to get through the hurricane 
called one of the strongest ever zamiar said 
water and lightning from gilbert are a greater threat than the 
hurricanes top winds of 175 mph he said 
im certainly not a believer in when your numbers up im 
a believer of that school that you have to watch out for yourself 
all the time or else youll force your number to be up 
zamiar will drop 25 probes known as expendable current 
profilers to measure the voltage induced in the water as gilbert 
passes through the earths magnetic field 
the probes will be dropped on a series of runs just before 
during and after the hurricane hits the continental shelf where 
the gulf floor suddenly plummets to far greater depths 
a radio component will remain above the water and send data from 
the probes which drop to the bottom of the water and develop a 
water current profile reflecting speed temperature and direction 
the information is useful for oil companies and other groups 
building projects in the gulf that must withstand extreme weather 
the 1000mile trip is expected to take about three hours 
the air force and national oceanographic atmospheric 
administration fly into hurricanes to gain atmospheric data but 
as far as i know we are the first private company to fly into a 
hurricane for purposes of research zamiar said

the us judicial conference on thursday 
announced plans for some federal courts to videotape their 
proceedings in an experiment that if successful could eliminate 
court stenographers 
the experiment is noteworthy because federal courts unlike many 
of their state counterparts ban all electronic coverage of 
courtroom proceedings 
the judicial conference a 28judge board which sets policy for 
the nations federal courts approved the twoyear videotaping 
experiment in a closed meeting wednesday spokesman david sellers 
said 
the experiment to be conducted in six trial courts and two 
appeals courts is patterned after a program already in place in 
kentucky state courts 
the conference wants to find out whether whether videotapes 
should replace written documents as official records of trial and 
appellate court proceedings 
during the experiment videotaping will supplement a 
stenographic record 
public access to the videotapes is something that has not been 
determined yet sellers said 
the experiment will be monitored by a committee led by us 
district judge richard m bilby of tucson ariz 
sellers said no final decision had been made on which courts 
will use the videotapes but he said federal trial judges in 
philadelphia have expressed interest participation of a federal 
trial court in arizona was possible because of judge bilbys role 
sellers said 
the judicial conference also reported that it is asking congress 
to create 73 new judgeships to eliminate backlogs and ease 
workloads but sellers said the realities are that nothing will 
happen during an election year 
the last increase in the judicial workforce was in 1984 when 
congress authorized creation of 86 judgeships 
the conference is seeking 14 new appeals court judges and 59 
trial judges but 22 of the trial judgeships would last only five 
years 
the conference in 1986 sought 56 additional trial court judges 
and 13 appeals court judges a proposal that went nowhere in 
congress 
there currently are 158 appeals court judges and 548 trial 
judges 
sellers said the judicial conference also approved spending 
70000 to 90000 on closedcircuit television cameras to monitor 
high risk trials 
he said stationary cameras capable of scanning a courtroom will 
be installed in 10 or 12 major cities the cameras will provide a 
video monitor feed to a marshals office 
the us marshals service proposed the security measure

democratic party leaders who once 
dismissed patrick kennedy as too young and inexperienced to be 
state representative said thursday they were just being loyal to 
the incumbent he defeated 
i dont think anybody was against kennedy said house 
majority leader thomas a lamb a democrat from west warwick i 
think the leadership was certainly in favor of jack skeffington we 
just think the world of jack 
lamb said kennedy wont get the cold shoulder from his fellow 
legislators but said he still has an uphill battle to win their 
respect 
i think that he has to come to the house and he has to prove 
himself lamb said i hope that now they will have a 
representative from the 9th district who will represent that 
district well the people will decide if hes doing a good job 
skeffington a fiveterm incumbent assembled a powerful array 
of general assembly and party leaders to endorse him against the 
21yearold kennedy a providence college junior and son of 
massachusetts sen edward m kennedy 
but kennedy making his first foray onto the political scene 
where his famous family has long been prominent handily defeated 
skeffington 50 a funeral director in the 9th representative 
district located in the heavily irish and italian neighborhood of 
mount pleasant 
kennedy who received 1324 votes or 57 percent to 
skeffingtons 1009 votes or 43 percent automaticaly wins the 
office because there is no republican opposition in november 
house speaker joseph deangelis a democrat from smithfield said 
he tried to talk kennedy out of running last june because we felt 
loyal towards jack and we were going to do everything we could to 
help jack face a stiff primary 
but deangelis predicted that when the legislature opens in 
january there wont be animosity or resentment toward young 
kennedy 
during the campaign skeffington rattled off a list of 
supporters including secretary of state kathleen connell 
providence mayor joseph r paolino jr and lt gov richard licht 
but licht and ms connell said they supported skeffington because 
he was endorsed by the party 
it was a classic story of a young man taking on a veteran and 
in this instance the energy and the excitement that kennedy 
brought to the contest won ms connell said 
skeffington blamed his defeat on the fanfare over the kennedy 
name and the campaign waged on kennedys behalf by numerous family 
members including kennedys father his cousin massachusetts rep 
joseph kennedy and cousin john kennedy jr the son of the late 
president 
in other results of wednesdays democratic primary rep fernand 
j st germain the house banking committee chairman who has served 
14 terms narrowly survived a challenge from scott wolf a 
political consultant making his first try for office st germain 
got 55 percent of the vote 
state and national republican officials said they were 
optimistic about their candidate ronald k machtleys prospects 
against st germain in november well throw everything we can in 
it said rich galen spokesman for the national republican 
congressional committee in washington he is at the top of the 
list of vulnerable democrats 
and businessman bruce g sundlun won the right to oppose 
republican gov edward d diprete in november

a senate panel on thursday voted to seize a 
development site adjacent to the manassas national battlefield park 
in suburban virginia rejecting a compromise under which only part 
of the parcel would be acquired 
the energy and natural resources committee voted 118 to approve 
a measure that would authorize congress to acquire the 542acre 
william center development tract close two heavilytraveled 
commuter routes through the civil war battlefield and pay up to 30 
million to build new roads around the park 
the measure introduced by sen dale bumpers dark is 
identical to a bill that passed the house last month 
it prevailed over a compromise measure by sen john warner 
rva that would have acquired just 80 acres of the tract warner 
said his proposal would preserve the most important historical 
aspects of the site at a lower cost 
however bumpers maintained the entire tract was historically 
significant 
if we dont act to preserve that property you can go down 
there three weeks from now and it will be gone for all intents 
and purposes bumpers said itll be a shopping mall 
committe chairman sen j bennett johnston dla said he hoped 
the bill would reach the senate floor by next week president 
reagan has threatened to veto any legislation similar to the 
bumpers bill 
developer john t hazel is planning to build a 12 million 
squarefoot shopping mall 17 million square feet of office space 
and 560 homes adjacent to the 4200acre park 
historians claim the development would ruin the historic 
integrity of the stillrustic ground on which the first and second 
battles of manassas were fought 
in addition the development site includes a hill from which 
confederate gen robert e lee commanded his troops in second 
manassas historians also claim that union and confederate dead lie 
in unmarked graves scattered throughout the development area

the house merchant marine and fisheries 
committee approved legislation thursday that would extend the us 
territorial limit to 12 nautical miles the first change since 1793 
when president thomas jefferson declared a threemile protection 
zone along the us coast 
the committee also approved legislation that would require that 
foreign fishing vessels stow their gear when passing through the 
200mile us economic zone and carry transponders so satellites 
could track their location 
those proposals were attached to a new ussoviet fishing 
treaty and were sought by washington state lawmakers after seven 
japanese trawlers were videotaped fishing in american waters off 
alaska in january 
along with the change in the territorial limit the measure also 
includes an expansion of the socalled us contiguous zone from 12 
nautical miles to 24 nautical miles 
the measure was approved on a voice vote 
rep mike lowry dwash sponsor of the bill said the 
expansion of the territorial limit will allow the united states to 
exercise complete control over a broader area and was essential for 
national security reasons 
the new limit will force foreign intelligence vessels to stay 
further offshore said lowry 
by moving our territorial sea from three miles to 12 miles 
the ability of soviet ships to monitor and detect the movement of 
us submarines is lessened said lowry 
the expansion of the contiguous zone will allow the united 
states to enforce such things as its customs laws and pollution 
regulations over a broader area said lowry 
lowry said the expansion would enhance our nations ability to 
intercept and board vessels which may be carrying contraband or 
drugs off our coast 
with a 24mile contiguous zone the coast guard would be able 
to board a foreignflag vessel out to 24 miles without seeking the 
consent of the foreign flag nation this would clearly enhance our 
nations drug enforcement authority he said 
lowry said that both zones would be consistent with customary 
international law and that the reagan administration was 
considering such changes through an executive order 
the new requirements for foreign fishing vessel passing through 
the us economic zone were approved just weeks after reports in 
the japanese press of a organized black market in japan for fish 
caught illegally in american waters 
american fishermen estimate that japanese trawlers have caught 
illegally more than 100000 tons of fish worth an estimated 250 
million off alaska since the first of the year 
rep don bonker dwash said present law allows the coast 
guard to take action against foreign trawlers only if they are 
caught illegally fishing in us waters 
many of these vessels are alerted to the presence of the coast 
guard and haul up their nets before they are discovered said 
bonker

three men accused of murdering a us drug 
agent will have bloodstained hands forever haunted by their guilt 
like shakespeares macbeth a prosecutor told jurors thursday 
in the culmination of an eightweek trial assistant us 
attorney jimmy gurule began his closing argument with a quotation 
from the play declaring will all great neptunes ocean wash 
this blood clean from my hand 
the defendants are charged with the slayings of enrique camarena 
and his associate alfredo zavala avelar 
in a hushed courtroom gurule methodically laid out the case the 
government has made in eight weeks of testimony against raul lopez 
alvarez 28 and rene verdugo urquidez 36 both charged with 
murder and jesus felix gutierrez 38 charged as an accessory 
after the fact 
felix is accused of helping mexican drug kingpin rafael caro 
quintero flee to costa rica after camarena and zavala were killed 
it is as a result of their participation whether direct or 
indirect that their hands remain stained with the blood of 
these two individuals the prosecutor said 
he spoke of camarena as a hero whose only fault was that he 
did his job too well 
he paid the ultimate price said gurule he gave his life 
for his job for his country he paid the price in the most savage 
barbaric unbelievable manner beaten and beaten and beaten until 
his life slowly slipped away drained from his body 
caro who is jailed in mexico has been portrayed as the 
mastermind behind camarenas torture murder camarena was abducted 
outside the us consulate in guadalajara on feb 7 1985 the 
bodies of him and zavala were found a few weeks later buried on a 
remote ranch 
gurule suggested to jurors that caro marked camarena for death 
after a drug enforcement administration raid on one of caros 
marijuana plantations cost the drug baron 55 million and a second 
raid netted 10000 pounds of marijuana worth up to 5 billion 
he has to blame somebody dea is responsible for these 
losses said gurule somebody had to pay and in this case it 
was dea agent enrique camarena 
with little physical evidence in the case gurule used charts to 
outline circumstantial proof that the defendants were connected to 
the deaths noting evidence for example that put one defendant 
near the scene of camerenas abduction 
attorneys for the three defendants have contended they had no 
role in the killings if they discussed it with others they said 
it was only because they read about it in the newspapers 
key pieces of evidence in the case were two tapes an audio 
recording of camarena being tortured and a videotape of lopez 
describing the camarena killing to an undercover dea agent who 
posed as a drug dealer 
gurule dwelled on the brutal nature of the killings describing 
camarenas crushed skull and zavalas fractured ribs 
it was as if someone was jumping up and down on his zavalas 
chest and crushed his chest cavity into his lungs he said of 
zavala

federal investigators thursday ruled out 
engine failure as the primary cause of the crash of a delta air 
lines jet last month saying there was no evidence the engines 
suffered a mechanical breakdown prior to impact 
the aug 31 crash as the boeing 727 was attempting to take off 
from the dallasfort worth airport killed 14 of the 108 people 
aboard the three pilots survived but none was able to shed light 
on the cause of the crash in initial interviews 
early speculation on the cause of the accident centered on the 
planes three engines because witnesses saw flames coming from an 
engine and one of the pilots was heard on the cockpit recorder to 
refer to engine failure shortly before the crash 
but the national transportation safety board said thursday a 
detailed examination of the three pratt amp whitney jt8d engines at 
the companys facilities in connecticut indicated there was no 
evidence of preimpact failure 
there was evidence that all engines were running as commanded 
and capable of producing full power at the time of impact the 
ntsb said in a brief statement 
the findings also seemed to rule out the possibility that an 
object or bird was sucked into an engine since that would have been 
evident when the engines were disassembled 
ntsb spokesman mike benson said the findings do not necessarily 
rule out a compressor stall or series of stalls that could have 
been caused by a disruption of air flow through the engine as a 
result of other problems such a disruption could result from the 
aircraft having an unusual angle 
but the ntsb said there was only slight rotational damage found 
in one of the three engines and that was in an area of heavy damage 
due to the crash generally serious compressor stalls or a series 
of stalls leave evidence of damage but not always according to 
aviation experts 
according to investigators the cockpit voice recorder tape from 
delta flight 1141 includes at least five noises that could be 
engine compressor stalls but all of them occur after the plane 
already was having serious problems remaining aloft 
the ntsbs statement did not address the continuing questions of 
what might have caused an engine compressor stall if one or more 
occurred or why the aircraft failed to climb after reaching 
adequate liftoff speed 
investigators have focused on whether the plane had the proper 
wing flap setting for takeoff the flaps at the trailing edge of 
the wings should have been extended to 15 degrees to gain proper 
lift 
the cockpit recorder includes an acknowledgement by copilot 
carey w kirkland that the flaps had been set for proper takeoff 
and it shows no evidence of an alarm going off that should have 
warned of an improper setting 
but investigators found the flap control level in the retracted 
position the position of the jack screws on the wings also 
indicated the flaps were retracted kirkland has told investigators 
he does not remember anything about the flight after the plane 
pushed back from the gate 
a twohour interview earlier this week of the pilot capt larry 
davis who was at the controls durign the takeoff shed little 
light on what may have caused the crash investigators said 
davis said he recalls one of the other pilots stating the flaps 
were properly extended but doesnt recall checking the flap 
indicators to verify if they indeed had been set 
he said he heard two loud bangs or explosions seconds after 
liftoff and that the plane began to roll according to lee 
dickinson the ntsb board member overseeing the investigation 
dickinson quoted davis as saying he previously had experienced 
engine compressor stalls but nothing like this

the stunning reversal of delawares 
democratic senate primary ended thursday as samuel s beard who 
had already begun campaigning as his partys nominee conceded 
defeat to lt gov sb woo 
beard who appeared to have won saturdays primary by nearly 
3000 votes pledged his support of woo at a news conference 
shortly after the recount gave woo a 71vote victory 20225 to 
20154 
woo faces republican incumbent william v roth jr who is 
seeking a fourth term and did not have primary opposition

millionaire civic activist 
woo joked that he had lived up to his nickname of landslide 
woo noting that when he was elected lieutenant governor four 
years ago he won by less than 500 votes in a race that also 
required a recount 
sam no one knows more than i the emotional roller coaster 
your family has been through in the past few days woo said 
he called beard a formidable opponent adding he would be 
even more formidable as an ally 
both requested the recount monday after a computer keypunch 
operator mistakenly gave beard 2800 votes too many beard thought 
he had won with 22418 votes to woos 19624

county where about 280 democrats are registered beard received 28 
votes in the district but the votes were recorded as 2828 in the 
computer at the countys department of elections according to paul 
t hart county elections director

lawyers trying to minimize the perjury 
sentence michael k deaver faces contended thursday that alcoholism 
impaired the former presidential aides memory during sworn 
testimony about his lobbying 
defense lawyer randall j turk said there was medical evidence 
that at all times relevant to this case deaver was an alcoholic 
and that the disease impaired his memory 
it clouded deavers memory both at the time of the lobbying 
contacts and when he was later questioned about them under oath by 
a grand jury and a house subcommittee turk said 
the former deputy white house chief of staff and close friend of 
president reagan and his wife nancy faces a possible fiveyear 
term and a 6800 fine for each of three perjury convictions 
deaver was found guilty late last year of lying by saying he 
couldnt recall certain contacts with former reagan administration 
officials for highpaying lobbying clients 
sentencing is scheduled for sept 23 the evidence was offered 
to give the court understanding of the offense behavior for which 
mr deaver was convicted turk said medical testimony about 
deavers condition was not offered during the trial because the 
defense rested without calling any witnesses 
more testimony was scheduled on friday 
turk said doctors would testify that deavers memory might have 
been impaired because he took a valium tablet before questioning in 
may 1986 by the house energy and commerce investigations 
subcommittee the panel and a grand jury investigated deavers 
lobbying for possible ethicslaw violations 
deavers willingness earlier that year to pose holding a 
telephone in a rented limousine near the us capitol for a time 
magazine cover photo for a story about his lobbying shows how 
alcohol had impaired his judgment turk said 
the cover headline said whos this man calling influence 
peddling in washington 
his trust of time magazine staggers the mind turk said 
noting that deaver would not have allowed reagan to expose himself 
to the press that way 
dr william argy testified deaver had been drinking up to a 
fifth of scotch whisky a day before his first treatment for 
alcoholism in june 1985 at georgetown university hospital the 
alcohol detoxification occurred several weeks after deaver left the 
white house staff 
deaver remained sober for five months but began drinking in 
december 1985 and his daily consumption had reached as much as a 
pint of vodka or a bottle of wine before his second hospitalization 
in october 1986 argy said 
deavers wife carolyn told the doctor her husband consumed 
bottles and bottles of wine the weekend before the first 
treatment in 1985 an episode that confirmed her belief he had a 
drinking problem argy testified 
a roman catholic priest who operates an alcoholism treatment 
center in havre de grace md testified that the former 
presidential aide complained of blackouts when he was admitted for 
a months stay in 1986 following his second hospitalization 
but on crossexamination by prosecutors the rev joseph martin 
noted that treatment records showed deaver enjoyed a nightly game 
of trivial pursuits a board game that tests players memory on 
a broad range of subjects 
the priest praised deavers successful twoyear fight against 
alcoholism saying i dont know if i could sit in the chair 
where he is facing what he is facing with the serenity and 
equanimity that he has 
he will weather what happens and he will continue going to aa 
alcoholics anonymous until he dies said the priest the first 
of several witnesses deavers lawyers planned to call during the 
twoday proceeding 
the defense is trying to convince us district judge thomas 
penfield jackson that alcoholism should be a mitigating factor in 
determining deavers sentence 
but independent counsel whitney north seymour jr argued that 
deavers treatment records show nothing to support any finding 
that his memory was impaired 
mr deavers ability to recall was absolutely functioning it 
was just that he decided to select what he wanted to recall said 
seymour 
among other things the former white house aide was convicted of 
perjury when he told a grand jury he couldnt recall contacting 
government officials such as thentransportation secretary 
elizabeth dole and others on behalf of private lobbying clients 
the telephone contacts with mrs dole and white house aide roger 
porter occurred when deaver was in the hospital while he was 
going through acute alcohol withdrawal and while he was sedated 
with tranquilizers turk said 
the doctors would say that deavers subsequent failure to 
recall what he was doing at the time was quite understandable he 
added 
but seymour was able to show that the call to mrs dole took 
place only 45 minutes after deaver had received his first 
tranquilizer a 25milligram dose of librium 
a telephone log produced at the trial showed deaver spoke with 
mrs dole at 5 pm that day deaver took the librium at 415 pm 
and a 20milligram dose of valium at 545 pm said argy reading 
from treatment records 
porter spoke with deaver the next day according to trial

carter clews a federal trade commission 
staffer fired and then rehired in a dispute over political 
activity on thursday blamed his troubles on commissioner andrew 
strenio 
clews was returned to the ftc payroll wednesday after 
complaining that his resignation a week earlier had not been 
submitted voluntarily that departure came in the wake of a dispute 
over letters the press aide sent out critical of democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis 
clews was given a choice of resigning or being fired when 
concerns were raised that the letters may have violated the hatch 
act which bans political activity by federal workers 
but commission general counsel robert paul said clews was 
reinstated on wednesday at least until an investigation could be 
completed into the facts surrounding the letters 
clews meanwhile issued a statement blaming strenio a 
democrat for his problems 
he charged that strenio was engaged in a witchhunt and was 
trying to turn the commission into a covert arm of the dukakis 
campaign 
if he had one iota of honor he would admit his culpability and 
resign from office clews said 
strenio in a statement issued by his office said mr clews 
claims that his dismissal or resignation from the federal trade 
commission somehow was caused by pressure from me that is 
incorrect 
i did not propose nor was i consulted about dismissing mr 
clews or demanding his resignation indeed i did not learn of his 
departure until after he left 
i am concerned about certain letters sent from the office of 
public affairs and have requested an investigation however i am 
reserving judgment on what action if any is appropriate until 
after that investigation is completed the statement said 
paul had reported that clews was being returned to the payroll 
but would remain on administrative leave until the matter could be 
settled 
that prompted clews to announce that he would not accept the 
pay instead saying he would divide the money among charities until 
the matter can be settled 
commission chairman daniel oliver and the other commission 
members will likely have to make a final decision on the case

schoolgirls who survived a bloody bus 
hijacking sang hymns thursday at a mass celebrated by pope john 
paul ii but still felt the terror from the night before when 
police stormed the bus in a hail of bullets 
one survivor said the hijackers opposed to the military 
government sang and prayed with the 71 hostages before shooting at 
the captives and lobbing grenades when police moved in to end the 
27hour ordeal on wednesday night 
three hijackers and a 14yearold girl were killed immediately 
on thursday a second passenger died of a bullet wound to the head 
and the fourth hijacker died the south african broadcasting corp 
said 
officials said 20 people were injured by bullets and by shrapnel 
from the hijackers grenades 
some of the hostages said they saw the hijackers setting up some 
type of explosive device 
the independent south african press association quoting 
wellplaced sources who watched the saga at close range said a 
explosive device to be triggered electronically was found fixed 
to the door of the bus 
the government which earlier denied south african forces were 
invited to help end the hijacking said south african police and 
lesotho soldiers assaulted the bus after the gunmen ordered the 
driver to crash into the grounds of the british high commission or 
embassy 
vitilina quoaoho 18 said the hijackers told us to lay under 
the chairs and they ordered the driver to pass through the locked 
gate of the embassy 
we saw a big light a flare fired by police and then the 
soldiers started shooting at the bus and the men the hijackers 
were shooting at us she said 
we were very frightened we are still frightened she said 
with her friends echoing her words as they spoke men and women 
singing hymns to the beat of drum walked by to take communion 
during a brief sunny moment in a mass that had been punctuated by 
thunder rain and cold winds 
the schoolgirls and several nuns who were aboard the bus were 
among a crowd of about 15000 who gathered at the maseru racecourse 
to see the pope beatify a french missionary who worked in lesotho 
until his death in 1914 
four of the girls wearing plastic bags as rainhats and blue 
uniforms from pope john xxii high school said that during the 
hijacking police appeared ready several times to fire at the bus 
during the journey to maseru from the hijack point at quachas neck 
the men the hijackers prevented them saying if you shoot 
you will be shooting your own people said one of the girls 
one unanswered question was why the hijackers suddenly tried to 
force the bus into the british embassy compound 
it happened less than a half hour after the popes motorcade 
with police escort had driven through the capital he arrived by 
road from south africa where his plane was diverted due to bad 
weather in maseru 
monica morori 36 who injured her feet jumping from the buss 
shattered windows during the shootout said the hijackers were 
joining passengers in singing and praying 
two of the hijackers were in their late teens and two were grown 
men 
after the mass the pope rode through the capitals main street 
to the queen elizabeth ii hospital where he gave medals and 
crucifixes to some of the injured including children and two nuns 
the pope urged his followers at thursdays youth rally to 
renounce every form of violence and hatred 
the increase of violence in the world can never be halted by 
responding with more of the same he said 
in an apparent criticism of some militants including activists 
who contend passive resistance alone cannot overcome south africas 
system of racial segregation john paul said there could be 
nothing further from the truth there is nothing passive about 
nonviolence 
the pope commented thursday on the bus hijacking remarking i 
am saddened to learn that others on their way to join me on this 
pilgrimage have been victims of a hijack that has caused such 
anguish and ended in bloodshed one of the nuns he visited 
sister florina nyogar who had a bruised face later told a 
reporter how she felt during the shooting 
we saw that it was our end and we accepted to die she said 
she said reports from the government that the hijackers refused 
to accept food for the hostages were inaccurate 
we didnt feel like eating or drinking we only felt like 
praying she said 
several hostages said the hijackers who brandished a 
sovietdesigned ak47 automatic rifle pistols and hand grenades 
claimed to be members of the lesotho liberation army a dissident 
group that for years was based in south africa but staged few 
operations 
lesothos ruling military council also blamed the dissident 
group for the hijacking the groups political commissar matladi 
sehlabaka told the star newspaper of johannesburg that his 
organization was not responsible 
we could not have undertaken such an operation because we are 
on talking terms with the lesotho regime sehlabaka said 
the hijackers reportedly demanded an end to military rule and 
asked for a meeting with the pope and king moshoeshoe ii 
the organization was also opposed to the leftist government of 
the late prime minister leabua jonathan who was ousted by the 
current military council in a bloodless coup in january 1986

hungary has agreed to renew full 
diplomatic ties with israel after a 21yearold break prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said upon his return from budapest thursday 
he suggested others in the soviet bloc may follow suit 
shamir also said the soviet union has diverged from its 
staunchly proarab position in the middle east conflict and was 
looking for solutions that would take israels needs into 
consideration as well 
the statement marked a turnabout for the hardline israeli 
leader who has accused moscow of scheming to trap israel by 
pushing for an international middle east peace conference shamir 
opposes such a conference and israeli officials have said that 
even if one was convened moscow could not take part until it 
renewed diplomatic relations 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc met in budapest with 
prime minister karoly grosz and other leaders his twoday private 
visit was the first to hungary by an israeli premier 
before leaving shamir held an emotional meeting with hungarian 
jews and pledged very close contacts with members of central 
europes largest jewish community 
shamir told reporters upon arriving in israel the hungarian 
prime minister concluded that we are approaching normal relations 
at a very fast pace 
he said no timetable was set for restoring ties but that we 
are heading for positive developments in the near future 
hungary and all other soviet bloc nations except romania cut 
diplomatic ties with israel after it captured lands of the blocs 
arab allies in the 1967 middle east war for years israel has 
worked quietly to restore the links 
shamir said grosz told him the issue of ties with israel 
frequently came up in his talks with other east european officials 
including soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 
shamir suggested that other east european nations may upgrade 
their ties with israel saying in response to a reporters 
question you should not be suprised if there will be news 
israeli officials said budapest could not have acted without 
soviet approval and that the step appeared to signal a new stage in 
the warming of relations with the soviet bloc 
this year the soviet union met a key israeli demand in 
permitting a growing number of jews to leave the country 
emigration figures in august reached an eightyear monthly high 
with 1864 jews allowed to leave moscow also has begun allowing 
soviet jews to visit relatives in israel 
the kremlin has exchanged consular delegations with israel and a 
soviet chamber orchestra now is touring israel as part of improved 
cultural links between the two countries 
a year ago hungary followed poland in setting up an interest 
section in tel aviv establishing the lowest possible level of 
diplomatic relations 
shamir said grosz briefed him on soviet positions on the mideast 
and other issues 
in hungary official reports made no reference to any planned 
restoration of diplomatic ties between israel and hungary 
hungarys official news agency mti said the two leaders reviewed 
bilateral ties and possibilities for the further development of 
contacts 
mti quoted deputy foreign minister laszlo kovacs as saying one 
reason for increasingly higher level contact with israel was 
the desire to promote middle east peace 
israel promised to assist hungary in economic and industrial 
development israel radio said 
inflation in hungary reached 18 percent this year and the 
country has a foreign debt of 18 billion 
hungarys jewish community numbers about 80000 and about 
240000 jews of hungarian origin live in israel

peace crusader abie nathan landed in 
israel thursday after meeting illegally with plo chief yasser 
arafat in tunis and authorities greeted him with a police summons 
nathan 61 was ordered to report to police for questioning 
friday for violating a law banning contacts with plo officials the 
activist insisted the trip had the blessing of the israeli army 
come to see me tomorrow if im in prison nathan told dozens 
of reporters as he arrived at ben gurion international airport near 
tel aviv 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip troops shot and 
wounded nine palestinians during clashes arab doctors said the 
army said troops fatally shot an 11yearold arab boy overnight 
after a patrol was attacked by a firebomb in gaza city 
the death brought to 266 the number of palestinians killed since 
the uprising against israeli occupation began dec 8 six israelis 
also have died 
nathan said he did not carry a message from arafat to israeli 
leaders but would request meetings with prime minister yitzhak 
shamir and foreign minister shimon peres to brief them on the 
session with the plo chief in tunis this week 
shamir accused nathan of violating israeli law and a foreign 
ministry official reacted sarcastically to nathans remark saying 
such a meeting would have to be done in jail 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity also accused 
nathan of helping arafat in his public relations campaign 
he apparently was referring to a wednesday news conference in 
strasbourg france during which the plo leader surprised his 
audience by wishing israelis a peaceful new year repeatedly using 
the hebrew phrase shana tova the jewish new year began sunday 
nathan said he urged arafat to make the gesture but he said the 
plo chiefs willingness to comply was a symbol for his readiness to 
recognize and negotiate with israel 
who would ever have dreamed that anyone could convince arafat 
to say shana tova nathan told reporters it was my idea i 
told him how to say it 
nathan also said he presented arafat with the names and photos 
of five israeli soldiers missing in action and was given assurances 
that the plo would try to help bring about their release 
nathan said israeli army officials provided the list after he 
told them he would try to meet arafat in tunis 
deputy army spokesman col raanan responding to nathans claim 
said the names of missing soldiers are available to anyone who 
asks i dont think he got any special blessing from the army 
nathan also presented arafat with a peace plan calling for 
mutual recognition between israel and the plo the peace activist 
said arafat promised to study the proposal 
during an address to socialist members of the european 
parliament in strasbourg on tuesday arafat said the plo accepted 
all un resolutions including 242 and 338 which recognize 
israels right to exist 
but peres speaking to reporters in london at the end of a 
twoday visit said the plo was in a confused state torn 
between proponents of compromise with israel and rejectionists who 
still dreamed of the destruction of the jewish state 
peres did not spell out whether israel now agreed to talk to the 
plo and accept an independent palestinian state israel has refused 
to negotiate with the plo saying it is a terror organization 
a 1986 israeli law bans meetings with representatives of terror 
groups including the plo and nathan could face up to three years 
in prison for meeting with arafat 
in 1966 nathan flew a private plane to port said egypt in an 
unsuccessful attempt to hold peace talks with egyptian president 
gamal abdel nasser at the time israel and egypt were still 
officially at war 
nathan served as a fighter pilot during the 1948 middle east war 
and owns the voice of peace a pirate radio station broadcasting 
from the mediterranean

recent findings about auto pollution could 
make it easier for many cities to meet federal clean air standards 
the head of the environmental protection agency said thursday 
the findings could double the effectiveness of planned agency 
regulations to control the volatility of gasoline and the recovery 
of gasoline fumes 
only in the past year has the agency begun to study what is 
called running loss the evaporation of gasoline from the tank 
and other fuel system components while the car is moving 
gasoline fumes react in sunlight with nitrogen oxides from all 
fuel combustion to produce ozone which is harmful to the lungs 
ozone is the constituent of urban smog that makes the chest feel 
tight 
proposed regulations discussed for years and frequently 
postponed for reworking had been calculated to reduce urban 
gasoline emissions by 10 percent or 15 percent epa administrator 
lee m thomas said at luncheon for reporters 
a new calculation of running loss suggests the effectiveness of 
the planned regulations could be as much as twice that thomas 
said 
this could mean cities close to compliance with federal clean 
air standards will have an easier time meeting the requirements and 
may not have to launch programs to inspect auto exhausts and 
pollution control systems he said 
i mean the marginal cities where reductions in hydrocarbons of 
zero to 25 percent would be required thomas said 
thomas said he could not say which closetocompliance cities 
might comply under the planned regulations but those most favored 
would be areas with peak concentrations in the 014 parts per 
million range and below 
the federal standard calls for limiting peak ozone to 012 parts 
per million and limiting excursions above that to no more than one 
hour per year 
epas list of noncomplying areas contains 68 urban and rural 
areas 38 of them with peaks of 014 ppm and below 
federal regulations have long governed how much unburned 
gasoline could be emitted in exhaust and how much could be 
evaporated while the car is stationary but epa has ignored 
evaporation while running in the belief that the amounts escaping 
vapor recovery systems were negligible 
gasoline volatility has risen throughout the 1980s and greater 
volatility brings increased emissions through evaporation 
exxon corp scientists revealed in may that their own and epa 
tests showed vapor recovery systems on cars were being overwhelmed 
on hot days releasing to the atmosphere perhaps 25 times as much 
gasoline as was permitted in exhaust 
the proposed regulations will remove most of this important and 
previously unknown source of ozone 
epa scientists said at the time it was an important discovery 
but they had not had a chance to calculate what the new findings 
would mean for urban ozone pollution thomas disclosure thursday 
was the first such assessment 
thomas said he planned to republish the regulations in final 
form for public comment in plenty of time to adopt them before the 
reagan administration leaves office

firefighters at 
yellowstone national park on thursday began building water bars 
on hiking trails so the precipitation that has fallen on the park 
this week would not erode the paths 
the logs placed across hiking trails divert runoff from melting 
snow park officials said 
as some 7200 firefighters and 1200 soldiers worked to take 
advantage of continued good weather democratic presidential 
candidate michael dukakis and the governors of wyoming montana 
colorado and idaho got a firsthand look at the destruction wrought 
by fires that have consumed about 1 million acres of the nations 
oldest park since july 
i cant remember a year in my lifetime when the weather seemed 
to be more important to us in many ways the drought the heat and 
now a massive hurricane bearing down on us are reminding us not 
only of our mortality but of the importance of pulling together and 
caring for each other dukakis said 
dukakis said he was awestruck by whats happened here 
about 9000 firefighters including soldiers brought in from 
military bases in the west have been tackling the fires at the 22 
millionacre park crews received a break this week with lower 
temperatures rain and snow 
this week is a lull in the battle its quiet and nothing is 
really going on said fire information officer bob valen at 
yellowstone 
there was no such luck for firefighters in montana oregon and 
idaho 
soldiers began relieving weary firefighters on the smoldering 
canyon creek fire in westcentral montana while afternoon winds 
and higher temperatures kept crews busy on a blaze in glacier 
national park 
forecasters meanwhile predicted another canadian cold front 
may hit montana this weekend bringing rain or even snow at higher 
elevations 
with just a little bit of luck maybe we could get enough 
precipitation to put the doggone fires out said national 
weather service meterologist jack poppe 
temperatures rose into the 80s thursday on the 32200acre red 
bench fire in glacier park where nearly 1000 firefighters were 
trying to complete the final mile of fire line and prevent the 
flames from escaping 
the fire has destroyed 21 homes and numerous outbuildings 
killed one firefighter and injured up to a dozen others since 
raging out of control sept 6 
in oregon willamette national forest crews worked on a 
4dayold fire that grew to 6350 acres overnight and put out so 
much smoke firefighters sometimes couldnt find the fire said us 
forest service spokesman norm hesseldahl 
it was a pretty frustrating day he said one of the 
fellows told me he was standing on the dam at hills creek reservoir 
and couldnt see the dam the smoke was so thick 
idaho still has about 300000 acres of forest fires and several 
wilderness and forest areas have been closed to public entry until 
the fire danger eases

local school boards should find supplements or 
alternatives to collective bargaining with teacher unions to bring 
about education reforms a national school boards association panel 
said thursday 
while most public school systems participate in collective 
bargaining with their teacher organizations the adversarial nature 
of these discussions has worked against cooperation and candor in 
some instances the panel said in a 44page report 
the panel was convened last year by the associations 
thenpresident jonathan t howe who is a local school board member 
in northbrook ill to look into how we get into these 
situations of strikes at the opening of school terms each 
september 
the report comes on the heels of carnegie foundation survey 
released this week showing that teachers believe they have little 
role in key classroom decisions and want more authority and 
responsibility 
howe said he agreed with the foundations conclusions that 
teachers should have more to say about such things but not through 
collective bargaining by their unions 
collective bargaining today is what i call pmp power 
money and process he said these are the three items that 
normally get discussed at the bargaining table it is nearly 
impossible to discuss working cooperatively for the benefit of 
school children after hours of debate solely on pay scales 
benefits and length of contract 
howe said unionheralded education reform efforts in dade 
county fla and rochester ny came about not through 
collective bargaining but through a waiver of collective bargaining 
to bring about change 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said howes conclusion that collective bargaining entails 
only power money and process contradicts examples of reforms cited 
in the report in school systems in dade county rochester toledo 
and pittsburgh 
the idea that innovative education reform initiatives in 
rochester and miami could have taken place without the strong 
backing of local aft affiliates or a strong contract is just plain 
wrong shanker said 
he called collective bargaining the best way for communicating 
between teachers and school administrators because it insures 
that whatever dialogue occurs is held on equal ground 
the associations report said the two major themes surfacing in 
several recent calls for education reform are restructuring schools 
and empowerment of teachers 
but it defines empowerment as sharing information not 
power with teachers designing instructional programs in 
cooperation with them and assigning them a share of the 
responsibility for fostering excellence

three antiapartheid leaders 
taking refuge in the us consulate after escaping from detention 
said thursday they do not trust the governments promise not to 
rearrest them 
colleagues of the activists who had been detained without trial 
for at least a year said they may ask the united states to serve 
as guarantor for an agreement that the three would remain free and 
unrestricted if they leave their sanctuary 
firoz cachalia an associate of the three said the governments 
promises are not worth the paper theyre written on he said 
the activists were likely to remain in the consulate until firm 
guarantees could be obtained 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said wednesday the activists 
would not be arrested if they left the consulate a spokesman for 
vlok brig leon mellet said the three were now normal free 
people and would have been released shortly if they had not 
escaped 
the activists have not indicated when or if they will leave the 
consulate on the 11th floor of a johannesburg office building 
they have rejected proposals to leave the country in exchange for 
freedom 
the three said in a statement thursday it is clear that the 
minister vlok intends placing us under severe restrictions we 
consider bannings and house arrest just another form of detention 
the crucial question is what kind of freedom does the minister 
envisage for us they said is it the freedom he has imposed on 
albertina sisulu and raymond suttner or is it the freedom which he 
himself or any other nationalist party member enjoys 
suttner a white activist was placed under severe restrictions 
when he was released this month after 27 months in detention mrs 
sisulu wife of jailed african national congress leader walter 
sisulu is barred from making public statements and from most 
political activities 
the banned anc is the leading guerrilla organization fighting 
white minority rule in south africa 
the escapees are murphy morobe acting publicity secretary of 
the banned united democratic front mohammed valli moosa the 
fronts acting general secretary and vusi khanyile chairman of 
the banned national education crisis committee 
morobe detained since july 1987 and khanyile detained since 
december 1986 are black valli moosa arrested with morobe is 
indian 
they slipped away from two police guards tuesday while 
undergoing physiotherapy at a hospital 
the activists lawyer krish naidoo said he had received no 
official word from the government that the men were free the 
government said assurances to that effect were given to us 
officials 
prominent antiapartheid leaders consulted with the trio 
thursday and morobe was visited by his wife and two children 
us officials have said the activists will not be forced to 
leave the consulate despite a worldwide us policy of not formally 
granting asylum in diplomatic offices 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge for 
varying periods since june 1986 when the government declared a 
state of emergency to control widespread black protests 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

protesters armed with clubs and 
firebombs battled riot police thursday at an antigovernment 
demonstration and at least 48 people were injured reports said 
the melee started when riot police stopped about 600 students 
and dissidents from marching off the campus of aju university in 
suwon 25 miles south of seoul the korean news agency yonhap 
reported it said four students were arrested 
protesters shouted slogans opposing a government ban on what 
they called legal demonstrations when the olympic games open in 
seoul saturday 
yonhap said police refrained from using tear gas because suwon 
is designated as a peace zone police and school authorities 
declined to comment 
authorities have banned all street demonstrations in peace 
zones in seoul and other cities which have olympic venues and 
related facilities 
yonhap said demonstrators organized the rally at the aju campus 
to protest an earlier police action in which a student was 
seriously injured after being hit by a tear gas canister sept 7 
during an antiolympic antigovernment demonstration at a nearby 
university campus 
protests during the past week have been small and attracted 
little support with the great majority of south koreans and most 
students ignoring demands the olympics be shared with communist 
north korea to help promote reunification of the divided korean 
peninsula

george bush taking aim at one of his 
opponents main bragging points said thursday that michael 
dukakis economic policies have hurt massachusetts and would 
knock the foundations from under the national economy 
he also renewed his public hope that lt col oliver north a 
key figure in the irancontra affair be found innocent of the 
federal charges he faces 
bush said massachusetts has lost 26000 jobs in the past five 
years while dukakis has been governor a contention at odds with 
federal figures that show a big increase during the period though 
jobs in manufacturing have decreased by about that number 
and in a comment two days before the opening of the summer 
olympic games he said dukakis should be crowned the gold medal 
winner in the taxandspend competition 
on economics bush quoted his democratic presidential rival as 
saying he wants to do for the nation what he has done for 
massachusetts the vice president added that slogan is 
sounding more and more like a threat 
winding up a twoday campaign drive in california where the 
presidential race is neck and neck bush delivered a speech before 
san franciscos commonwealth club whose members include 
businessmen lawyers and politicians 
under my opponent massachusetts has lost lost 26000 jobs 
since 1983 more than any other state in the country bush said 
government figures indicate the state has gained more than 
230000 jobs in the past five years the text of bushs speech said 
manufacturing jobs and aides said that was what the campaign 
would stand by government figures do show a loss in manufacturing 
jobs more than made up for by increases in other areas 
bush said that under dukakis taxing and spending in 
massachusetts has increased more than in any other state and 
that the state has amassed a 74 billion dollar debt 
dukakis responding to the bush remarks while on an inspection 
tour of fivedamaged yellowstone national park said 
my state has more jobs than people to fill them were very 
proud of what weve done weve not only built a strong 
economic future but weve balanced budgets 10 years in a row 
on a different subject bush was asked about north by a student 
at a concord calif high school asked whether he would pardon 
north bush said the question is for me pardon imputes guilt 
and therefore i have refused to speculate on this because i want to 
see this man have a fair trial i hope hes found innocent 
in my description anybody that shed his blood in vietnam with 
two or three purple hearts is a hero for that bush said now 
did he make some mistakes maybe so but youre not going to see me 
picking on ollie north 
at the same questionandanswer session a girl needled him 
about flubbing the date of the japanese bombing of pearl harbor 
and a boy asked if bush didnt want to deck dukakis for teasing 
him on the same issue 
bush told the boy when you make a mistake like that i expect 
somebody to jump on me 
and when the girl asked him when was pearl harbor he joked 
about being in connecticut instead of california teased her about 
never having made a mistake in her life then waxed serious 
i remember because i fought for my country in warand i hope 
well never have another one the former bomber pilot said 
later aboard air force two bush said he would study debate 
tapes from president reagan in preparation for his own encounters 
with dukakis because i think its important to say what you 
feel in your heart more than reel off some statistics 
bush relaxed and sipped on a glass of wine as he told reporters 
his goal in the debates is to project what i am warts and all 
responding to an account in a forthcoming book about president 
reagan that said some aides expressed serious doubts about the 
presidents mental ability to carry out his duties during the 
irancontra crisis bush said 
i was there i saw the president this is so offensive to me 
its so grossly unfair to a very successful president it really 
offends me 
bush said dukakis as governor has tried to raise taxes five 
times most recently this summer with a 180 million increase in 
business taxes sales taxes and personal income taxes 
when taxpayers rebelled dukakis was forced to sign a repeal 
bush said this by the way is one of the five tax cuts that 
he boasts about in his campaign gospel gospel truth bush 
said calling the other four inconsequential 
bush said that under dukakis massachusetts has had the second 
fastest increase in state taxes per capita of all 50 states when 
it comes to increasing state spending per capita my opponent is 
at the top of the list leading the 50 states 
michael boskin a stanford university professor who is a bush 
economic adviser said the taxincrease ranking was based on an 
increase in tax revenue during dukakis past five years 
in general that increase was caused by higher income not 
higher tax rates he said 
bush also said that under dukakis massachusetts has ranked 40th 
in job growth and 45th in manufacturing job growth

one of four british commandos who shot and 
killed three unarmed ira guerrillas in march told a coroners 
inquest thursday that one of the three made a suspicious movement 
and then failed to heed a warning to stop 
another soldier who took no part in the actual shooting backed 
up the first witness account that the man sean savage 24 looked 
like he was reaching for a weapon 
the special air services commando who shot savage said the irish 
republican army member would still be alive if he stopped when 
warned 
the commando identified only as soldier d for security 
reasons said savage instead moved his hand aggressively toward a 
jacket pocket spurring him and his partner to fire 
we gave savage an option said the commando hidden from 
view by a curtain during his testimony 
if he had stopped im telling you he would be alive now he 
was given more than enough time we had no need to give him a 
warning we gave him the benefit of the doubt 
he was crossexamined by patrick mcgrory the attorney for the 
ira members families 
a third soldier said he saw mairead farrell 31 fall to the 
ground but saw no move on her part such as lifting her arm in 
the air to surrender 
news reports and a documentary by independent television in 
britain have quoted witnesses to the march 6 shooting in gibraltar 
as saying farrell tried to surrender but was shot down 
the testimony came on the eighth day of an inquest by gibraltar 
coroner felix pizzarello and an 11man jury into the shooting 
deaths of savage farrell and daniel mccann 30 by the elite 
antiterrorist unit of the british military 
critics of british prime minister margaret thatchers government 
claimed the deaths were evidence of an unofficial shoottokill 
policy against ira members on missions against british targets 
the ira has acknowledged the three were members of its 
organization and that they were on active service when killed 
a senior british intelligence officer testified earlier that the 
soldiers believed the three were planning to set off a car bomb in 
this fortress colony with a remotecontrol radio device 
soldier d said he shot savage nine times in all the last 
two into savages head he denied shooting savage repeatedly in the 
head after the ira man fell to the ground or putting his foot on 
savages chest and shooting him 
mcgrory suggested such action would be sheer murder 
well it wouldnt be a nice thing to do the soldier said 
prompting laughter 
is that the best thing you can say that it wasnt a very nice 
thing to do mcgrory asked 
well it wasnt was it the soldier responded 
soldier d denied being in a frenzy at the time 
i carried on shooting until he was no longer a threat he 
testified 
soldier m another witness said he saw mccann farrell and 
savage together before savage separated himself from the others 
minutes before the shootings 
he said he noticed two soldiers closing in on mccann and 
farrell then heard gunfire and saw farrell falling to the ground 
john laws the attorney for the crown and gibraltar police 
commissioner joseph canepa asked soldier m whether he saw farrell 
raise her hand to surrender 
soldier m said he had not 
another surveillance team member identified as h said he 
saw mccann and farrell in front of a filling station after they 
separated from savage 
they stopped and appeared concerned h said soldiers a 
and b went into a rigid pose and there was firing i moved behind 
soldiers c and d 
soldiers a through d did the actual shooting 
savage stopped and spun around and there was an expression of 
surprise in his face h told the inquest 
i feared he would be armed and that he would use his weapon 
indiscriminately at myself and other bystanders 
i then heard shots fired by soldiers c and d 
the two shooting sites are within a clear line of sight about 
200 feet apart near the british colonys border with spain 
h said he had no doubt that the move made by savage 
constituted a threat to soldiers c and d 
the inquest will resume friday

the head of the food and drug administration 
told congress on thursday that his agency was moving toward banning 
a chemical that once was used widely as a propellant in hairsprays 
dr frank e young stopped short of saying his agency definitely 
would make final a threeyearold proposal to prohibit use of the 
product methylene chloride 
but he told the house small business committees regulation 
subcommittee that based on the data his agency has gathered so far 
we feel all the evidence indicates it is a hazardous substance 
the fda should announce its final decision on the substance by 
the end of the year other government agencies also would have to 
consider the proposal before it becomes official 
the fda believing the substance is a carcinogen proposed 
banning use of the product in 1985 
just the introduction of this for just a few seconds in the 
air in the bathroom every morning is a risk young told the 
lawmakers 
the cosmetics industry has conceded that the chemical is 
hazardous for cosmeticians who might use it several times a day 
but has argued that it is safe for consumers but since the 
government first proposed to halt the substances use the industry 
has reduced dramatically its reliance on it 
the halogenated solvents industry alliance representing 200 
companies that use distribute and produce chlorinated solvents 
issued a statement saying the fda overestimates the potential 
health risk presented by exposure to methylene chloride 
alliance president paul a cammer said a recently updated study 
of eastman kodak co workers exposed to the substance for an 
average of 22 years found no increase in overall cancer mortality 
resulting from exposure to the chemical 
heinz j eiermann director of the fdas division of color and 
cosmetics said that less than 2 percent or 1 percent of the 
hairspray now in use contains the product 
for all practical purposes it has been eliminated he said 
during a break in the subcommittee meeting 
eiermann said the agency was moving toward issuing a final rule 
on the product to prevent its use in the future

the chief philippine negotiator in us bases 
talks said thursday the two sides are close to agreement on how 
much cash the united states should pay to use the bases but remain 
sharply divided on noncash compensation and other issues 
we are still far apart although we both agree that our hard 
components thus far are not far from each other philippine 
foreign secretary raul manglapus said in an interview he defined 
hard components as the cash and commodities congress would be 
asked to appropriate as part of the bases agreement 
he did not say how much aid is proposed but congressional 
sources have said us negotiators offered close to 500 million 
including a doubling of direct basesrelated aid to 360 million 
for fiscal 1989 manglapus declined to say how much the philippines 
wants but said other issues are as important as the demand for 
compensation which manila news reports have put as high as 12 
billion a year 
manglapus said he was not surprised when us defense secretary 
frank carlucci told him wednesday that the united states is 
prepared to move its bases out of the country if pushed to pay too 
much 
carluccis warning was echoed by secretary of state george p 
shultz who said thursday the united states may be forced to seek 
alternative sites for the bases 
speaking to the local chapter of the asia society which seeks 
to promote usasian friendship shultz said it would be 
preferable for the united states to maintain its presence at the 
bases but there are alternatives which we are having now to 
examine 
he gave no further details but other officials have indicated 
that the untied states is exploring the possibility of relocating 
elsewhere in east asia including guam 
shultz acknowledged that the negotiations on compensation and 
other issues basically arent going very well and said the 
philippines is overestimating the amount of resources the united 
states can provide as compensation 
manglapus said his country also is preparing for such a 
possibility and said no decision has been made on whether to 
conduct negotiations for us access to the massive clark air base 
subic navy base and other facilities after the current agreement 
lapses in 1991 the talks now in recess in manila cover only the 
agreements final two years and not the longterm future of the 
bases 
manglapus said the philippines recognizes that the united 
states in its own interest might one day decide to pull out of 
the philippine bases 
carlucci showed a considerable amount of open mindedness on 
bases issues manglapus said describing their meeting as very 
positive 
he said unresolved issues include the storage of nuclear weapons 
on the bases ownership of improvements to the bases procurement 
policies and the writeoff of debts for military equipment 
he said the negotiating panels have agreed to seek creative 
ways to increase noncash benefits to the philippines including 
other debt writeoffs and increased purchases of philippine 
products but nothing has been resolved 
we have not gotten anything out of the american panel he 
said criticizing us negotiators for attempting to put the cost 
of us operations in the money package including salaries paid to 
filipino employees and travel expenses incurred by us officials 
the foreign secretary who said he is discussing the bases issue 
with a variety of us officials but not conducting negotiations 
while in washington said his private communications with officials 
of neighboring asian governments reveal none of the quiet support 
for us bases that american officials claim 
they either say nothing or they say the opposite said 
manglapus 
he said the philippines has been reminding other southeast asian 
nations of the lonely role it is playing in hosting the bases 
surveys of filipinos show only a small percentage of outright 
opposition to the bases he said but a large number of people say 
they would want the bases out if the americans do not improve the 
bases agreement including additional compensation

george bush said thursday he hopes oliver north is found 
innocent of charges in the irancontra affair and declined to rule 
out a pardon if the former white house aide is convicted michael 
dukakis toured yellowstone national park and said he was 
awestruck by the summers fire damage 
bush seized the role of campaign aggressor for the day saying 
that under dukakis massachusetts has fared poorly on jobs 
creation he derisively awarded his democratic rival a gold medal 
in the tax and spend competition 
but the vice presidents attack was marred when he omitted a 
word from his prepared text and said massachusetts had lost jobs 
since 1983 official figures show the state has lost manufacturing 
jobs as bushs prepared speech said but overall employment has 
risen by more than 200000 jobs 
dukakis aides in massachusetts rushed to criticize bushs 
claim but the governor himself at first said ill be responding 
to that sometime next week 
later in the same session with reporters without further 
prompting he said if this nation had 3 percent unemployment 
the rate in massachusetts and had 10 years of balanced budgets 
and had the record that we have we could be looking forward to a 
future of strength and optimism and jobs for everybody 
my state has more jobs than people to fill them he said 
asserting that the reagan administration has left a fiscal mess 
in washington 
later en route to los angeles he added what mr bush has 
given us is a mountain of debt record deficits a record trade 
deficit and an economic future that does not bode well for the 
american people 
bush was on the attack in the battle of the television 
commercials as well airing an ad in environmentally minded 
california that accused dukakis of permitting the harbor in boston 
to become the dirtiest in america dukakis ran advertisements 
touting his own record on crime fighting and other issues 
both campaigns were pointing toward the first campaign debate a 
90minute televised session in winstonsalem nc on sept 25 
bushs office released a schedule showing the vice president 
with limited campaigning outside washington next week and large 
blocks of time at home 
dukakis also will have a curtailed travel schedule next week 
and aides disclosed that washington attorney bob barnett would join 
the group of advisers preparing him for the debate barnett played 
the role of a bush standin when democrat geraldine ferraro was 
preparing for the vice presidential debate in the 1984 campaign 
bush said thursday aboard air force two that he would study 
tapes of president reagan debating because i think its important 
to say what you feel in your heart more than reel off some 
statistics 
what id like the bottom line to be is that i come out for 
what i am warts and all he said 
the topic of the irancontra affair arose when bush fielded 
questions from high school students in california and was asked 
whether he would pardon north 
the question is for me pardon imputes guilt and therefore i 
have refused to speculate on this because i want to see this man 
have a fair trial i hope hes found innocent im not one of the 
north critics im not one of these people that are jumping all 
over this guy he said 
so i hope hes found innocent and then id have to make a 
determination later on as to the equity in that nature 
earlier bush ripped into dukakis in a speech in san francisco 
the fact is the socalled massachusetts miracle is really the 
massachusetts mirage and right now that state is approaching a 
fiscal fiasco that might best be described as a budgetary three 
mile island facing a budgetary meltdown he said 
bush said that under dukakis massachusetts has lost lost 
26000 jobs since 1983 more than any other state in the country 
but bushs own text said massachusetts has lost manufacturing 
jobs while federal figures show the state has gained jobs overall 
spokesman mark goodin said bush was referring to manufacturing 
jobs when he spoke 
despite dukakis having presided over several tax cuts bush said 
that during his rivals tenure massachusetts has had the second 
fastest increase in state taxes per capita of all 50 states when 
it comes to increasing state spending per capita my opponent is 
at the top of the list leading the 50 states 
if this were the olympics his composite score would make him 
the gold winner gold medal winner in the tax and spend 
competition he said 
bush renewed his pledge not to raise taxes as well as his call 
for a cut in the tax on investment profits he said dukakis has 
tried to raise taxes five times most recently this summer with a 
180 million increase in business taxes sales taxes and personal 
income taxes 
dukakis rarely seen wearing anything other than a dark suit and 
red necktie visited yellowstone dressed in khaki pants a brown 
suede jacket and boots that looked nearly new 
he said he was awestruck by whats happened here 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen said as he 
campaigned through his native texas that the democratics fortunes 
have bottomed out after a rough patch and were on the rebound 
weve see in the last four or five days as weve taken these 
issues on on defense and theseoutrageous charges on patriotism 
that the polls have turned around he told reporters 
many polls in recent days have found a slight advantage for 
bush although a washington postabc survey conducted sept 713 
reported dukakis with 48 percent support and bush with 45 a 
statistical dead heat 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle was in 
oklahoma city during the day where he indicated he was tired of 
having dukakis refer to him as j danforth quayle

moslem kidnappers holding four educators 
issued a photograph thursday of two of their american hostages with 
a handwritten statement setting out conditions under which their 
captives might be freed 
the offer from the islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine organization was in a note delivered to a western news 
agency in beirut the note included a polaroid picture of alann 
steen 49 of boston and jesse jonathan turner 41 a native of 
boise idaho the men have been held for nearly 20 months 
the picture showed steen and turner smiling broadly resting on 
a mattress with a flowered pattern and a violet pillow each was 
holding a cigarette both wore navy blue outfits and had long hair 
steen was cleanshaven while turner had a bushy beard 
steen turner robert polhill 54 originally of new york city 
and mithileshwar singh 60 an indian who is a legal resident alien 
of the united states were kidnapped on jan 24 1987 from the 
campus of the us affiliated beirut university college by gunmen 
posing as riot police 
the statement written in arabic hinted that the moslem group 
would free its hostages if the us administration undertook an 
initiative within one week in support of the palestinian uprising 
in israelioccupied territories the uprising began dec 8 
official us policy is that washington will not bargain under 
such conditions 
the hostages wives who still are living at the campus were 
not available for immediate comment on the new statement telephone 
calls at the college go through a switchboard which closes at 11 
pm an hour before the statement was delivered 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine is believed to be 
sympathetic to the palestinians as well as irans revolutionary 
patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the four educators are among 17 foreigners missing and believed 
held hostage in lebanon the 17 include nine americans three 
britons an indian an irishman an italian and two unidentified 
men 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped in beirut 
on march 16 1985 
the statement said our organization plans to undertake a 
positive initiative to ease the issue of the hostages but it needs 
adequate reactions by international forums toward the rights of our 
moslem palestinian people in their struggle against the zionist 
enemy 
the us administration should be the first among the 
governments that should declare a clear positive stance toward the 
rights of our people in harmony with its claims of defending human 
rights 
it concluded at this sensitive stage of the uprising led by 
comrade strugglers in the interior of the occupied territories 
we offer this intiative and expect from the governments concerned a 
response within one week of the publication of this statement we 
then will be ready to advance further in this initiative 
the term ease the issue of the hostages usually indicates 
willingness to free the captives 
the statement said the groups offer was timed to coincide with 
the 10th month of the uprising against israeli occupation of the 
west bank and the gaza strip 
every day and every month of the history of this uprising is 
proving that the element of faith is growing greater the 
statement said 
from this concept the organization of islamic jihad for the 
liberation of palestine declares its blessing for all the factions 
of the moslem palestinian people as well as the entire islamic 
nation 
steen was a communications instructor when kidnapped from the 
college and turner a visiting professor of mathematics and computer 
science polhill lectured in accounting and singh was a visiting 
professor of finance

michael dukakis viewing 
the devastation caused by fires in one of the nations most popular 
parks resisted being drawn thursday into another longdistance 
spat with presidential rival george bush 
ill be responding to that sometime next week said dukakis 
when asked his reaction to bushs latest attack on the dukakis 
claim that under his governance massachusetts has undergone an 
economic miracle 
bush said that people and business were leaving massachusetts 
and that my opponent ranks first in spending increases second in 
tax hikes 
if this were the olympics his composite score would make him 
the gold medal winner in the tax and spend category bush said 
when the questioner said but mr bush said it today dukakis 
just smiled and replied good luck to mr bush 
after responding to a number of questions about the fires and 
gun control dukakis apparently thought better of his refusal to 
respond to bush 
without further prompting he said if this nation had 3 
percent unemployment the rate in massachusetts and had 10 years 
of balanced budgets and had the record that we have we could be 
looking forward to a future of strength and optimism and jobs for 
everybody my state has more jobs than people to fill them 
he compared conditions in massachusetts with whats happened 
under mr bush and the administration of which hes been a part and 
the kind of fiscal mess im going to inherit as the next 
president of the united states 
after flying from west yellowstone mont to los angeles 
dukakis showed less reluctance to join the fray with bush 
anybody whod compare my states economy with three mile 
island must be suffering meltdown he told reporters at the 
airport what mr bush has given us is a mountain of debt record 
deficits a record trade deficit and an economic future that does 
not bode well for the american people 
dukakis was briefed by officials at the fireblackened national 
park on efforts to contain the blazes bob barbee superintendent 
of the park said afterward were not out of the woods yet 
the briefing took place on a road overlooking the madison river 
and a blackened hillside 
the democratic presidential candidate rarely seen wearing 
anything other than a dark suit and red necktie dressed for the 
occasion in khaki pants a brown suede jacket and boots that looked 
nearly new 
joining him were four democratic governors mike sullivan of 
wyoming ted schwinden of montana roy romer of colorado and cecil 
andrus of idaho 
dukakis was told that fires had burned over 15 million acres in 
the park and near it 
dukakis said he was awestruck by whats happened here 
i cant remember a year in my lifetime he said when the 
weather seemed to be more important to us in many ways the 
drought the heat and now a massive hurricane bearing down on us 
are reminding us not only of our mortality but of the importance of 
pulling together and caring for each other 
questioned about his position on gun control dukakis said he 
believes hunters and sportsmen had a right to own guns and use them 
in a legitimate and responsible way 
i think people who want to protect themselves in their homes 
should be able to do so subject to the appropriate state laws he 
said let me remind you mr bush was voting for gun control when 
he was in congress 
he refused to enter a controversy over the way the fires have 
been handled saying put out the fires first and make dure 
theyre under control then he added there would be time to 
review the policies

you dont have to tell louisiana oldtimers what to do when a 
hurricane begins brewing in the gulf of mexico 
because of the size and strength of this storm we didnt have 
to be told to leave said linda toupuisaid who along with her 
husband runs the tampt grocery in holly beach la where by midday 
thursday fewer than 25 of the coastal towns 100 residents were 
still around it could take a northerly course if its any time 
to pack up for one this is the one 
this is the first time weve packed up in years said mrs 
touchet whose living quarters are in the rear of the grocery 
their back yard is beach and the gulf of mexico where hurricane 
gilbert packing winds of 120 mph was moving slowly toward the 
northnorthwest 
isolated squalls from gilberts northern edge knocked out power 
thursday morning in parts of grand isle a resort community on a 
barrier island of the louisiana coast mayor andy valence warned 
some 2000 residents who evacuated wednesday not to return too soon 
were asking all of those people to stay put where they are 
because grand isle wont be a very nice place to be today said 
valence 
tides were expected to reach 5 feet above normal all along the 
coast and valence said louisiana 1 the only route from grand isle 
to the mainland was certain to flood 
some 20000 people had been ordered to evacuate the states 
coast by thursday afternoon but many hadnt waited for marching 
orders 
and in cameron hayes picou felt no more pressure in making an 
evacuation decision for the hurricanesavvy parish 
you just take the data available and like any other job you 
make a decision the 39yearold parish civil defense director 
said as he ordered what he called a precautionary evacuation of the 
remainder of the population of 10000 
sixtyfive percent have already gone he said thats 
enough data right there should you secondguess 65 percent of the 
people 
by 6 pm about 75 percent of the population had left most of 
the others said they would stay put unless the storm takes a turn 
to the north 
picou said it was as total an evacuation as hed seen in this 
coastal parish since hurricane audrey swept a tidal wave through 
the marsh killing 500 people 
audrey is burned into the minds of the population and people are 
educated to the danger of hurricanes from birth said picou 
in fact hurricane gilbert became a classroom exercise for the 
eighth grade at grand caillou middle school this week 
were teaching it while its here said teacher david 
duplantis who took advantage of the weather to teach how air 
currents develop into hurricanes 
everybodys saying its the worst one yet said melissa 
guidry 13 who lives in a trailer along bayou grand caillou in 
dulac if its worse than juan then i guess im scared 
there was one parent who just left here she said they were 
taking their children to tennessee said principal danny smith 
who used a hurricane tracking map to plot gilberts progress 
others plan ahead for these things including one man who told 
school secretary joyce trahan he was putting his pirogue a 
flatbottom canoe on top of his car 
he said im gonna drive north and when i get to someplace 
where somebody asks me what that is on top of my car ill know 
ive gone far enough the secretary said

the first black mayor of birmingham said 
thursday night the deaths of four girls in a church bombing 25 
years ago was not the end but the beginning of a story we are 
still writing together 
richard arrington in his third term as the mayor of a city once 
bitterly divided racially spoke at a service held in memory of the 
victims of the sept 15 1963 bombing at the 16th street baptist 
church 
arrington told the racially mixed congregation of about 1400 
that the torch that we raise tonight is raised by two hands one 
black and one white 
arrington described birmingham as a city of change and said the 
bombing by a ku klux klansman was a tragedy of a community and a 
tragedy of a people so immense was that tragedy that it resounded 
around our globe 
we have the power to transcend that tragic event we are 
determined it will have a redeeming quality 
a plaque in the church contains pictures of four girls with the 
inscription may men learn to replace bitterness and violence 
with love and understanding 
the present pastor of the church rev james e young said 
birmingham has provided spiritual and moral leadership to the 
world for the past quarter century 
referring to the church bombing and to other civil rights 
problems young described the 1960s as years of silent tears 
and told the congregation we are here to worship the god who 
brought triumph out of tragedy 
thursday nights service was sponsored by a biracial committee 
that sent invitations to other community groups that read in 
embracing our history there is healing 
arrington and black and white ministers spoke in memory of 
cynthia wesley addie mae collins and carol robertson all 14 and 
denise mcnair 11 who were preparing for a youth program when the 
explosion killed them a quartercentury ago 
more than 40 earlier bombings had occurred in birmingham during 
the civil rights struggles of the late 1950s and early 1960s but 
no one was killed in those 
the church bombing galvanized the city 
all of us are victims and most of us are innocent victims 
said the mayor at the time albert boutwell 
a citywide moment of prayer was observed at noon the next day 
but lowering of racial barriers took much longer 
be concerned not only with who murdered them but with the 
philosophy of life that murdered them martin luther king jr 
said at the combined funeral of three of the girls 
all visible barriers now are gone in birmingham which has six 
blacks and three whites on its city council 
a retired automobile mechanic and ku klux klansman robert 
edward chambliss was convicted in 1977 of murdering miss mcnair 
he died in prison after eight years 
miss mcnairs father chris mcnair a former state legislator 
and now a jefferson county commissioner said he still is not 
satisfied 
i think there are others out there who roam just as free as i 
am who will never be brought to justice he said 
mcnair said that although segregation in politics and business 
has ended it bothers him that most churches still are either white 
or black 
mankind needs the church or the synagogue he said this 
is needed this is part of mans inner being if they cant come 
together at that time then how are they going to come together in 
genuineness at any other occasion i have to doubt it

biaggi first elected to congress in 1968 was convicted of 
various charges in two federal cases over the past 18 months but 
did not resign until after his conviction in august in the wedtech 
case had he remained in office he could have faced expulsion by 
his colleagues 
by that time it was too late for candidates to get on the ballot 
for the primary and it was thought biaggi would get votes thursday 
because of his popularity and because a biaggi victory would give 
the remains of the boroughs political machine the chance to pick a 
successor in a special election 
biaggi already holds the republican line for the november 
election 
garcia stepped up his schedule late in the primary when it 
became apparent that espada a community health center director 
represented a serious challenge betancourt had lost in two earlier 
primary bids

member of his politically active family to seek office as a

prime minister edward seaga declared a 
major section of hurricanedevastated jamaica a disaster area on 
thursday and police were empowered to force stores to open quickly 
to avoid shortages 
the area contains more than 1 million of this caribbean island 
nations 23 million people and embraces four of jamaicas 14 
parishes or counties on the badly hit east coast kingston st 
andrew st catherine and st thomas 
seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast that the onemonth 
period of public emergency was put into effect to enable 
normalcy to resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the 
rebuilding process to begin 
he continued a dusktodawn curfew established in kingston 
earlier this week to prevent looting 
at least 26 people were killed when hurricane gilbert the 
strongest storm this century swept through jamaica on monday the 
governmentrun jamaica information service reported officials fear 
the toll will mount as communication is reestablished with the 
interior 
five people were reported killed in the dominican republic and 
10 in haiti where the military government declared its own state 
of emergency on the wrecked southern peninsula 
seaga said the international airport at montego bay had reopened 
to all traffic and the norman manley international airport at 
kingston will resume full operations shortly three commercial 
airlines were flying out of kingston airport thursday 
the information service said a period of public emergency is the 
equivalent of a declaration of a disaster area in the united states 
and is not a state of emergency in any form whatsoever 
under the emergency regulations police can force gas stations 
and all stores selling food hardware drugs and fuel to open 
friday morning and all other stores to open as soon as electricity 
is available 
the failure of shops to reopen has placed an unbearable burden 
on official sources to provide meals through centers of refuge 
seaga said 
women and children carried plastic containers of water on their 
heads and stood in line at service stations for kerosene with which 
to cook what food could be found 
a helmeted soldier with a rifle and a german shepherd guard dog 
stood outside the hometride bakery and food centre controlling the 
number of people allowed inside 
there is a possibility a very real possibility of a food 
shortage particularly of chicken said jean lewis director of 
public affairs for the jamaican information service supermarkets 
are still pretty well stocked but how long that will remain the 
case is another matter 
it was sunny and humid in the capital which was still littered 
with zinc roofing toppled utility poles and other storm debris 
a government spokeswoman said there had been some looting right 
after the hurricane winds died down but it appeared to be under 
control 
the capitals two radio stations broadcast advisories to boil 
water and not to touch downed telephone or power lines and passed 
along personal messages to remote regions of the country 
by thursday only 10 percent of jamaicas telephones were back in 
service said marge boberschmidt a spokeswoman for american 
telephone and telegraph 
atampt secured a single telephone line in jamaica wednesday night 
and began relaying onepage messages from stranded americans to 
worried friends and relatives back home 
ms lewis estimated 93 percent of the island was still without 
electricity stores and hotels used gasolinepowered generating 
plants the 18floor pegasus hotel popular with visiting 
businessmen was dimly lit and without elevator service 
seaga estimated the hurricane damage in jamaica at 8 billion 
relief supplies began arriving thursday for some of the countrys 
halfmillion homeless 
sports stadiums churches government buildings and movie 
theaters were used to house an estimated 150000 people the 
government said 
the government has said about 500000 or more than onefifth of 
the jamaican population was homeless seaga estimated 100000 of 
the islands 500000 homes were completely wiped out and an 
additional 300000 had roofs ripped off or other severe damage 
gilbert strengthened from a tropical storm into a hurricane 
saturday night 160 miles south of puerto rico it skirted the 
dominican republic and haiti on sunday plowed straight through 
jamaica on monday brushed past the cayman islands tuesday and 
slammed into the yucatan peninsula wednesday morning the hurricane 
on thursday was headed toward northern mexico and southeastern 
texas

medical researchers say transplanting 
tissue from freshly aborted human fetuses holds great promise for 
suffers of parkinsons and other diseases but they admit that 
ethical questions must be resolved before launching widespread 
experiments in the new technique 
a special national institutes of health advisory committee was 
turning to those questions today in a second day of hearings 
expected to focus on ways to guard against commercial trafficking 
in fetal tissue and to discourage the prospect of people becoming 
pregnant with the intention of having an abortion to provide 
treatment for a relative 
meanwhile a ban against federal financing of such research is 
likely to remain in effect for several months at least

these are the days of awe for jews and some 
of their leaders compare it to the time preceding national 
elections which also involves making critical choices 
the 10 high holy days commenced sept 12 on rosh hashana the 
traditional start of a new year and last through next wednesday 
sept 21 yom kippur the day of atonement 
its a period of selfexamination repentence for faults and 
rededication to gods goodness compassion and justice 
behold i set before you this day life and death blessing and 
curse choose life that you and your children may live that 
scriptural meditation runs through the occasion 
theodore ellenoff president of the american jewish committee 
notes that both the united states and israel are approaching 
national elections in which they also will set their courses for 
the future 
he notes that jewish tradition says the blast of the shofar or 
rams horn heard in synagogues on the holy days will also signal 
the arrival of the messiah to bring world peace and harmony 
ellenoff adds 
in the forthcoming elections american and israelis have the 
responsibility to take the first small step toward fulfillment of 
that messianic dream 
the dream is expressed in the prayers of the holiday worship 
open for us the gates of righteousness open the gates that yield 
blessing and brotherhood compassion and kindness devotion and 
dignity justice and joy 
hasten the advent of messianic redemption 
rabbi william berkowitz national president of the american 
jewish heritage committee suggested that jews engage in a 
spiritual election campaign about basic decisions for their own 
lives 
we can take inspiration from this years presidential election 
campaign which confronts fundamental issues and demands clear 
choices he said 
so too must american jewry engage in a kind of spiritual 
election campaign in which they confront the fundamental issues 
facing the jewish community and in turn engage in some basic 
choices 
the rabbinical council of america representing orthodox 
judaism said the forthcoming presidential election involves the 
economy human rights and defense and urged jews to vote in it 
rabbi moses a birnbaum president of the new york board of 
rabbis says jews have always cherished one ideal the 
obligation upon us literally to repair the world the vision of 
a world healed by us 
as we wish each other life let us wish each other the courage 
and strength to turn the vision into reality he said 
citing the recurrent prayer at holiday services inscribe us 
into the book of life o you who delight in life birnbaum said 
no prayer is more important for jews and all humankind 
but we live in days when life is often cheap more often 
corroded by cynicism and corruption we see if we have the 
courage to look so many countless lives made unlivable by poverty 
and disease and homelesness 
we see if we do not turn away lives inflamed by prejudice 
and hatred and fantaticism we witness millions of lives snuffed 
out by senseless wars and bloody persecution 
he said surmounting these antilife conditions demands not only 
prayer but our unflagging determination to work for justice and 
equality for all gods children 
mazon a jewish hunger reponse urged jews to donate money saved 
by fasting on yom kippur to feed those who fast not on account of 
faith but because of famine 
saying 40000 children will die of hunger on the day of yom 
kippur as happens daily the organization said that when we are 
given the opportunity to sustain life itself it is not only an 
opportunity it is a mandate

when the congregation will discuss biblical and ethical concerns 
relating to homosexual relationships 
bishop peter rogness of the southeastern wisconsin synod of the 
evangelical lutheran church in america said he applauded bartos 
effort to examine a contemporary question but a congregation 
would not be sanctioned to perform homosexual marriages

specified whether congregations can authorize homosexual marriages 
leaving open the door for congregations to decide about it

theres something kind of poignant about 
watching wealthy rock stars pay homage to those two monumental 
influences woody guthrie and leadbelly both of whom died 
basically penniless but at least they know who they owe 
with the justreleased album showtime has produced 
an inspired video tribute to the folk legends featuring 
performances by and interviews with bruce springsteen u2 pete 
seeger arlo guthrie little richard and john cougar mellencamp to 
go along 
among others 
the allstar tribute to woody guthrie and leadbelly 
premieres saturday with additional playdates sept 20 26 30 and 
oct 9 and 11 robbie robertson is the narrator the success of the 
film was probably never in doubt since it comes from director jim 
brown and producer harold leventhal the team responsible for the 
emmywinning 1982 documentary the weavers wasnt that a time 
though it was bob dylans idea that spawned the cbs record 
folkways a vision shared and therefore the showtime special 
he doesnt appear on camera but against a backdrop of old still 
photographs that show how much dylan tried to emulate woody 
guthrie down to the cigarette hanging from his lip he talkis has been 
using against bush in recent campaign appearances 
michael dukakis balanced 10 budgets in a row and still cut 
taxes five times the announcer in the 30second 
responsibility ad says

for 90 minutes with no notes no managers and no neutral 
corners george bush and michael dukakis meet one week from tonight 
in a presidential debate it is a highrisk political arena and in 
a close volatile election campaign the debate and a midoctober 
rematch could be pivotal 
this great debate like those that have gone before is likely 
to defy the longrehearsed efforts of the candidates to take 
control of its course and outcome over the 28 years since the 
first nationally televised debates the most telling issues 
generated have not been on topics the candidates chose but have 
involved image style or error 
the unpredictable unmanageable nature of the debates seemed to 
concern vice president bush and his republican camp more than it 
troubled dukakis the democratic nominee wanted more debates four 
instead of two and a less controlled format without a panel of 
questioners 
in the debate over ground rules bush chairman james a baker 
iii got his way fewer debates in the middle of the heaviest 
television sports schedule of the year with a panel of three at 
each debate to put questions to the candidates 
bush and dukakis meet next sunday sept 25 at wake forest 
university in winstonsalem nc their second debate will be in 
los angeles oct 13 or 14 in between on oct 5 the vice 
presidential candidates democratic sen lloyd bentsen of texas and 
republican sen dan quayle of indiana are to debate in omaha neb 
the dukakis camp had proposed that there be only a moderator 
not a panel of questioners so that the two presidential candidates 
would confront and question each other 
that kind of oneonone meeting has been proposed by producers 
and spurned by candidates before out of concern that a 
challenging questioning debater would come on too strong for the 
taste of the voters as a result the format in which candidates 
are questioned answer in turn then get time for rebuttals has 
become the standard 
bush obviously wasnt interested in any newlook ventures 
debates have not produced his finest moments in politics he sat 
silent and frustrated in nashua nh in 1980 while ronald reagan 
then a rival for the republican nomination took command of the 
microphone and their presidential primary debate its hard to 
remember anything about his 1984 debate with democratic vice 
presidential nominee geraldine ferraro except that the next day 
bush awkwardly remarked that he had tried to kick a little ass 
primary campaign debates multiplied in the race for the 1988 
nominations everybody wanted one which produced a roster of more 
than 40 debates and candidate forums 
bush took part in seven debates with his rivals for the 
republican nomination 
dukakis has had more warmups including 21 campaign debates on 
his way to the democratic nomination between his two tours as 
governor after massachusetts voters denied him renomination a 
decade ago dukakis spent part of his time moderating a debate 
program on public television 
i have respect for him as a debater bush said during 
negotiations on their debates were talking about the 
technical thing in debate where i think he is very good probably 
far better than i am 
that fits one of the favored tactics of 1988 lowering 
expectations or at least trying to do so the ploy is not likely 
to work in a campaign debate at least not in the match of a 
twoterm vice president against a governor of massachusetts 
if lowered expectations do serve any candidate in the debate 
sequence it is more likely to be quayle belittled by dukakis and 
the democrats in the vice presidential debate a standoff with 
bentsen would work to republican advantage 
but efforts at advance positioning and control have proven 
fruitless in prior presidential debates this will be the fifth 
campaign featuring candidate debates since john f kennedy and 
richard m nixon faced off seven presidential elections ago bush 
will be the fourth republican presidential nominee to debate 
dukakis the fourth democrat

from the first they have been styled the great debates 
libraries of briefing books hours of cram courses and rehearsals 
have gone into them for all of that they have produced neither 
great oratory nor breakthroughs on major issues instead they have 
offered televised summations of the standard speeches and positions 
the candidates serve up daily in their campaign travels and some 
have turned on mistakes in style or substance 
the major impact on those campaigns has been one of impressions 
rather than of words a haggard nixon his lateday beard darkening 
his cheeks a fumbling gerald r ford a defensive jimmy carter a 
rambling ronald reagan his age apparently showing 
those impressions tended to take shape after the debates in 
reflection rather than in the performance 
reagan was 73 during his last reelection campaign age became 
an issue after an uncharacteristically fumbling tv performance in 
louisville ky against walter f mondale it never was mentioned 
directly in that debate when it was in a second debate in kansas 
city reagan punctured it with a wisecrack that worked an age 
problem no said reagan i am not going to exploit for political 
purposes my opponents youth and inexperience 
the era of the televised debate began in chicago on sept 26 
1960 nixon versus kennedy nixon then vice president held a 
narrow lead in the polls and overruled some of his advisers to 
debate the lesserknown kennedy 
nothing either man said counted nearly as much as the way nixon 
looked that night hed used powder to cover his beard it streaked 
as he perspired in the hot tv lights kennedy looked trim and fit 
small screen black and white television magnified the images that 
debate first of four gave kennedy a lasting lift and he won a 
hairbreadth election 
the debates were said to have created a tradition future 
candidates surely would follow none did for 16 years 
president lyndon b johnson wasnt interested in giving his 
republican challenger the equal billing of a debate in 1964 when 
the polls anticipated his landslide election barry goldwater the 
republican nominee excused him in advance saying a president 
shouldnt debate because he might just slip and say something 
inadvertently that could change the course of history 
nixon was the republican nominee in 1968 and again in 1972 he 
was the favorite and hed learned his lesson about debating 
but in 1976 ford president by appointment and lagging behind 
carter needed a jump start for his campaign he sought it with a 
debate challenge he and carter met three times and ford made one 
magnified mistake in the second debate he said there is no 
soviet domination of eastern europe and there never will be under a 
ford administration pressed by a questioner he insisted on it 
eventually he corrected the statement but it hurt perhaps not 
so much for content as for the way it fit the snide claims of 
fords critics that he was prone to err and bumble 
carter said later that he wouldnt have won without the debates 
four years later carter was the underdog pressing for 
oneonone debates with republican reagan they finally met in 
cleveland one week before the election that was the night a 
relaxed reagan in his element played the longsuffering victim 
whenever carter attacked there you go again he would say

within months nasa had a new administrator and other top 
officials the directors of three major field centers involved with 
the shuttle left and all those involved in the decision to launch 
were replaced 
there were wholesale resignations and duty changes at alabamas 
marshall space flight center which oversees the booster rocket 
contract and at morton thiokol inc in utah which builds the 
boosters nasa established a new safety and quality control office 
astronauts and former astronauts were placed in key decision 
making positions as recommended by the commission to give the 
flight crews a larger voice in what was happening 
rear adm richard truly a former astronaut who made two shuttle 
flights now heads the shuttle program robert crippen who has 
made four flights now heads a new mission management team and it 
will be he who makes the final gono go decision to launch in the 
waning minutes of the countdown 
engineers at marshall and morton thiokol redesigned the rocket 
joint adding a third oring better insulation a heater and a 
capture lip to prevent a gap opening under the pressure of ignition 
nasa also took the time to redesign parts that it said needed 
improvement on the orbiter the external tank and the main engines 
in all 56 major changes and more than 400 lesser ones have been 
made to the vehicle the program to redesign all three shuttles so 
far has cost about 24 billion 
reagan ordered a replacement shuttle for challenger at a cost 
of 28 billion and the new craft is starting to take shape at a 
rockwell international facility in california 
among the changes to the orbiter is the addition of an emergency 
escape system featuring a blowout cabin hatch and a 12foot 
aluminum and steel telescoping pole the hope is that in case of a 
problem during a landing attempt while the shuttle is in gliding 
flight the astronauts could slide down the pole and then parachute 
to safety the system would not be of use in a challengertype 
accident 
nasa had hoped to launch discovery last february but technical 
problems and delays in testing new systems slipped the date to 
june then to august and september 
said forrest s mccartney director of the kennedy space center 
after the challenger everyone was encouraged to go back and look 
at everything they could think of and see what could be done to 
reduce the risk they did a very thorough and comprehensive job of 
that the stigma of another challenger is one that everyone is very 
conscious of 
so the reason its taking us so long to get back to flying 
again is that were doing everything we know to reduce risk to the 
minimum he said weve initiated more checks and balances than 
we ever had before

when nasa engineers set out to develop a new 
design for the space shuttle rocket boosters they had to do it 
fast do it cheap and do it right 
the result say most experts is a rocket that is just short of 
the best design possible but certainly good enough to get america 
back into space and keep it there until better rockets are built 
if you started with a clean sheet of paper there are things 
you could do to improve the rockets said russ bardos nasas 
director of shuttle propulsion but he added im perfectly 
comfortable with what we have on there now 
space shuttle discovery stands poised to ride into space before 
the end of the month on redesigned solid rocket boosters developed 
in a crash program that lasted 31 months required hundreds of 
thousands of man hours and cost the nation 800 million 
better rocket engines will be built said bardos but it will 
take an additional four to five years and require even more money 
the redesign program started after the jan 28 1986 challenger 
explosion that bared serious problems with the boosters that 24 
times previously had sent astronauts into orbit 
engineers deep in the structure of nasa had known as early as 
1984 that leaking seals on the boosters threatened disaster a 
quiet program to develop a new booster design had been started at 
the marshall space flight center and at morton thiokol the utah 
manufacturer of the rocket 
in the meantime nasa expressed confidence in the boosters and 
withheld any concerns from the public and even from the astronauts 
the shuttles kept flying 
a member of the rogers commission which investigated the 
challenger accident later described the decision to continue 
flying as playing russian roulette with a flawed and dangerous 
system 
the game ended when challenger exploded and seven astronauts 
died 
a new team was named to correct the flawed boosters and some 
members of the group later said they were amazed to find how little 
data there was about about the internal workings of the rockets 
what appeared to be a simple steel tube filled with propellant was 
in fact a complex machine 
there was so much we didnt know said bardos it needed a 
lot of design work and changes 
the shuttle boosters are the largest solidfueled rockets ever 
made two are used to launch the shuttle and each is 14916 feet 
long and 1217 feet in diameter loaded with 11 million pounds of 
propellant each boosters weighs 13 million pounds and produces 
about 33 million pounds of thrust at launch providing more than 
twothirds the lifting power to get the shuttle airborne 
because the boosters are so massive they are manufactured in 
four segments each of the steel casings are filled with a mixture 
of chemicals that cure into a tough rubberlike solid the 
segments are shipped to the kennedy space center where they are 
assembled 
when the segments come together they join at what is called a 
field joint it was a failed field joint that leaked and destroyed 
challenger 
the field joints used for challenger had a metal lip called a 
tang that fit into a deep metal groove called a clevis one side 
of the clevis housed two orings or rubberized seals bolts held 
the clevis and tang together 
when the propellant was ignited inside the rocket a pressure of 
up to 900 pounds per square inch and temperatures of several 
thousand degrees immediately surged against the joint the surge 
was supposed to force the orings to seal the joint 
however engineers learned early in the shuttle program that the 
sudden pressure actually caused the heavy steel casings to balloon 
out an action called rotation this caused the joint to open 
slightly if the action was severe enough the orings could lose 
their capacity to seal 
low temperatures also affected the orings when chilled the 
rubberized material became hard and sealed more slowly 
when challenger was launched the boosters had been chilled by 
subfreezing temperatures overnight photos of the launch showed 
that superheated gas escaped immediately from the lower field joint 
on the righthand booster the rocket gases later melted through a 
brace to free one end of the shuttles massive fuel tank the tank 
ruptured and challenger exploded just 73 seconds after launch

nasa engineers already had developed a new joint to correct the 
rotation problem the joint included a metal lip called a capture 
feature that was added to the inside of the tang this joint 
resembles a handshake with a new thumb on the tang giving 
extra strength 
the booster redesign team brought this new joint out of the 
laboratory and with modifications it became the new field joint 
the modifications were important a third oring was added 
heaters were installed to keep the joint temperature at a constant 
75 degrees and a jshaped slit was formed in insulation coating 
the inner surface of the joint this slit caused pressure to 
actually close the joint further forming still another seal 
john thomas who headed the nasa redesign team also directed 
the redesign of the nozzletocase joint of the booster this joint 
had no role in the challenger disaster but engineers realized it 
might be even more flawed than the field joint 
the new nozzle joint added another oring and a new sealing slit 
in the insulation thomas over the objections of some engineers 
also added 100 bolts to further strengthen the nozzletocase seal 
each element of the new design was tested hundreds of times 
using subscale models or with fullscale joints filled with partial 
propellant loads 
at one point engineers pressurized water inside the rocket 
until the casing burst thomas said the test reached twice the 
normal operating pressure and none of the joints ever leaked 
and finally five fullscale rocket motors loaded with more 
than a million pounds of propellant were fired at the thiokol site 
in utah in a firing in august the engineers intentionally cut 
insulation and oring seals to test how the joints would behave 
with assembly flaws there was not a leak 
thomas said early firings revealed some problems that were later 
corrected but there were none he said that would endanger an 
astronaut crew 
the massive redesign effort has been closely monitored by an 
independent panel of the national research council 
in a report issued sept 9 the nrc agreed with bardos the new 
rocket is not perfect but it seems to be good enough 
more might have been accomplished if the program were 
unconstrained by the need to return to flight as soon as possible 
and by limitations in budget the nrc report said but such 
constraints were practical necessities and our impression is that 
they were not unreasonable 
the new boosters said the report have enhanced safety and 
reliability but it warned risks remain however whether the 
level of risk is acceptable is a matter that nasa must judge 
thomas bardos and others said that judgment has been made after 
one of the most intense efforts ever mounted by the space agency 
were ready to fly said thomas

besides proving that nasa can fly 
astronauts safely again the first postchallenger missions most 
important task is to deploy a 100 million communications satellite 
to increase the agencys ability to monitor shuttle flights 
the tracking and data relay satellite once deployed will help 
ground controllers keep track of shuttles and other unmanned 
spacecraft orbiting the earth coverage provided by the tdrs is 
more continuous than the space agencys current worldwide network 
of groundbased communications tracking systems 
a similar satellite was deployed in 1983 and is in orbit but a 
nearly identical one was destroyed in the challenger explosion jan 
28 1986 
discovery also will be carrying 11 scientific experiments that 
lend themselves to being conducted in the weightlessness of space 
two are projects that were designed by students and were packed 
away aboard challenger before its fatal flight another is an 
experiment to grow crystals of a protein the aids virus uses to 
infect human cells researchers hope the results will help them 
develop better drugs to fight the disease 
but the satellite is the prime cargo its deployment is 
important to nasa because it will roughly double the time a shuttle 
can be monitored said frederick w weber vice president of 
contels technical services division the fairfax vabased contel 
owns and operates the satellite for nasa 
the urgency is to get the second one up there so we can have a 
full system weber said to provide full coverage we need two 
spacecraft in orbit 
the satellite now in place provides coverage for about 45 
percent of a shuttles orbit it has had some minor breakdowns but 
is still operating at 98 percent capacity said jim elliott a nasa 
spokesman at goddard space flight center greenbelt md 
the tdrs relays signals and data between a spacecraft or another 
satellite and a ground terminal at white sands missile range nm 
where it then is routed to the appropriate nasa facility 
once the second tdrs is up and operating scheduled to take 
place about two months after deployment the two satellites will 
be able to relay data equal to a 20volume encyclopedia in one 
second said jim elliott nasa spokesman at goddard space flight 
center in greenbelt md 
the tdrs satellite can provide multiple access and support 
communications from 26 spacecraft simultaneously 
before the first satellite was put in orbit shuttles had to 
communicate with the ground through nasas network of tracking and 
communications stations around the world communications were 
possible only when the spacecrafts orbit came into the range of an 
individual tracking station 
the tdrs satellite is scheduled to be deployed about six hours 
into the mission although there are five later times it could be 
done if problems arise 
the satellite and an inertial upper stage boooster rocket 
stored in discoverys cargo bay will be propelled from the orbiter 
into space by a springloaded ejection device at a speed of 4 
inches per second 
later the satellite is thurst into a higher orbit by the 
booster rocket the boosters first burn is scheduled to take place 
an hour after the satellite is deployed and the second and final 
burn will follow 5 hours later the booster and satellite separate 
about 13 hours after launch 
the satellite booster and their carrying cradle weigh about 
45000 pounds making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboard 
a shuttle johnson space center officials said the satellite 
itself weighs about 5000 pounds is 57feet wide and has two 
50pound antennas that look like giant umbrellas 
the tdrs is to be placed in orbit at 178 degrees west longitude 
22300 miles over the pacific ocean near the gilbert islands at 
that altitude it will be in what is called geosynchronous orbit 
meaning that it moves with the earth always staying in the same 
position above the planet 
the first tdrs satellite which is over the atlantic ocean off 
the northeast coast of brazil will become an inorbit spare by the 
time four satellite have been deployed early next year

federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan 
has told congress he sees no need for a blanket ban on mergers of 
the biggest banks and securities firms but is going along with 
such a ban in order to win passage of legislation permitting banks 
to underwrite securities 
greenspan said wednesday that he and fellow fed governors see 
no threat to the system if those merger activities were to take 
place 
but he said they did not believe it was wise to press the issue 
for fear of hurting chances for repealing the glasssteagall act 
which separated commercial from investment banking in 1933

consumers felt more confident about the economy 
last month than in the previous two months after a devastating 
drought in the nations farm belt came to an end according to a 
private research group 
the conference board a businessfinanced nonprofit group said 
wednesday its consumer confidence index climbed to 1192 in august 
up nearly 6 points from july and 35 points from june 
the monthly survey which covers 5000 us households is 
conducted for the board by national family opinion inc of toledo 
ohio 
the strong increase in consumer confidence was largely due to 
a better mood in americas farm belt said fabian linden 
executive director of the boards consumer research center 
linden said improved weather conditions and government support 
payments to affected farmers led to last months gains 
confidence also is up in the rest of the nation spurred by 
the continuing vigor of the economy he said 
the survey found that more people said they planned to buy homes 
and major appliances last month than in july some 41 percent had 
homebuying plans in august up from 35 percent in july and 34 
percent planned a major appliance purchase compared with 30 
percent in july 
however less people were planning to buy a car dropping to 72 
percent last month from 89 percent in july 
the survey found that 32 percent of consumers polled thought 
business was good up from 28 percent in july nearly 22 
percent felt the the economy would get better compared with 20 
percent the previous month 
in addition 20 percent of those surveyed thought jobs would 
increase in the next six months up from 18 percent in july

us oil production declined again in august and 
imports remained strong as uncertainty over prices left little 
incentive for boosting domestic output according to the american 
petroleum institute 
meanwhile deliveries of refined petroleum products rose 22 
percent from a year earlier the largest yearly increase since the 
first three months of the year the trade group said wednesday 
refineries reached 88 percent of capacity the highest monthly 
utilization rate in nearly 10 years 
some analysts said the surprising number in the trade groups 
monthly report was the healthy 117 percent increase in deliveries 
of distillate fuel oil which includes home heating oil and diesel 
fuel despite the severe summer drought in the nations midsection 
analysts said much of the demand was channeled into inventories and 
not consumed 
deliveries of gasoline rose 13 percent and of kerosine jet fuel 
08 percent last month while residual fuel oil deliveries fell 26 
percent the report said 
crude oil production averaged 81 million barrels a day 08 
percent less than the 82 million barrels produced daily in august 
1987 
alaskan daily production remained near the 2 million barrel 
level it has held since late last year but production in the lower 
48 states declined about 175000 barrels a day from a year ago and 
more than 11 million from early 1986 the report said 
the lower crude oil prices and increased price uncertainty of 
the past several months have no doubt reduced the amount of well 
servicing that is economic to undertake the trade group said 
the partial recovery in well servicing that began last year 
appears to be eroding the report said with only about half of the 
wells restored following the 1986 oil price crash 
when youre getting 16 to 18 for oil you cant put as much 
enhanced recovery investment into servicing said bob baker an 
analyst with prudential bache securities inc 
although imports declined between 3 percent and 5 percent in the 
last two months lower production and higher consumption have 
pushed imports up more than 500000 barrels a day over the last 
eight months as a whole 
the trade group said total inventories which include crude oil 
and its refined products were up 02 percent in august from july 
and up 16 percent from a year earlier 
residual fuel oil inventories were down 35 percent compared to 
last month and 151 percent lower than a year ago 
crude oil stocks were down 53 percent compared to july and down 
08 percent from august 1987

with maines rockbound coast in the 
background captain owen beal hauls a trap over the side of his 
lobster boat and makes his pitch to television viewers in a thick 
down east accent 
you can have your lobster within 24 hours from maines clear 
cool ocean waters says beal in a 60second spot scheduled to 
debut within the next month on cable tv stations in various major 
us markets 
beal clad in a yellow slicker tells viewers that all they have 
to do is dial a tollfree telephone number if they want the 
tastiest lobsters in the world on their dinner table 
the ads will mark a 30day trial of what is billed as the first 
television sales and distribution network to guarantee home or 
office delivery of live maine lobsters anywhere in the nation 
within 24 hours 
the venture represents a merger of modern hightech 
telemarketing systems and a 75yearold lobster pound operated in 
this small eastern maine fishing village by sidney look the fourth 
look generation to run the business 
the idea originated two years ago when ed dugay of cherryfield 
a pilot who flies spotter planes for herring fishermen brought 
maine products such as lobsters blueberries and sardines as gifts 
on a visit to his brother in nashville tenn 
hes involved in a lot of telemarketing dugay said of his 
brother mike and a lightbulb went on the two brothers hit 
upon the tv marketing plan and approached look with it 
its a great marriage really sid has three lobster pounds and 
a lot of inventory and were kind of acting as consultants 
dugay said wednesday 
operators in dallas will process telephone orders and feed them 
into a computer between midnight and dawn the data will be 
transmitted along telephone lines to a recentlyinstalled bank of 
computers on the second floor of looks shingled packing house at 
the end of a wharf 
at the start of the workday the orders are printed out and the 
lobsters are packed at the same time credit card numbers debit 
customers accounts and copies of the orders appear on the main 
federal express computer in memphis tenn 
a truck arrives at 4 pm to pick up the lobsters which are 
shipped from bangor international airport before sunset 
launching the business from this village of 1200 in a remote 
section of the maine coast forced the dugays to overcome some 
hurdles overnight shippers had no daily federal express service to 
jonesport before the inauguration of looks lobster line 
likewise jonesport had no touchtone phones relying on rotary 
dials or communication through an operator because computers 
require touchtone systems dugay had to add a conversion device to 
the modem linking his phone line to the computer 
dugay says the markets for the initial ads still are being 
selected but he expects denver and chicago to be among them the 
minimum order will be for six 1pound to 1pound lobsters at a 
total cost of 89 plus 10 for shipping and handling 
if the lobster line proves successful dugay says he is prepared 
to offer other eastern maine products including quahogs mussels 
and blueberries

early september sales of domesticallymade cars 
and trucks were down by 9 percent from a year earlier according to 
automakers but analysts say last years incentives and reports of 
relatively low inventories in 1988 make yeartoyear sales 
comparisons difficult 
the companies reported wednesday they sold 243337 vehicles 
during the sept 110 sales period this year compared with 267397 
vehicles during the same period last year there were eight selling 
days in both periods 
there is so much noise in the data that its not a terribly 
meaningful comparison this year vs last year said mary ann 
sudol of fitch investors service inc of new york 
during early september 1987 dealers were in the thick of 
incentive battles offering such enticements as 19 percent 
financing and cash rebates to get buyers into showrooms and reduce 
bulging inventories 
in addition in the last report on inventories the industry 
was down a shade below 60 days sudol said it could be that 
there are scattered shortages in the showrooms 
for the early september period car sales fell 126 percent to 
155131 this year compared with 177512 during the period last 
year there were 19 percent fewer trucks sold during the period 
this year compared with last year 88206 vs 89885 
analyst ron glantz of montgomery securities inc of san 
francisco said despite the coloring that last years incentives put 
on sales comparisons sales appeared to be strong 
sales are pretty decent he said the sales are at the 
same rate they were last month 
general motors corp showed the largest decline in early 
september sales an 18 percent drop falling to 74640 cars during 
the period this year compared with 91075 cars during early 
september 1987 
ford motor co sales fell 116 percent to 45318 cars from 
51243 during the same period last year chrysler corps decline 
was 102 percent to 20357 in early september from 22659 a year 
ago 
chrysler had some of the biggest incentives during the august 
and september last year 
honda of america manufacturing inc showed a 413 percent 
increase to 9660 cars early this month from 6835 during the same 
period last year but a dealer sales drive may have something to do 
with that glantz said 
dealers have a sales push going on in order to be eligible for 
larger quotas in the new model year he said 
for the year to date automakers reported sales of about 84 
million usmade vehicles 71 percent more than the 78 million 
sold through sept 10 last year there were 214 sales days through 
sept 10 of this year one more than the same time last year so 
the percentage change was for the daily sales rate

a complex scheme by harvard university 
to share in profits from the research findings of its faculty 
members poses an ethical obstacle course for the university 
academics say 
harvards decision to seek 30 million for companies to 
commercialize the schools medical research comes eight years after 
the university scrapped a plan to coinvest in a professors work 
after the agreement was deemed ethically dangerous 
phillip sharp a massachusetts institute of technology biology 
professor who in 1978 helped found biogen inc one of the first 
biotechnology startup companies said wednesday that harvard needs 
lots of walls to guarantee that the lure of forming companies 
does not impede faculty and research decisions 
does harvards financial expectation in starting new ventures 
have a risk in influencing what goes on in terms of their search 
for truth and new research sharp asked if that relationship 
is too strong then it has the potential of influencing who harvard 
recruits as faculty 
harvard said the new program safely distances the university 
from deciding what research would be marketed 
there is by definition no conflict because harvard is not the 
decision maker as to where the investments would be made said 
harvard vice president john shattuck 
under the plan harvard would raise money from six to eight 
outside corporate investors to develop health care businesses under 
a limited partnership called medical science partners that 
partnership would be run by another limited partnership headed by 
andre l lamotte a former drug industry executive and ion inc a 
harvard subsidiary 
harvard would get 10 percent of any company profits which would 
be reinvested in medical research 
administrators said the new scheme would raise sorely needed 
money to supplement harvard medical schools 350 million research 
budget and speed up development of medical innovations 
the new investment structure formally established this month 
differs from those at other universities because harvard is 
involved directly in raising the money used to start up the 
companies 
most research universities have licensing offices that patent 
and market professors work through existing companies and then 
divide royalties among the university the department and the 
professor 
stanford university last year earned 91 million through 
licensing fees tops in the nation while mit made about 3 
million washington university in st louis has a 5050 agreement 
with an outside venture capitalist who selects research with 
commercial promise 
we dont coinvest with our faculty in new companies because 
that could raise potential conflicts if you invest in professor a 
but not in professor b stanford spokesman bob beyers said 
lets say professor a gets a bigger lab or higher salary or more 
graduate students there are problems there 
faculty members stand to receive research support in the harvard 
deal they are not required to use the fund to market their work 
university conflict of interest guidelines urge scientists not to 
compromise their research and teaching activities in relationships 
with industry including the fund 
the big difference is theyre creating that very large fund 
that theres going to be pressure to invest in good research 
said edward maccordy associate vice chancellor for research at 
washington university 
the key to look at is what influence on the inventor is there 
going to be he said if the inventor still pursues the 
research he wants to pursue and has the alternative of seeking 
support for that anywhere he wants to then theres no impact 
shattuck said the limited partnership would be run directly by 
lamotte a former executive with the us affiliate of the french 
drug company merieux harvard medical school recruited lamotte who 
would negotiate with the medical school for rights to researchers 
work 
he comes to harvard to seek to patent and purchase discoveries 
just as anyone else would shattuck said it is an arms length 
relationship with medical science partners 
in 1980 harvard agreed to form a company along with biochemist 
mark ptashne and take about 15 percent ownership share but backed 
out after university president derek bok said the risk of judging 
researchers based on the marketability of their work was too great 
ptashne who still is at harvard found outside venture capital 
sources to form genetics institute inc 
many present biotechnology firms also were founded by professors 
who realized a lucrative market for transferring technology from 
the lab to the marketplace since the early 1980s one example is 
genentech inc of san francisco formed by university of california 
professors

the 13 billion plan to split playtex 
holdings inc into two companies will enable each one to focus on 
their own areas of business while giving a big return to investors 
who bought playtex in 1986 says chairman joel e smilow 
on wednesday the stamfordbased company said it would divide 
into two separate companies under a series of buyout transactions 
led by two groups each headed by smilow 
the deal would separate playtex family products businesses from 
its intimate apparel operations allowing their respective 
managements to operate more independently of each other 
the group led by smilow members of playtex holdings management 
and thomas h lee co a bostonbased investment firm agreed to 
pay 960 in cash and 1 in face value of a new issue of preferred 
stock for each of the companys 50 million outstanding 
privatelyheld common shares a total of about 530 million 
the smilowlee group also will acquire or redeem playtex 
holdings outstanding debt and preferred stock worth 770 million 
a second group led by smilow and members of playtex apparel 
products inc management then would acquire that business for 380 
million in cash 
smilow said the deal does several things including give a 
wonderful return to shareholders who invested about 10 million 
to acquire playtex in 1986 and creating two separate companies 
each focused on their own areas of business 
playtex holdings acquired the businesses of international 
playtex inc from subsidiaries of bci holdings inc in a 125 
billion leveraged buyout on dec 12 1986 retaining playtex 
intimate apparel and family products businesses while selling its 
cosmetic and fragrance units for 350 million 
the company last year made an aborted attempt to sell its family 
products division which makes products such as playtex tampons to 
johnson amp johnson inc for 726 million 
management owns 28 percent of playtex holdings stock with the 
rest held by institutional investors bci holdings and the 
investment firm drexel burnham lambert inc 
playtex holdings had 1987 sales of 6144 million including 
3104 million from the intimate apparel division overall 
operating profit was 1548 million including 464 million from 
intimate apparel 
smilow who also is playtex chief executive and president said 
the sale of the apparel business would allow playtex holdings to 
concentrate on its family products and hair care businesses it 
also would allow management of the separate businesses to operate 
more independently of each other while keeping current top 
management namely smilow and vice chairman hercules sotos in 
command 
after the transactions management will own 40 percent to 50 
percent of the family products group and 100 percent of the apparel 
business smilow said 
the transactions are subject to the execution of definitive 
agreements finalizing financing arrangements and obtaining any 
necessary approvals 
thomas e lee co is a bostonbased private investment firm 
specializing in leveraged transactions and has participated in more 
than 60 management buyouts

the aluminum company of america says a 
profitsharing plan involving 7000 whitecollar employees in 
domestic aluminum operations will go into effect this year a move 
opposed by the united steelworkers union 
officials of the pittsburghbased company said wednesday that 
the plan would create a profitsharing pool when the companys us 
operations exceed a return of 6 percent on assets employees would 
share 17 percent of profits above that threshold they said 
alcoa officials said individual payouts would vary with profits 
and the number of employees involved the plan is retroactive to 
jan 1 the company said 
alcoa said the payout could amount to about 7 percent of each 
employees base salary if secondhalf 1988 profits equal firsthalf 
profits 
in contract talks three weeks ago the company offered a 
profitsharing plan to union employees that would amount to up to 
1300 for bluecollar workers based on alcoas expected 1988 
profits 
the united steelworkers said it rejected the plan as inadequate 
and said it opposed the companys plan to extend it to whitecollar 
workers 
on aug 24 the usw and the aluminum brick and glass workers 
unions broke off early contract negotiations with alcoa after 
rejecting offers that included profitsharing an immediate 
ratification bonus lump sum bonuses annually an improved medial 
insurance option and increased pension benefits 
usw negotiator george becker said the talks ended because alcoa 
would not address several key issues including wage and pension 
increases 
the unions sought new contracts to recover concessions 
negotiated in 1986 when the aluminum industry faced difficult 
economic times

directors of the washington public power 
supply system were upbeat about building two nuclear plants even as 
they secretly discussed abandoning the billiondollar projects the 
jury in the wppss fraud trial has been told 
we claim and we will prove that these false statements were 
made fraudulently intentionally recklessly and negligently 
said one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs tom barr during 
opening arguments wednesday 
attorneys for the 19 defendants were expected to make opening 
arguments today in the lawsuit over wppss 225 billion default in 
1983 after halting the projects its the largest default in 
municipal bond market history 
the defendants deny fraud claims saying poor judgment may have 
been used but that wppss and defendant utilities hired expert 
advisers and acted in what they believed were northwest power 
consumers best interests 
the us district court trial moved here from washington state 
due to pretrial publicity is expected to take months 
attorney paul bernstein representing some of the 24000 bond 
buyers who sued told the 20 jurors wednesday they would hear tapes 
of wppss directors behind closed doors talking about terminating 
the plant projects in early 1980 
bernstein said that don clayhold a utility official who was a 
wppss director was taped saying if we scrapped the projects we 
probably wouldnt be able to pay off the debts 
another wppss director the late william hulbert said shutting 
the plants would break every small utility in the northwest 
bernstein told the jury 
but the same directors talking to a representative of the bond 
agency moodys painted a bright enough picture of the projects 
that wppss retained its aplus rating he said 
barr said the utilities that oversaw wppss made promises in 
official bond statements that they never intended to keep barr 
represented chemical bank of new york which sued on behalf of the 
24000 bond buyers 
the defendants are 16 washington state utilities all of them 
wppss directors two engineering firms and a financial adviser to 
wppss seven other utilities settled out of court with the 
plaintiffs 
wppss was formed in 1957 by public utilities to build and 
operate major electric plants in washington idaho and oregon 
in the 1970s it embarked on an ambitious plan to build five 
nuclear plants but was plagued by cost overruns and delays only 
one plant was completed and is operating 
barr said wednesday the defendant utilities claimed there was a 
need for more electricity in the northwest when there was not and 
continually changed estimates of what building plant nos 4 and 5 
would cost 
had the projects been honestly represented he said wppss would 
never have been welcomed at the bond market 
barr said the utilities soon realized after construction of the 
two plants had begun that they had acted recklessly but he said 
they went ahead in the belief that the federal bonneville power 
administration would assume debts for the plants as it had done 
for wppss plant nos 1 2 and 3 
that would have reduced the utilities obligation by twothirds 
he said 
barr noted that in the first of 14 bond sales in 1977 the 
plants cost was estimated at 337 billion by mid1981 the cost 
had jumped to 118 billion and dates for completing that plants 
had slipped several years 
barr said the utilities ultimate ace up the sleeve was to 
litigate their way out of their predicament 
they intended first to go to court and to get their state 
courts to get them out of their promises he said adding that 
that strategy worked 
in 1983 the washington supreme court ruled that utilities that 
had signed contracts with wppss for construction of plants 4 and 5 
lacked authority to make those agreements the court said the 
utilities could not obligate customers to pay for plants that might 
never be built

opponents have promised to appeal a federal court 
decision upholding the partial merger of the detroit free press and 
detroit news under a joint operating agreement approved last month 
by thenattorney general edwin meese iii 
in a ruling wednesday us district judge george revercomb 
rejected contentions by a group of detroit advertisers and readers 
that the morning free press owned by knightridder inc was not a 
failing newspaper entitled to antitrust exemptions under the 1970 
newspaper preservation act 
the judge said he would allow a monthold court order 
temporarily blocking the deal to expire at 715 pm on saturday 
but david c vladeck a lawyer who represented michigan citizens 
for an independent press said the group planned to appeal 
revercombs decision and would ask the appeals court to extend the 
stay blocking the partial merger 
the group claims the agreement would result in higher prices 
unnecessary job losses and diminished journalistic quality its 
case was argued in washington by public citizen a consumer group 
founded by ralph nader 
we feel the arguments weve already made are very 
persuasive said william schultz a lawyer for public citizen 
we feel its a very strong case and we have a very good chance 
in the court of appeals 
officials of the detroit newspaper agency which would oversee 
the two newspapers combined operations were scheduled to meet 
today in washington to decide whether to enact the agreement before 
an appeals court heard the case the free press reported 
revercomb had dismissed in wednesdays ruling contentions that 
meese arbitrarily and capriciously ignored findings by the 
justice departments antitrust division and an administrative law 
judge that the dailies did not qualify for a joint operating 
agreement 
the court finds that the attorney general was not unreasonable 
in finding that the free press a newspaper that has incurred and 
will continue to incur losses that would already have led to its 
demise were it not owned by a large corporate parent is a failing 
newspaper the judge wrote in a 17page opinion 
david lawrence publisher of the free press said in a 
statement this is a good day for the future of the free press i 
can only hope that the pain and uncertainty of the past almost 2 
years will be over before too long 
knightridder had threatened to close the free press if the 
joint operating agreement was not approved 
the consolidation of the two newspapers business advertising 
circulation and production departments would result in layoffs of 
between 600 and 800 employees compared with 2200 if the free 
press shut down 
the free press has lost 100 million in the last nine years and 
the afternoon news purchased by gannett co inc in 1986 has also 
sustained significant operating losses in the last decade 
according to the audit bureau of circulation the free press had 
a daily circulation last year of 638720 daily compared with the 
news 678720 on sundays the news held a slightly larger lead 
839319 to 724342

a federal jury has convicted a former member of 
the chicago board of trade on charges that he and three others used 
a wig and other disguises to make illegal trades worth 308000 
thompson b sanders was found guilty of 11 counts of conspiracy 
wire and commodities fraud and interstate transportation of stolen 
property he faces as much as 55 years in prison and 13 million 
in fines at his nov 3 sentencing by us district court judge 
marvin d aspen 
but sanders who did not testify in his own defense said he 
would appeal the conviction 
maybe it was a mistake not taking the stand he told 
reporters outside the courtroom i thought there was enough 
evidence standing by itself that id be found not guilty 
the charges stem from four trades of us government bond 
futures at the cbot in 1986 
the government charged that sanders and three accomplices dan 
dewey dan kolton and david pelleu all of whom pleaded guilty to 
one count of each of conspiracy and wire fraud participated in a 
scheme in which dewey wore a wig and used fake credentials to gain 
access to the us treasury bond trading pit at the cbot 
once in the pit dewey set in motion four trades that allowed 
the four to pocket 308000 in profits prosecutors said the scheme 
allowed the four to walk away from bad trades while claiming 
profits from good ones

retail sales declined last month providing further evidence 
that the economy is slowing and inflation pressures are easing 
the commerce department reported today that retail sales 
declined 02 percent or 330 million to a seasonally adjusted 
1335 billion in august pulled down by the sharpest drop in auto 
sales in 10 months 
sales of womens apparel and furniture also declined while food 
and gasoline sales were up slightly the government said 
many economists said the report indicated that growth in 
consumer demand has slowed 
meanwhile the lowest monthly merchandise trade deficit since 
december 1984 has encouraged financial markets that the united 
states is on the way to solving its trade imbalance 
the commerce departments report wednesday that the trade 
deficit fell to 953 billion in july from a revised 1322 billion 
in june was considered significant because it included a big drop 
in imports 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 
1760 to 210064 on wednesday closing above 2100 for the first 
time since it stood at 210740 on aug 8 bond prices rose 
modestly and the dollar rallied 
a decline in the nations demand for imports could mean the 
economy is cooling off somewhat which would reduce pressure on 
interest rates the prospect for lower rates is good for the stock 
and bond markets 
lower rates could be bad for the dollar by reducing the returns 
on dollardenominated assets but the dollar rose apparently 
because the drop in the deficit indicated the dollar did not need 
to weaken much to help erode the trade deficit 
the dollars rise occurred despite the federal reserves 
attempts to restrain it 
good news on trade preceded a leap in oil prices triggered by 
mounting concern that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries would succeed in cutting its oil production 
after touching a nearly twoyear low last week the nearmonth 
contract for west texas intermediate has soared about 165 a 
barrel rising 84 cents on wednesday to 1540 on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
in a second report wednesday the government said industrial 
output rose a moderate 02 percent in august pushing production up 
a healthy 53 percent over a year ago much of this gain reflects 
the boom in export sales that american companies have enjoyed 
in other economic news wednesday 
sales of usmade cars and trucks fell 9 percent in early 
september according to figures automakers released wednesday but 
changes in incentives made the figures difficult to compare with 
those of a year earlier 
the conference board a private research group said consumers 
felt more confident about the economy last month than in the 
previous two months after a devastating drought in the nations 
farm belt came to an end

iraq will not agree to lower its output of oil 
even if other opec members ask and may even increase production 
the countrys oil minister said in an interview published thursday 
the minister issam abdulrahim alchalabi told the alwatan 
newspaper that iraq would not rule out increasing its output from 
27 million barrels a day as part of an effort to rebuild its 
shattered economy after eight years of war with iran 
iraq has refused to abide by a quota of 15 million barrels a 
day set by the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
because its persian gulf enemy has been allowed to produce 23 
million barrels a day 
opec secretarygeneral subroto has held talks with several 
members of the cartel recently including iran who are opposed to 
raising iraqs official quota to parity with iran 
however the newspaper thursday said chalabis latest statements 
indicate baghdad no longer is interested in gaining parity with 
iran or in accepting any assigned quota 
we sacrificed and lost a lot in the eight years of hostilities 
during which we could not produce our output quota the minister 
was quoted as saying 
therefore we are not prepared to sacrifice more as we now 
have our construction commitments and debt which we should repay 
the minister declined to estimate by how much iraq might 
increase its oil exports saying it would depend to a large 
extent on the state of our ports 
but our output will be larger when the second stage of the 
iraqisaudi pipeline is completed in september 1989 he said 
the pipeline to the red sea and another via turkey to the 
mediterranean were oil export outlets iraq used after its ports 
were damaged and shipments through the gulf blocked by the war 
oil prices have risen sharply in recent days after a steady 
decline in previous weeks prompted by fears of a world oversupply 
of oil the sharp rise in prices started monday was fueled by 
reports suggesting that opec could be closer to limiting production 
chalabi dismissed as baseless charges that iraq was 
responsible for the overall decline in oil prices saying iraqi 
production did not change whereas oil prices dropped by 30 
percent 
opec is producing at least 35 million barrels a day more than 
its selfimposed collective quota of 15 million barrels crude is 
selling between 14 and 1550 a barrel on world markets opecs 
benchmark price is 18 
the new yorkbased petroleum intelligence weekly reported in 
august that iraq was exporting 500000 barrels of oil a day to the 
united states 
chalabi said that talk of a us embargo of iraqi oil because of 
iraqs alleged use of chemical weapons against turkish refugees did 
not worry him 
iraq will be able to find markets for selling its oil and 
consequently our oil exports will not be affected by any embargo 
chalabi said

oil futures prices were lower in early trading 
today as support factors that strengthened the market in recent 
days began to fade 
speculation that hurricane gilbert would temporarily disrupt 
gasoline supplies along the gulf of mexico coast had fueled a surge 
in energy prices since monday 
but early indications today suggested the hurricane might not 
disrupt oil and gasoline supplies to the extent previously thought 
people are afraid the hurricane is not going to slam into the 
refineries afterall said peter beutel an analyst with elders 
futures inc 
in addition statements that iraq would not lower its oil output 
and instead might raise production also dampened prices analysts 
said 
on the new york mercantile exchange wholesale unleaded gasoline 
for october delivery was trading about 157 cents lower at around 
4545 cents a gallon shortly after the market opened gasoline had 
soared 321 cents a gallon on wednesday to settle at 4702 cents on 
top of a 119 cents rise in tuesdays session 
the october wholesale heating oil contract was down about 122 
cents at 4285 cents a gallon after rising 224 cents a gallon to 
settle at 4407 cents wednesday 
the october contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude was lower trading between 1503 and 1518 a 
gallon today on wednesday it soared 84 cents a barrel to close at 
1540 and trading volume was 160363 contracts the highest since 
a record 175383 contracts were traded last dec 17 
on monday crude prices had plunged briefly to 1375 nearly a 
twoyear low before rebounding and have generally moved higher 
since then 
the price boosts stemmed partly from speculation that hurricane 
gilbert which is approaching the gulf coast would disrupt 
gasoline output at refineries along the texaslouisiana border as 
well as offshore oil production analysts said although the storm 
had not damaged the gulf oil fields up to 1 million gallons a day 
of gasoline could be lost if production was halted to wait out the 
storm 
the approaching hurricane increased demand for gasoline at both 
the wholesale and retail levels and caused long lines at gas pumps 
in texas but analysts said they did not anticipate any immediate 
increase in retail prices 
if the hurricane comes in and does damage it will have an 
effect on retail prices said andrew lebow senior broker and 
analyst with edampf man international futures inc but right now 
the impact is localized and there is no impact at the pump 
the overriding element in the market wednesday involved 
opecrelated developments including an announcement that the 
cartels price monitoring committee would meet later this month 
which signaled a possible cutback in opec production 
opec secretarygeneral subroto announced the cartels price 
monitoring committee would meet sept 2526 
although members of the committee saudi arabia venezuela 
algeria indonesia and nigeria cannot take pricing or production 
action they can call a meeting of the entire 13member 
organization of petroleum exporting countries 
the prospect of such a meeting was enough to move the market 
although most traders remained cautious 
it indicates that opec is going to take some action lebow 
said 
reports wednesday also indicated some members of opec had 
reduced their output the market turned bearish last week on 
reports that opec was producing 20 million barrels of oil a day or 
more than 1 million barrels above the level the market could 
absorb wednesdays reports indicated opec production was down to 
about 185 million barrels said peter beutel assistant director 
of elders futures inc

the united states doesnt have the worlds 
biggest phone company anymore or the biggest banks or even the 
worlds biggest stock market 
but it still has the worlds biggest computer company 
international business machines corp towers over almost every 
facet of the world information industry which is burgeoning in 
size to rival oil and autos 
even with the dollar at depressed levels ibms 54 billion in 
revenue last year was more than triple that of its closest japanese 
competitor fujitsu ltd which pulled in 16 billion 
now though even big blue is adjusting to a new age of limits 
like the united states as a whole the computer giant is 
discovering that the rules of the game are changing it has 
encountered fierce new competitors on unaccustomed battlefields and 
found its old weapons inadequate 
this past week nine smaller rivals ganged up to adopt a new 
data pathway for personal computers rejecting the one ibm had 
hoped to establish as an industry standard 
in adjusting ibm has cut jobs without layoffs trimmed 
expansion plans and learned to be less imperious with customers 
ibm clearly intends to stay on top of the heap but it has 
learned painfully that toorapid growth has its drawbacks 
theyre being hit from all sides by the japanese as well as 
smaller american companies that are faster on their feet and dont 
suffer the problem of bureaucracy said bernard slade a former 
ibmer who is a senior management consultant with united research 
co in morristown nj 
being big means ibm can afford to spend 54 billion a year on 
research development and engineering more than the entire revenue 
of all but 75 of the fortune 500 companies 
it also means ibm is the only company that offers products in 
everysegment from personal computers to mainframes to software 
that gives it an advantage in the coming era of systems 
integration when customers will focus on tying their equipment 
into a smoothly running whole 
but size isnt everything as general motors corp and the 
defense department well know 
john f akers the 53yearold former navy fighter pilot who 
heads ibm has been striving to streamline the company by reducing 
staff and moving more people into jobs that deal directly with 
customers 
the chairman and chief executive was asked in june at a news 
conference in london whether the decentralization was an 
acknowledgement that being big had its problems 
no question about it he said 
akers told the london reporters he wants ibm people to take more 
risks and act more like entrepreneurs at every level of the 
company which by its very nature suggests we are going to make 
more mistakes in the future than we have in the past 
one sign that ibm has not entirely changed its strategy is its 
continued commitment restated this past week to grow over the 
long term at the same rate as the overall industry in each of the 
areas in which it participates 
long term could be the key phrase because it gives the 
company leeway to hold back on expansion when it is prudent to do 
so 
trying to match a 20 percent industry growth spurt in a single 
year could seriously discombobulate a company of ibms size 
ibms profits fell in 1985 and 1986 the first case of 
backtoback earnings declines since the great depression and many 
analysts attributed it to overstaffing and overbuilding in the 
early 1980s when the company overestimated its growth potential 
ibm is determined not to let that happen again says marc 
schulman of salomon brothers inc in a recent research report 
we believe that the company has determined that it is not in 
its interest to attempt to maintain or increase market share at all 
times in all markets schulman wrote 
most observers agree ibm is nimbler than other big companies and 
they praise the companys nolayoff tradition which has endured in 
spite of the effort to become leaner and meaner 
its created a higher degree of esprit de corps a better 
environment for people to work and a higher degree of 
professionalism because people have been wedded to the company 
said slade who spent 16 years at the company 
in essence ibm has been warehousing employees until such time 
as they become necessary said salomons schulman 
being ibm means carrying a lot of baggage product lines such as 
mainframes that made it into the giant of today but will be 
relatively less important in the future 
the biggest piece of baggage they have to drag around is 
compatibility with the 370 series mainframe user base which 
accounted for about 28 billion of ibms 54 billion in revenue 
last year including related addons software and maintenance 
said david h andrews president of adm inc in cheshire conn 
they cant do anything to radically disturb that mainframe 
business but it doesnt provide much opportunity either said 
andrews whose company provides consulting to ibm corporate 
customers 
ibms size gives it the potential at least theoretically to 
force competitors out of business indeed the justice department 
filed an antitrust suit against ibm in 1969 and didnt drop the 
action until 1982 under the reagan administration 
although ibm no longer has to tiptoe the way it once did it is 
still on warning not to emphasize its size in its advertising 
the kind of practices that helped ibm grow in the past and 
drew the scrutiny of antitrust lawyers are the same ones that are 
inhibiting the company today 
critics say ibm intentionally segmented the market with a 
variety of incompatible computers so that it could manipulate 
prices lowering them in the segments under attack from rivals 
while keeping fat profit margins in segments where it faced less 
competition 
ibm says it made different kinds of computers to satisfy 
different kinds of customers in any case the lack of 
compatibility left an opening for competitors such as digital 
equipment corp which uses a single operating system in its entire 
vax line 
if ibm makes it easy for its computers to interconnect with each 
other and competitors models it will open its sheltered accounts 
to the fiercest competition ever it is a risky strategy but the 
alternative is to stick with a steadily dwindling group of ibm 
loyalists 
ibm is taking the risk spending 200 million this year alone 
on the aix base software that is one key to the highly competitive 
open systems of the future 
ibms strategy of cutting costs decentralizing and plunging 
into the competitive market of open systems indicates that the 
people running the giant realize they are in a new era and are 
determined to adapt to it 
ibms grand plan said adms andrews is to ensure growth 
and dominance in the 1990s

guinness plc said its profit after taxes rose 19 
percent in the first half of 1988 from a year earlier helped by a 
large reduction in the interest charges on its debt 
the big british liquor company reported thursday that its profit 
for the first six months of the year rose to 111 million pounds or 
about 186 million from 93 million pounds or 156 million in the 
same period a year earlier 
earnings per share increased to 131 pence or 22 cents from 
111 pence or 19 cents 
for nearly two years guinness has been embroiled in a scandal 
surrounding its 1986 takeover of distillers co plc a british gin 
and whisky maker 
guinness has admitted that its former management arranged for 
third parties to repurchase guinness stock apparently to boost 
its share price and make its cash and stock offer for distillers 
more attractive than a rival bid seven men face criminal charges 
in the case including ernest saunders guinness former chairman 
and chief executive 
guinness revenue in the first half jumped 16 percent to 114 
billion pounds or around 192 billion from 986 million pounds 
or 166 billion 
interest charges paid by the company fell 33 percent in the 
period to 24 million pounds or 40 million 
the decline reflects the reduction in guinness debt as it has 
received the proceeds from the sale of several peripheral 
businesses outside its core spirits and brewing operations 
in the first half of 1988 we made considerable progress in 
furthering our declared strategy to build on our core businesses of 
spirits and brewing guinness chief executive anthony tennant 
said 
the company didnt provide separate quarterly results it isnt 
required to do so under british law

grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade as fears eased about hurricane 
gilberts potential threat to southern soybean crops 
crop futures prices had risen moderately wednesday as the raging 
storm approached the gulf of mexico but analysts said today it 
appeared the hurricane would skirt the central section of texas 
southern coast reducing the potential for serious crop damage 
some concern remained that gilbert would spawn storms in the 
midwest where weekend showers moving in from the west already were 
expected to slow the corn and soybean harvest a prospect that 
should support prices analysts said 
the farmers could be out of their fields for a few days 
said jerry gidel grain market analyst with the chicagobased gh 
miller division of britishowned lit america inc 
the agriculture departments rejection of several bids for 
subsidized us wheat sent wheat prices lower this morning he said 
in early trading wheat was 3 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 409 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 2 cents lower with september at 284 a bushel oats 
were unchanged to 3 cents lower with september at 268 a bushel 
soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents lower with september at 875 a 
bushel 
livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on 
the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 68 cent lower to 27 cent higher with october 
at 6987 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 40 cent 
lower with september at 7955 cents a pound hogs were 27 cent 
lower to 20 cent higher with october at 3795 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 27 cent to 50 cent lower with february

bond prices were unchanged to higher in calm 
trading early today continuing to draw support from wednesdays 
encouraging report on the nations trade deficit for july 
the treasurys closely watched 30year issue was up about 
point or 250 for every 1000 in face value at midday its

the bond market does not seem to have a whole lot of upside 
potential said john sebastian executive vice president of 
clayton brown amp associates an investment firm in chicago 
the commerce department said wednesday that the us merchandise 
trade deficit fell to 95 billion in july from a revised 132 
billion shortfall the previous month 
the july figure represented the lowest monthly imbalance since 
december 1984 and was far less than the 115 billion to 125 
billion most analysts had anticipated 
analysts said they were encouraged by the fact that the improved 
trade picture was due largely to a drop in imports rather an 
increase in exports they said that suggested the economy may be 
slowing down thereby easing fears of inflation 
the bond market shrugged off the news toturday declared today that 
presidential rival michael dukakis is 
an olympic champion in the taxandspend competition dukakis 
traveled to wyoming to view damage and praise firefighters at 
yellowstone national park 
bush said at a breakfast of the commonwealth club in san 
francisco my opponent still says he wants to do for the nation 
what he has done for massachusetts that slogan is beginning to 
sound more and more like a threat 
dukakis has indeed pointed with pride to his states economic 
condition however bush said of the governor the judges have 
made their final decision if this were the olympics his 
composite score would make him the gold medal winner in the 
taxandspend competition 
meanwhile dukakis democratic running mate sen lloyd bentsen 
declared today in dallas that the polls have turned around and 
that republicans outrageous charges on patriotism had created 
a backlash among voters 
sen dan quayle bushs running mate said today in oklahoma 
city that i will be delighted to compare my qualifications to 
those of dukakis who has been suggesting voters wouldnt be wise 
to put the indiana senator a heartbeat away from the presidency 
the bush campaign began airing in california an antidukakis ad 
saying the massachusetts governor had a chance to clean up boston 
harbor but chose not to raising the cost when the job eventually 
is done 
the democratic nominee completing three days of foreign policy 
and defense speeches charged wednesday that the nations military 
has suffered from years of neglect under the reagan administration 
dukakis promised an audience in annapolis md that the nation 
is going to have strong strategic forces were going to have 
strong conventional forces and were going to clean up the mess in 
the pentagon 
bush told a raucous rally in san franciscos chinatown that the 
november election provides the voters with a choice you can 
choose to keep going with the policies that have launched the 
longest period of economic growth in history or you can choose to 
go backward 
the vice president was campaigning again today in california a 
key state with the most electoral votes 47 before ending the day 
in ohio 
dukakis was flying to yellowstone to view fire damage to 939270 
acres of the 22 millionacre facility and meet with firefighters 
local residents and governors of western states 
dukakis was not expected to take a position on the question of 
whether the reagan administration was wrong to let the fires burn 
unchecked until midjuly 
hes not going out there to criticize but to talk and listen 
and learn he wants to see the fires listen and say that if 
elected president hell look at the fire policy dukakis 
communications director leslie dach said 
republican quayle stumping for votes in kansas held his first 
news conference since sept 1 quayles counterpart democrat 
bentsen was appearing in dallas and memphis tenn 
the two contenders got word wednesday on their only vice 
presidential debate which was set for oct 5 in omaha neb 
bentsen said debating quayle would give both an opportunity to 
compare our records of experience and accomplishment in the us 
senate 
the two encountered hostile crowds on the campaign trail as the 
gop senator from indiana was jeered by dukakis supporters chanting 
go home quayle in albuquerque nm and hecklers rattled the 
democratic senator in his home state of texas 
as you listen to this babble over here you cant help but 
think of the dukakis positions quayle said they have no 
positions theyre loud but they dont have any ideas 
bentsen who overcame his initial problems to respond to the 
jeers in grand prairie texas defended his running mate as a 
candidate who would strengthen the military with practical weapons 
instead of the buck rogers type of gop program 
dukakis in a speech at georgetown university promised his 
support for development of the advanced tactical fighter aircraft 
and the sea wolf attack submarine if elected 
its time for an end to republican smoke and mirrors on 
national defense dukakis said 
president reagan campaigning for bush in missouri made his 
first referrence to dukakis recent emphasis on defense and foreign 
policy saying we havent seen such a radical transformation 
since dustin hoffman played tootsie 
bush who pitched patriotism to hispanic workers in fresno 
calif courted asian voters in san francisco with the words only 
one man is pledged to build a better america through low taxes and 
high opportunity and only one man wants laws against crime 
tougher laws and creative programs for our schools 
only one person only one person can carry americas peace 
and prosperity into the 1990s he said i am here to tell you 
that i am that man 
later however about 400 demonstrators gathered at union square 
across from the hotel where bush delivered a fundraising speech 
the protesters chanted wheres george and money for aids 
stop the war us out of el salvador police said at least one 
person was arrested 
in the latest nationwide poll an abc newswashington post 
survey of 1092 likely voters dukakis and bush were essentially 
tied with 48 percent supporting dukakis for president and 45 
percent backing bush the poll had a margin of sampling error of 
three percentage points 
the poll was conducted sept 7 through tuesday finishing two 
days after two other polls that had found an eightpoint bush lead 
that indicated some movement to dukakis in those last two days

smallbusiness owners and executives arent 
exactly overjoyed about their relationships with bankers and are 
particularly steamed up about what they feel are excessive lending 
rates 
to which you might respond so what else is new 
agreed the smallbusiness view does not break new ground but a 
study just completed draws dire consequences from it particularly 
the inference that the dispensing of services in america may be 
declining 
the study by the nfib foundation found that just 60 percent of 
all smallbusiness loan applicants left their banks satisfied a 
finding the foundation felt was so important it led to its major 
conclusion 
william dennis jr senior research fellow explains that 
conclusion 
not long ago the united states lost preeminence in 
manufacturing due to the decline in product quality since that 
time american industry has struggled mightily sometimes 
successfully and sometimes not to regain lost markets 
the 60 percent figures raises the specter that the same 
process may be occurring in services 
this conclusion is made despite what some bankers claim is an 
explosion of new and valuable products from lending institutions in 
the aftermath of deregulation but the survey concludes differently 
according to john sloan president of the national federation of 
independent business and a former banker the results of 
deregulation are virtually invisible 
although the study which involved more than 1900 businesses 
found some evidence of greater competition for smallbusiness 
accounts sloan states that smallbusiness owners have not only 
seen little in the way of improved services or benefits they have 
actually been hit with higher interest rates 
the washingtonbased federation has more than 500000 business 
members some with sales in the scores of millions of dollars a 
dimension that hardly qualifies them as small 
just what is small has always been a subject of dispute 
with some analysts limiting it mainly to proprietorships while 
others define the category so broadly as to include any business 
other than the 1000 largest 
stating that small business is enormous by any measure dennis 
offers these statistics 
more than 17 million federal income tax returns containing some 
type of business income were filed in 1986 and more than 4 million 
businesses employed people 
approximately 99 percent of all businesses are classified as 
small in fact most small businesses are very small nearly 60 
percent of all employers have only one to four employees ninety 
percent have less than 20 
small business produces about 38 percent of the gross national 
product and nearly half of the nations gross business product 
constituting more than 15 trillion of goods and services every 
year 
small companies have created most of the 34 million new jobs in 
the united states since 1970 smaller firms now employ over half 
the private sector workforce 
small business in short is a vital economic force one of the 
worlds largest by some estimates says dennis it is the worlds 
third largest economy trailing only the united states as a whole 
and the soviet union 
and yet the study suggests it is not being serviced properly 
by banks 
an example 
diversity within the smallbusiness population implies that 
smallbusiness financial conditions and demands for financing must 
also be highly diverse 
but dennis observes with lending authority often physically 
removed from a smallbusiness owners branch and transaction costs 
for custom loans comparatively high cookie cutter banking 
appears increasingly in vogue 
almost all transactions he continues are cut from the same 
pattern the result of tension between the small business need 
for individualized borrowing and the banks demand for greater 
uniformity in lending

a playful bit of english tradition went on the 
auction block thursday 
the owner of hamleys of regent street one of the worlds 
oldest biggest and most famous toy shops said the flagship store 
and the hamleys name will be sold with hopes the new owner will 
expand the business worldwide 
we are selling a major piece of english heritage said 
graham watson a spokesman that history and heritage can be 
exploited by the right buyers 
major american retailers have expressed an interest in buying 
the 228yearold store which holds a royal warrant as a toy and 
sports merchant to queen elizabeth ii said the owner lowndes 
queensway plc 
the company said the sale would give a new owner the opportunity 
to develop the hamleys name by franchising or licensing it for use 
in major international retailing centers developing a hamleys 
brand of high quality toy clothing and other products for sale 
around the world and through sponsoring prestigious events such as 
the wimbledon tennis tournament 
lowndes queensway said it is selling hamleys to concentrate on 
its furniture and carpet businesses 
the company set an oct 3 deadline for bids and said it expected 
to announce a purchaser at the end of next month 
it is a unique brand and a unique opportunity and we believe 
the price will reflect that uniqueness said watson who is a 
director of noble grossart ltd the firm that is handling the sale 
lowndes queensway shut down 10 other hamley stores throughout 
britain this year after the chains previous owner harris 
queensway plc failed in an attempt to expand domestically 
lowndes ventures plc a holding company acquired harris 
queensway last month saying it would return harris queensway to 
its core businesses of furniture and carpet retailing hamleys is 
the first unrelated business being sold 
the future for hamleys lies not in opening stores throughout 
the uk united kingdom but is to have hamleys stores and 
hamleys goods in places like new york paris and rome watson 
said 
located on regent street one of londons finest shopping 
streets hamleys boasts an extensive range of merchandise more 
than 25000 product lines 
founded in 1760 by toymaker william hamley the retailer 
currently is making a pretax profit equivalent to about 34 
million on annual sales of about 31 million watson said 
watson said many of up to 40 inquiries lowndes queensway already 
has received came from parties overseas 
the ownership of hamleys may become foreign at the end of this 
exercise he said

to wall streets known and alleged insider 
traders stock manipulators and other schemers the name gary lynch 
has become an accursed synonym for trouble 
the lanky 38yearold head of the securities and exchange 
commissions enforcement division who once drove a truck for the 
family business leads a team of lawyers and investigators that has 
stunned the financial world with the biggest crackdown on 
securities law abuse in history 
its an effort that has made wall street felons dennis levine 
and ivan boesky household words it has forced the most venerable 
brokerages to reevaluate and tighten their own compliance and 
ethics codes moreover it is likely to lead to tough new laws on 
insider trading and other frauds 
to lynch a 6foot2 father of two young sons who works 11hour 
days and weekends for an annual salary of about 72000 a fraction 
of what hed earn in a private practice this is the reward for 
taking on the role of top sec cop 
it took a couple of years for me to get to the point where i 
enjoyed it he said in a telephone interview thursday from his 
office in washington for the forseeable future i see myself 
staying right here 
lynch and his crew made perhaps the biggest splash of their 
careers sept 7 with a 184page civil complaint against drexel 
burnham lambert inc its celebrity highyield bond financier 
michael milken and other employees accusing them of secretly 
scheming with boesky to violate a litany of securities laws and 
cheat drexels own clients 
the complaint which marked the most aggressive sec enforcement 
action ever undertaken against an investment firm capped a nearly 
twoyear probe of drexel implicated by boesky when he settled 
insider trading charges with the sec in 1986 and paid the 
enforcement agency a record 100 million 
drexel has asserted its innocence and assembled a scrappy legal 
team to fight the accusations which may not be resolved for years 
in accordance with sec policy lynch would not elaborate on the 
allegations against drexel which is still under investigation but 
those who know lynch say hes a tenacious legal adversary who 
shouldnt be underestimated 
hes a fine individual and an outstanding lawyer im proud of 
him said stanley sporkin a former sec enforcement chief who 
hired lynch in 1976 hes a very quiet reserved person who goes 
about his job and does it 
sporkin now a federal judge in washington said lynch impressed 
him soon after joining the division by taking on a tortuously 
complex securities law violation case involving a west coast firm 
with an aggressive defense lawyer 
from that point on recalled sporkin i knew i could rely 
on him when he told me there was something there there was 
something there 
lynch grew up in rural new york attended syracuse university 
and graduated from duke university law school in 1975 but wasnt 
sure he wanted to make a career out of law 
he wound up driving a truck in florida for his brothers 
business before spending a year in private practice and 
subsequently joining the sec 
quickly rising through the enforcement division from staff 
attorney to branch chief to assistant director he developed a 
reputation as one of the shrewdest sec lawyers around especially 
because of his talents at uncovering paper trails of fraud and 
bargaining for information 
ive certainly always enjoyed the investigative process 
lynch said i like putting the puzzle together i also have to 
say i like negotiating deals even if eventually a deals not 
reached 
lynch got the divisions top job in early 1985 and became the 
youngest enforcement chief in sec history although some securities 
lawyers say privately that lynch happened to be in the right place 
at the right time to lead the crusade against wall street greed 
others say he was crucial to the effort 
without him this wouldnt have gotten done said edward 
herlihy a new york attorney and a former sec assistant enforcement 
chief who had been lynchs superior in the late 1970s i think 
lessable people than gary lynch would have stubbed their toes 
lynchs colleagues say he personally pierced the veil of secrecy 
surrounding the bahamas branch of a swiss bank where convicted 
insider trader dennis levine maintained a bank account to handle 
his illicit deals 
faced with exposure levine cooperated with the sec and federal 
prosecutors becoming the key figure that led them to boesky 
softspoken and modest with grayflecked hair that belies his 
age lynch also is credited with restoring sapped morale at the 
enforcement division which had watched lynchs predecessor john 
fedders depart amid scandal 
after fedders resignation prompted by charges that he had 
beaten his wife lynch managed to keep many talented sec lawyers 
from leaving for higherpaying jobs in private practice 
lynch is not without critics in the government however rep 
john dingell dmich chairman of the house subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations has chided lynch and his staff for 
not aggressively pursuing other securities law abuses besides the 
highly publicized insider trading cases 
others have criticized lynch for allowing boesky to settle 
insider trading charges for only 100 million and permitting him to 
sell large positions before the charges against him were announced 
in november 1986 in effect letting boesky trade on inside 
information about his impending demise 
lynch rejects such criticisms saying that under his tenure the 
sec has pursued more enforcement cases than at any other time in 
history

grain and soybean futures closed broadly lower 
thursday on the chicago board of trade after an attempt to rally 
soybean prices to last weeks highs fizzled prompting a rapid 
lastminute selloff 
the midsession buyers led by brokeragehouse and 
commodityfund traders all ended up scattering to the winds in 
the last final seconds said jerry gidel an analyst in chicago 
with the gh miller division of the britishowned trading company 
lit america inc 
gidel said fears of crop damage from hurricane gilbert a major 
factor in wednesdays price rally had largely dissipated on 
expectations that the storm would skirt most of the texas coastline 
higher cash prices for us soybean meal and rumors that the 
soviet union may have bought up to 500000 metric tons of argentine 
soybean meal also contributed to the midsession rally gidel said 
but analysts said the midday buyers turned sellers when they 
found no support for soybean prices above 890 for september 
delivery and 903 for november delivery 
at the close wheat was 5 cents to 7 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in september at 408 a bushel corn was 2 
cents to 5 cents lower with september at 282 a bushel oats were

the president of public service company of 
new hampshire the first major investorowned electric company 
since the depression to seek bankruptcy protection has resigned 
due to health reasons the utility announced thursday 
robert harrison 56 joined the states largest power company 31 
years ago and became president in 1981 
he had been vice president since 1973 overseeing finances for 
the building of the companys 56 billion seabrook nuclear plant 
which was completed two years ago but remains unlicensed because of 
evacuationplanning obstacles 
at a special meeting wednesday the utilitys board of directors 
named john duffett its chief operating officer and a 32year 
veteran of the company to succeed harrison 
duffett 60 becomes the fifth president in the utilitys 
62year history the directors also named william scharffenberger 
67 as board chairman a position that had been unfilled 
scharffenberger who is president and chief executive officer of 
wheelingpittsburgh steel corp has extensive experience in 
corporate reorganizations public service said in a statement 
wheelingpittsburgh based in wheeling wva has been under 
chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection since april 1985 
delays in licensing the seabrook project forced public service 
to seek protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy laws on jan 28 
scharffenberger said the board expects a smooth transition of 
leadership that would not delay filing of a reorganization plan 
with the bankruptcy court public service has until dec 27 to file 
such a plan 
harrison who has a history of heart disorders will retire 
under the companys disability benefits program the company said 
he has been under a lot of stress and his doctor has ordered 
him to relieve himself of that stress a company director philip 
dunlap said in an interview thursday 
in a statement harrison said he was deeply disappointed that 
it is necessary to leave in the midst of the restoration of psnhs 
financial health 
harrison was active in obtaining financing for seabrook which 
public service began building in 1976 
but as construction began so did protests which blossomed into 
mass demonstrations that made seabrook a symbol of the nations 
antinuclear movement 
public services financial condition worsened as construction 
continued and in 1979 a state law went into effect that bars the 
company from charging ratepayers for seabrook before the plant 
operates commercially the utility which originally owned 50 
percent of the project reduced its share to 36 percent after 1979 
the first of two planned seabrook reactor was completed but a 
second officially was canceled in 1986

growing economic area in the world in the 1990s a study predicted 
thursday 
but unlike past years when exports from japan korea taiwan 
hong kong and singapore to the rest of the world fueled the 
regions progress the engine of growth in the next decade will be 
trade among the areas 12 nations the report said

firm and released by the worldlwide accounting firm kpmg peat 
marwick

the 1990s

he called it unfair to prevent the companies from making their 
own equipment contending their removal from the marketplace 
through the breakup of atampt has resulted in dominance by foreign 
manufacturers and a 26 billion trade deficit for 
telecommunications equipment at the end of 1987 
weiss said he would urge house members to pass a resolution 
introduced by rep john dingell dmich to lift the manufacturing 
ban and allow the regional companies to sell information services 
such as financial planning spreadsheet analyses and electronic 
directories provided for computers 
us district judge harold greene earlier this year modified the 
atampt consent decree to allow the bell companies to transmit 
information services but he refused to permit them to originate 
the information themselves he said the bell companies control of 
local phone networks would give them an unfair advantage over 
informationservices competitors 
but weiss said supporters of the information services 
restriction imply that the restriction is the only way to ensure 
fair competition these people arent opposed merely to unfair 
competition they prefer no competition period 
let it be clear however that in their dash to protect their 
markets they are also keeping many critical information services 
from the american people and many benefits from the american 
economy

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply moved in opposite directions in the week ended sept 5 the 
federal reserve board reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 rose to a seasonally 
adjusted 30368 billion up from 30341 billion the previous 
week 
an even broader measure m3 fell to a seasonally adjusted 
38486 billion from 38496 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 rose to a 
seasonally adjusted 7831 billion from a revised 7827 billion 
the previous week 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for 
annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent 
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 
percent the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since 
early 1987

cotton futures prices plummeted the permitted daily limit of 2 
cents a pound thursday on the new york cotton exchange as fears of 
hurricane damage to the texas cotton crop receded 
on other markets prices for future delivery of oil precious 
metals grains soybeans livestock and stocks all declined 
cotton for october delivery had gained 26 cents a pound during 
the previous two days on speculation that hurricane gilbert would 
strike the louisiana or northern texas coastline and damage cotton 
crops in the mississippi delta region 
but the huge storm appeared to be tracking further south on 
thursday and was expected to do little harm to the cotton crop 
analysts said sell orders poured into the cotton exchange sending 
some contracts down the limit in the morning prices recovered at 
midday but closed limitdown in a second round of heavy selling 
there was a lot of selling coming in partially profittaking 
partially establishing new positions which says there is no need 
for cotton to be at these levels said ernest simon cotton 
specialist in new york with prudentialbache securities inc 
furious winds and driving rain still were forecast for the 
southern texas coastline but most of the cotton in that area 
already has been harvested analysts said 
the hurricane poses the worst threat to cotton plants with open 
bolls that expose the white fibers to the elements 
any rain will stress the cotton discolor it and dirt will get 
inside said judith ganes an analyst in new york with shearson 
lehman hutton inc not only can the crop lose quantity but the 
quality is diminished 
simon said the only exposed cotton was in western texas most of 
the cotton in the states northcentral and westcentral regions 
had not opened yet and growers there want rain he said 
cotton settled 190 cents to 2 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in october at 5485 cents a pound 
the prospects of a major disruption of oil refining along the 
texaslouisiana coast also diminished with the changing hurricane 
forecasts sending energy futures prices down sharply on the new 
york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 46 cents to 50 cents 
lower with october at 1490 a barrel heating oil was 116 cents 
to 137 cents lower with october at 4270 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 48 cent to 139 cents lower with october at 4563 
cents a gallon 
the drop in energy prices reinforced the prevailing bearish 
attitude among gold futures traders on new yorks commodity 
exchange where prices dropped to their lowest levels in more than 
17 months 
credittightening moves by the federal reserve and central banks 
in europe have weakened inflationary pressures and dampened 
investor demand for gold said george anagnos metals analyst with 
thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
the commerce departments report that retail sales declined 02 
percent last month simply confirmed the precedent of recent 
economic statistics which suggest the economy is growing in a more 
tempered and sustainable fashion he said 
gold settled 270 to 350 lower with the contract for delivery 
in october at 41980 a troy ounce silver was 22 cents to 3 cents 
lower with september at 6467 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures finished broadly lower on the chicago 
board of trade after an attempt to rally soybean prices to last 
weeks highs fizzled prompting a rapid lastminute selloff 
fading fears of crop damage from hurricane gilbert also fueled 
the decline analysts said 
wheat settled 5 cents to 6 cents lower with september at 407 
a bushel corn was 2 cents to 5 cents lower with september at 
282 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
september at 265 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 10 cents 
lower with september at 872 a bushel 
cattle futures settled mostly lower in line with lower cash 
prices trading was cautious ahead of fridays sevenstate 
cattleonfeed report from the agriculture department 
hog futures also were pressured by lower cash markets but frozen 
pork bellies finished higher in a technically inspired rally 
analysts said 
live cattle were 05 cent to 18 cent lower with october at 
7037 cents a pound feeder cattle were 18 cent lower to 12 cent 
higher with september at 7975 cents a pound hogs were 60 cent 
lower to 20 cent higher with october at 3795 cents a pound 
frozen pork bellies were 03 cent to 50 cent higher with february 
at 4872 cents a pound 
stockindex futures retreated modestly on the chicago mercantile 
exchange where the contract for september delivery of the standard 
amp poors 500 index settled 165 points lower at 26780

chinas ambitious drive to boost livestock and 
poultry production could be held back by a limited availability of 
feed supplies an agriculture department report said thursday 
the current fiveyear plan for increasing the output of meat by 
18 percent from 193 million tons in 1985 to 2275 million metric 
tons by 1990 is meeting with some success the report said 
the limiting factor in chinese livestock and poultry 
production gains will be feed supplies the report said in 
turn feed grain imports will be constrained in the next two to 
three years by chinas ability to earn sufficient foreign exchange 
for these purchases 
china is an important but sometimes erratic market for us 
farmers and the livestock sector is watched closely for signs that 
more grain and feed sales may be developing 
one of the problems cited in the report which was included in 
the october issue of foreign agriculture magazine is this years 
rise in world grain prices caused by tighter supplies resulting 
primarily from the us drought 
should world commodity prices remain high the chinese 
government is likely to squeeze exports of corn and soybeans out of 
the domestic market in order to earn badly needed foreign 
exchange the report said 
in 198586 it said china exported more than 6 million tons of 
corn from its northern provinces while importing 400000 tons into 
the south 
as in the past china will continue to export soybeans for 
foreign exchange and barter with japan the ussr and other 
asian countries the report said
