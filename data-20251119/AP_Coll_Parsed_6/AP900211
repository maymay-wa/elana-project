secretary of state james a baker iii 
opened a new round of talks with allied leaders sunday night on 
reducing us and soviet troops in europe 
but his chances of shaping a nato consensus on how to reply to 
the latest proposal by soviet president mikhail s gorbachev were 
limited by the absence of a consensus within the bush 
administration 
us sources who demanded anonymity said the pentagon had not 
signed off on a us response it was not clear whether the 
delay was caused by a substantive disagreement or by the fact that 
defense secretary dick cheney was away starting a twoweek trip to 
asia 
a senior defense department official traveling with cheney said 
he heard a hint of such a story last week and that it wasnt his 
sense that the pentagon is throwing up any kind of roadblocks 
i have no sense we are the problem the official said he 
said cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs 
had been in constant contact with the pentagons representative at 
the talks undersecretary of defense paul wolfowitz and i didnt 
sense there were any problems 
reflecting the lack of a firm us position officials said 
afterward that baker was neutral in his presentation to the 
allies of the gorbachev proposal 
he basically just laid it the proposal out literally said 
a us official who demanded anonymity the secretary described 
it in neutral terms 
as for the allies the official said the ministers felt they 
wanted to consider it for a longer period of time 
meanwhile the new york times reported that baker told soviet 
officials last week that the united states is now willing to 
receive preliminary soviet proposals about reductions in nuclear 
arms that would go beyond those currently under negotiation 
up to now we have not been willing to discuss the soviet ideas 
on start ii on the ground that we still have work to do on start 
1 the paper quoted a senior administration official now we 
are saying you can raise your ideas if you want to we are getting 
to the point where we need to think a little bit about the next 
phase 
also on the agenda in ottawa was talks on german reunification 
the first session was requested by west german foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher to brief baker on meetings chancellor helmut 
kohl and genscher held in moscow with leaders of the soviet union 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd and french foreign 
minister roland dumas were invited to attend 
afterward baker and the foreign ministers of the 15 us allies 
in the north atlantic treaty organization arranged a caucus in 
advance of the opening monday of an open skies conference with 
the soviet union and the six other warsaw pact nations 
the purpose is to consider adoption of a proposal made last may 
by president bush to open the countries to aerial surveillance as a 
way of allaying suspicions of secret military operations or 
preparations for surprise attacks 
in his state of the union speech jan 31 bush proposed a 
ceiling of 225000 on us and soviet troops on foreign soil in 
europe with a limit of 195000 in central europe 
gorbachev in a fourhour meeting with baker on friday in 
moscow countered with an initiative that would set the ceiling of 
195000 throughout europe or 225000 as an alternative without 
any sublimit for central europe 
one result would be more leeway for the soviets to keep troops 
in central europe than under the bush proposal currently about 
385000 are in east germany alone 
baker called gorbachevs proposal very interesting but said 
at a news conference friday night in moscow the bush administration 
could not reply without consulting the allies 
still discussion within the bush administration itself 
apparently is still going on the pentagon and the national 
security council must weigh in with their recommendations 
within the alliance itself the debate could extend beyond the 
two days baker is spending in ottawa so a consensus may not emerge 
by the time he flies home tuesday night 
genscher requested the meeting with baker as bakers us air 
force jet was en route from bucharest on a 12hour 5290mile 
flight 
gale winds in the vicinity of shannon ireland where bakers 
plane was due to refuel forced it to divert to lajes air base in 
the azores to canada 
german reunification is proceeding at a pace unanticipated by 
either the americans or the soviets the two superpowers are trying 
to arrange a peaceful outcome but they differ on strategy 
baker has endorsed a proposal that would keep the unified 
germany in nato but without western troops permitted in east 
germany 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze has proposed an 
international plebiscite on the question of german reunification

scientists from around the globe gather 
in south carolina on monday to review a 10year study of acid rain 
that may be the most comprehensive ever on the issue 
about 1000 researchers from 11 federal agencies spent 500 
million compiling 28 separate reports on the causes and effects of 
acid rain and proposals to curb it 
one conclusion of the study likely to provoke controversy at the 
conference is that acid rain generally isnt harming the nations 
forests said joseph barnard a us forest service researcher who 
headed up the work of forest scientists the charlotte nc 
observer said in saturday editions 
the world resources institute a washingtonbased environmental 
group said evidence is unambiguous that acid rain and ozone 
contribute to the deaths of trees in the south east and west 
the reports will be reviewed during the weeklong meeting on 
hilton head island then combined in a final document that will be 
used with computer models to devise emissioncontrol strategies 
against acid rain 
the whole purpose is to give outsiders a chance to critique 
the reports its a chance to get them out into the broader 
scientific community said chuck herrick a spokesman for the 
national acidic rain assessment program 
the program was established by congress 10 years ago to oversee 
the study of acid rain 
about 600 scientists from 35 countries are expected to attend 
the conference which runs through friday 
acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
which mixes in the atmosphere and can be carried hundreds of miles 
before falling back to earth as rain snow fog and dust particles 
it makes lakes and streams acidic killing aquatic life it can 
also kill trees and is harmful to the health of humans 
much of the pollution comes from power plants that burn 
highsulphur coal although other industrial facilities contribute 
the national acidic rain assessment programs final report will 
be used to create 30 scenarios detailing the expected effects of 
acid rain in the future and the effectiveness of various efforts 
to curtail acid rain 
the report will make no recommendations on what should be done 
however 
the assumption then is the policy people will be looking at 
this and will be able to make their decisions said herrick 
adding that the review is probably the most comprehensive ever 
compiled on acid rain 
last summer president bush unveiled a clean air bill to sharply 
reduce urban smog toxic chemical air pollution and acid rain by 
the end of the decade bushs plan which he called one of his top 
priorities is before congress

six convicts including three murderers 
escaped from a maximumsecurity prison early sunday apparently by 
cutting through metal bars officials said one was captured later 
in the day 
the escapees who had been in segregation cells at the joliet 
correctional center because of disciplinary problems were 
considered extremely dangerous authorities said most were in 
their 20s 
tommy munoz was captured shortly after 530 pm at his cousins 
chicago home by law enforcement officers whod staked it out said 
state department of corrections spokesman nic howell munoz 22 
was serving a sentence for narcotics violatins and intimidation 
about 100 corrections officers specially trained to deal with 
escapes assisted state police and local law enforcement officers in 
the hunt 
a search for the escapees with dogs and an airplane was called 
off earlier because they has apparently split up said state 
trooper thomas miller 
the prisoners escaped from segregation cells where they were 
kept for disciplinary problems howell said four of the inmates 
were doubled up in cells and the other two were in cells alone 
reports of when the prisoners escaped changed over the course o 
the day state police originally reported the men were discovered 
missing at 455 am but illinois department of corrections 
spokesman nic howell later said the discovery was made after a 7 
am inmate count came up short 
the inmates had to cut through bars on the cells break a 
window cut through bars outside the window and cross a fence to 
get away howell said 
obviously this is a breach of security he said they 
shouldnt have had the materials to be able to cut with and should 
not have been able to cut like this without being noticed 
the men may have been armed with cutting tools when they got 
away miller said 
the prison which has been plagued by overcrowding in recent 
years is one of the states four maximumsecurity facilities and 
one of two in joliet which is about 30 miles southwest of chicago 
the other in joliet is stateville correctional center 
the prison houses 1300 inmates 500 more than it was built to 
hold 
in addition to munoz miller identified the escapees as 
daniel johnson 24 of buru tenn imprisoned for murder

panned out he said 
police said two men walked into the las cruces bowl on saturday 
herded seven people including four children into an office in the 
front of the building made them lie on the floor and shot them in 
the backs of their heads the men then set fire to the office in an 
effort to cover up the crime police said 
the owners daughter had opened the safe and was counting the 
money when all this happened said police sgt phil george 
rubio said it appeared the motive was robbery and that money was 
missing he did not disclose the amount 
he said the seven victims were the only people in the bowling 
alley at the time and the robbers apparently decided to rid 
themselves of any witnesses 
no neighbors interviewed saturday heard the shots but they said 
their dogs started barking around 730 am 
one of the victims called police around 830 am from the 
smoldering office 
she was crying and hysterical when she called said george 
who was the first officer on the scene 
ive never been involved in a case so gruesome george said 
one of the survivors was moaning and groaning so i went to her 
and we started getting them out of the office 
firefighters helped move the dead and wounded from the flames

not release any other details 
police lt jerry fariss said sunday he had spoken with two of 
the survivors one of them was able to give a description that 
tends to match the one weve got he said

a general claimed saturday the 
government has made strong military gains toward vanquishing the 
usbacked guerrillas in the nearly one year since the soviet 
troop withdrawal 
lt gen abdul haq ulumi also claimed guerrilla losses were 10 
times those of the army in the past year he declined to give a 
specific figure 
the insurgents who are based in neighboring pakistan said the 
only route to peace is on the battlefield not across the 
negotiating table 
us secretary of state james a baker iii told reporters in 
moscow that washington was willing to permit afghan president najib 
to remain in office while peace talks are conducted between the 
sovietbacked government and the usarmed insurgents 
referring to reports that moscow and washington were considering 
compromises that could include a scaling down of aid to the 
opposing afghan sides ulumi said it was very much toon too early 
to speak about what we should give up and what they the 
guerrillas should give up 
first there should be a ceasefire international guarantees 
elections and formation of a broadbased government said ulumi a 
ranking member of the central committee of the peoples democratic 
party of afghanistan 
speaking to foreign journalists through an interpreter he said 
that since the soviets ended nine years of military presence in 
midfebruary najibs troops proved their ability to go it alone 
against the insurgents known as the mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors 
the government still holds every major city and has made deals 
with scores of local commanders who once fought on behalf of the 
mujahedeen but fighting continues in much of the countryside and 
around several key provincial capitals mujahedeen rockets still 
fall on kabul although with far less frequnecy than a year ao 
the last red army troops crossed the border home on feb 15 
1989 but moscow continues massive supplies by land and air of 
weapons and food

galileos camera shutter snapped 
uncontrollably for five hours saturday after the spacecraft zipped 
around venus but officials said it shouldnt endanger the 135 
billion eightyear mission to jupiter 
engineers at nasas jet propulsion laboratory shut off the 
television camera while diagnosing the problem which apparently 
involved faulty software that made galileos computer send 
incorrect commands to the camera mission director neal ausman said 
they decided saturday night to send new computer commands to 
galileo to restart the camera so it could take a series of 
photographs of venus late saturday and early sunday said nasa 
spokesman bob macmillin 
the engineers believed an error in computer commands they sent 
to galileo made the shutter snap when it wasnt supposed to and 
they were pretty certain theres nothing wrong with the computer 
or camera he said 
galileo cruised around venus at 959 pm pst friday coming 
three to four miles closer to the planet than the planned point of 
closest approach 10028 miles above the venusian surface said 
mission science and design manager bill oneil 
the camera appeared undamaged but its shutter opened and closed 
twice per minute 468 times over five hours ausman said as 
planned only 16 pictures taken late friday and early saturday were 
stored on galileos tape recorder ausman said 
the malfunction didnt harm those pictures and the 452 unwanted 
shutter snappings were just like taking pictures with no film in 
the camera project manager dick spehalski said during a saturday 
news conference 
however the problem threatened five dozen other photos the 
spacecraft was supposed to take in the coming week to make a 
timelapse movie of venus clouds and winds said project scientist 
torrence johnson 
he said scientists werent too upset because about 20 us and 
soviet spacecraft have visited venus previously and the main 
purpose of galileos flyby was to use venus gravity to speed the 
spacecraft for its long trip to jupiter 
galileos other sensors will continue observing venus as the 
spacecraft speeds away from the planet spehalski said 
galileo was deployed oct 18 from space shuttle atlantis on a 
looping 24billion sixyear route that requires venus and earth 
to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to jupiter 
once there the spacecraft will deploy a probe to study 
jupiters atmosphere then orbit the giant gas planet for at least 
two years in a mission that costs 135 billion 
when the glitch developed at 141 am pst saturday galileo 
already had snapped the 16 pictures to study venusian wind and 
cloud patterns and search for lightning that might indicate 
erupting volcanoes beneath the clouds 
the camera was shut off at 630 am after engineers determined 
it was following incorrect computer commands ausman said eight 
minutes later the erroneous commands stopped without explanation 
despite the trouble there was no point when the spacecraft 
was in jeopardy he said 
galileos tv camera is perhaps the most critical instrument on 
the spacecraft it is expected to take pictures of jupiter 20 to 
1000 times more detailed than those returned by the voyager 1 and 
2 spacecraft in 1979 
the tv camera has a shutter which opens to throw light on an 
electronic sensor data from that sensor can be sent to earth 
where it is assembled into a photograph 
were dealing with a fresh spacecraft and prototype 
software so nasa knowingly risked a glitch in exchange for 
trying to photograph venus even though the spacecraft is still in 
the shakedown part of its trip to jupiter johnson said 
for now the pictures and data gathered in the flyby are being 
stored on galileos tape recorder and wont be sent back to earth 
until october when the spacecraft is close enough to transmit the 
material that antenna now can be used only for communications to 
keep galileo operating 
galileos roundabout route to jupiter is an indirect result of 
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger and killed 
seven crew members 
after the tragedy the national aeronautics and space 
administration decided against using powerful volatile 
liquidfueled centaur rockets to launch spacecraft after they were 
deployed from shuttles 
instead galileo was launched by a weaker booster after it was 
released from atlantis cargo bay that made it necessary to use 
the gravity of venus and earth to help speed and aim galileo toward 
jupiter a centaur would have propelled galileo to venus in only 
two years

two cosmonauts rocketed into orbit sunday on a 
mission designed to turn a profit of over 40 million a first in 
the 32year history of the soviet space program 
riding a soyuz tm9 capsule flight commander anatoly solovyov 
and engineer alexander balandin soared into cloudstreaked skies 
over the baikonur space complex in soviet kazakhstan on schedule at 
916 am moscow time 
the launch of the threestage rocket shown live on soviet 
television was also witnessed by four us astronauts flown to the 
space center in central asia for the event 
the american guests included dan brandenstein who commanded the 
11day flight of the space shuttle columbia in january ron grabe 
paul weitz and jerry ross 
solovyov and balandin were scheduled to dock later with the 
space station mir and to relieve two fellow soviet spacemen now 
spending their sixth month in orbit the new cosmonauts are to 
spend six months in space 
all systems were reported normal by soviet television eight 
minutes after the soyuz capsule and booster rocket lifted off atop 
a column of orangewhite flames 
the cosmonauts now aboard the mir alexander viktorenko and 
alexander serebrov are scheduled to return to earth on feb 19 
under president mikhail s gorbachev pressures have increased 
on the once sacrosanct soviet space program to prove its usefulness 
to the shortageplagued economy some soviet lawmakers have even 
called for funding cutbacks saying the country can ill afford 
costly space missions when it cannot supply citizens with a 
reliable supply of meat and potatoes 
the soyuz tm9 mission however is designed to to put to use 
the kristall module described by the government newspaper izvestia 
as the first orbital factory for the fullscale manufacture of 
technological and biotechnological materials in the nearweightless 
conditions on mir 
through use of kristall to be launched for linkup with mir on 
march 30 a profit of up to 41 million is expected the official 
tass news agency said it is the first time a profit has been part

us secretary of state james a baker 
iii offered romania 80 million in food aid on a brief visit to 
bucharest sunday morning but told the countrys interim leaders 
that the united states expects continued movement toward democracy 
we want to do our part to assist the transition to political 
pluralism and a free market economy baker said after meeting 
with interim president ion iliescu and premier petre roman 
baker is the highestranking american official to visit romania 
since decembers revolution which toppled communist dictator 
nicolae ceausescu 
his visit came amid controversy over the new provisional council 
of national unity which will run the country until elections on 
may 20 and includes opposition parties for the first time 
many of the 18 party leaders who met baker said they told him 
the old national salvation front council which took power during 
the revolution has kept its grip on power in the new council 
several said the front is a guise for the old communist party 
baker said he told iliescu and roman that the betterment of 
relations of the united states with romania will depend on fully 
free fair elections and the respect for human rights and the 
rights of minorities 
terming the changes since the overthrow of ceausescu a reform 
movement that clearly i think we have to applaud baker told 
reporters after meeting with the officials that his visit was 
intended to encourage the continuation of the process of reform 
its very important to the united states that the commitment 
to reform towards democracy is expressed in the conduct of fully 
free and fair elections said baker 
the us official announced the humanitarian aid package at a 
meeting with leaders of 18 parties and four unions at the residence 
of us ambassador alan green jr 
i was pleased in the meeting i had with the president and the 
prime minister to say that were prepared to make available to 
romania on highly concessionary terms 80 million in food 
assistance he said 
a state department official said the assistance would include 
500000 metric tons of feed grain and 7500 tons of butter 
asked by reporters whether the united states would restore 
romanias favorednation trade status baker said we are 
reexamining now our position just as we are reexamining it with 
respect to some other countries in eastern europe 
whether we move towards that depends on continued movement 
towards free and fair elections openness freedom and democracy 
he said 
baker said romanian officials assured him they are committed 
to fully free and fair elections 
roman said after his meeting with baker that he viewed the visit 
as the beginning of a new relationship on a new basis taking 
into account the new democracy in romania 
from now on we can speak of american aid as not just 
humanitarian i mean aid to rebuild roman added 
baker made several appearances outside the ambassadors

side the authorities efforts to remove toekes from his home in 
the western romanian city of timisoara sparked decembers

the reform effort that we see taking place in romania baker said

respecting the rights of minorities in america and the importance 
of freedom of religion

proper atmosphere for the elections 
the collective answer was that there is fear and it is a 
sustained action of fear he said

20 election date 
we told him the elections should be postponed until september 
and everybody agreed coposu said

which did not significantly change the governments position 
adrian manolache 37 president of the romanian ecology party

communist officials under ceausescu 
the front wants to lead the country to totalitarianism he 
said its not possible to have democracy without opposition

visit is very important for our people for our parties and for 
democracy because james baker promised to us help and funds for our 
electoral campaign he said baker didnt say how much help 
mr baker said that he is near the opposition and the 
parties and near democracy in romania he said 
baker also met student leaders representing the students who 
were in the forefront of the revolution 
gabriel nuta 23 a university of bucharest student representing 
the student league said he told baker to keep a tough position 
when it comes to the front 
they are just talking a lot about democracy but doing very 
little about it he said they are using stalinist 
methodsaid 
baker stopped in bucharest after a brief visit to bulgaria 
following talks in the soviet union his next stop is ottawa where 
he will attend a conference on open skies

a baby humpback whale that became caught in 
fishing nets was rescued sunday after an american marine biologist 
dived into the sea and cut the mammal loose 
fisherman abdullah khadouri spotted the 21foot dark gray whale 
trapped and dying in about 130 feet of water at the mouth of 
shutaifi bay close to muscat harbor 
fishermen alerted the coast guard who called in scientists from 
the oman marine science center 
jonathan mee 29 from san francisco who is working at the 
center managed to free the whale after a dozen dives 
once freed it swam out toward fahal island off the northern 
coast and was seen heading toward the open sea mee said 
it was still alive when i got to it initially but it was in 
great distress he told the associated press its tail was free 
but the rest of its body was caught in thick rope its eyes were 
closed very tightly and it was making whimpering noises which 
reverberated through the water 
mee said he could not tell how long the whale had been entangled 
we believe it may have been traveling with its mother before 
losing its way and becoming caught in the nets he said 
the last humpback whale sighted in oman was on christmas eve in 
1988 when three adult whales were beached off the eastern coast 
they were released and a school of dolphins led them to open sea

government troops and secessionist 
rebels battled for a fourth day sunday for ethiopias vital red sea 
port of massawa state radio said 
the sunday morning broadcast by the governmentcontrolled 
station conflicted with an earlier claim by the eritrean peoples 
liberation front that it had captured the city 
that claim was made in a broadcast saturday night by the voice 
of the broad masses of eritrea the rebels clandestine radio 
station 
the government broadcast did not directly deny the rebel claim 
but said fighting was continuing around the port one of only two 
on ethiopias red sea coast 
massawa is a key staging point for emergency food donated 
through the united nations for an estimated 4 million people facing 
famine in northern ethiopia this year 
the state radio said ethiopias army and navy were paying 
heavy sacrifices to defend the city but it gave no sources for 
its report 
ashagre yigletu deputy prime minister for social affairs said 
saturday the renewed fighting around massawa had effectively halted 
the relief effort 
the united nations hoped to ship some 700000 tons of food in 
the next few months to northern drought victims most of them in 
eritrea and neighboring tigre provinces 
most of that aid would have been delivered by ship to massawa 
although detailed plans for its distribution have not been worked 
out 
the rebels broke an almost yearlong lull in fighting in eritrea 
by launching a massive offensive thursday that clearly had the 
capture of massawa as a primary objective 
in the first three days of fighting the rebels claimed to have 
destroyed eight government brigades totaling about 12000 troops 
most of them entrenched along the 40mile road linking massawa with 
the provincial capital of asmara 
the eritrean rebel attack erupted as the government appeared to 
be containing another offensive in the far south by a separate 
insurgent group the tigre peoples liberation front 
foreign minister tesfaye dinka told diplomats in addis ababa on 
saturday that the eritrean offensive appeared aimed at taking 
pressure off the tigrean rebels 
while they do not share common goals the two insurgent groups 
have long maintained a loose alliance and have been known to 
coordinate their attacks against government forces 
the tigrean rebels launched their own offensive in late august 
sweeping south and east out of tigre into the neighboring provinces 
of wollo and gondor 
a government counteroffensive begun in january appeared to have 
halted and in some areas pushed back the tigreans southern drive 
which at one point came within 75 miles of the capital 
in what has become africas oldest war the eritreans have been 
fighting since 1961 for independence for ethiopias northernmost 
province once an italian colony 
the tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago in an attempt to 
topple president mengistu haile marian they say they want to 
replace mengistus socialist regime with a government modeled after 
that of albania the last hardline communist nation in eastern 
europe

mongolians stirred up by the soviet communists 
partys decision to relinquish its monopoly on power demanded 
mongolias communists do the same in a rally sunday that drew 
thousands of people a source said 
about 4000 to 5000 mongolians attended the threehour 
demonstration in front of the lenin museum in mongolias capital 
ulan bator said a foreign source contacted by telephone from 
beijing 
it was the fifth demonstration called by the mongolian 
democratic union founded in december by artists and intellectuals 
the rally was called late wednesday or thursday the source 
said after the soviet communist party voted to relinquish its 
decadesold hold on political power 
mongolia ruled by communists since 1921 and long a client of 
the soviet union has cautiously followed the soviet lead in 
embracing perestroika or reform but apparently not quickly 
enough for some of its citizens 
some speakers sunday called for the resignation of president 
jambyn batmonh and the politburo and criticized premier dumaagiyn 
sodnom for the nations stagnant economy 
but the speakers stressed that they were not against the party 
just opposed to its monopoly on power said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
indeed two banners showed the union working with the party to 
combat bureaucratism one depicted the union on one side of a saw 
and the party on the other side cutting down a tree representing 
the bureaucracy he said 
other banners gave a glimpse of some of the complaints and 
concerns of the mongolian people some said livestock to the 
herdsman if people are rich the state will be rich and 
is it true we are saddled by loans a reference to the soviet 
unions massive loans to mongolia put at 55 billion by some 
economists the source said 
unlike previous rallies which were dominated by union 
officials speakers sunday included a taxi driver a factory 
worker an elderly woman a coal miner and a herdsman from the 
countryside the source said many said they were members of the 
union which claims a total membership of 60000 
some speakers recounted stories of union members being fired 
from their jobs or lectured because of their political activities 
the union has called for an end to communist party influence 
over government affairs debate on setting up a multiparty system 
a fulltime parliament and investigations of past repressive 
regimes 
the source said sundays rally was peaceful with almost no 
police or military presence he said the museum apparently is not 
one of the sites where demonstrations were banned by the city 
council three weeks ago 
union spokesmen said meetings were being held in other parts of 
the country no plans were announced for future rallies but the 
union said it still planned to hold a oneday congress next sunday 
although no location has been found 
the source said the mongolian press had reported the formation 
of other political groups newspapers and other reports say a green 
party and a mongolian patriotic unity front which appears to be 
acting as a mediator between the communist party and the democratic 
union have been founded he said 
mongolia is a nation of 2 million scattered across the vast 
deserts and grasslands of eastern asia between china and the soviet 
union its economy and culture have long been dominated by the 
soviet union the russian cyrillic alphabet was officially adopted 
in 1946 and traditional mongolia script was banned until about 
five years ago

top trade negotiators from the soviet union 
and the united states sit down for the first time monday in an 
effort to begin dismantling the barriers that have prevented normal 
trade relations between the two superpowers for nearly a 
halfcentury 
us trade representative carla hills and deputy trade 
representative julius katz will be meeting with a soviet delegation 
headed by yuriy n chumakov deputy minister of foreign economic 
relations 
both sides are working under a tight deadline trying to hammer 
out a wide ranging agreement in advance of the june summit meeting 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
the administration hopes that normalizing trade relations 
between the two nations will give a boost to the soviet economy and 
lend economic support to the political reforms being undertaken by 
gorbachev 
in announcing the start of talks last week hills said the 
administrations goal was to encourage economic reform within the 
soviet union as it moves toward a more marketdriven economy 
as part of the trade agreement which would have to be approved 
by congress the united states would waive high tariffs that in 
some cases boost the duties on soviet goods by 10 times over 
tariffs imposed on similar goods from other countries 
the high tariffs have been required under a 1974 law known as 
the jacksonvanik amendment which erected the trade barriers on 
the basis that moscow was prohibiting soviet jews and other 
dissidents from leaving the country 
bush has signaled that the administration is ready to seek a 
waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment based on actions the soviets 
have taken in the past year to boost jewish emigration 
granting the lower tariffs requires completion of a trade 
agreement something bush has said he hopes to be able to sign when 
he meets in june with gorbachev 
us consumers would see lower prices for such popular items as 
soviet vodka which by one estimate could drop in price by 125 a 
bottle and for luxury items such as russian furs 
through the first 11 months of 1989 soviet imports to the 
united states totaled just 658 million far below even china 
which had imports of 1105 billion during the same time period 
us export sales to the soviet union totaled 382 billion 
through november resulting in twoway trade of 448 billion the 
administration is predicting that the trade figure could jump to 
between 10 billion and 15 billion within the next two or three 
years 
american farm groups are watching the current trade negotiations 
with keen interest threefourths of us export sales to the 
soviet union involve american farm products and the soviets 
reportedly have stated they will not approve a new grain sales 
agreement with the united states until they are granted the lower 
tariffs on their products 
many analysts however question the administrations projection 
on how much a new treaty could mean in increased trade noting that 
the soviet economy is facing severe problems at present which make 
it difficult for the country to afford imports from abroad 
i am not all that optimistic about significant increases in 
trade flows until the soviet economy is reformed said richard 
kaufman an expert on soviet affairs with the joint economic 
committee of congress the reforms that have captured world 
attention so far have all been on the political and social level 
robert cullen editor of sovietamerican trade a newsletter on 
the subject said that the trade agreement will help gorbachev more 
politically than it will boost trade between the two countries 
even with a trade agreement the fundamental barriers between 
the soviet union and america such as not having a convertible 
ruble are not going to be alleviated cullen said 
one primary area of dispute in the trade talks is expected to be 
differences over how the waiver of the jacksonvanik tariffs will 
be accomplished the administration would like a threeyear trade 
agreement with annual presidential review and waiver of the high 
tariffs 
the soviets however would like to see the tariffs removed 
permanently as a way of building confidence among business leaders 
that trade relations will remain stable in coming years 
micah naftalin national director of the union of councils for 
soviet jews said his organization favors oneyear waivers the 
country is still extraordinarily unstable and we should take it 
step by step 
the administration will come to the bargaining table seeking a 
trade agreement guaranteeing the protection of americanpatented 
products from piracy an arbitration method to settle business 
disputes and provisions to allow either country to impose temporary 
trade restrictions if a domestic industry suffers injury because of 
an unexpected surge of imports 
congress has let the administration know that it expects to be 
consulted as the negotiations progress senate finance committee 
chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas put hills on notice last week that 
such consultations will be necessary to win congressional approval 
of any deal that is negotiated

once the euphoria over nelson 
mandelas release dies down south africa will still face the 
enormous challenge of ending its centuriesold racial divisions and 
building a new nation 
black and white leaders say a major era in the countrys history 
is coming to an end with the impending demise of whiteminority 
rule but the future is foreboding they warn with many obstacles 
and the threat of conflict ahead 
south africans must peacefully solve the countrys problems and 
find a way to live together in equality after 40 years of 
apartheid leaders say but the white government and its opponents 
appear to be far apart with whites insisting on a special role in 
the future despite black objections 
now there can be no going back irreversibly south africa has 
been placed on the path to its new future the sunday times said 
in an editorial reflecting the views of a growing number of south 
africans 
while the search for peace is likely to be long and difficult 
changes that would have been unthinkable even a year or two ago are 
already taking place 
president fw de klerks decision to free mandela and end bans 
on black opposition groups after years of armed conflict stunned 
many whites and blacks he pledged to find a new dispensation 
that would end the exclusion of the countrys 28 million blacks 
from political power 
de klerk says he opposes black majority rule and that a new 
constitution must include protection for group rights to ensure 
whites are not swamped in a future democratic state the government 
says it will also retain for now such apartheid legislation as 
laws segregating residential districts 
while the government declines to outline its position in talks 
on a future constitution governing national party officials say 
they favor splitting the country into a series of racially based 
semiindependent cantons or counties 
the cantons would be united under a federation that would 
oversee economic cooperation and other national issues 
critics reject such plans as apartheid in another guise and 
the anc and other opposition groups say they will accept nothing 
less than total democracy 
mandela has indicated he will not bend on his insistence on 
equal rights we must work toward a common destiny and that can 
only be achieved through a nonracial society and not one in which 
whites continue to demand special political treatment mandela 
was quoted as saying by the south african press association 
the 5 million whites in south africa control the economy and 
there is a huge gulf between the prosperity of most whites and the 
bleak poverty of the great majority of blacks 
but while de klerk and mandela attempt to find a peaceful 
solution there are many whites and blacks who will oppose any 
compromise and insist on total power for their side alone 
many whites are unhappy about the steps de klerk has taken and 
the opposition conservative party is attempting to force an 
election to oust the government political observers say de klerks 
white support is uncertain and he has to move quickly and 
decisively 
many whites looked worried or scared as they watched cheering 
and singing blacks surging through parts of central johannesburg on 
saturday after mandelas release date was announced 
a handful of blacks taunted whites yelling freedom is coming 
whites get out a few furious whites lashed out hurling bottles 
and insults at the blacks 
an hour after mandelas motorcade reached cape town city hall 
after his release sunday riot police clashed with black youths 
and more than two dozen people were reported injured 
government leaders are worried about a violent reaction by 
extreme rightwingers and security officials are braced for 
terrorism some political analysts have raised the possibility of a 
military coup but the government insists it has the full support 
of the defense forces 
the anc and other antiapartheid groups face major divisions 
the anc is split between moderates and hardliners favoring a 
military campaign and some black groups oppose any negotiations 
with the white government 
mandela faces the challenge of trying to organize a broad 
coalition to present a united front to both the government and to 
more militant black groups mandelas task is likely to be easier 
than de klerks since many blacks regard him as their leader 
despite the enormous challenges many whites and blacks appear 
hopeful they can solve their differences peacefully and find a way 
to live together without being tied down by the past

police on sunday arrested an ultrarightist accused 
of firing several shots inside the campaign office of former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone the second attack on a japanese 
politician in less than a month 
nakasone was not in the office at the time and none of the 11 
people inside was injured police said 
the attack following the jan 18 shooting of nagasakis mayor 
heightened concern that ultrarightist groups are becoming 
increasingly violent after keeping a low profile during a year of 
mourning for the late emperor hirohito 
japanese rightsts revere the imperial family and are believed to 
be dissatisfied with nakasones and other governing liberal 
democratic party leaders links to an influencebuying scandal 
they also are unhappy with the governments willingness to hear 
debate on whether the state should fund several coronation 
ceremonies for emperor akihito 
rightist groups their vans painted in drab military colors 
were out in force sunday for a national holiday that marks the 
founding of the japanese nation 
police said koji konishi 23 entered the nakasone campaign 
office in takasaki city 60 miles northwest of tokyo and fired 
three shots at a television set a campaign poster and a doll 
symbolizing good luck 
police said konishi identified himself as a member of the 
rightist seiji kessha kokuyukai political organization for those 
concerned about the nation 
police said konishi told them he didnt intend to kill anyone 
but dislikes nakasone and wanted to create a ruckus to show the 
rest of japan how the politician had made a fool of the japanese 
people 
katsumi kobayashi a nakasone aide said he had no idea what 
konishis motive might have been and said the office had received 
no threatening phone calls or letters 
he said a rightist was arrested in tokyo last spring for 
planning an attack on nakasone who served as prime minister in 
198287 
we cannot allow free democracy free elections to be trampled 
on by such acts of violence nakasone told reporters 
nakasone who is seeking reelection to the lower house of 
parliament was delivering a speech to supporters elsewhere in the 
city when the attack occurred 
last year another member of konishis group which police say 
has fewer than 20 members and is based in tokyo severed a finger 
and sent it to thenprime minister noboru takeshita nakasones 
successor to protest dirty politicians 
police estimate the number of ultrarightists in japan at 
120000 in roughly 820 groups 
only 10 days after the official mourning period for emperor 
hirohito ended on jan 8 the mayor of nagasaki hitoshi motoshima 
was shot in the back as he was leaving city hall a member of a 
rightist group kazumi tajiri has been charged with attempted 
murder in the attack 
motoshima had received numerous death threats after saying in 
december 1988 that hirohito shared responsibility for japans

sigrid kluge says she welcomes the soviet 
green light for german reunification but she fears developments 
are moving too quickly and threaten to swallow up her country 
i want unification not colonization the young mother said 
sunday as she pushed her daughter in a stroller across east 
berlins huge alexander square 
the drive toward unification gained a boost on saturday when 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev had agreed that a decision on the issue is the sole 
right of the german people including the time frame and the 
method 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said sunday 
the soviet leadership cleared the way for german unification 
because moscow officials believe it will improve european stability 
while it is almost impossible to judge the nationwide reaction 
to the developments many east germans queried at random sunday 
were wary about the rapid pace of events in their country which 
until four months ago was under the grip of a hardline communist 
regime 
some appeared especially concerned by kohls assertion that a 
reunification plan could be presented by the end of this year 
we should wait until our economy is stronger so that we can 
have a say in forming a new germany with all the best points of 
both countries said ms kluge an office clerk 
but west germans say it is the reported nearcollapse of the 
east german economy that makes unification so pressing now 
ms kluge was worried about the possible loss of east germanys 
extensive social services the services are designed to provide 
literally cradletograve security for all citizens although the 
social safety net is unraveling 
as a single mother i dont know what id do without all the 
state child care and other benefits we have here ms kluge said 
edith puechner 52 a high school teacher from leipzig said 
things are happening too quickly for people to adapt she appeared 
concerned by kohls assertion that unification could be approved by 
the end of the year 
we have to adjust to both democracy and a new economic system 
and that takes time ms puechner said people are going to be 
shocked by unemployment many will have to be trained for jobs in 
entirely different areas 
with east germans still heading west at a rate of 1800 per day 
none of those questioned in east berlin disagreed that unification 
was inevitable the only uncertainty appeared to be how soon and on 
what terms 
some felt unification could not come soon enough 
theres no use maintaining this system any longer its time 
to just dump it said rudolf mueller a 56yearold garment 
worker most of my friends and family have left already i 
sometimes feel like the only one whos still here 
unification as fast as possible is the last chance for our 
country said hanschristian schlesinger 37 who runs his own 
business selling work clothes 
ive been struggling along for years with my business i have 
to deal with so many restrictions and complications he said 
schlesinger and his wife marita said they have attended 
meetings with visiting west germans to get advice on how to run 
private businesses 
were just starting to organize ourselves now and the general 
feeling about the future is pretty optimistic he said 
none of those interviewed favored a unified germany being part 
of nato instead all spoke out for german neutrality 
most said that only neutrality would convince neighboring 
countries they have nothing to fear from a unified germany 
they also argued against adding to either nato or the warsaw 
pact at a time when the world is moving toward disarmament 
some expressed dismay at the aggressive turn they say their 
revolution has taken 
i find this germany united fatherland business very 
dangerous said juergen ritter 50 a manager in a staterun oil 
company he was referring to a slogan frequently chanted at 
demonstrations in east germany

it was just after sunrise on day two of 
andrew youngs campaign trip for the georgia statehouse and when 
the oceanographic vessel cape hatteras docked along the savannah 
river he went aboard to shake hands 
few if any of the north carolinabased scientists on the 
research ship can vote in georgia 
but itll look great on tv 
and that was part maybe even most of the point as young 
former congressman former ambassador to the united nations former 
mayor of atlanta launched his bid to become georgias first black 
governor in a campaign stressing media savvy over race 
reporters accompanying the democrat joked about the stealth 
campaign seemingly able to slip in and out of towns without meeting 
an actual georgia voter 
but everywhere young went he was followed by his film crew 
snaring footage for the allimportant tv spots that georgia viewers 
wont see for months 
gov joe frank harris a democrat is barred by the state 
constitution from running for a third consecutive term just as 
young was barred last year from seeking his third consecutive term 
as atlanta mayor 
the consensus is that young a popular black leader facing a 
crowded field of white candidates is assured of finishing in the 
top two in the july 17 democratic primary unless someone gets more 
than half the vote the top two finishers will face each other in a 
runoff aug 7 
youngs campaign is hard at work on a barrage of campaign 
commercials hell unleash in those final weeks 
people arent paying attention yet now said frank greer 
youngs media guru watching the savannah river filming 
under the direction of greer who masterminded the media push as 
virginias doug wilder became the nations first black governor 
last fall little is left to chance and anything can be a photo 
opportunity 
the docking of the cape hatteras was more than a coincidence a 
young volunteer said the campaign had sent word to the ship and 
offered the crew an opportunity to be on tv with a real live 
political superstar 
the backdrop for the filming was a big bridge under construction 
a bridge whose funds young voted for years ago as a congressman 
from atlanta when a reporter surmised the connection he got a 
congratulatory bear hug from the ebullient greer 
in augusta a visit by young to the new river walk development 
was ignored by most of the local media a half hour of handshaking 
snared three tourists from delaware a man from virginia and a 
couple of shopkeepers 
but the crew got some great film of young and his wife jean 
nuzzling by the river 
if all this seems sort of cynical greer explained that in 1990 
in a state of 6 million people you just dont meet many voters 
down at the courthouse square 
in this day and age the way you meet voters is through the 
media greer said 
but two traditional courthouse speech stops last week showed 
that young is pretty good when he does speak to actual voters 
in the southeast georgia town of waynesboro tuesdays itinerary 
called for a meeting with local officials but when a crowd of 75 
or so greeted young he hopped up the courthouse steps and went to 
work no text no microphone just his message of new businesses 
new jobs a commitment to abortion rights and a public vote on a 
lottery 
the next day young delivered the only formal speech of the 
fourday tour to a crowd of 250 at the courthouse in thomasville 
it was a special event for young as he spoke tearfully about 
beginning his ministerial career in the small southern georgia town 
some 35 years ago 
in an interview last week while his campaign van rolled through 
eastern georgia young said he enjoys campaigning and likened his 
first statewide race to his travels organizing voting rights drives 
in the heyday of the civil rights movement 
like wilder in virginia young isnt directly mentioning the 
race question there are no emotional entreaties to white voters to 
give him a chance 
the word black very seldom comes up in the polling he 
said we dont ask racial questions and people dont raise em

hit films like ghostbusters and et the 
extraterrestrial are forbidden videos at some nursing homes that 
gave up movies rather than meet hollywoods demands they buy a 
license to pop a cassette into the vcr 
the nursing homes say they should be treated like ordinary homes 
exempt from videocassette copyright restrictions when residents 
gather in a common living area to watch a movie 
when people come to a nursing home or a retirement home it is 
for life and it is their home said stella muller leisure 
director for marquette manor in indianapolis we dont see why we 
cant have a gathering in the front parlor and show a movie 
hollywood takes a different view 
the motion picture industry lumps nursing homes in the same 
category as libraries colleges churches prisons oil rigs and 
other institutions that show home videos to groups of people 
such organizations are required to buy a public performance 
license as do movie theaters for each copyright video they show 
or they can purchase an annual umbrella license giving them the 
right to show unlimited videos from certain studios 
nursing home officials say a typical fee would be 365 per bed 
per year or 730 for a home with 200 residents 
the nursing homes are backing legislation pending in the house 
and senate that would allow unlicensed public viewing of videos in 
a hospital hospice nursing home or other group home providing 
health or healthrelated care and services to individuals on a 
regular basis as long as the facilities do not charge for the 
viewing or further retransmit the material 
sen william roth rdel first introduced the legislation in 
1988 after receiving a letter from 10 elderly residents of emily p 
bissell hospital a staterun nursing home in wilmington del 
it is not our choice that we are here but we are and our 
lives are now changed in many many ways the residents wrote 
if the staff could show us some of the movies available on 
videocassette it would certainly bring us a lot of pleasure 
barbara dixon of the motion picture association of america 
which represents major hollywood production companies and 
distributors said mpaa is working with congressional staff to find 
a compromise that would address nursing home concerns without 
setting a precedent that we might come to regret later on 
if a movies shown in an individual room that is probably 
not a violation of the copyright law but if its shown in a public 
accommodation area where it can be viewed by large numbers of 
people then you run into a legitimate concern she said in an 
interview last week 
the legislation would exempt health care facilities under the 
home use exception contained in copyright licensing laws as is 
noncommercial viewing of films or videos in individual residences 
the measure is supported by the american association of homes 
for the aging aaha the american health care association the 
national association of activity professionals and other groups 
representing the elderly 
residents should be able to view these films in their 
residences or homes the same way all of us watch films with our own 
families in our own living rooms aaha which represents 
nonprofit nursing homes said in a recent legislative alert to its 
members 
because of the licensing dispute some nursing homes no longer 
have movie nights show only classics on which the copyrights have 
expired or encourage residents to rent their own videos to watch in 
their bedrooms some have purchased umbrella licenses while others 
ignore the copyright restrictions and hope they dont get caught 
officials said 
the licensing push took off in 1986 when the motion picture 
licensing corp based in stamford conn was created by three 
veterans of the movie business to sell public performance licenses 
to various organizations 
company chairman peter kuyper said the firm is involved in 
discussions aimed at resolving the licensing dispute without 
legislation but he declined to comment further 
the companys promotional literature says fees vary depending on 
the nature and size of the expected audience and how often movies 
are to be shown

servant of you the people 
within an hour of the release as mandelas motorcade arrived at

riot police fired shotguns after groups of black youths smashed 
shop windows in the city center

hundreds of terrified people waiting to hear mandela ran for cover 
as police fired blasts of shotgun pellets 
clashes between police and celebrating blacks were reported in 
at least two other areas while in johannesburg thousands of young 
blacks received an escort from traffic police as they ran 
triumphantly through the city columns of cheering activists jogged 
through durban and other cities 
we have waited too long for our freedom mandela told the 
crowd he said that until the proper climate was created for 
peaceful negotiations the armed struggle was still a policy of the 
anc 
the factors that caused the need for armed struggle 
exist today mandela said we have no options but to continue 
we express the hope that a climate conducive to a negotiated 
settlement would be created 
mandela spoke of my long and lonely years in prison 
i am content that your pain and suffering was far greater than 
my own he said adding that he would make further statements 
after consulting his anc comrades 
there must be an end to white monopoloy of political power and 
a fundamental restructureing of our political and economic systems 
to ensure that the inequalities of apartheid are addressed he 
said 
the anc leader called president fw de klerk a man of 
integrity and called on the white community to join us in the 
safety of a new south africa the freedom movement is a political 
home for you too 
mandela jailed since 1962 for helping plan the african national 
congress antigovernment guerrilla campaign was greeted by a 
thunderous cheer when he and his wife winnie walked hand in hand 
through the gateway of victor verster prison in paarl 35 miles 
from cape town 
the mandelas gave clenchedfist salutes to the hundreds of 
supporters who had waited for hours outside many of them waving 
green gold and black anc flags 
mandela dressed in a dark suit and tie appeared solemn and 
dignified as he and his wife walked to a white bmw sedan and 
climbed in he broke into a broad smile as the car set off slowly 
toward cape town in a policeescorted motorcade 
scores of policemen stood guard in the bright sunshine and a 
small army of photographers and television crews from across the 
world frenetically took the first pictures of mandela as a free man 
im too much happy said nelson dlula a black teenager in 
the crowd he wore a khaki outfit decorated with the ancs green 
gold and black colors 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp gave live 
television coverage to the release 
this is the moment the world has been waiting for said the 
television reporter at the scene the sun is shining on south 
africa 
mandelas speech was delayed an hour by the violence as the 
clashes erupted some antiapartheid leaders told the crowd to 
disperse but many remained to hear mandelas voice for the first 
time in nearly three decades army units equipped with tear gas 
were deployed nearby and police helicopters flew overhead 
your tireless and heroic sacrfices have made it possible for 
me to be here today the 71yearold mandela told the adoring 
crowd i therefore place the remaining years of my life in your 
hands 
dr aslam dasoo tending the injured at a first aid station 
said about 100 people had been hurt and journalists counted 130 
injuries there was no immediate statement from police 
in johannesburg hundreds of young blacks joined by a few 
whites ran through downtown streets shooting viva anc after 
the release traffic police patrol cars cleared the way for them 
in soweto the sprawling black township outside johannesburg 
where mandela has his home crowds of supporters danced and sang in 
celebration many under umbrellas because of a steady rain 
there were unconfirmed reports that three celebrating blacks in 
the tribal homeland of ciskei were shot dead by police in inanda 
a black township outside durban a local journalist said she saw 
one black killed and five injured when police fired at a 
celebration 
the decision to free mandela was announced saturday by president 
fw de klerk who had met mandela the previous night he described 
the black leader as committed to a peaceful solution 
de klerk who lifted a 30year ban on the anc on feb 2 
expressed hope that mandelas release would lead to racial 
reconciliation 
mandela has offered to serve as mediator in arranging talks 
between the government and the anc on a postapartheid constitution 
that would give voting rights to the black majority 
mandela had been serving a life sentence after he was convicted 
of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whiteled government for 
18 years of his imprisonment he was held on robben island in cape 
towns harbor where he endured substandard food deprivation of 
news and reading material and hard labor that included gathering 
seaweed and smashing stones 
many south african blacks consider him their paramount leader 
and he would be a favorite to win the presidency if blacks were 
allowed to vote 
under south african apartheid the nations black majority has 
no voice in national affairs 
mandelas freedom has been a longstanding demand of black 
leaders in south africa as well as governments and human rights 
groups abroad 
de klerk in his speech feb 2 lifted bans and restrictions on 
the anc and other opposition groups scrapped some 
stateofemergency regulations declared a moratorium on hangings 
and promised to free mandela unconditionally 
these concessions met most but not all of the ancs conditions 
for negotiations the organization and mandela also have demanded 
freedom for all political prisoners and an end to the state of 
emergency

free mandela in exchange for a public renunciation of violence but 
mandela refused

the hundreds of foreign 
journalists who swarmed into south africa to cover the release of 
nelson mandela have been getting almost as much attention as the 
black leader 
local reaction to the media invasion has ranged from allegations 
that visiting correspondents organized antigovernment protests to 
claims that overseas publications offering millions of dollars for 
exclusive pictures of mandela 
the south african broadcasting corporation the staterun 
network said sunday that more than 2000 journalists converged on 
south africa for the release 
journalists from north america europe and asia had spent weeks 
waiting for mandela to be set free a succession of false alarms 
over the past few weeks often sent camera crews scuttling to victor 
verster prison outside cape town mandela finally walked out of the 
prison sunday after 27 years in custody in various jails 
the local press has mixed its own coverage on mandela with often 
lurid accounts of the activities of overseas colleagues 
south african newspapers have run long reports claiming that 
american news companies have been offering millions of dollars for 
exclusive rights to the first picture of mandela or the first 
exclusive interview none of the reports has been confirmed 
some local media reports last week claimed foreign journalists 
helped organize black protesters at a violent protest in 
johannesburg south african and foreign correspondents on the scene 
denied the claims but police said they were investigating 
rightwing extremists flooded radio talk shows in johannesburg 
with claims that foreign journalists concocted false pictures of 
street violence to create the impression of widespread unrest 
these foreign journalists are trying to destroy our country 
said one angry caller 
competition between the press for stories and facilities has 
sometimes been more frenzied than the quest for stories 
the area around mandelas modest home in the black township of 
soweto outside johannesburg has sprouted in recent weeks with extra 
telephone lines antennae and waiting camera crews 
top hotels in johannesburg and cape town have been booked solid 
by the foreign press rental companies say their vehicles and 
planes have been rented for weeks and communications out of cape 
town have at times been overwhelmed by the deluge of media phone 
calls and broadcasts 
its great were making a fortune said a delighted 
employee at a johannesburg car rental firm he refused to give his 
name

one of the wests bestknown editorial 
cartoonists has some simple advice for public figures who want to 
avoid being ridiculed by him on editorial pages across the country 
drop dead 
as far as nationally syndicated cartoonist steve benson is 
concerned dying is the best way public figures can expect a fair 
shake from his cartoons which appear in nearly 200 newspapers 
across the nation 
benson says the job of cartoonists is to catalyze discussion 
some credit cartoons he drew for the arizona republic as a factor 
in the impeachment of former arizona gov evan mecham 
we skewer people we ridicule issues we make fun of countries 
where we have never been we never let a fact get in the way of a 
good cartoon he said but in the end we get a lot closer to 
the truth then most people 
what we do is get people to think we are conservatives at 
heart we are trying to protect america and our communities from 
abuses by those in power

rival christian forces battled in 
beiruts raindrenched alleys and the mountains northeast of the 
capital sunday while civilians dodged bullets to reach the moslem 
sector to buy goods for their trapped families 
troops of rebel gen michel aoun and the rival lebanese forces 
militia ignored two calls for a ceasefire in their 13dayold 
battle for control of the christian enclave north of beirut 
it is the bloodiest fighting between christian forces since the 
civil war between lebanons moslems and christians erupted in 1975 
police said at least eight people were killed and 17 wounded in 
the latest violence aouns headquarters reported 12 soldiers and 
four officers wounded 
since the fighting broke out jan 30 at least 457 people have 
died 
shellbattered hospitals packed with casualties appealed over 
the radio for blood plasma oxygen and water 
in some districts of christian east beirut the stench of death 
hung in streets where decomposing bodies have lain for days civil 
defense teams have not been able to remove them because of sniper 
fire 
hundreds of frightened civilians dodged sniper fire and sprinted 
across the citys dividing green line many risked their lives to 
buy bread and drinking water for their families who were trapped in 
underground shelters 
others who made it across the 3milelong demarcation line 
stayed in the the syrianpoliced moslem sector outside the combat 
zone 
police said about 25000 christians have crossed into west 
beirut in the last three days 
nearly 50000 other christians have in recent days fled the 
enclave over the mountains that run down its eastern flank police 
reported 
five months ago the christians were being slaughtered by syrian 
shellfire in a sixmonth battle between aouns troops and the 
syrian army which he considers an occupation force 
its very ironic said simon hajjar after darting across the 
green line were fleeing to the syrians from christian leaders 
battling each other under the slogan of ridding lebanon of syrian 
occupation 
as he spoke gunfire and shell blasts boomed in east beiruts 
ashrafiyeh residential district and the workingclass quarter of 
ein rummaneh both lebanese forces strongholds that border the 
green line 
police said aouns troops and the militiamen of samir geagea 
fought all night in pouring rain in the narrow alleyways of the two 
districts neither side apparently made any significant territorial 
gains 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing 
regulations said shelling duels were raging in the snowcapped 
mountains of kesrouan a maronite catholic province 
mediators representing patriarch nasrallah sfeir the maronites 
spiritual leader called a ceasefire for 6 pm and another for 11 
pm saturday but there was no stop to the fighting 
on saturday aouns troops drove the lebanese forces out of the 
key highway town of kleiat 
both aoun and geagea are maronites the main christian sect that 
has dominated power in lebanon since independence from france in 
1943 
the push by aouns 19000 troops into kesrouan underlined the 
generals determination to crush geageas militia which has 6000 
hardcore fighters and thousands more reservists 
it is the only force challenging his authority in the 
310squaremile christian enclave where an estimated 1 million 
people live 
although both aoun and geagea are at odds with syria they 
differ over a peace plan sponsored by the arab league to end the

the states powerful education 
policysetting board meets this week to discuss a report which 
contends that much of what new york schoolchildren learn is based 
on hidden assumptions of white supremacy 
the state board of regents on friday will take up the taskforce 
report titled a curriculum of inclusion the latest flashpoint 
in a national debate over whether whats taught in schools is 
racially fair 
more than half the panel named by state education commissioner 
thomas sobol are educators and its 17 members were black 
hispanic asian american indian and one white it was headed by 
state naacp chairwoman hazel dukes 
its report concludes that new yorks history courses 
overemphasize the contributions of white europeans minimize the 
accomplishments of minorities and largely ignore wrongs committed 
by whites against others 
the task force called on the state to change the way it teaches 
history and other subjects to include more about the contributions 
of nonwhites 
were saying that the curriculum should be revised to reflect 
accurately all contributions so that everybody knows where we as a 
nation came from said meteorology professor harry hamilton 
author of the report who teaches at the state university of new 
york at albany 
he said the report is intended to promote better understanding 
between cultures but its critics say new york education leaders 
should be more concerned about disintegrating schools high dropout 
rates and drug addiction 
if schools spend their resources fretting over the worth of 
western culture its likely that children will be more woefully 
unknowledgeable in the basics than they already are the wall 
street journal editorialized recently 
the controversy has come east from stanford university where 
complaints that a required freshman course on western culture 
furthered sexual and racial stereotypes led to the inclusion of 
more study of nonwestern cultures 
the new york report released last summer said most attempts to 
talk about nonwhite cultural contributions were appendages to 
school curriculum 
in most history courses white european culture is likened to 
the master of a house ruling over a dinner table who has 
invited the others through his beneficence 
the absence of positive references to nonwhites has a 
terribly damaging effect on the psyche of young blacks 
hispanics asians and indians the report said 
columnist george will called the report affirmative action run 
amok he said its authors sought to ignore the central role 
european culture has had in shaping american institutions 
i think the report should be thrown away said diane 
ravitch a history professor at columbia universitys teachers 
college and a consultant who reviewed the report for sobol 
she says the panels argument logically extends to distorting 
history into a kind of feelgood study and thats not the purpose 
of history 
among its examples of bias the task force cited the lack of 
discussion of the role of black soldiers in the revolutionary war 
it said the mexican war more properly should be the less 
ethnocentric mexicanamerican war 
the report also said a socialstudies curriculum that pictures 
on its cover a white family with several generations and a black 
family with a single parent sends a subtle message about family 
structures 
ravitch said thats not bias in fact she said the report 
couldnt cite any real examples of bias in the state curriculum at 
all 
it is a temper tantrum ravitch said of the report i met 
with members of the task force and they were very angry people i 
think some of that anger spilled out in this report 
sobol said some of the reports rhetoric was 
counterproductive but agreed that textbooks dont tell enough 
about the history of different racial groups and when they do its 
from a white perspective 
hes recommending the regents appoint a racially balanced panel 
of scholars to write a new curriculum emphasizing cultural 
diversity he also wants a permanent advisory panel to monitor the 
curriculum for signs of bias 
its not just that we should have more black history for black 
kids and more hispanic history for hispanic kids he said all 
of our kids should know more about all the rest of our kids 
otherwise they dont connect

nato and warsaw pact negotiators begin talks 
monday on opening their skies to surveillance flights now that 
political developments in the soviet bloc have reduced cold war 
tensions 
the proposal to be considered at the threeweek open skies 
conference would allow the alliances to fly unarmed aircraft over 
each others territory to monitor military installations and 
compliance with arms agreements 
the 16 members of nato and the seven warsaw pact countries 
already have agreed in principle to implement the idea resurrected 
in the spring of 1989 by president bush from a proposal first put 
forth in the 1950s 
since bush made the proposal to build good will and trust 
hardline communist governments have fallen throughout eastern 
europe hungary czechoslovakia and poland already have begun to 
scale back their armies and demand moscow withdraw tens of 
thousands of red army troops from their soil 
east germany bulgaria and romania are likely to follow suit 
while the soviet union has proposed further troop and arms cuts and 
publicly switched its military doctrine from an offensive to a 
defensive stance 
when open skies was proposed a year ago the world was a 
different place said paul stares a research associate at the 
brookings institute a nonpartisan think tank in washington our 
suspicions have dropped dramatically and people are wondering if 
peace and love have really broken out what do we need these 
treaties for 
a year ago everyone thought open skies was a swell idea 
said james blackwell deputy director of politicalmilitary studies 
at the center for strategic and international studies in 
washington now everybody thinks it would be really useful and 
possible 
civilian or military aircraft would be allowed to fly over the 
united states soviet union canada and nato and east bloc states 
of europe larger countries would allow several flights a month 
the duration of the flights would be limited and planes would 
be open to inspection before and after the flights negotiators 
must work out quotas flight routes and other details 
some question remain whether such an agreement would be worth 
the effort 
the united states and soviet union each have satellites capable 
of detailed ground monitoring even at night and through clouds 
and the talks are not directly connected to any arms or troop 
cut negotiations which likely would include their own verification 
provisions 
officials however believe flights would be more flexible for 
monitoring than satellites which are restricted to certain orbits 
such flights also would benefit countries that do not have 
surveillance satellites 
blackwell said any open skies agreement would make the 
verification task much easier he said monitoring of the 
disarmament treaties now being discussed would require hundreds 
of thousands of people across europe 
we would need as many soldiers to monitor the talks as we plan 
to withdraw he said 
stares said some duplication of monitoring might result but that 
such flights would be the best way to monitor compliance within the 
united states and east of the ural mountains in the soviet union 
stares emphasized that an agreement would codify the principle 
that everybody talks about for greater transparency in world 
affairs he added as a general principle to lower our 
uncertainty i think its a good thing an open skies 
agreement also could set a precedent for flights over other trouble 
spots in the world such as the middle east or for monitoring 
countries suspected of violating pollution controls stares said 
the first round of talks in ottawa will last three weeks 
foreign ministers from the north atlantic treaty organization 
and the warsaw pact will attend only the first three days 
a second round is planned in april in budapest hungary 
nato officials have said they would like an agreement quickly 
hopefully by the middle of the year the warsaw pact has not stated 
a formal position

two cosmonauts took president mikhail s 
gorbachevs drive for economic efficiency to new heights sunday 
blasting off on the soviet unions first space mission designed to 
turn a profit 
riding a soyuz tm9 capsule flight commander anatoly solovyov 
42 and engineer alexander balandin 36 soared atop a column of 
orangewhite flames into cloudstreaked skies over the baikonur 
space complex in soviet kazakhstan at 916 am 
their onschedule launch was televised live and for the first 
time four active us astronauts were invited to the formerly 
topsecret spaceport on the steppes of central asia to watch it 
they were dan brandenstein head of nasas astronaut office and 
commander of the 11day january mission of the space shuttle 
columbia and paul weitz ron grabe and jerry ross 
the americans presence was additional proof of how gorbachevs 
leadership has led to more openness and a rollback of the obsessive 
secrecy that once cloaked soviet space ventures 
solovyov who led a joint sovietbulgarian mission in 1988 and 
space rookie balandin were to link up with the mir orbital platform 
on tuesday they will relieve two fellow soviets alexander 
viktorenko and alexander serebrov who were launched sept 5 and 
are in their sixth month in orbit 
under gorbachev pressures have increased on the countrys once 
sacrosanct space program to prove its usefulness to the 
shortageplagued economy some lawmakers have even demanded big 
funding cuts saying the nation cannot afford costly space missions 
when it cannot guarantee citizens a reliable supply of meat and 
potatoes 
however the sixmonth mission undertaken by solovyov and 
balandin has been noisily billed by staterun media as a 
moneymaker the spacemen are to put to use the new kristall module 
described by the government daily izvestia as the first 
minifactory for the manufacture of technological and 
biotechnological materials in zerogravity conditions 
through use of kristall which is to be shot into orbit march 30 
for linkup with mir up to 41 million of profit are forecast the 
official tass news agency said for the first time in soviet 
cosmonautics incomes from the flight are expected to exceed by far 
spending on the spaceships launch it proclaimed 
the cosmonauts will melt crystals and exploit conditions of 
weightlessness to manufacture superpure semiconductor materials 
for science and technology tass said factories that placed 
their orders with the cosmonauts are waiting impatiently to put 
them to use it added 
other moneymaking ventures for the cosmonauts are 
bioengineering experiments and photographing the earths surface 
part of the bioengineering program was developed with the help of 
us scientists tass said adding it showed how superpower 
cooperation in space is growing 
while there was no way to audit the huge profits claimed for the 
soyuz tm9 mission by tass the accent on profitability was in 
keeping with the new realities the soviet space program is 
experiencing under gorbachev 
when viktorenko and serebrov were launched in september their 
threestage booster rocket was festooned with an advertisement 
bought by generali an italian insurance company and ads for a 
soviet electronics firm and new dawn perfume a soviet scent 
were prominently displayed at the launch pad 
likewise the soviets opened up another oncesecret spaceport 
plesetsk to foreigners in september courting clients from west 
germany france and other western countries by offering cutrate 
prices to place payloads in orbit 
however the mission that began sunday was the first under the 
shift of soviet space research to the profitandloss 
accounting system imposed by the kremlin on factories and farms 
tass said space missions used to be paid for from a central fund 
but the soyuz tm9 mission is financed by staterun enterprises and 
organizations that seek some benefit from it for example by 
testing technology or conducting experiments tass said 
the soviet space shuttle buran launched on its maiden unmanned 
mission in november 1988 has drawn the most fire from soviet space 
critics with even roald z sagdeev former chief of the countrys 
space program calling it a multibillionruble boondoggle built for 
no good reason 
but even the mir launched in 1986 as the chief building block 
of a soviet space station has been caught in the economy drive 
the mir originally designed to be permanently manned remained 
empty for four months in 1989 to cut costs and give soviet 
scientists time to prepare modules like kristall to be launched and 
bolted to it 
alexei leonov deputy chief of the cosmonauts training center 
told tass this saved 25 million but admitted some people question 
that sum thus also casting doubt on how the fabulous profits for 
the mission that began sunday were figured 
viktorenko and serebrov are to return to earth feb 19 during 
their mission on mir they tested a space motorcycle designed 
to recover satellites or recover spacemen in distress

five million iranians thronged tehrans 
snowcovered freedom square on sunday to mark the islamic 
revolutions 11th anniversary speakers urged them to continue 
their fight against the united states 
leaders had worried that the anniversary celebration the first 
since ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death in june would be poorly 
attended 
but tehran television monitored in nicosia said people in the 
massive crowd carried portraits of khomeini who launched the 
revolution and banners pledging allegiance to his successor 
ayatollah ali khamenei 
khomeini known as the imam returned in triumph to tehran on 
feb1 1979 after shah mohammad reza pahlavi left the country ten 
days later the shahs government collapsed and the islamic 
republic was proclaimed 
the television said the crowds began massing in azadi or 
freedom square on the capitals western outskirts soon after dawn 
even though temperatures had not climbed above zero the report 
showed aerial shots of a wave of people converging on the square 
and footage of crowds chanting death to america 
the official islamic republic news agency said the square and 
surrounding streets were so packed that it was difficult to move 
even a few inches 
during the festivities khamenei declared a conditional amnesty 
for all prisoners to celebrate the anniversary the television 
said but it did not say how many prisoners were included or under 
what conditions 
iranian officials fearful khomeinis death might have dampened 
the revolutionary zeal of the people had urged iranians to join 
sundays rally 
president hashemi rafsanjani addressing the crowd thanked them 
for turning out 
this sea of united informed and righteous people who today 
have packed this square on the first anniversary of the revolution 
without our great imam is the best and most telling demonstration 
of the strength of the revolution and the commitment of the 
people to abide by the teachings of the imam he was quoted as 
saying 
reasserting khomeinis vehemently antiamerican stand ayatollah 
ahmad jannati said this people will never abandon their fight 
against the united states and are determined to continue 
treading the late imams path according to irna 
jannati heads the islamic propagation organization which 
publishes and distributes books periodicals and other material 
promoting the iranian revolution abroad 
criticizing the united states which strongly supported the 
shah became a cornerstone of the islamic revolution 
the antiamerican feelings among khomeinis followers boiled 
over when iranian militants stormed the us embassy in tehran in 
november 1979 and held 52 americans hostage for 444 days relations 
have been broken ever since 
although pragmatic leaders such as rafsanjani have been working 
to improve irans radical image to attract western investment and 
technology spritual leaders have held fast to khomeinis legacy 
exporting the islamic revolution abroad one of khomeinis main 
goals failed during irans eightyear war with iraq most arab 
nations ruled by sunni moslems distrust the shiite moslem clergy 
running persian iran 
iran did however win many followers among the more than 1 
million shiites in lebanon where irans partisans of hezbollah or 
party of god are battling the syrianbacked amal movement shiite 
moslem extremists loyal to iran are holding 18 western hostages in 
lebanon including eight americans 
the longest held is terry a anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 
1985

young west german men begin 
cruising into this east german border town early in the evening 
seeking romance in a land where the sight of a bmw can win smiles 
from young women but snarls from local males 
the opening of the german border did not only change history it 
has changed mating rituals as well 
the guys from over there west germany are a lot less 
inhibited than the ones over here said conni 18 who lives in 
saalfeld and these cars they have theyre just incredible 
west german visitors have been flooding into east germany by the 
tens of thousands since the borders were opened last year 
many are tourists coming to see famous sights like the elegant 
sans souci palace of friedrich the great in potsdam the historic 
city of weimar or the lakes and haunting forest areas near the 
polish border 
many west germans also load up their mercedes and bmws to go 
visit their poorer trabantdriving relatives to the east 
the open borders have opened up new romantic possibilities as 
well 
one prestigious west german newspaper die zeit called the 
phenomenon reunification of the flesh 
from schwerin in the north to plauen in the south young west 
germans in their flashy bmws sleek mercedes and soupedup audis 
cruise into east german communities there have been numerous 
reports of east german women giving up everything at home and 
running off with the west german men 
but not every crossborder foray is a success 
guenter kantzner and three friends drove an audi gt from their 
bavarian village across the border to saalfeld late one friday 
night 
some guys think when they come over here theyll be treated 
like kings said kantzner standing in front of a bar rumored to 
offer good chances for meeting young east german women 
for kantzner and his friends however the first visit to 
saalfeld was a decided letdown 
there wasnt a single unescorted woman in the saalfeld bar in 
fact there were only about 10 people there after about 30 
uneventful minutes kantzner and his friends went back to bavaria 
some east german men get annoyed by the invasion of the 
wessies with their flashy automobiles 
but henrich viebach a 17yearold saalfelder opts for a more 
philosophical view 
i know a number of girls who went over to the west after 
meeting boys from over there said viebach but i dont see 
anything wrong with it if i were in their shoes id do the same 
thing 
the crossborder traffic has raised fears that west germanys 
aids and drugs problems will take root and flourish in east germany 
never has a border stopped a virus it always comes through 
said niels soennichsen an aids adviser for the east german 
government after the borders were opened last november 
some saalfeld residents say theyve heard of drugs showing up on 
their side of the border but west german border guards and east 
german customs officials in the area insist that so far there have 
been no problems 
the continuous flow of west german cars into east germany proves 
the tourists must be enjoying themselves 
east germany still lacks the often gaudy commercialism of the 
west and parts of the country have retained the rustic beauty that 
used to be germanys trademark

california democrats are waging a 
bruising primary campaign for governor this year while republicans 
have united behind a moderate lowprofile senator who just a 
decade ago was a reviled party outcast 
the three candidates for governor in the june 5 primary are 
republican pete wilson who served 11 years as mayor of san diego 
before his 1982 election to the us senate and democrats dianne 
feinstein the former mayor of san francisco and state attorney 
general john van de kamp 
republican gov george deukmejian is retiring after two terms 
the major issues so far in the race include abortion ethics 
the death penalty education and managing the problems spawned by 
californias explosive growth 
wilson formally kicked off his campaign sunday with a series of 
toughtalking anticrime speeches in which he stressed his support 
of the death penalty and proposed a nobail policy for accused drug 
kingpins 
i am outraged that 12 years after the people of california 
made it the law of the state the death penalty has not been 
enforced he said he also called for limits on appeals in death 
penalty cases 
abortion is an unlikely issue for this race since all three 
candidates are prochoice but some odd twists have brought it into 
the campaign 
one is van de kamps contention that a victimsrights 
initiative supported by wilson and feinstein inadvertently would 
repeal privacy laws which are the foundation of key prochoice 
court rulings 
another is feinsteins assertion that while men may support 
womens rights on abortion a prochoice woman will never 
compromise on that issue 
all three candidates stress similar qualityoflife themes 
covering all of the problems caused by californias population 
growth from crowded schools and traffic gridlock to overloaded 
waste disposal systems and other environmental concerns 
all three are cautious experienced politicians and they all 
come frlom affluent influential families 
wilsons father was an executive for a large advertising agency 
feinsteins was a san francisco surgeon and van de kamps family 
name is on one of southern californias best known bakery chains as 
well as a frozen food label 
but any similarities have been overshadowed by the intensity 
with which each has magnified narrow differences or attacked the 
others records 
feinstein who trails substantially in the polls and 
fundraising has received the least criticism but her nineyear 
record as mayor of san francisco has been attacked because of the 
179 million deficit she left her successor 
wilson and van de kamp both have been tarnished by their 
peripheral roles in the collapse of lincoln savings and loan 
association wilson for accepting 16500 in contributions from 
lincoln president charles keating and van de kamp for allegedly 
letting his justice department block another state agencys order 
to halt lincolns sale of what later proved to be worthless bonds 
van de kamp has also criticized wilson for the speaking 
honorariums he has accepted as a senator while feinstein and 
wilson have hammered at van de kamps failure while los angeles 
district attorney to prosecute a suspect later convicted in the 
hillside strangler murder case 
beyond the flurry of charges other anomalies abound in the race 
wilson 56 arrived at the enviable position of being unopposed 
in the republican primary by an unlikely route that involved luck 
and deft political maneuvering 
since he entered politics in 1967 in the state assembly wilson 
has been distrusted by conservatives for his aggressive advocacy of 
growthmanagement and environmentalprotection policies and his 
moderate stands on social issues 
wilson almost alone among california republicans opposed 
ronald reagans 1976 campaign for president and went to new 
hampshire on behalf of thenpresident ford to contradict reagans 
account of his governorship 
reagan narrowly lost new hampshires leadoff primary and later 
lost the nomination by a handful of delegates and many california 
republicans blamed wilson 
in 1978 wilson ran for the republican nomination for governor 
finishing a dismal fourth with only 9 percent of the vote 
his endorsement of reagan in 1980 took some of the edge off the 
conservative animosity and wilson became the surprise winner of 
the 1982 republican primary for us senate when the campaign of 
the conservative frontrunner barry goldwater jr collapsed 
leaving conservatives to choose between wilson and a gop moderate 
they disliked even more thenrep pete mccloskey 
wilson was again the noneoftheabove alternative in the 
general election facing outgoing democratic gov jerry brown as 
browns popularity was at its nadir 
but wilson won reelection on his own in 1988 building a 
moderate record in tune with californias political mainstream 
only two small organized groups upset about wilsons gayrights 
and abortion stands have publicly opposed him and their attempt 
to draft former baseball commissioner peter ueberroth to run 
against wilson fizzled 
although van de kamp 54 is californias chief prosecutor he 
is the only opponent of the death penalty in the race putting him 
at odds with 80 percent of californias voters 
feinstein 56 has the highest nationwide name identification 
and the most charismatic presence of the three candidates but 
until recent months she has never been active in democratic party 
affairs outside of san francisco and is only beginning to build a 
statewide network of supporters

over 100000 liberians have fled to 
neighboring countries in recent weeks to escape an army campaign to 
put down a libyanbacked rebellion according to us officials 
some official estimates say as many as 140000 have left the 
west african country with a majority going to ivory coast and the 
remainder to guinea 
one us official attributed the exodus to excesses by both 
government forces and the rebels but andrew natsios director of 
the us office of foreign disaster assistance said the army was 
chiefly responsible 
the behavior of the army has been very disturbing natsios 
said in an interview last week it is primarily the army that is 
causing the movement of people 
he called the army a major cause of human rights abuses 
one official citing the testimony of refugees said army troops 
are arresting all young men in the conflict area and some are being 
shot 
but another us official who like the first spoke only on 
condition of anonymity said the flight of the liberians was based 
more on rumors of danger than on actual abuses 
the state department said at the end of january that us 
military officers acting at the request of liberian officials had 
stepped in to stop abuses by the government troops 
liberia a nation of less than 2 million population was founded 
a century and half ago by freed american slaves 
the united states and liberia historically have had close ties 
but the relationship over the past decade has been strained because 
of repeated allegations of rights abuses and corruption by the 
government of president samuel k doe 
liberian authorities said rebel troops fighting does government 
killed about 200 people since the fighting began in the eastern 
part of the country on dec 24 
africa watch a usbased human rights group said government 
forces killed at least 200 civilians while searching the 
countryside for rebels 
western diplomats in the ivory coast capital of abidjan said 
last week government troops had killed 500 civilians since the 
fighting began 
us officials insisted that libya was behind the rebellion but 
they gave no details about that countrys precise role the 
officials said libyan leader moammar gadhafi has backed 
insurrections in about a dozen countries in subsaharan africa 
according to natsios the plight of the liberians who fled has 
been made easier by the welcome they have received in the ivory 
coast and guinea by their tribal kinfolk most liberian army 
officers are from a different tribe 
the us ambassadors in all three countries have released a 
total of 75000 for emergency needs but natsios reported that the 
refugees generally are in good shape he estimated the number of 
displaced persons inside liberia at between 2000 and 3000 
the romebased world food program announced last week it is 
giving 910000 worth of food to liberian refugees outside the 
country 
in addition the state department may send a team of experts to 
the region to assess conditions

president lee tenghu was unanimously 
endorsed sunday by the governing nationalist party as its 
presidential candidate virtually assuring him of a sixyearterm 
lees choice of a top personal aide as vice presidential nominee 
also received the backing of the party although it angered many 
elderly conservatives who would have preferred the post go to 
chiang wego son of the late nationalist leader chiang kaishek 
the 74yearold chiang wego an army general is 
secretarygeneral of the national security council 
all 180 members of the nationalist partys central committee 
stood up to approve lee the 66yearold former vice president who 
succeeded president chiang chingkuo when he died in office in 
january 1988 
his tenure as president has been marked by policies designed to 
strike a balance between the conservative old guard of the party 
and an increasingly restless population clamoring for more freedom 
the national assembly or electoral college is expected to 
approve lees nomination at a meeting march 20 
the committee later unanimously supported lees candidate for 
vice president li yuanzu a former justice minister who is now 
secretarygeneral to the president 
although lee was assured of the nomination there was intense 
speculation over whom he would propose for vice president aging 
conservatives and younger reformers who have differed widely over 
the pace of democratic change lobbied hard to influence the 
decision 
lee 66 the first native taiwanese to head the party and 
government appeared to be staking out his independence with the 
nomination of li 
in a speech to the convention lee tried to reassure both the 
old guard and reformers that he had their interests at heart 
he urged convention delegates to unite and continue the 
democratization process initiated by chiang chingkuo who in 1987 
lifted martial law that was first imposed by his father chiang 
kaishek 38 years earlier 
we are facing rising demands from the public and keen 
competition from the opposition party lee said we need to 
review related constitutional problems so we can create more room 
for further progress 
the nationalist party lost several key local seats in taiwans 
first multiparty general elections in december as the public vented 
displeasure at the slow pace of reforms to dismantle a political 
system that perpetuates nationalist rule 
lee also reasserted the partys commitment to seek reunification 
with china a demand of the old guard politicians who fled to 
taiwan with chiang kaishek in 1949 after losing a civil war to 
communist forces on the chinese mainland 
a new opportunity is created for our reunification with china 
as communist regimes in the world are facing the destiny of 
outright collapse if they do not introduce drastic changes lee 
said 
our utmost task is to unite all anticommunist forces to 
topple the chinese communist tyranny he added 
li the vice presidential nominee is from the chinese mainland 
but that does not appear to have enthused the aging mainlandborn 
conservatives who dominate the national assembly 
although the aging nationalists are uncomfortable with lee many 
fear a popular uprising against the party if he is not elected 
opinion polls have found his public approval rating to be more than 
80 percent 
the aging assembly members who occupy 658 seats were elected 
before 1949 and were frozen in office to support the nationalist 
claim to be the sole legitimate rulers of all china the remaining

his face is weathered and his 
hair is gray but nelson mandelas voice still booms with the 
confidence of a man who never seems to have doubted the justice of 
his cause during decades in prison 
the prison years have left their mark physically but mandelas 
spirit still belongs to the young man who stubbornly protested the 
inequities of apartheid 
i come before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of 
the people mandela told tens of thousands of cheering supporters 
sunday after his release following 27 years in jail 
i place the remaining years of my life in your hands he 
said 
mandela has clearly lost weight since the 1960s both his face 
and his body are leaner than when he was a sturdily built boxer 
decades ago at 71 his face is creased with two thick lines that 
frame his strong confident smile 
his full head of hair is mostly gray with a distinctive patch 
of white on the right side his voice is full and strong and he 
speaks like the lawyer he is in slow measured sentences 
despite his age mandelas walk is smooth and graceful and he 
appears extremely fit the result of a twohour daily exercise 
regimen that reportedly begins each morning at 330 
in his first public appearance he was dignified courteous and 
polite in a wellcut suit he looked much more a politician than a 
guerrilla leader 
nonetheless his elderly appearance probably came as a surprise 
to many south africans the majority of whom were born after 
mandela was last seen publicly in 1964 
pictures of him as a vigorous african national congress leader 
in his 40s have been widely circulated in recent years hundreds of 
people at the rally wore tshirts with that youthful visage 
emblazoned on the front 
mandelas reserved even formal demeanor is likely to work in 
his favor among whites who have long been flooded with government 
propoganda portraying him and the anc as a communistled terrorist 
group 
president fw de klerk and his government now say mandela is 
committed to a peaceful resolution of the south african conflict 
and like the blacks have invested considerable hope that mandela 
can succeed in bringing people together where others have failed 
but mandela stands firm on his commitment to a oneman onevote 
democracy a system the government rejects 
i have fought against white domination i have fought against 
black domination said mandela a united nonracial democracy 
in south africa is the only way to peace

nato secretary general manfred woerner emerged 
sunday from talks with president bush to suggest that a reunified 
germany could be a part of the western alliance without extending 
natos military reach over the territory that is now east germany 
woerner said a way can and will be found to keep a united 
germany in nato while recognizing the legitimate security 
interests of the soviet union 
following two days of talks at the presidential retreat at camp 
david md both bush and woerner hailed what the white house 
called west german chancellor helmut kohls extraordinarily 
successful talks with soviet leaders in moscow 
kohl said saturday he got unequivocal assurances from soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev that moscow would respect the right of 
the two germanys to decide for themselves on the timing and 
structure of their reunification 
the white house said bush and woerner agreed that nato should 
adopt new political roles including helping shape us policies 
toward the east bloc nations now shifting toward democracy 
woerner spoke with reporters at andrews afb outside washington 
before boarding a us air force jet to ottawa canada and an 
international conference on open skies including bushs 
proposal to allow the superpowers to conduct surveillance flights 
over each others territories 
secretary of state james a baker iii also was bound for ottawa 
on sunday following his sixday trip to moscow and eastern europe 
at a news conference in moscow on friday night baker had said us 
policy calls for full german membership in nato or association 
with the alliance for a reunited germany 
a senior administration official later clarified that remark 
saying full nato membership still was the only administration goal 
for a reunified germany 
both baker and the official endorsed a proposal by west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher that while a united germany 
should be a nato member western troops would not move into the 
territory that is now east germany 
the united states and its nato allies want a unified germany to 
be a part of the western military alliance that they view as a 
cornerstone of four decades of peace in europe 
i personally would like to see a unified germany remain a 
member of nato said woerner but of course we have to take 
into account the legitimate security interests of the soviet 
union 
we can and will find solutions which guarantees these security 
interests of the soviet union he said 
one of the possibilities he said is not to extend the 
military integration of nato towards the former region of the 
german democratic republic now east germany and this could be 
done without problems but the whole of germany could and should 
remain a member of nato 
this is a solution which would not create any problems said 
woerner 
asked if he had in mind a neutral section of germany woerner 
said we are not considering a neutral germany or even a neutral 
east germany 
he declined to discuss further details saying this is a 
solution which has to be found and which has to be discussed too 
much speculation about details leads nowhere 
woerner who spoke in english added i think its now the 
task of all governments concerned to find a solution which allows 
germany to be embedded in western structures european integration 
atlantic alliance with additional alleuropean framework the csce 
process and with solutions which take into account the legitimate 
security interests of the soviet union 
on abctvs this week with david brinkley gennadi 
gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said our 
position is that its for the germans to decide what to do next if 
they want a reunited germany its their decision 
but he added they must take into account the specific 
position of germany our specific relationship with the german 
democratic republic and our security concerns and even our 
psychological concerns because we still have memories of that 
dreadful terrible war we had with germany 
for many people in my country its difficult to understand 
that we are going to have a big germany again as our neighbor 
said gerasimov who added that a reunited germany must not upset 
stability in europe 
sen sam nunn chairman of the senate armed service committee 
said germany must remain a vital part of the western alliance 
though there have been hints that west germany should take a 
modified role in nato a part of reunification with east germany 
ive just been told that a number of the east german army 
people are coming over and wanting to join the west german army 
nunn said on nbctvs meet the press 
youre going to have a merged type army there over a period of 
time i dont know how long but you cant have a political and 
economic union and have two separate armies 
john herrick an assistant white house spokesman said bush and 
woerner expressed their gratification that the government of the 
federal republic of germany had affirmed that a unified germany 
would remain a member of the north atlantic alliance 
they agreed that nato in addition to maintaining the common 
defense should adopt new political roles in helping guide 
western policy toward the emerging democracies of eastern europe 
in coordinating the negotiation and monitoring of arms control 
agreements and in developing western policy for regional and 
transnational issues 
kohl will be bushs guest at camp david on feb 2425

white police officers and black 
activists worked together sunday to ensure the safety of nelson 
mandela as he walked out of prison 
security was tight throughout the day with hundreds of heavily 
armed police keeping watch at the prison and guarding mandelas 
route police were aided by volunteer marshalls from antiapartheid 
groups 
but the heavy security did not prevent violence in central cape 
town where police clashed with rampaging young blacks who smashed 
shop windows doctors and journalists said more than 100 people 
were injured and there were reports of deaths 
black activists and policemen who may once have arrested them 
worked with each other in some cases to hold back the crowds and 
ensure mandelas safety 
winnie mandela who has endured midnight police raids on her 
home had an escort of three motorcycle officers riding ahead of 
her motorcade to victor verster prison where her husband was 
released 
however when mandela and his wife got into a car to leave the 
prison seucrity broke down some eager witnesses to history 
surrounded the car and nearly climbed atop it 
police lined mandelas route to cape town while volunteers held 
hands against the crowd to keep the streets clear police 
helicopters hovered overhead 
but after police and young black youths began fighting angry 
men and women formed chains around city hall to protect mandela and 
mauled anyone who tried to pass police had to negotiate their way 
through the chain to get to their superiors inside the building 
the police may be inside but we are in charge of the door

young blacks and nervous white 
policemen turned celebration to chaos sunday at the welcoming rally 
for nelson mandela on his first day of freedom 
tens of thousands of people had gathered hours before the rally 
hoping for a glimpse of the black leader who was released after 27 
years in jail for fighting the white minority government 
but as the sun set there were no longer the shouts of viva 
mandela and the energetic singing of the morning but shotgun 
fire police helicopters crisscrossing the sky ambulances 
wailing police dogs barking and black youths chanting pounding 
their feet and issuing angry challenges 
the center of the city called the fairest cape was a 
battlefield 
thousands of blacks and whites stood in the huge parade ground 
eyes fixed on the city hall balcony listening to endless political 
speeches over defective loudspeakers waiting for mandela to appear 
they waited even though they could hear at the edges of the 
throng the shop windows shattering and the intermittent gunshots 
as the 71yearold prisoner free for just two hours was driven 
in a motorcade past streets lined with tens of thousands of people 
the first shots rang out near the railway station 
bands of youths had broken shop windows earlier in the day and 
police who came to investigate were taunted by a crowd that 
outnumbered them six to one they guarded the shop but did not draw 
their guns 
but later when people began shattering the outer windows of a 
shopping plaza across the street from the parade ground four 
policemen appeared in the middle of the street and began firing 
shotguns at the black youths 
the youths fought back hurling broken bottles that soon made a 
shardcovered nomans land 
the youths stood on the edge of the crowd or hid behind cars 
and buildings with makeshift wooden and metal weapons many tried 
to blend in or stand in front of the bystanders 
on a side street women and children were watching a momentary 
standoff suddenly a blueuniformed officer wheeled around aimed 
his shotgun toward the crowd and fired three times 
some of the onlookers screamed and ran but most fell down on 
the pavement some tried to hide behind a car but the driver drove 
away 
as the terrified women looked up to see why they had been made 
targets they saw thin young boys in dirty tshirts and shorts 
scamper past them laughing 
but there were peacemakers on both sides 
ordinary folk black and white formed a human chain around a 
makeshift first aid center in the street near city hall each time 
shots rang out they crouched to the ground but they never broke 
their lines 
when hooligans smashed into indianowned snack shops on the edge 
of the parade ground a young black man raised the anc flag to 
protect the white policemen who came to stand guard in front of the 
shops 
the young mans colleagues formed a wall with their bodies to 
hold back scores of young radicals who were itching to get at the 
policemen

president corazon aquino said sunday 
she will refuse to meet defense secretary dick cheney during his 
visit next week following criticism of her administration by us 
officials and media 
mrs aquino also said filipino officials will demand an 
explanation for cuts in promised us economic aid when the two 
governments begin talks soon on extending the lease on six american 
military bases which expires in 1991 
cheney is expected here next sunday for three days of talks and 
visits to clark air base and the subic bay naval base the largest 
of the six installations 
no schedule of meetings had been announced but mrs aquino 
routinely receives prominent americans and her refusal to see a 
us official of cheneys rank is unprecedented for her 
administration 
cheney left washington on saturday for hawaii before flying on 
later to south korea hong kong the philippines and japan in 
honolulu defense department spokesman pete williams said cheneys 
schedule had not been nailed down and its unsure whether 
well see mrs aquino or not 
during her weekly national radio program mrs aquino complained 
about us media reports following visits last month by deputy 
national security adviser robert gates and republican rep jim 
kolbe of arizona 
ive been thinking that we talk of one thing and afterward 
something else is published in american newspapers mrs aquino 
said 
because of our sad experience of the last two visits i think 
it is best that it be defense secretary fidel ramos who will 
meet with his counterpart and that he does not need me at the 
moment 
mrs aquino also said her government considered washingtons 
failure to provide promised economic and military aid to be a 
violation of a 1988 agreement allowing the united states to 
maintain its bases through the end of their lease 
in october 1988 then secretary of state george shultz agreed to 
pay 962 million over two years for use of the bases through 1991 
after that a new agreement must be negotiated and ratified by the 
us and philippine senates 
this year the bush administration asked congress to provide 
200 million in military assistance and 160 million in economic 
support funds for the philippines 
but congress cut the figure by 96 million and us diplomats in 
manila say there is no chance the reductions will be restored 
mrs aquino said the countries need to begin talks about the 
bases and discuss the nonfulfillment of the commitments of the 
americans mrs aquino said we are waiting for them to explain 
why this happened 
strains in usphilippine relations have emerged despite bushs 
public support for mrs aquino 
on dec 1 us air force jets flew air cover in support of 
progovernment forces battling military mutineers trying to oust 
mrs aquino 
but in the aftermath of the coup attempt us officials have 
delivered some of the strongest public criticism of mrs aquinos 
administration since she took power in the february 1986 uprising 
against the late ferdinand marcos 
last month deputy assistant secretary of defense carl ford told 
the house subcommittee on asia and the pacific that the political 
situation here remains unsettled and that many wondered whether 
the government could regain public confidence 
during the same hearing deputy assistant secretary of state 
david lambertson warned of the danger of another coup attempt and 
said corruption was hampering government operations 
after a visit here last month rep kolbe told reporters in 
arizona that mrs aquino favors retaining us bases but is in a 
very awkward position politically because of others opposition 
to them 
his comments were widely published in the philippines 
antibases groups claimed mrs aquino had made a secret agreement 
with the americans while publicly stating she had not made up her 
mind on the installations

celebrated cellist and conductor mstislav 
rostropovich whose soviet citizenship was restored in january 
after 12 years of official disgrace arrived in his homeland sunday 
to a jubilant vip welcome 
rostropovich accompanied by his wife opera singer galina 
vishnevskaya received a tumultuous welcome at sheremetevo airport 
where hundreds of friends fans and journalists gathered to meet 
his flight from tokyo 
welcome back welcome home fans yelled as the couple was 
escorted to the vip lounge to be officially greeted by soviet 
culture minister nikolai gubenko and an entourage that included 
us ambassador jack matlock and french culture minister jack lang 
it was like a welcome for a visiting head of state said a 
soviet who watched the festivities and commented on condition of 
anonymity 
rostropovich and his wife were driven away in separate black 
chaika limousines with a twocar police escort soviet television 
news said they went immediately to pay their respects at the grave 
of dmitri shostakovich the celebrated soviet composer who died in 
1975 and was once in official disfavor under dictator josef stalin 
the 62yearold cellist whose instrument accompanied him in a 
white case will perform concerts tuesday and wednesday at the 
moscow conservatory with the national symphony orchestra of 
washington dc and later give two concerts in leningrad 
on monday rostropovich was to present health officials with 1 
million singleuse syringes to help in the antiaids campaign 
throwaway syringes are in notoriously short supply in the soviet 
union 
rostropovich earned the kremlins wrath in the early 1970s by 
giving refuge to author alexander solzhenitsyn whose writings 
depicted the brutal political repressions that began under soviet 
founder vladimir lenin and reached a bloody crescendo under stalin 
the maestro and his wife left the soviet union in 1974 the year 
of his last public performance in moscow to live abroad four 
years later the soviet government stripped the couple of their 
citizenship for actions harmful to the prestige of the soviet 
union 
in january the supreme soviet legislature restored their 
citizenship and nullified the decree that stripped them of all 
their medals and honorary titles 
rostropovich gained international renown as a cello soloist and 
conductor with the moscow philharmonic since his departure from 
the soviet union he has maintained homes in london the united 
states switzerland and france 
in 1987 queen elizabeth ii conferred a knighthood on him on his 
60th birthday 
several other prominent soviet cultural figures also have had 
their lost citizenship restored in recent months amid the reforms 
of president mikhail s gorbachev 
solzhenitsyn is a notable exception soviet officials say they 
have not received any application from him to have his citizenship 
restored although his works are now being published by official 
media 
the nobel prizewinning author who lives in vermont was 
stripped of his citizenship and expelled from the soviet union in 
1974 the official writers union voted last year to restore his 
membership 
alexei yelisayev chairman of the supreme soviets commission on 
citizenship said in a december newspaper interview that exiled 
soviets who lost their citizenship could have it restored only if 
they requested it 
yelisayev said it was not necessary for exiles to return to have 
their citizenship restored

the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee criticized the bush administrations arms control 
position sunday as being put together by carpenters rather than 
architects lacking a broad view 
sen sam nunn dga said the administration needs to take a 
look at us weapons systems as they relate to arms control and an 
apparent willingness by the soviets to disarm 
its going to be awfully hard for this administration to say 
weve had a breakthrough in negotiating with the soviets were 
going to reduce arms by about 30 to 40 percent and then come up and 
say we want two missiles two of them mobile we want a new b2 
bomber we want an sdi program to go forward full steam all of 
these things at one time nunn said on nbctvs meet the 
press program 
i dont think thats going to sell he said 
nunn said bushs armed forces modernization plans do not take 
into account some of the possibilities in arms control like 
getting rid of the mx rail mobile missile in exchange for the 
soviet ss24 which is also a based on railroad cars and moving 
toward a policy of no multiplewarhead missiles 
our arms control position is really being done by carpenters 
rather than architects he said i dont think in congress 
theres going to be a lot of receptivity to going forward with huge 
weapon systems unless there is a strategic concept that fits into 
the arms control 
he also criticized the timing of bushs appearance last week at 
us military war games in california and his comments in support 
of the strategic defense initiative at a time when the soviet union 
was voting to reduce the power of the communist party 
well these military exercises have to go on but i did think 
it was curious the president chose this moment in history to 
participate in a war game and give it tremendous visibility nunn 
said i think thats somewhat out of sync with the events that 
are taking place 
nunns comments came as secretary of state james a baker iii 
was en route to ottawa canada for a natowarsaw pact open 
skies conference on surveillance and other techniques for 
exchanging military data between east and west 
at the ottawa conference baker was to continue discussions with 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze on troop reductions in 
europe and weapons cuts 
the talks made progress last week while baker was in moscow 
when a nearagreement was reached between the united states and 
soviet union on cuts in chemical weapons and longrange nuclear 
missiles 
if negotiations work out in canada the slight differences 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev on 
troop cuts are expected to be smoothed out setting the stage for 
an agreement later this year between the nato and warsaw pact 
alliances to remove about 400000 soviet and 100000 american 
soldiers from europe 
the talks in moscow produced an agreement that bush and 
gorbachev would sign accord in june providing for the destruction 
of all their chemical weapons in 10 years if all other nations 
capable of making poison gas sign a treaty

the solitude that fosters crooning in the 
shower is helping university of georgia students master their do 
re mis and shed their inhibitions about singing in public 
music professor david smith uses an electronic voice analyzer in 
a room that once was a restroom to help future elementary school 
teachers overcome a lack of confidence in their singing abilities 
the voice laboratory still has a sink and soap dish but other 
toilet fixtures have been removed 
smith said the solitude of the laboratory is intentional but 
the fact that its located in a former restroom is strictly the 
result of space limitations 
the activity itself is designed to be done in isolation so 
that they would not be so selfconscious he said i would 
assume singing in the shower might be the same thing where they 
would not have an audience to entertain 
smith said students who are selfconscious about singing respond 
much better to musical activities that give them feedback without 
any human involvement 
so an electronic device measures vocal performance digitally and 
gives the students a score a meter shows them whether they are 
sharp or flat it may not make opera singers out of them but the 
teacherstobe learn to be more at ease and more effective in 
leading youngsters in classroom singalongs he said 
students can develop their skills in a fairly fun 
nonthreatening way he said it has a subtle videogame 
approach

and that did it

african national congress to suspend its guerrilla campaign in 
south africa following the release of anc leader nelson mandela 
but kaunda long one of the south african governments 
staunchest critics also said the anc should maintain its military 
capability in case of violence by white rightwing extremists in 
south africa 
until we know which way the ultrarightists are going it is 
important that the armed struggle should only be suspended not 
abolished kaunda told the associated press at his official 
residence in lusaka 
certainly i think the anc should suspend the armed struggle 
for the moment but they should not be tempted to destroy their 
armed forces he said 
kaunda has allowed the anc to base its exile headquarters and 
guerilla facilities in zambia and they have been targets of 
sabotage and military attacks by south africa 
he also said he believed it was premature to lift international 
economic sanctions before the united nations discusses the south 
african situation on june 30 
that will be the time for all of us to look back at what de 
klerk will have done by way of establishing the root for abolishing 
apartheid said kaunda chairman of the sixnation african 
frontline bloc neighboring south africa 
kaunda said he telephoned south african president fw de klerk 
late saturday to offer him his encouragement he gave no other 
details of their conversation which took place a few hours after 
de klerk announced plans for mandelas release sunday 
kaunda said he believed the anc should encourage de klerk 
along the path by talking 
the time for talking has come he said 
the anc has said it will not end its guerrilla campaign in south 
africa or declare a unilateral ceasefire until several conditions 
are met including the government lifts the state of emergency 
releases all political prisoners and withdraws troops from black 
townships 
the organization has said it will not begin talks with the 
government until the same conditions are met 
kaunda described the ancs conditions as proper but did not 
indicate whether he would try to persuade or pressure anc leaders 
to start talks 
i support them fully but i think they should start talking now 
even if it means a program of talks about talks he said 
earlier sunday zambian state radio quoted lusakabased anc 
secretary general alfred nzo as describing mandela as the leader 
of the anc and all the people of south africa 
nzo called on all south africans to support mandela and join 
hands in efforts to bring about justice and democracy in their 
homeland

although most south african 
blacks are jubilant over nelson mandelas release his african 
national congress movement remains locked in bitter feuds with 
major black factions to its left and right 
mandela himself is so revered that no black leader has said a 
bad word about him in public 
yet the anc in whose name mandela endured more than 27 years in 
prison is considered by some blackconsciousness militants to be a 
sellout and by some black conservatives to be a powerhungry 
marxistinfluenced party 
within south africa black youths who have grown up with such 
slogans as freedom or death and waged street battles with 
police may have trouble accepting the idea that talks have 
precedence over armed struggle 
for many of the youths the struggle has simply meant to shoot 
your way to pretoria antiapartheid leader murphy morobe said 
recently 
the most influential of the ancs black critics is mangosuthu 
buthelezi chief minister of the kwazulu homeland and leader of 
inkatha a relatively conservative zulu organization that claims 
15 million members more than 2500 blacks have died in a 
threeyear power struggle between inkatha and anc supporters in 
natal province 
police said 12 blacks were killed in factional fighting in the 
province on sunday 
buthelezi depicts himself as a longtime foe of apartheid and an 
old friend of mandela but he contends the anc is unjustifiably 
trying to claim the role as principal negotiator for the black 
community 
it was inkathas refusal to be coopted into the anc and its 
refusal to become a subservient bagcarrier to the anc that led to 
the two organizations being in conflict buthelezi said after 
mandelas release was announced 
there will be a conference table searching for the formula for 
a multiparty democracy buthelezi added mandela will be there 
i will be there the anc will be there inkatha will be there 
buthelezi said mandela more than any other black leader has 
the potential to put partisan interests aside and promote black 
unity 
one faction that is unlikely to join in negotiations is the pan 
africanist congress which along with the anc was banned in 1960 
and legalized by president fw de klerk earlier this month 
the pan africanist congress espouses black selfreliance and 
contends that whites play too large a role in ancaligned groups 
it has criticized the ancs increasing interest in negotiations 
saying blackwhite talks should take place only when the government 
is ready to hand over political power and end white ownership of 
the bulk of the countrys land 
even within the ranks of anc supporters there is some division 
commanders of its military wing reportedly were displeased last 
year as relatively moderate members of the exiled leadership raised 
the prospect of negotiations 
mandela has no formal position in the anc at present and his 
future role is uncertain 
the organizations president oliver tambo is recovering from a 
stroke and possibly may be replaced later this year but mandela is 
not expected to take that post he may find himself trying to 
balance his anc duties with a broader role as leader of blacks 
across the political spectrum

amid the scenes of wild 
jubilation over the release of nelson mandela on sunday there were 
some ugly confrontations between jeering blacks and angry whites 
many whites looked worried or scared as they watched cheering 
and singing blacks surging through parts of central johannesburg 
elegantly dressed whites shrank back as the black throngs danced 
around them 
while most people black and white were wellbehaved a handful 
of blacks taunted whites yelling freedom is coming whites get 
out a few furious whites lashed out hurling bottles and insults 
at the blacks 
in cape town violence broke out about the time mandelas 
motorcade arrived 
police said a black looter was shot to death by officers and 
firstaid workers said more than 100 people were injured when riot 
police fired shotguns after black youths smashed shop windows some 
youths retaliated by hurling bottles 
clashes between police and celebrating blacks were reported in 
at least two other areas including the tribal homeland of ciskei 
where hospital officials said police shot three people to death and 
wounded 20 
police said 12 people were killed in natal province in factional 
fighting between anc supporters and backers of a more conservative 
black group 
for some south africans the scattered incidents of racial 
tension were worrying signs of what might happen in the days ahead 
when the government and antiapartheid groups attempt to negotiate 
over ending white rule many people in the crowds spoke of the need 
for peace and understanding between the races 
at the elegant carlton shopping mall three young black men 
surrounded a young white couple spitting on the frightened pair 
and shaking fists at them other blacks intervened and chased the 
taunters away 
as blacks early sunday surged through hillbrow near the city 
center some whites in apartments overlooking the street hurled 
empty bottles at the celebrants the marchers screamed insults and 
shook their fists but no injuries were seen 
frightened white motorists caught in the milling masses in the 
streets leaned on their horns or scattered the crowds by driving at 
high speed some clenched their fists in revolutionary salutes in 
apparent attempts to placate hooting blacks 
a white man watching the celebrants from his doorstep said 
look at them look at them what is happening to south africa 
some black youths pretended to fire imaginary machine guns at 
police vans filled with white officers shadowing the celebrants 
other blacks ran up to the vans yelling get out get out 
but much larger groups of blacks shouted peace peace peace 
most blacks and whites spoke of the need to solve south africas 
problems peacefully i pray to god we have peace in south 
africa one black marcher said we must all live together 
leaders on both sides have expressed fears that white and black 
extremists will provoke violence in the months ahead to try to 
derail negotiations for their own ends white extremists demand the 
retention of white supremacy some black militants oppose a 
compromise with whites 
i fear what is coming it will be a terrible time but we must 
overcome it by working together said the rev allan boesak a 
top antiapartheid leader

the world boxing council and world boxing association suspended the 
result pending investigation of a long count protest by tysons 
promoter don king 
tyson knocked out for the first time in his pro career said 
hes still the champion i knocked him out before he knocked me 
out tyson said 
douglas said hes champ just call it a victory for the small 
man 
douglas father former middleweight world contender bill 
dynamite douglas said he pulled the greatest upset in 
history 
because of an error by referee octavio meyran douglas was on 
the canvas for 12 seconds after tyson knocked him down in the 
eighth round two rounds later douglas knocked out tyson with a 
fivepunch combination 
there is no champion before feb 20 when the wbc meets in 
mexico city to settle the controversy said wbc president jose 
sulaiman of mexico 
sulaiman suggested what course the two governing bodies might 
take when there are problems a rematch is absolutely 
mandatory he said 
only the international boxing federation which sanctioned the 
bout as a championship match said douglas is the winner the ibf 
however isnt recognized by the japan boxing commission 
douglas disputed victory has created a wideopen heavyweight 
division that for three years had been the personal domain of 
tyson who was 370 with 33 knockouts 
tyson was scheduled to defend the title against no 1 contender 
evander holyfield on june 18 at atlantic city nj but holyfield 
has no contractual obligation to fight tyson if tyson is not the 
heavyweight champion 
theres nothing wrong with losing i can handle a loss but i 
want to lose fairly tyson said at the postfight news 
conference which douglas did not attend 
douglas was felled in the eighth round by a right uppercut to 
the jaw i wasnt really hurt douglas said when i looked up 
the count was at six i got up between seven and eight i clearly 
heard eight 
douglas was upright at nine but by then the timekeeper had 
tolled 10 although meyran who failed to pick up the timekeepers 
count didnt know that he motioned for the two boxers to resume 
fighting then the bell rang 
contrary to the old saying the bell cannot save a fighter it 
isnt rung if a fighter is down past the threeminute limit of the 
round but rings if a fighter beats the 10count 
douglas hurt tyson three or four times in the ninth round and 
by the end of the round tysons left eye was closed 
just past the minute mark of the 10th round douglas landed a 
fivepunch combination with the key blows being a right uppercut 
a left and a right to the jaw and tyson went down and was counted 
out 
the most famous long count in boxing history took place in a 
bout between jack dempsey and gene tunney on sept 22 1927 at 
chicagos soldier field before nearly 150000 fans and a radio 
audience of 50 million 
the newly adopted knockdown rule required the standing fighter 
to go to the farthest neutral corner before the count would start 
after six rounds dempsey seeking to regain the title he lost 
to tunney a year earlier toppled his opponent with a barrage of 
punches but went to the wrong corner using up five seconds before 
he moved to the proper corner 
fourteen seconds later tunny got up and went on to win a 
unanimous decision for the 10round fight said dempsey i was 
robbed

confrontations between young 
blacks and white policemen turned celebration to chaos sunday at 
the welcoming rally for nelson mandela on his first day of freedom 
tens of thousands had gathered hours before hoping for a 
glimpse of the black leader who was released after 27 years in 
jail for fighting the whiteminority government 
but as the sun set cheers of viva mandela and the energetic 
singing of the morning faded to new sounds 
people heard shotgun fire police helicopters crisscrossing the 
sky wailing ambulances barking police dogs and chanting black 
youths pounding their feet and issuing angry challenges 
police said officers fatally shot a black looter and firstaid 
workers said at least 100 people were injured when riot police 
fired shotguns after groups of black youths smashed shop windows 
the center of the city called the fairest cape was a 
battlefield 
thousands of blacks and whites stood in the huge parade ground 
their eyes fixed on the city hall balcony as they listened to 
endless political speeches over defective loudspeakers and waited 
for mandela to appear 
they waited even though they could hear at the edges of the 
throng the shattering shop windows the intermittent gunshots 
as the 71yearold prisoner free for just two hours was driven 
in a motorcade past streets lined with tens of thousands of people 
the first shots rang out near the railway station 
bands of youths had broken shop windows earlier in the day and 
police who came to investigate were taunted by a crowd that 
outnumbered them six to one they guarded the shop but did not draw 
their guns 
but later when people began shattering the outer windows of a 
shopping plaza across the street from the parade ground four 
policemen appeared in the middle of the street and began firing 
shotguns at the black youths 
the boys fought back hurling broken bottles that soon made a 
shardcovered nomans land 
the youths stood on the edge of the crowd or hid behind cars 
and buildings with makeshift wooden and metal weapons many tried 
to blend in or stand in front of the bystanders 
on a side street women and children watched a momentary 
standoff suddenly a blueuniformed officer wheeled aimed his 
shotgun toward the crowd and fired three times 
some of the onlookers screamed and ran but most fell to the 
pavement some tried to hide behind a car but the driver drove 
away 
as the terrified women looked up to see why they had been made 
targets they saw thin young boys in dirty tshirts and shorts 
scamper past them laughing 
but there were peacemakers on both sides 
ordinary folk black and white formed a human chain around a 
makeshift firstaid center in the street near city hall each time 
shots rang out they crouched to the ground but they never broke 
their lines 
when hooligans smashed into indianowned snack shops on the edge 
of the parade ground a young black man raised the anc flag to 
protect the white policemen who came to stand guard in front of the 
shops 
the young mans colleagues formed a wall with their bodies to 
hold back scores of young radicals who wanted to get at the officer

secretary of state james a baker iii 
sunday gave moral support to opposition parties and a gentle 
warning to the interim government which has been accused of trying 
to consolidate power prior to elections 
during a 4hour stopover in bucharest he succeeded in 
underlining americas commitment to free and fair elections without 
unduly alienating government leaders who have been strongly 
criticized by the opposition 
less than two weeks ago the united states criticized the 
national salvation front government which took power after the 
december revolution that toppled communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu for attempting to impede opposition parties contesting 
the may 20 general election 
baker did applaud the reform movement in romania since 
ceausescus overthrow and execution but he didnt praise the 
government 
premier petre roman said an endorsement would be very good 
but 
baker said he told interim president ion iliescu and roman that 
the betterment of relations of the united states with romania 
will depend on fully free fair elections and the respect for human 
rights and the rights of minorities 
baker also announced that the united states will offer romania 
80 million in food assistance a state department official said it 
will include 550000 tons of feed grain and 8200 tons of butter 
the romanian government previously had complained that the 
united states had not fulfilled a promise to send aid following the 
revolution 
opposition leaders told baker they were still being intimidated 
by the government said corneliu coposu president of the national 
peasant party the countrys largest opposition group 
the collective atmosphere was that there is fear and it is a 
sustained action of fear coposu said 
the fronts decision to participate in the election reversing 
an earlier pledge to stay out sparked mass demonstrations by 
students and opponents who demanded it resign 
in a compromise the front agreed to share power in a new 
provisional council of national unity which was inaugurated friday 
to run the country until the election 
but many of the 17 opposition party leaders and student 
representatives who met baker said they told him the front was 
trying to control the ruling council and continue the old communist 
system under a new guise 
in romania the youth made its revolution and iliescu and his 
friends have monopolized the revolution said nica leon 
president of the liberal democratic party 
toma george maiorescu president of the romanian ecological 
movement said the parties also told baker that elections should be 
postponed at least until september 
iliescu called his meeting with baker positive and said the 
secretary of state had reaffirmed us willingness to meet 
halfway romanias new openness 
roman said he viewed bakers visit as the beginning of a new 
relationship on a new basis taking into account the new democracy 
from now on we can speak of american aid as not just 
humanitarian i mean aid to rebuild 
but baker was noncommital on the question of economic aid or 
restoring romanias favorednation trading status several 
opposition parties told him the united states should wait until 
after the election before it makes a decision

a lawsuit filed on behalf of a carpenter 
seeking a pension for work on the alaska pipeline eventually could 
include up to 23000 union members as plaintiffs a lawyer said 
the lawsuit was filed friday in us district court in portland 
against the northern alaska carpenters retirement fund by daniel 
duncan a carpenter from medford who was disabled while working on 
the pipeline 
duncan claims carpenters were wrongly deprived of retirement 
money when the funds trustee forfeited their contributions duncan 
claims in the lawsuit that the trustee refused to vest carpenters 
with less than 10 years service who were laid off as the oil 
pipeline project neared completion in the late 1970s 
the lawsuit seeks certification from the court to add as 
plaintiffs as many as 3000 other carpenters who worked on the 
pipeline between dec 31 1972 and jan 1 1980 
richard j birmingham one of duncans attorneys said friday 
that the lawsuit also could apply to 20000 other union members 
including teamsters and total retirement claims could run as high 
as 50 million 
william earhart whose portland company administers the 
carpenters retirement fund said friday he had no comment on the 
lawsuit 
duncan alleges in his lawsuit that the carpenters union was 
partially terminated under federal law when the layoffs reached 
significant portions of the membership 
under the law the lawsuit says nonvested union members 
automatically become vested in their retirement fund when partial 
termination occurs 
the lawsuit says a rider attached to a budget bill in 1984 by 
alaskas two senators unconstitutionally denied union members the 
protection of the doctrine of partial termination 
the lawsuit asks that the northern alaska carpenters retirement 
fund be required to vest class members it seeks to have the fund 
enjoined from liquidating or distributing trust funds so as to 
prevent payment of the accrued benefits 
it also asks that class members be paid their accrued benefits 
as damages and seeks attorneys fees

nelson mandelas emergence sunday from nearly 
three decades in prison brought praise from world leaders but the 
international rejoicing was tempered by appeals for swifter 
progress toward ending apartheid 
as mandela 71 walked from the grounds of his prison outside 
cape town into crowds of supporters who had campaigned ceaselessly 
for his release the african national congress welcomed him to 
the warm embrace of our people and the national liberation 
movement 
president bush said he telephoned mandela told him all 
americans were rejoicing at his release and invited him to the 
white house 
i stated to him our desire to see a peaceful evolution towards 
a totally racially free south africa a society without prejudice 
a society of total freedom bush told reporters in the rose 
garden 
in atlanta coretta scott king widow of slain us civil rights 
leader martin luther king jr said she was overjoyed by the 
release of mandela who has shown us the tremendous power of 
unearned suffering for a just cause 
special church services were scheduled in many us cities 
indias prime minister vp singh called mandela a valiant 
soldier of independence justice and equality and french premier 
michel rocard invited him to visit paris 
gabons chief of state urged other african nations to restore 
diplomatic ties with south africa and britain said it was time to 
reconsider international sanctions 
antiapartheid campaigners took to the streets to celebrate 
including thousands who thronged to londons trafalgar square 
singing dancing and waving flags of the newly legalized anc 
mandelas release provided a surge of hope that should be 
harnessed to open talks between the government and the black 
majority british foreign secretary douglas hurd said hurds 
deputy foreign minister william waldegrave called mandela a 
leader of real stature to represent the africans who can enter into 
dialogue 
zambian president kenneth kaunda called for the anc to suspend 
guerrilla actions in south africa but to maintain its military 
capability in case of violence by rightwing extremists 
the time for talking has come said kaunda whose country 
plays host to the ancs exile headquarters and guerrilla bases 
but the anc said in a statement released in harare zimbabwe 
that it was not prepared to open talks with the whiteminority 
government of president fw de klerk until he lifted the state of 
emergency released all political prisoners and repealed laws that 
formed the basis of the apartheid system of segregation 
mandela reiterated those conditions at a rally sunday 
the nigerian government called mandelas release positive 
proof that international sanctions have worked but britain said 
it would contact the european community and the commonwealth of 
former colonies about encouraging new ties with south africa 
when people are doing the right thing boldly and courageously 
as president de klerk is it seems quite absurd to still use sticks 
to beat them with however small those sticks may be british 
prime minister margaret thatcher said 
the die is now cast the way is open for peaceable 
negotiations what is the use of trying to hit out why not help 
the process 
canadian sanctions will remain in effect until apartheid is 
scrapped foreign minister joe clark said prime minister brian 
mulroney wrote a letter to mandela saying we celebrate with the 
world that your freedom from prison today may soon lead to the 
freedom of all south africans from the injustice of apartheid 
sweden which maintained strong economic sanctions against south 
africa said mandelas release creates new hope for democracy and 
freedom 
through his courage commitment and moral strength he has 
been a constant source of inspiration for those who hold the ideals 
of freedom democracy and fairness high swedish premier ingvar 
carlsson said on mandela 
in poland solidarity leader lech walesa called mandela a man 
who devoted his life to the realization of the idea of equality of 
all people 
experiences of recent months show that there is no room in the 
world any more for regimes which hold human rights in contempt 
walesa said in warsaw 
australias prime minister bob hawke described mandelas release 
as the most positive sign the world had seen that the walls of 
the abhorrent apartheid system may soon be breached 
hawke and spains foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez 
also urged the south african government to build on the good will 
flowing from mandelas release 
president mario soares of portugal said he was deeply 
satisfied with this the latest significant step in the democratic 
reforms currently going on in south africa 
in italy premier giulio andreotti welcomed the gesture 
capable of giving a fundamental impetus to dialogue between all 
south africans 
israel welcomed the south african governments move as a step 
toward improving relations between the two countries 
human rights activist natan sharansky who emigrated to israel 
after spending nine years in soviet prisons and labor camps said 
he was glad mandela was released and hoped the years in prison 
have changed this leader that he is now more tolerant and is ready 
for a dialogue 
japans foreign minister taro nakayama said he hoped mandela 
would play a major role in national reconciliation in south africa 
and jordans minister of information ibrahim izzeddine agreed 
its a great moment to see a national leader who has suffered 
for 27 years go free and have the chance to lead his country to 
freedom its a great moment in the history of mankind 
thousands of wellwishers gathered for a street party outside 
the south african embassy overlooking londons trafalgar square 
where antiapartheid protesters have stage a roundtheclock picket 
since april 19 1986 demanding mandelas release 
busloads of police officers stood by but the crowd was 
goodnatured waving anc flags singing and dancing a banner was 
placed at the foot of admiral nelsons column in the center of the 
square temporarily renaming it mandelas column 
elsewhere in britain church bells pealed when mandela was

plo chairman yasser arafat said sunday the 
growing controversy over sovietjewish emigration to israel will 
jeopardize efforts for a peaceful settlement to the arabisraeli 
conflict 
arafat appealed to the soviet union to rescind an agreement with 
israel for direct flights between moscow and telaviv for 
immigrants and he urged arab leaders to convene an emergency arab 
summit 
moscow already has suspended the flight agreement 
speaking at a news conference arafat also accused israeli 
soldiers of killing at least four palestinians in the gaza strip 
town from which a bus filled with israeli tourists left before it 
was attacked in the egyptian desert last week 
he rejected reports linking the palestine liberation 
organization or other palestinian groups with last sundays attack 
40 miles northeast of cairo nine israelis were killed in the 
ambush 
the attack must have been carried out by extremists whatever 
their color identity or nationality is he said at a news 
conference in baghdad where the plo has offices and its official 
radio station voice of palestine 
in a published interview arafat appeared to condemn the attack 
of course we were surprised by the attack because we reject 
aggression on any civilians be they jewish american or 
european mondays issue of the londonbased magazine arab 
jerusalem quoted him as saying 
but arafat said the longer the united states and israel avoid a 
comprehensive peace settlement the larger the possibility of an 
explosion in the region 
cairos relations with the plo have been strained over the bus 
attack with columnists in governmentrun newspapers condemning 
arafat by name for not speaking out against it news reports have 
said those involved were palestinian 
at the news conference arafat said the recent influx of soviet 
jews to israel was made possible because of an understanding 
between president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev at 
their december summit in malta 
it is regrettable to say that this part of the accord was made 
in malta after president bush insisted that the soviets open a 
direct route to israel he said 
arafat said an arab league delegation will visit moscow later 
this month to ask the kremlin to halt the exodus permanently 
arafat declined to say if the soviet union promised to take any 
steps last week during talks between a soviet envoy and plo leaders 
in tunis but that the plo has ongoing contacts with moscow on the 
issue

liberation of palestine claimed feb 3 that soviet deputy foreign 
minister gennady tarassov made such a promise in tunis

alleged that the bus attack was planned and executed by residents 
of the mediterranean town in the israelioccupied gaza strip 
arafat said at least four palestinians were killed and 331 
wounded in rafah since the israeli army began the alleged offensive 
i appeal to the world community to halt this massacre 
immediately he said 
there was no independent confirmation of his allegations but 
one palestinian was shot dead in rafah and 52 suffered gunshot 
wounds in the city since the bus attack arab reports and hospital 
officials say 
most of the casualties resulted from three days of protests 
following wednesdays fatal shooting of a palestinian teenager 
during a stonethrowing clash 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said sunday the bus attack was 
planned by two palestinian deportees chief of staff lt gen dan 
shomron said in a speech in tel aviv the attack was carried out by 
what he called the palestinian wing of the islamic jihad group

given

government television 
broadcast nelson mandelas release from prison live sunday and 
later showed the speech in which he endorsed armed struggle against 
the government 
customarily the south african broadcasting corp offers live 
news coverage only of wellcontrolled events such as a presidential 
seech but the company scrapped the heart of its afternoon 
programming sunday to show mandelas walk to freedom even though 
the event occurred 75 minutes behind schedule 
in the interim sabc reporter clarence keyter became caught up 
in the excitement of the moment repeatedly telling viewers they 
were about to watch history in the making 
this is the moment the world has been waiting for keyter 
said the sun is shining on south africa 
the coverage stopped when mandelas motorcade pulled away from 
victor verster prison en route to cape town and there was no live 
coverage of later violence in the city or of mandelas speech at 
city hall 
but the main 8 pm news program devoted an entire hour to the 
release showing footage of black youths looting shops and 
broadcasting on a delayed basis virtually all of mandelas speech 
prior to feb 2 when president fw de klerk lifted a 30year 
ban on the anc the speech would have been illegal and the sabc 
could have been prosecuted for broadcasting it but on sunday as 
keyter and mandela both said a new south africa was in the making

moses b anderson is one of 13 black roman 
catholic bishops in the united states but the multicolored 
braided rope about his neck makes him unique hes chief of an 
african tribal clan 
the motor citys 61yearold auxiliary bishop last month became 
chief of the aduana clan of west africas ashanti tribe in ghana 
with the title came the symbolic braid and a new name nana kwasi 
amoateng i 
i wont be able to live there but i intend to do as much as i 
can for the village of antoa anderson said i am in more of 
a position now to get more africanamericans involved with africa 
last month about 1000 ashanti gathered in antoa for andersons 
installation as the clans firstever chief before the tribes 
centuriesold ceremony the bishop had to buy a ceremonial sword 
umbrella and sandals 
chiefs may never be seen barefoot and their feet can never 
touch the ground so they must always wear sandals anderson 
said they must always be seen clothed and they can never sit on 
the ground thats why stools or chairs are so important it is a 
symbol of dignity to sit it is a symbol of dignity to be sheltered 
by an umbrella 
andersons new role is based on ashanti culture not the tribal 
religion so there is no conflict with his catholic duties 
anderson said cardinal edmund szoka who heads the detroit 
archdiocese until he moves to a vatican post in june is supportive 
of his new role 
he said well now remember that youre still a catholic 
bishop he was just joking hes really interested in knowing what 
all this means for black catholics in detroit and around the 
country anderson said 
the cleric said he already has started work on helping the 
500member village anderson said he plans to collect items such as 
ballpoint pens chalk paper and clothing 
he said he also hopes to raise money to help buy a computer for 
bishop peter sarpong of the kumasi diocese who in 1987 suggested 
anderson become a chief 
they invited me in 1988 for the ceremony but that was at the 
same time of the church closings and i wanted to stay here to be 
supportive of the cardinal anderson said referring to szokas 
consolidation plan which closed 35 churches in the archdiocese 
anderson said he now tells people he is a ghanianamerican 
rather than africanamerican

seven score and one year ago the a 
lincoln who visited this seashore town may have been just a grocer 
from philadelphia 
but some residents continue to insist it was the future 16th 
president who stayed in a hotel in this resort community on july 
31 1849 
those who dispute the tale say lincoln whose birthday comes 
monday was in springfield ill practicing law that longago july 
31 winning a judgment of 11230 for a client casting further 
doubt is a record of an abel lincoln a philadelphia grocer who 
they say may have headed to the jersey shore that summer day 
all these years we may have been honoring a grocer said 
jake schaad who has researched the story and is writing a book 
about the history of cape may 
one version of the story claims that while in cape may lincoln 
rejected an offer to become governor of the oregon territory after 
his wife mary todd lincoln told him she was afraid of indians 
schaad said 
its a good story but it didnt happen schaad said adding 
that other versions have lincoln fathering an illegitimate son 
while at the shore 
the town claims to be americas oldest seashore resort tracing 
its visitors to just after the revolutionary war said jeffrey 
dorwart a history professor at rutgers universitycamden who is 
researching a book for cape may countys 300th anniversary in 1992 
some longtime residents knew henry irick who said that when he 
was 16 he came with his father and lincoln to this community of 
victorian homes and lazy sea breezes 
mary ann nyblade a 65yearold cape may resident who can trace 
her family in the town back to 1695 said she still clings to 
iricks story 
irick was the son of john s irick a wealthy vincentown farmer 
who supposedly met up with lincoln and came to the mansion house in 
cape may he recalled that visit in a newspaper interview in the 
late 1890s and the story was born ms nyblade said 
the mansion house guest register shows an a lincoln and wife 
from philadelphia in room 24 fire destroyed the hotel in 1856 but 
the register was saved ms nyblade said she acknowledged that the 
reference to philadelphia on the register was a problem for the 
futurepresident theorists but say the future president may have 
listed philadelphia if they had taken the steamboat from there to 
cape may 
the man who saved that register was lewis stevens and the 
250page book is now in huntsville ala in a safedeposit box 
owned by bill stevens ms nyblades nephew and a descendant of 
lewis stevens 
bill stevens said in a telephone interview that the register 
contains signatures of other famous people such as sen henry clay 
however he said he has learned too much about lincoln to believe 
he could have visited cape may 
im convinced he was not in cape may at that time he said 
theres no doubt about that said thomas f schwartz curator of 
the lincoln collection at the illinois state historical library in 
springfield 
on july 31 lincoln was at least 1000 miles west of cape may 
filing an affidavit in sangamon county circuit court for henry 
bailer who was owed 11175 by oliver davis davis ended up paying 
11230 which schwartz guesses included interest 
dorwart said he can prove president benjamin harrison spent 
summers in cape may as did president us grant and woodrow wilson 
while he was governor of new jersey but lincoln is a different 
story 
my sense is that since looking at the lincoln papers he was 
in illinois dorwart said 
he said residents of cape may 50 miles south of the masondixon 
line and site of several duels between northerners and southerners 
in the 1840s and 1850s may have been trying to prove their loyalty 
to the union after the civil war by circulating the story 
iricks tale probably cemented the story as fact dorwart said 
the cape may county historical museum still features a facsimile 
of the hotel register signature and everybody acknowledges that 
some legends just seem to die hard 
even if lincoln didnt come down here its part of our 
culture that he was here dorwart said

with more than 41 million in the bank for 
his 1990 senate race new jersey sen bill bradley again has 
demonstrated his prodigious power to draw money from a national 
pool although he deflects speculation about his presidential 
aspirations 
contributions of nearly 45 million flowed into the bradley 
account in 1989 including 39 million from individuals 570475 
from political action committees and 17500 from the democratic 
party federal election commission records show 
dividends and interest on the money brought in nearly 200000 
according to the democrats 1989 campaign finance report 
bradley has picked up 945 million in contributions interest 
and refunds since jan 1 1985 including 89 million in 
contributions alone among senators facing the voters this year he 
is second only to sen phil gramm dtexas with 105 million in 
receipts according to an analysis by common cause 
campaign manager nick donatiello says he expects to raise an 
additional 2 million at least to help buy expensive television 
advertising time in the new york and philadelphia markets 
although the bradley campaign organization is not yet working 
against any announced opponent new jersey republicans say they 
hope to announce a candidate by march it spent 279 million last 
year on operations 18 million in the last six months reports 
indicate 
the senator maintains he is running for only one job what i 
want to do is be a us senator from new jersey he repeated last 
week 
bradley may not yet know whether 1992 will be his year to reach 
for the democratic presidential nomination but his statewide 
reelection effort has national overtones 
bradley paid more than 200000 to joe peritz and associates 
of wilton conn for polling although donatiello insists the 
vast majority of those surveyed are from new jersey the 
senator said his campaign had been taking the national pulse on 
such issues as tax reform that issue is close to bradleys heart 
because he helped design 1986 tax reform legislation 
his 1990 campaign has purchased about 500000 in computer 
equipment to keep track of his 30000 to 35000 contributors around 
the country including 7000 new donors according to donatiello 
in addition the campaign has paid thousands of dollars for 
video screens to project bradleys largerthanlife image across 
banquet halls at his fundraisers expenditures from july to 
december also included 35000 paid to a california media 
consultant michael kaye and associates who has worked for 
democratic sens edward kennedy and alan cranston 
kaye who has worked with bradley throughout his career 
designed 30second television spots that ran last summer on new 
jerseys cable stations and were reintroduced last monday the 
latest cable spots carry no campaign message but feature bradley 
chatting about such issues as clean drinking water and deterring 
youngsters from joining gangs 
while he concentrates his public comments about the race on 
issues that affect new jersey constituents the senators active 
fundraising schedule has included a boston event sept 25 that 
raised 100000 a los angeles event oct 12 that raised 650000 
a chicago event nov 6 that brought in 200000 and a 
1000aperson new jersey fundraiser dec 4 that brought in 
500000 
the senator has been especially successful in california where 
help from michael eisner chief executive officer of disney 
studios and michael ovitz head of creative artists agency has 
brought dollars and attention from hollywoods heavy hitters 
bradleys latest group of celebrity contributors include 
novelists judith krantz and sidney sheldon platoon and wall 
street screenwriter and producer oliver stone sister gossip

president bush telephoned nelson mandela from 
the white house on sunday told him all americans were rejoicing 
at his release after 27 years in south africas prisons and 
personally invited him to the white house 
i stated to him our desire to see a peaceful evolution towards 
a totally racially free south africa a society without prejudice 
a society of total freedom bush told reporters in the rose 
garden late sunday afternoon 
he told me that he wanted to consult some of his colleagues 
but that he expected he would be able to accept my invitation 
the president said 
i told him that all americans were delighted after these many 
years in jail that he was released that we were rejoicing at his 
release said bush 
it was a very friendly conversation it lasted five or six 
minutes maybe and he expressed his gratitude to me and to the 
american people for calling said bush 
the president said the future of us sanctions against the 
white minority government of south africa was not discussed during 
his brief conversation with the african national congress leader 
that did not come up i will address that at an appropriate 
time theres no time frame i will be discussing that with our top 
advisers said bush who on saturday called south african 
president fw de klerk and invited him to pay a separate visit to 
washington 
im not prepared to express my view on sanctions at this time 
weve had some momentous events and i think the thing is to let 
these events settle in now said bush theres differences of 
opinion in the congress and american public opinion lets 
just rejoice in the fact that mr de klerk took some very forward 
steps and let us rejoice in the fact that mr mandela is free 
asked whether he planned to send secretary of state james a 
baker iii to south africa now bush said i have no immediate 
plans to do that but said he would not rule it out 
bush asked whether he plans a more active us role in seeking 
a peaceful solution to the problems in south africa said 
anytime that human rights and equality are at stake anywhere in 
the world the united states has a very useful role to play and i 
think both president de klerk and mr mandela feel that way 
indeed both of them indicated that to me 
we have had a cutoff of high level visits for some time but 
now with the freeing of mandela it is appropriate that highlevel 
visits take place said bush who added that he is sure theyll 
be separate visits 
he said mandela sounded restrained in their telephone 
conversation his comments were very warm and very i dont want 
to use the word appreciative but i think he was glad that i 
called there was a calmness in his voice and he all in all im 
sure enjoyed this first day very very much although he didnt 
state that you could just sense it from the way in which he 
expressed himself 
bush said he expects a de klerk visit to draw criticism 
ive invited mr de klerk to the white house i think the 
world rejoices in the fact that mr mandela is free and theres 
always going to be somebody shooting at mr de klerks decision or 
something of that nature or maybe mine but ive invited him here 
i hope he comes here i have invited mr mandela here i hope he 
comes here thats the way it is thats the way it is going to 
be 
theres always somebody out on the fringe somewhere trying to 
assign an unhelpful motive i think mr de klerk in making certain 
changes inside south africa has done something that many of us 
felt was long overdue but nevertheless hes done it he 
deserves credit for that said bush 
the us sanctions include a ban on new investment in south 
africa a prohibition on the import of certain south african 
products and the cancellation of landing rights for south african 
airlines 
asked whether he felt the sanctions had prompted de klerks 
decision bush said maybe so i dont know 
even as mandela walked to freedom sunday the debate was already 
joined in the united states over whether to lift the sanctions 
it was wonderful to see that man walk out of that prison 
said rep howard wolpe dmich chairman of the house foreign 
affairs subcommittee on africa the struggle of apartheid is not 
a struggle of black against white it is a struggle of democracy 
sen sam nunn dga speaking on nbctvs meet the press 
said its time for us to begin discussing in our country 
between the president and the congress as to when the sanctions 
would end and which ones would end we certainly need to 
acknowledge these events we certainly need to encourage the south 
african government to go forward 
but rep william h gray dpa the house majority whip said 
although we welcome the freeing of mandela and we applaud the 
move by mr de klerk the fact is that south africa is still not 
free the future is really in their hands whether or not 
sanctions are lifted really is up to the de klerk government 
herman cohen the assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs said on cbstvs face the nation that if you get an 
equitable situation based on negotiations where everybody gives a 
little and everyone ends up as a winner i think you can have a lot 
better south africa 
south africas minority white population of 5 million has 
maintained control through its apartheid laws and denial of 
political rights to the 26 million black residents 
cohen said the last thing the american government should be 
doing is prescribing the type of constitutional change that we want 
to see 
asked whether the united states backs the principal of one man 
one vote the state department official replied we believe in 
universal suffrage and if you have one man one vote in every 
democratic system in the world there are limitations on pure 
majority rule 
he called bushs invitation to de klerk a tremendous symbolic 
gesture 
bush would be the first person to say that apartheid is not 
over its just the beginning of a process right now and we 
certainly wouldnt want to eliminate all of our leverage in that 
situation cohen said 
but i think the time has now come to make a gesture which in 
effect says youre making progress said cohen 
gray said the antiapartheid act of 1986 passed over the veto 
of thenpresident reagan spelled out that before sanctions could 
be lifted south africa had to free mandela and all other political 
prisoners and meet at least three of four other criteria de klerk 
has already met one of the conditions by legalizing the african 
national congress and other antiapartheid groups 
the other conditions include an agreement by the government to 
engage in good faith negotiations on south africas political 
future the lifting of the state of emergency and making 
substantial progress toward dismantling apartheid 
sen alan cranston dcalif the senate majority whip said 
mandela is free but black africa still groans under the yoke of 
apartheid the united states should keep up the pressure of 
sanctions which undoubtedly have worked well until the last 
vestige of apartheid is eradicated 
the white house said feb 1 that mandela would be invited to 
come at his convenience upon his release from prison after 27 years 
bush had already signalled more than a week ago that he would 
invite both mandela and de klerk to the white house for separate 
visits john herrick a spokesman said that in saturdays phone 
call bush expressed his admiration for the significant 
initiatives announced by the south african government in recent 
days and reiterated his hope there would be continued progress 
toward a negotiated solution in an atmosphere of nonviolence

more than 2000 people protested 
outside the governments television building sunday demanding the 
ouster of journalists they said were loyalists of toppled communist 
dictator nicolae ceausescu 
a dozen tanks and armored personnel carriers held back the 
demonstrators outside the building where during the december 
revolution the new governments leaders took refuge while the army 
fought off ceausescus secret police 
it was one of several protests some involving tens of thousands 
of people held by various groups over the weekend that are 
demanding an end to what they consider unfair policies that remain 
from the days of the executed hardliner 
also sunday us secretary of state james a baker visited for 
several hours with government and opposition leaders he withheld 
praise for the government and listened to opposition complaints 
the demonstrators outside the tv headquarters accused the ruling 
national salvation front of controlling the mass media with 
ceausescu loyalists they chanted down with communism and we 
protected you youve deceived us a reference to the fierce 
battles for control of the media during the revolution 
the front ruled the country for six weeks after the uprising and 
now dominates the multiparty council of national union which was 
inaugurated friday and will rule until elections in may 
dumitru iuga chief of the free broadcasters union told the 
demonstrators that after two hours of talks he had reached an 
agreement with the tv authorities that would eradicate the last 
remnants of ceausescus tragedy and preserve what we won in 
december 
he did not provide details of the agreement which he promised 
would be published tuesday in a newspaper 
the protesters primary demand was the removal of tv 
directorgeneral petre constantin and news anchormen gheorghe 
marinescu and petre popescu 
they are absolutely associated with the previous regime 
therefore they are tainted and must go said valentin balmas a 
tv technician 
balmas said the demonstrators were not satisfied with the 
resignation friday of broadcasting chief aurel dragos munteanu 
since censorship is not done by one man alone 
across town several hundred medical students protested the 
refusal of the bucharest medical school to increase next years 
class to accommodate students who have been displaced by about 400 
foreign students 
the authorities of the bucharest medical school which are 
loyalists of the former regime say we should admit a maximum of 
foreigners because we need their hard currency said gheorghe 
mihai a parent of one of the students 
on saturday members of the 100000strong romanian drivers 
syndicate surrounded the fronts headquarters in victory square 
with several hundred trucks and buses demanding better work 
conditions

lei about 150 to 5000 lei which is about double the monthly 
average they also demanded their mandatory length of service be 
cut in half to one year 
more than 40000 ethnic hungarians carrying candles and books 
demonstrated peacefully in tirgu mures in central romania on 
saturday demanding equal rights the official rompres news agency

nelson mandela walked through a 
prison gate to freedom sunday setting set off joyous celebrations 
and violent clashes as blacks nationwide welcomed their leader back 
from 27 years in jail 
comrades and fellow south africans i greet you all in the 
name of peace democracy and freedom for all mandela told tens 
of thousands of cheering supporters who thronged outside city hall 
at twilight many getting their first look at the 71yearold 
african national congress leader 
but he emphatically reaffirmed his commitment to the ancs 
guerrilla campaign and called for increased pressure to end 
whiteminority domination the same cause that resulted in his 
life sentence on charges of plotting against the government he 
also reiterated that talks with the government cannot begin until 
it lifts the state of emergency 
i stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble 
servant of you the people said the whitehaired mandela who 
looked much more an elder statesman in his suit and tie than a 
guerrilla leader 
today the majority of south africans black and white 
recognize that apartheid has no future it has to be ended by our 
decisive mass action he said in a rousing halfhour speech 
frequently interrupted by roars of viva 
we have waited too long for our freedom 
violence broke out about the same time mandelas motorcade 
arrived in cape town from victor verster prison and delayed his 
speech police said a black looter was shot to death by officers 
and first aid workers said more than 100 people were injured when 
riot police fired shotguns after groups of black youths smashed 
shop windows in the city center 
some youths retaliated by hurling bottles at the officers 
hundreds of terrified people waiting to hear mandela ran for cover 
as police fired blasts of shotgun pellets 
clashes between police and celebrating blacks were reported in 
at least two other areas including the tribal homeland of ciskei 
where hospital officials said police shot three people to death and 
wounded 20 
in natal province where anc supporters have been feuding with a 
more conservative black group police said 12 blacks were killed in 
factional fighting sunday it was a harsh reminder of the bitter 
feuds involving black factions who disagree on the best way to 
fight for equality 
elsewhere hundreds of thousands of blacks danced and jogged 
through the streets of big cities and impoverished townships 
rejoicing at mandelas freedom 
very good news very good news president bush said after 
mandelas release bush said he telephoned mandela told him all 
americans were rejoicing at his release and invited him to the 
white house 
the rev jesse jackson speaking at a church service outside 
cape town shortly before mandela was released commended the south 
african government for making a courageous step but said the 
pillars of apartheid remain in place 
a thunderous cheer went up as the man who was the worlds most 
famous prisoner walked handinhand with his wife winnie through 
the gate of victor verster prison in paarl 35 miles from cape town 
under a brilliant blue sky the mandelas gave clenchedfist 
salutes to the hundreds of supporters who had waited for hours 
outside many of them waving green gold and black anc flags and 
wearing tshirts emblazoned with a youthful image of mandela 
mandela appeared solemn and dignified as he and winnie walked to 
a white bmw sedan and climbed in he broke into a broad smile as 
the car set off slowly in a policeescorted motorcade 
the decision to free mandela after a prolonged international 
campaign on his behalf was announced saturday by president fw de 
klerk eight days earlier de klerk stunned the nation by lifting a 
30year ban on the anc and announcing other reforms aimed at 
clearing the way for blackwhite negotiations 
de klerk who spoke at length saturday on mandelas release 
stayed out of the public eye sunday anton pretorius a de klerk 
spokesman said the president planned to comment on mandelas 
release later in the week 
government television however broadcast live mandelas exit 
from prison and later showed most of the anc leaders speech 
his elderly appearance probably shocked many south africans the 
majority of whom were born after mandela was last seen publicly in 
1964 
mandela has clearly lost weight since the 1960s both his face 
and his body are leaner than when he was a sturdily built boxer 
decades ago his face is creased with two thick lines that frame 
his strong confident smile 
mandela in his speech called de klerk a man of integrity who 
had gone further than any previous national party leader in 
accommodating black political aspirations 
but he said further steps including the lifting of the state 
of emergency and release of all political prisoners must be taken 
before talks can begin the anc shares these demands 
mandela was the last wellknown political prisoner in south 
africa six of his anc colleagues who had been imprisoned for more 
than 25 years including walter sisulu were released in octobr 
in the mid1980s mandela rejected offers to go free in exchange 
for a renunciation of violence de klerk abandoned this condition 
although he said after meeting mandela on friday night that he 
believed the black leader was committed to peaceful solutions 
zambian president kenneth kaunda one of the south african 
governments harshest critics urged the anc to suspend guerrilla 
actions in the wake of mandelas release 
but mandela told the cape town crowd the anc resorted to

gasoline prices are falling as temperatures 
around the nation are rising returning the market to its normal 
winter patterns industry analyst trilby lundberg said sunday 
gasoline prices normally drop in the winter and rise in the 
summer along with national driving patterns lundberg said sunday 
however they stayed higher than normal in january because 
unusually cold weather increased the demand for heating oil and 
crimped gasoline and diesel supplies at refineries she said 
when a warming trend moved across the nation in january gas 
prices fell again she said the result was a sixtenthsofacent 
decrease for all grades of fuel at gas pumps across the nation 
between jan 19 and feb 9 lundberg said 
the average price of all grades of gasoline at the nations 
stations was 11246 cents per gallon on feb 9 according to the 
national lundberg survey of stations across the country 
lundberg added it was too early to tell if last weeks spill of 
an estimated 400000 gallons of crude oil from a tanker off 
huntington beach would have any effect on future gasoline prices 
if any suppliers or marketers or dealers have been adversely 
affected we havent heard of it she said 
the average prices of gasoline at selfservice stations were 
10095 cents per gallon for regular unleaded 11838 per gallon for 
premium unleaded and 9927 for regular leaded 
the prices for fullservice stations were 12909 cents per 
gallon for regular unleaded 14251 for premium unleaded and 12734 
for regular leaded

the characters in richard nelsons some 
americans abroad are insufferable their actions at best trivial 
and at worst immoral 
but nelson is not portraying escaped convicts whitecollar 
criminals or even discredited politicians the object of his satire 
is a group of anglophile american academics and their students on a 
yearly marathon tour of british theater 
its a specialized group to skewer and if the scope of the 
play which which arrived sunday at the mitzi newhouse theater in 
lincoln center is narrow its aim is deadly and delicious 
these academics from a small unidentified american college have 
come to worship at the shrines of british drama particularly the 
national theater in london and that holiest of holys the royal 
shakespeare companys complex in stratfordonavon 
two events turn the tour into turmoil both problems must be 
solved by the chairman of the schools english department joe 
taylor played with a wonderful allenveloping smugness by colin 
stinton taylor is the kind of teacher who demands truth in 
literature if not in real life 
the chairman must tell a colleague who paid his own way over to 
cement his position at the school that his contract will not be 
renewed and taylor must handle an accusation by an unstable 
student that she was molested by a teacher 
nelson has great fun with these people as they race from play to 
play to play for them its quantity rather than quality that 
counts these intrepid theatergoers seem more concerned with seat 
location the food at intermission and how to divide the bill after 
dinner than with what they are watching on stage 
much of the evenings enjoyment comes from director roger 
michells snappy production cleverly designed by alexandra byrne 
the furniture and props for the plays 11 scenes hang precariously 
above the stage they are pulled down when needed while a jazz 
combo performs and then carted offstage when a scene ends 
most of the other performers are up to stintons high standards 
particularly effective are bob balaban as the nerdy assistant 
professor on shaky status john bedford lloyd as the pompous 
professor accused of attacking a student and frances conroy as 
another teacher trying to conceal an affair 
nelsons best scene occurs late in the play at a pizza hut in 
stratford no less where the chairman and two of his professors 
look at and then deny the mess they have created its hypocrisy at 
its highest and wonderfully acted by stinton bedford lloyd and 
conroy 
some 30 years ago noel coward wrote a wicked song called why 
do the wrong people travel for his musical sail away in it 
he poked fun at the ubiquitous american tourist who would have been 
better off and happier if he had stayed home much the same can 
be said for nelsons motley collection of pretentious academics

a group of progressive communists on sunday 
demanded a leading role in organizing this summers party congress 
and threatened otherwise to hold an alternative congress 
the group calling itself the communist party democratic 
platform adopted a statement that said the communist party central 
committee plenum last week did not go far enough in moving toward 
democratic reform 
while the plenum agreed to president mikhail s gorbachevs 
proposal to permit multiparty elections the group said it failed 
to democratize the election procedure of delegates to the party 
congress set for late june or early july 
the proposals formulated during the plenum have an 
inconsistent and contradictory character which is totally 
inadequate to meet the demands of the existing situation said 
the statement obtained by the associated press 
the elections of delegates should be direct according to 
platforms by secret ballot and with free nomination and 
selfnomination of candidates the democratic platform said 
the group which includes wellknown progressives such as 
central committee maverick boris yeltsin economist gavriil popov 
and historian yuri afanasyev 
yeltsin cast the lone vote against the plenums reform saying 
it did not go far enough 
the group called on gorbachev and other members of the partys 
ruling politburo to meet with the progressives to discuss their 
proposals for election of delegates 
if their proposal is turned down or ignored by the party 
leadership the democratic platform said it would begin planning 
for an alternative and genuinely democratic party congress 
that would raise the possibility of the creation of an 
opposition faction inside the party something the communist 
leadership has implacably resisted since the days of vladimir lenin 
last weeks plenum also condemned the vote by lithuanias 
communists to form a party independent of moscows control

thousands of washington teachers plan to play 
hooky tuesday and participate in marches and rallies across the 
state to protest a decision not to raise their salaries with a 
projected budget surplus 
as many as 35 of the states 296 school districts may shut down 
for the day because of the walkout expected by about 13000 
teachers and other education workers affecting 200000 students 
said washington education association president carla nuxoll 
about 8000 more members of the union also are to participate in 
rallies and marches over gov booth gardners decision to ignore 
the organizations request for immediate 10 percent pay increases 
we are going to the constituents and telling them that if they 
dont have adequately paid educational employees we arent going to 
be able to deliver an educational program said association 
spokeswoman teresa moore 
the 49000member wea represents more than 90 percent of the 
teaching force in the state including 42000 of the states 45000 
classroom teachers and about 7000 other staff members 
teachers in the seattle school district the states largest 
with about 43000 students 2500 teachers and 1500 other 
employees are among those expected to participate in the protest 
said nuxoll and the district is scheduled to be closed 
city schools superintendent william kendrick said in a statement 
that he understands the teachers frustration and strongly supports 
increased funding for employee salaries 
the idea for a walkout began with teachers in everett and 
edmonds after the legislature and gardner failed last year to make 
amends for salaries that slipped ever lower in the last 10 years 
moore said 
when gardner did not earmark any of a projected 611 million 
198991 state surplus for teacher pay raises support for the 
walkout grew nuxoll said the wea wants 300 million of the 
surplus to pay for salary increases for teachers and other 
education workers 
gardner washington house speaker joe king and senate majority 
leader jeannette hayner say they sympathize with teachers but the 
state doesnt have the money to meet their demands 
the education association left it up to its chapters statewide 
to decide whether to participate in the protest 
in the 1980s olympia always told us the money was short but 
that wed be first on the list when money was available now we 
arent even on the list said greg waddle northwest regional 
chairman of the wea 
in some districts school officials have expressed support for 
the protest the wea contends teacher pay in washington state has 
slid from fourth in the nation a decade ago to 21st 
nuxoll said the average annual teacher salary in the state last 
year was 29176 for a person with 12 years of experience a 
bachelors degree and 90 credits of postgraduate study about 500 
below the national average 
teachers received a 4 percent raise for the 198990 school year 
that was approved by the legislature last year and are slated to 
receive a 6 percent pay increase next school year 
the 18000 starting salary this year is not attracting new 
entrants to the profession nuxoll said 
were saying that whats at risk in this state is the ability 
to attract and retain the best teachers she said 
in olympia teachers plan a rally in the state capitol tuesday 
night as part of the protest rallies are also planned in spokane 
yakima and wenatchee

any federal court order to end sitins at 
selma high school and city hall would escalate racial tension 
stemming from the dismissal of a black school superintendent an 
attorney for the protesters said sunday 
us district judge charles butler in mobile scheduled a 
telephone conference for monday on a request from city attorneys 
for a temporary restraining order halting the protests which have 
kept all selma schools closed since wednesday 
it probably would escalate it a lawyer for the protesters 
jl chestnut said of a court order i dont think black people 
give a damn about an injunction 
butler said chestnut will be included in the telephone 
conference 
chestnut joined about 400 other blacks outside city hall on 
sunday for a march to the high school for the second straight day 
marchers made their way through a black neighborhood chanting no 
contract no school and aint going to let no injunction turn 
me around 
the high school and city hall were occupied for the fourth day 
in a row about 20 adults and 150 students were in the high school 
mayor joe smitherman said 
the racial turmoil began when six white members of the city 
school board voted feb 2 to dismiss norward roussell the citys 
first black superintendent the vote sparked protests leading to 
the closing of two schools tuesday and all 11 of selmas public 
schools wednesday 
roussell was reinstated after initial protests but students and 
other protesters want the school board to extend his contract 
which expires june 30 
roussell said sunday he was not sure how long schools will 
remain closed backing off an announcement last week that they 
would reopen monday he said he must meet with the school board to 
decide the matter and has not been able to do so 
rose sanders a selma attorney and one of the protesters said 
she was injured as a result of police brutality during a melee at 
smithermans office monday a preliminary city report said 
allegations of police brutality at the protest were unfounded 
mrs sanders said at a rally at the high school later sunday 
that the federal courts should not be used to undermine civil 
rights protesters 
i am willing for my children to lose a year in school so their 
children wont have to go through this 25 years from now she 
said 
protesters had planned both saturday and sunday to walk from a 
selma church to the edmund pettus bridge a landmark in the civil 
rights movement of the 1960s but organizers later changed the 
routes 
chestnut said sunday he did not see any sign from smitherman or 
other white community leaders that the protests will lead to any 
changes 
i dont think youve ever had good faith on both sides of the 
controversy chestnut said

the plo secretly endorsed a us plan for 
israelipalestinian dialogue a leading newspaper reported sunday 
on the eve of a meeting that could decide israels next steps in 
the middle east peace process 
the meeting monday of the 3500member central committee of 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud bloc is aimed at ending a 
power struggle in the rightwing party that has halted peace 
efforts by israels likudlabor coalition government 
the haaretz newspaper said the palestine liberation organization 
agreed to proposals by us secretary of state james a baker iii 
aimed at setting up elections in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip of palestinian representatives to peace talks 
a text of the agreement was placed on foreign minister moshe 
arens desk last week the newspaper said 
it said agreement was reached on three key points names of 
palestinian delegates to a preliminary meeting with israelis in 
cairo egypt the agenda for those talks and the method for 
announcing the delegates names no further details were given 
a foreign ministry spokesman denied knowledge of the document 
saying we are not aware of any such report on his arens 
desk 
israel television said two senior baker aides are to leave for 
cairo monday to prepare a meeting of the israeli us and egyptian 
foreign ministers as the first step toward the israelipalestinian 
dialogue 
shamirs top aide yossi benaharon said he was not aware of 
plans for such a meeting in cairo but confirmed arens was due to 
meet with baker in the next few days 
palestinians have been waging a 26monthold revolt against 
israeli rule of the occupied lands 
in violence sunday adnan assaf 45 died of gunshot wounds 
inflicted by soldiers in a clash in the west bank town of qabatiyah 
on friday arab reports said the army confirmed his death and said 
it was checking the circumstances 
assafs death raised to 655 the number of palestinians killed by 
israeli soldiers or civilians during the uprising at least 181 
other palestinians have been slain by fellow arabs as suspected 
collaborators and 43 israelis also have died 
at mondays likud meeting shamir demands a single vote of 
confidence in his leadership and his peace plan for elections in 
the occupied territories hardliners want several votes on 
controversial issues that threaten to split the party or even bring 
down the government 
i have no compromise formula apart from the evident one let 
the central committee decide what agenda it prefers shamir said 
sunday 
the squabble has produced two weeks of mudslinging between 
shamir and likud hawks but some analysts said the battle could 
still end in a compromise as did a likud rift last july then 
shamir delivered a hardline speech in exchange for his opponents 
refraining from speaking 
shamirs initiative was approved by the government last may amid 
american and european pressures to begin peace talks the plan 
calls for negotiations with elected palestinians on interim 
selfrule for the west bank and gaza later talks would decide the 
final status of the occupied lands 
but progress toward the elections of those representatives has 
been slow partly because likud hardliners have repeatedly tried 
to undercut the plan warning it could lead to an independent 
palestinian state

a communist party faction impatient with 
the pace of reform broke away sunday and formed its own party 
the alternative socialist party in its founding declaration 
called for private enterprise and limited government control of the 
economy 
the official bta news agency reported that as many as 600 people 
joined the new party

congress that chose moderate reformer alexander lilov as party 
chief and sought to present a more progressive image

over from longtime hardline leader todor zhivkov in november had 
made some moves toward reform including renouncing its 
constitutionally guaranteed leading role 
during the fourday party congress lilov and other top 
officials said the party had parted with stalinism and was 
embarking on a road of socialist democracy 
but members of the new party said the communist party was not 
moving fast enough on reform speakers at sundays meeting

speakers who called for the formation of the alternative 
socialist party received resounding applause from the 3000 
participants 
vassilev a philosophy professor at sofia university said the 
partys founding congress will be held by next month

a special about blacks flatly denied making the remarks but said 
he would rather accept the suspension than end his career at cbs

east germany in november her parents bought her a barbie doll 
now on her second excursion to the western world the 
sixyearold is getting wined and dined make that milkshaked and 
hamburgered by barbies corporate parents 
mattel inc manufacturer of the famous fashion doll brought 
miss polzin and her family over for a fiveday holiday in new york 
they will be guests at a blacktie affair mattel is hosting tonight 
to mark the beginning of the annual american international toy fair 
and to announce what the company is calling the barbie summit 
patricia wyatt director of marketing for girls toys at mattel 
said the company thought it was fitting to have miss polzin on hand 
when they revealed plans for the event that is to be held each year 
starting with the first threeday conference in new york during the 
week of nov 19 essay contests will be held for girls of varying 
ages to compete to become delegates 
through barbie we want to bring children from around the world 
together ms wyatt said speaking in the almost reverential 
tones mattel people use in referring to a toy that has been a 
musthave for many little girls since being introduced 31 years ago 
mattel reckons that enough barbies have been sold in the dolls 
lifetime that if placed head to toe they would circle the earth 3 
times sales of the dolls plus her entourage and their 
accouterments exceeded 450 million in 1988 and accounted for 40 
percent of hawthorne califbased mattels total revenue 
the summit will give children a forum to express their 
viewpoints and help them share their different cultures 
with one another ms wyatt said in an interview 
a new barbie summit doll appropriately available in four 
ethnic distinctions outfitted in a shimmering white ensemble will 
debut at toy fair an annual trade show proceeds from sales of the 
doll will be placed in a barbie fund which mattel will donate to 
childrens charities 
the towheaded miss polzin was tuckered out friday afternoon from 
a busy day of sightseeing shopping and a visit to rumpelmayers 
restaurant a favorite manhattan watering hole with the young 
icecream eating set but she handled an interview at her waldorf 
astoria suite with admirable aplomb and smiled sweetly for 
photographs 
it was a picture of a beaming anika clutching a new barbie that 
first attracted mattels attention 
we were very moved by the photo ms wyatt said it was 
nice to know that barbie transcended cultures 
the caption on the photo which appeared in newspapers around 
the world gave her name and hometown schwanefeld east germany 
it said she was photographed after a day of westernstyle shopping 
in helmstedt west germany 
mattels german affiliates easily tracked down miss polzin only 
a few inquiries were needed to trace her in schwanefeld a tiny 
village population 270 a few miles from the border with west 
germany 
miss polzin wearing a new dress and complementing hotpink 
tights said through an interpreter that she was enjoying her trip 
to the united states 
but signs of jet lag were still evident as she sat on a sofa 
beside minnie mouse she and her 10yearold brother maik and 
parents eva and inglof who works for the east german railroad 
arrived late thursday night from frankfurt on a flight courtesy of 
lufthansa airlines 
they already had been to the statue of liberty and outings to

measures to protect the 
environment should not jeopardize worldwide economic growth a 
highlevel panel of experts said here sunday 
there is no doubt that it is totally irresponsible to further 
postpone forceful measures to contain further damage to the 
earths environment said emile van lennep a former 
secretarygeneral of the organization for economic cooperation and 
development oecd 
but such measures should not lead to any unfair competition on 
the worlds markets said van lennep a member of a group of 
experts that met here to draw up a report for the interaction 
council 
the council founded seven years ago and chaired by former west 
german chancellor helmut schmidt is a looselyknit association of 
30 former heads of government who meet annually to discuss 
environmental issues such as population growth deforestation and 
energy supplies 
among the participants at the weekend meeting which was in 
preparation of next mays annual meeting in seoul south korea 
were former british prime minister lord callaghan and miguel de la 
madrid the former mexican president 
an important task for governments in the coming decade will be 
to take care of environmental conservation and at the same time see 
to it such conservatory measures will not be detrimental to 
economic growth van lennep said 
and he said that the group of experts here emphasized that the 
pricing instrument should be used as much as possible so that 
the environmental cost of a given product is reflected in its 
price 
van lennep said the experts voiced grave reservations 
against government subsidies to their local industries to cushion 
the effect of environmental costs on their products pricing 
the former oecd chief said the experts also would recommend a 
huge transfer of funds to third world and eastern european nations 
to gear their industries to environmental needs

czechoslovakias annual economic 
growth rate slowed to 17 percent last year while some six percent 
of the countrys citizens live close to the poverty line a 
newspaper said 
the annual growth dynamics of the gnp slowed to 17 percent 
down from 28 percent according to preliminary estimates mlada 
fronta quoted the official federal statistics report as saying 
the newspaper on saturday said the average growth rate in 
industrialized countries is estimated at 36 percent 
czechoslovakias national income the rough equivalent of gnp 
is 58o billion crowns or some 34 billion the report said the 
crown cannot be converted freely into dollars or other western 
currencies 
the report said high energy consumption in czechoslovakias 
inefficient economy as well as the sharply reduced output of the 
countrys military industry contributed to the growth slowdown 
vast amounts of idle stock roughly equivalent to one years 
gnp also have slowed the economy mlada fronta said 
in 1988 there were almost 900000 people whose average 
per capita income was lower than 1000 czechoslovak crowns 59 
thats on the verge of the poverty line the newspaper said 
the average monthy income for czechoslovakias 155 million 
population is 3200 crowns 188 up by 24 percent in 1989 from 
the previous year the report said 
czechoslovakias centrally planned economy which has timidly 
introduced some elements of market mechanism in recent years so 
far failed to produce notable results

arab banking corp bahrains largest 
offshore bank said it was setting aside its entire 1989 profit of 
132 million to cover potential loan losses 
abc which is owned by the governments of kuwait libya and abu 
dhabi said sunday the addition to its loanloss reserve was needed 
to reassure investors because the bank is planning a 250million 
share offering to boost its capital by 25 percent 
troubles with the banks latin american loan portfolio helped 
cause interest income to fall 14 percent to 327 million in 1989 
from 380 million in 1988 
the drop largely reflected nonpayment of interest by brazil and 
argentina said abdullah saudi the banks president and chief 
executive 
the drop in interest income was offset in part by an increase in 
fees and commissions which rose 30 percent to 179 million last 
year from 138 million in 1988 
operating profit before taxes minority items and loan loss 
provisions fell to 184 million in 1989 from 239 million 
saudi said the addition to reserves would boost the banks 
provisions for doubtful loans to about 40 percent of its loan 
portfolio 
saudi said the 250million share issue planned for the first 
half of this year will be listed in the bahrain kuwait and 
luxembourg stock exchanges 
funds raised through the share issue will go in part toward the 
setting up of a new abc european subsidiary saudi said 
the new company provisionally named abc europe will take care 
of abc branches in paris milan and london it is likely to be 
based in london 
saudi said he hoped the bank also would expand in the arab world

fastfood and soft drink giants expecting to be 
called on to help solve the nations solid waste problem are 
taking the unusual stance of supporting taxes on themselves in that 
endeavor 
companies such as pepsicola general bottlers inc mcdonalds 
corp pepsico inc and cocacola co are the leading users of 
polystyrene food containers aluminum cans and plastic and glass 
bottles 
and they have been feeling enough heat from consumers concerned 
about the garbage choking the nations landfills to suggest a tax 
on themselves by a government they believe will eventually tax them 
anyway 
in the last few months representatives of the companies have 
been working to draft proposals for legislation that would place a 
levy on their own use of unrecycled materials 
were trying to find a way to encourage recycling on a 
national level said malcolm chester vice president of public 
affairs for pepsicola general bottlers a subsidiary of 
chicagobased whitman corp and the countrys largest independent 
soft drink bottler 
but paul risley an aide to sen max baucus dmont head of 
the subcommittee planning hearings on the 1990 clean air act said 
the companies are drawing up their own proposals because theyre 
afraid of what might be included in a renewal of the recycling 
conservation and recovery act of 1980 
the bush administration had been expected to put specific 
recycling provisions in its budget proposal possibly a user 
fee or tax on virgin materials produced by paper mills plastic 
plants steel mills and glass manufacturers 
but senate sources said the administration would concentrate 
first on getting the clean air act passed by early summer 
if the federal government doesnt come with something this 
year it may be too late said sal porazzo director of 
environmental affairs at pepsicola co whose parent company also 
owns the kentucky fried chicken taco bell and pizza hut chains 
its already happening at the state level porazzo said 
about 10 percent of all beer and soft drink containers are being 
recycled but the number is moving up rapidly said chester of 
pepsicola general bottlers 
about 64 percent of the countrys growing mountain of solid 
waste is paper and paperboard metals glass and plastics 
according to pepsicola 
although pepsicola claims that soft drink and fastfood 
containers account for only 225 percent of that sold waste after 
recycling the public still sees them as the biggest solid waste 
problem 
cocacola is talking with the retail grocery trade and 
congressional staff members about several proposals including 
fess for the use of virgin material said spokesman randy 
donaldson were laying out alternatives and getting feedback 
oak brookbased mcdonalds the largest fastfood chain is 
talking to its suppliers about user fees for unrecycled materials 
as well said spokesman armando ojeda 
ojeda said the chain which recently announced plans to recycle 
waste from 450 restaurants in five new england states would like 
to see action on the user fees at a national level

travelers said the net loss of nearly 13 million in 1989 in

chrysler corp said sunday it will cut deeper 
into its salaried work force as it continues with an accelerated 
costcutting program 
the nations no 3 automaker in october announced a program 
designed to carve 1 billion in costs from its 26 billion budget 
by the end of 1990 at that time chrysler said 2300 salaried 
employees or 8 percent of its 31000member whitecollar work 
force would be removed from its payroll 
chrysler spokesman steve harris said sunday that more 
whitecollar workers would be cut through attrition he said he 
couldnt say how many positions the company planned to eliminate 
and he knew of no plans for further layoffs 
automotive news a weekly industry journal quoted unidentified 
sources in its mondays editions as saying the new round of cuts 
would remove 5 percent to 10 percent of the companys salaried work 
force in addition to those announced in october 
whitecollar reductions are becoming a way of life at 
chrysler harris said a certain part will come through 
attrition 
general motors corp and ford motor co have said they like 
chrysler constantly are reviewing their employment levels in 
1987 gm began its action plan to cut costs since then its 
original target has been raised to 13 billion by 1991 
ford has no formal costcutting plan similar to gms or 
chryslers 
the automakers will give better pictures of changes in their 
employment levels later this week when they report 1989 earnings 
the latest salaried workforce reduction at chrysler is likely 
to be met favorably on wall street said auto analyst thomas 
ogrady president of integrated automotive resources inc of 
wayne pa 
what i would be concerned about is what they are doing with 
the savings he said sunday if it is just to have a better 
bottom line thats not so good 
he suggested that the company funnel the money into product 
development there was no indication from harris about where the 
savings would be sent but if the job cuts were part of the overall 
costreduction program it would be unlikely that product 
development would get much 
auto analyst steve girsky of painewebber inc in new york city 
said the newest cuts should be well received 
i think this company is serious about slimming down he said
