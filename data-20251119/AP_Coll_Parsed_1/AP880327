the nations secondlargest city with its 
promisedland image of youth and opportunity is starting to show 
its age the effects of too many years of too much growth are 
increasingly evident in los angeles streets and freeways sewers 
and landfills 
while in many us cities the challenge is just to replace 
public works as they wear out los angeles faces the added 
pressures of californiastyle growth 
the stress has occasionally popped the citys overworked sewer 
system causing raw sewage discharges into the pacific ocean and 
prompting mayor tom bradley last fall to propose restrictions on 
the number of new sewer hookups 
on the regions streets and freeways daily trips will increase 
42 percent by the year 2010 according to a local planning agency 
motorists average speed of 31 mph systemwide today is expected to 
drop to 11 mph 
and without more landfills city and county officials say los 
angeles will produce thousands of tons more garbage daily than it 
can properly dispose 
our infrastructure has reached the point that it requires 
massive infusions of resources to maintain or to increase its 
capacity to deal with the population growth said edward j 
avila president of the citys board of public works 
i think los angeles has been lulled into a false sense of 
security said delwin a biagi an engineer who joined the citys 
public works department 17 years ago and who now heads the bureau 
of sanitation 
the city population is expected to swell 16 percent to 36 
million by 2010 according to the southern california association 
of governments in the surrounding sixcounty area the predicted 
growth is 47 percent to 183 million people in 22 years 
over the next 25 years we see a 50 percent increase in 
housing and jobs in the los angeles area said roger riga a scag 
transportation planner that means its going to cause some big 
problems with our transportation system its already overburdened 
we know that the question is what are we going to do about it 
rigas agency which predicted the growth in traffic also 
prepared a study in february that sets out three alternatives 
ranging in cost from 42 million to 110 million to alleviate 
congestion by locating jobs nearer to housing through growth 
management or changing driving patterns by carpooling or 
rescheduling office hours or constructing new highways and other 
facilities 
however california department of transportation officials say 
the problems are so intractable that doubling the number of 
freeways would not appreciably reduce traffic 
moreover a statewide study done by the governors 
infrastructure review task force indicates the pricetag would be 
billions not millions of dollars the task force estimated the 
states public works needs at 78 billion and projected a revenue 
shortfall of 50 billion to meet the demand 
increasing traffic and other effects of growth have stoked the 
political fires of los angeles antigrowth movement said laura 
lake an adjunct faculty member at uclas school of public health 
who heads a group called not yet new york 
all the people who support slowgrowth want to make sure that 
the infrastructure will still be there ms lake said the 
system is hemorrhaging and theyre coming up with very expensive 
bandaids 
her group supported city council candidate ruth galanter last 
year and the growthcontrol advocate was elected ms lake herself 
plans to run for a council seat in 1989 
local concerns reflect a nationwide problem 
last august a study of public works funding done for the us 
senate concluded as the federal government shifted priorities 
away from infrastructure financing new federal laws have mandated 
state and local compliance with new requirements for water 
pollution control clean drinking water and the cleanup of 
hazardous wastes 
another federal study concluded that as much as 90 billion a 
year is needed to pay for all types of public works repairs 
nationwide 
the problems it identified neglected and dilapidated bridges 
water systems highways mass transit systems and other facilities 
are consistent with what is happening in los angeles county 
supervisor mike antonovich said recently 
yet los angeles leaders postponed capital improvements to the 
sewer system for more than a decade while arguing over compliance 
with federal clean water standards 
the city was running away from its responsibilities said 
dorothy green president of an environmental group called heal the 
bay 
the dispute ended when the city agreed to stop dumping its 
treated sewage sludge offshore and to build a secondary wastewater 
treatment facility the primary wastewater plant was built in 1950 
the cost of compliance will be more than 23 billion over the 
next 10 years officials said 
los angeles also faces a looming crisis over its garbage which 
is thrown away at the rate of 45000 tons per day in the 
metropolitan area said mike miller manager of the citys solid 
waste task force 
the city itself which generates 18000 tons per day of that 
total already trucks 5400 tons per day to outlying county 
landfills miller said 
we have to find additional landfill space and we have to start 
recycling efforts miller said thats all weve got 
if no landfills are established the excess garbage will amount 
to 6400 tons per day by 1992 and 50000 tons per day by the year 
2000 miller said by 1997 there will be no landfills remaining 
within the city 
we havent been able to site a new landfill since 1974 
miller said listing five illfated proposals including 
trashtoenergy incineration plants 
the city council is very aware of the situation they just 
have no clearcut plan as to what theyre going to do

nineteen states have taken steps to change laws that govern the 
guardians who take on the personal and financial affairs of old 
people aiming to close loopholes and prevent abuse of the 
elderlys rights 
almost all the action has come since publication last fall of 
associated press stories about shortcomings in the littleknown but 
powerful system of guardianship under which hundreds of thousands 
of people deemed mentally incompetent have had their affairs turned 
over to someone else 
the series guardians of the elderly an ailing system 
which examined guardianship laws from a national viewpoint and in 
each of the 50 states and the district of columbia found a network 
of overburdened courts that routinely fail to monitor wards under 
their jurisdiction which often opens the door to physical and 
financial mistreatment 
legislation to strengthen guardianship protections has been 
introduced in arizona california colorado florida michigan new 
jersey ohio oklahoma and pennsylvania us rep claude pepper 
dfla has drafted a national reform law 
in addition studies of guardianship laws are under way in new 
york virginia mississippi and illinois court procedural changes 
have been made in alaska pennsylvania and washington state and 
the idaho senate is considering a resolution for a study 
five new laws in new mexico have already provided 755000 to 
set up private guardianship services adult protective services 
social workers inhome care and homemaker help for frail elderly 
and disabled adults and a demonstration program for counseling the 
elderly on guardianship medicaid and nursing home financial issues 
the indiana general assembly this year amended the state 
guardianship law based on recommendations from a longterm review 
by the probate code study commission the changes included 
requiring biannual review of a wards personal status in addition 
to his or her financial reports and increasing legal 
representation for the ward 
and earlier this month utah gov norm bangerter signed into law 
a package of guardianship reforms that was approved unanimously at 
the state house 
the reforms will require among other things that proposed 
wards receive written notice of guardianship proceedings that they 
be represented in proceedings by attorneys and that clear and 
convincing medical evidence be provided to prove incapacity in 
lieu of such catchall phrases as advanced age or 
confinement 
betty tatham chairwoman of the 21member panel that overhauled 
utahs guardianship law said the task force drew heavily on the 
aps guardianship research state and national in identifying 
problems with the states existing law and drafting the new one 
we want the state of utah to be a good place for retired 
people to live we think that this bill will have a positive impact 
on protecting the elderly in our society bangerter said 
in virginia a house committee earlier this month defeated a 
proposal to remove advanced age from state law as a reason to 
place a person under guardianship physicians in general 
disapprove of such terminology saying that it makes it too easy to 
link advanced age with incompetency without other factors 
considered 
but an opponent delegate clinton miller argued the change 
wasnt needed because virginia requires expert testimony on the 
persons mental or physical incapacity the ap stories on 
guardianship in virginia however found that expert testimony was 
often nothing more than a oneparagraph statement from a doctor in 
85 percent of the cases examined such brief statements were all 
that was used to establish incompetency 
concerning the states with proposed legislation 
two bills to amend arizona guardianship laws received almost 
unanimous support in committee but have been delayed by the 
impeachment trial of gov evan mecham one would require guardians 
to file annual reports on the wellbeing of wards the other would 
remove advanced age as a reason to declare a person 
incapacitated 
california lawmakers said the ap series prompted several new 
bills in the state assembly they would variously certify 
professional guardians require counties to educate guardians on 
their responsibilities and require petitions seeking guardianship 
to spell out what the elderly person is capable of doing and what 
the guardian would handle 
colorado gov roy romer is expected to sign a bill which he 
received march 8 that would require guardians to supervise their 
wards more closely its sponsors said the legislation was prompted 
by the ap state series on colorados lack of required review of 
guardianship cases 
both houses in florida are considering legislation to 
dramatically liberalize state guardianship statutes it would 
require more accountability from guardians attorneys examining 
committees doctors and courts 
the michigan senate is considered two housepassed bills one 
would require legal representation for proposed wards and periodic 
judicial review of cases to see if guardianship remains necessary 
the second bill would prohibit nursing homes from requiring 
residents to have guardians 
a new jersey senate committee has passed a bill that would 
require courtappointed attorneys to report every two years on what 
they have done for their wards other legislation pending in the 
legislature would require annual reports 
marie muhler who runs the states yearold public guardian 
office said judges began clamping down after the ap series i 
notice now that some courts are putting in strict guidelines for 
accounting she said in an interview 
the ohio senate may vote in may on its rewritten version of a 
housepassed bill overhauling state guardianship laws the proposal 
would limit the definition of incompetent by removing the term 
advanced age and require the appointment of investigators to check 
each case of alleged incompetency and explain their rights to the 
proposed wards 
an oklahoma joint conference committee is considering a bill 
that would change the state guardianship law to require more 
reporting and improve legal representation 
in pennsylvania legislation now in committee would refine the 
definition of incapacity provide lawyers for incompetent people 
without them and set regular review hearings the bills sponsor 
rep allen kukovich says similar legislation failed to reach the 
assembly floor in recent years but that this bill has better 
chances because of the ap series and the attention it brought to 
guardianship 
studies of guardianship laws are underway in several states 
in virginia such an overall study continues in the general 
assembly despite the defeat of the proposal to change wording in 
the existing law the study will also cover other protective 
services for the elderly and incapacitated 
the mississippi council on aging and the cook county public 
guardians office in chicago report they are working on 
guardianship improvements court officials in alaska washington 
state and pennsylvania say they have made some changes in 
guardianship procedures since the ap series 
a study of new yorks guardianship system called 
conservatorship is rather well along and findings may be 
available this summer according to the states top administrative 
judge albert rosenblatt the study was prompted by the attention 
the ap gave the issue rosenblatt said

eight years after chinas communes began 
splitting up and peasants returned to family farming the 2670 
farmerworkers of cao tan state farm still live and tend crops 
collectively 
they are still organized into pseudomilitary work teams and 
brigades once the basic units of all chinese agriculture like 
dairy worker wu jinlian who helps monitor milk quality each has a 
strictly assigned role 
i like it and i do it well miss wu 28 said proudly 
expressing disinterest in farming her own small plot like the mass 
of chinese peasants 
cao tan is one of 2300 staterun farms established in the 1950s 
and 1960s in imitation of the huge food factories stalin created in 
the soviet union as vanguards of communist agriculture 
most of chinas state farms were set up in remote border areas 
or on reclaimed wasteland as was cao tan which means grass 
sands 
gou xingwen head of the farms agriculture division said the 
farm site in xian in arid northwestern china had been a dried 
riverbed its not fertile too much sand he said 
but it produces 20 percent more grain per acre than the average 
family farm in the region because of heavy capital investment 
mechanization and guidance from the farms own small scientific 
research laboratory 
about 80 percent of agricultural production is mechanized 
boasted gou 
although state farms account for only 27 percent of chinas 
farmland they own nearly 8 percent of the rider tractors in the 
country and half the combine harvesters 
they have become chinas main producer of nonstaple food items 
such as eggs and milk and lead in agricultural exports 
their healthy performance highlights what is wrong with most of 
chinese agriculture 
by breaking up the communes china restored the work incentive 
to peasants but also brought back the main weakness of traditional 
farming plots too tiny for efficient production mechanization or 
use of advanced scientific techniques 
the use of tractors and other machines fell as did investment 
local governments now sink their funds into collective projects 
such as small factories while peasants tend to use the profits 
they control for the first time to build better homes and buy 
televisions 
as a result agricultural production has stagnated or even in 
the case of grain fallen 
at the state farms however collective control over profits has 
ensured steadier levels of investment allowed under deng 
xiaopings 1978 reform program to retain most of their profits the 
farms have reinvested heavily in equipment and fertilizer 
they have become showcases of what would be possible in chinese 
agriculture if tractors and technology were more widely used 
at cao tan for example the 1300 cows are fed a scientifically 
balanced diet that includes mineral supplements they are milked by 
machines at the rate of one cow every two minutes 
as a result milk production is among the highest in the country 
ten combines and nearly 100 tractors work the 9677 acres of 
land the dry sandy soil is treated with twice as much chemical 
fertilizer as that of individual farmers nearby resulting in the 
high crop yields 
the workers at cao tan also enjoy a higher standard of living 
than most family farmers nearby they live in brick row houses with 
concrete floors and cold water taps compared to the mudblock 
homes and packed dirt floors of nearby villages 
the average per capita income is 1270 yuan a year the 
equivalent of 343 more than double the national average for 
peasants 
cao tan has made some concessions to the new national policy of 
rewarding individual initiative instead of paying workers equally 
as in the past work teams now sign contracts with the farm and 
team members share bonuses when their production exceeds the 
contracted amount 
nonetheless some ambitious cao tan farmerworkers have left 
in recent years in hopes of getting rich as individual farmers or 
entrepreneurs 
about 20 leave every year gou said the people who have 
ability want to break the farm up and leave to go on their own 
the talented may leave but gou and other farm officials are 
convinced the farm will never be broken up because of its most 
valuable asset its machinery 
the machinery is of no use if the farm breaks up it cant be 
used by individual farmers gou said he predicted the movement 
to break up landholdings has run its course and china will begin 
rebuilding large farms to modernize its agriculture 
recent reports in the staterun media indicate a growing number 
of officials share that view 
the xinhua news agency and economic daily both recently urged a 
return to largescale farming one mayor was quoted as saying his 
town was encouraging families to form farming cooperatives 
in several counties families that want to work in factories 
have been allowed to lease their cropland to the most skilled 
farmers who accumulate large plots 
rural development experts are observing the experiments 
with great interest the china daily reported

us and panamanian soldiers still 
patrol the panama canal sidebyside but their once warm relations 
are strained by the prospect of a confrontation over strongman gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
president reagan has said the united states will not act like 
a colossus of the north and take military action here but the 
panamanian defense forces say if the americans do their 
ustrained and supplied troops are ready to fight back 
the defense force is prepared said martin paz spokesman 
for the 15000man force under noreigas command 
paz says the united states is aggravating tension between the 
two forces governmentowned national radio daily blasts the united 
states and warns of military aggression 
we are seeing a lot of maneuvers maneuvers which do not 
comply with the treaty said paz it is my impression that they 
are doing it to frighten us to terrorize us 
the united states wants noriega indicted by us federal grand 
juries on drug trafficking charges to resign and is tightening the 
economic screws on the country in support of a citizens campaign 
to oust the general 
the opposition hopes the defense forces will eventually turn on 
their discredited commander those hopes were raised saturday when 
bankers rejected a government demand for the 70 million remaining 
in their vaults and the cashstarved government was unable to make 
the defense force payroll 
there are growing pockets in the defense forces that are 
against noriega said opposition leader jose mulino but we 
dont know if they will act 
panama is home to the us southern command headquarters for 
all us military activity in latin america 
about half the 10000 us army air force and navy personnel 
are classified as combat troops their air backup includes corsair 
fighters blackhawk helicopters and c130 transport planes 
although the defense forces panamas only armed authority 
outnumbers the americans it has virtually no air force 
but the defense forces are not the ragtag affair they were 
before the 1977 treaty giving panama sole control of the canal by 
the year 2000 
since 1981 the united states has spent more than 100 million 
to make panama capable of defending the canal alone military 
observers say the panamanian troops are increasingly effective 
especially the new 800man battallion 2000 
the defense forces carry ussupplied m16s and wear battle 
dress uniforms virtually identical to the americans when they 
hurled tear gas at striking dockworkers the grenades were made in 
saltsburg pa 
enhancing the defense forces potential strength are paramilitary 
groups loyal to noriega 
observers here believe the 25000 automatic assault pistols the 
defense forces tried to buy in the united states this week were for 
the paramilitary groups 
noriegas former pilot who recently fled panama has said that 
16 tons of cuban arms were delivered to the mountains of panama for 
the generals last stand paz refused to comment on the defectors 
claim 
us military aid to panama was suspended by congress last year 
as the political situation began to deteriorate 
but under the treaty us and panamanian military police still 
patrol together stand sidebyside at the gates of shared bases 
and sit on boards that authorize troop movements around the canal 
theres a little tension said one us military policeman 
who asked not to be identified but we get along were 
professionals with a job to do 
until recently they also carried out joint training exercises a 
practice stepped up by noriega after he took command in 1983 
many panamanian officers are graduates of the us army school 
of the americas headquartered in panama city until it moved to 
fort benning ga in 1984 others trained at fort leavenworth one 
close noriega aide is a graduate of west point 
noriega began a massive shakeup of his forces after a failed 
coup on march 16 paz scoffs at the idea of another larger more 
successful mutiny and says only a few who wandered off the 
track were part of the abortive coup 
osvaldo velasquez head of panamas human rights commission 
said the dissidents are being harshly punished he said 11 arrested 
officers have been tortured 
the defense forces have detained us soldiers off their base at 
least three times since the failed coup us officials have 
ordered military personnel and their dependents not to go to panama 
city unless necessary 
whatever happens to noriega us military officials are worried 
about whether the defense forces and american troops can now 
achieve the smooth transition aimed at having panama take over the 
canal in 12 years

moslem extremists are expected to 
increase their influence on the iranian government during a crucial 
parliamentary election next month 
the april 8 vote also will prepare a new generation of leaders 
to take over after the aging ayatollah ruhollah khomeini dies 
hardliners such as interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi who 
has close links to proiranian shiite moslem militants holding 
foreign hostages in lebanon are expected to make some gains 
extremists have been coming out of the shadows in the last 
eight months or so said gary sick a former us national 
security adviser who specializes in iranian affairs 
theyre certainly being heard and are more prominent now he 
said in a telephone interview from his new york home its not 
clear how dominant a position they now have in the decisionmaking 
process but they have a tremendous impact and that could have an 
effect on the elections 
the candidates who will run for the 270seat singlechamber 
majlis or parliament will not be campaigning on party tickets in 
the western style because there are no formal political parties in 
iran 
but they represent factions that reflect various shadings of 
islamic radicalism in a contest for control of parliament which 
will play an important role in the postkhomeini era 
any election in iran is important sick said the most 
important thing is that the iranians do have reasonably open 
elections 
he added theres always a certain amount of fixing but 
considering theyre in the middle of a war and all the infighting 
among the hierarchy its interesting that theyre having an 
election at all 
membership of the majlis elected on a oneman onevote system 
has become increasingly controlled by the regime and only approved 
candidates can run about 20 million to 25 million people vote in 
iran 
the elections the third since khomeinis 1979 islamic 
revolution toppled the monarchy will be held against a backdrop of 
the 7yearold war with iraq the growing international isolation 
of khomeinis fundamentalist regime and worsening economic woes 
but the main issues in public at least will be land and 
industrial reform nationalization and social change 
among the candidates announced so far are parliament speaker 
hashemi rafsanjani hardline antiamerican radical hadi ghafari 
mohammed yazdi a former central committee member of the now 
disbanded islamic republic party 
tehran radio monitored in nicosia said that the candidates 
also included for the first time 34 women mainly from tehran and 
the northeastern city of mashhad one of the hotbeds of 
revolutionary islam 
rafsanjani prime minister hussein musavi president ali 
khamenei and chief justice ayatollah mussavi ardebeli as heads of 
identifiable factions have been maneuvering for months to shape and 
dominate the next majlis 
khamenei 48 is serving his second fouryear term as president 
and is constitutionally barred from running again in the next 
presidential election in 1989 
his political base was seriously weakened last june when 
khomeini disbanded the islamic republic party which the president 
headed 
khomeini 87 and reported in poor health said he disbanded the 
party the vehicle used by irans clerics to seize political power 
in the early days of the revolution because it was riven by 
factionalism 
rafansjani who also has strong support in the majlis is 
looking ahead to the presidential election and wants to replace 
khamenei with one of his allies 
with the nonislamic elements who helped put khomeini in power 
sytematically eliminated in bloody purges the only opposition 
party permitted is the freedom movement a tiny antiwar faction 
led by mehdi bazargan 
the veteran liberal politician was irans first postrevolution 
prime minister but he quit in protest against the storming of the 
us embassy in november 1979 by khomeinis loyalists 
despite constant harrassment he and his followers remain a 
faint voice of dissent 
the majlis has wide constitutional powers unlike the 
rubberstamp body it became under the late shah mohammed reza 
pahlavi but it has little decisionmaking power regarding the 
conduct of the war 
the council of guardians a 13member body dominated by 
conservative clerics has blocked parliamentary efforts to push 
through sweeping economic reforms underlining the conflict between 
the radicals led by musavi and others and the more traditionalist 
factions 
the traditionalist factions are linked to the bazaaris the 
wealthy merchant class who have survived under the revolution and 
who retain considerable economic and political influence 
but khomeini recently gave the majlis and the radicals a major 
boost with a series of edicts that widened state powers and control 
of the warbattered economy 
legislation on land reform and nationalization blocked by the 
council will now be resubmitted to the majlis and is likely to be 
become law 
this was a victory for the majlis and the radicals over the 
more conservative forces sick commented without saying so 
khomeinis edicts changed the constitution it wasnt coincidental 
that khomeini issued these edicts before the elections

a rally to protest reagan administration policy in central 
america drew 1900 participants and 250 counterdemonstrators sunday 
in st paul minn while 600 people rallied in los angeles there 
were no reports of violence or arrests 
we must demand an end to intervention and we must demand our 
government to stop lying to us anne winkler of the central 
america peace action committee told the st paul crowd 
after listening to speeches and singing songs for about an hour 
at the capitol the group marched to the nearby cathedral of st 
paul for a church service 
the service commemorated the assassination of salvadoran roman 
catholic archbishop oscar romero who was shot in a church march

stop repressive actions 
capt richard smith of capitol security said the antiwar 
protesters at the capitol numbered about 1900 a group of about 
250 counterdemonstrators was on hand and chanted 
proadministration slogans from the capitols side steps but there 
was no trouble smith said 
in los angeles a caravan of horntooting cars decked out with 
protest posters snaked 10 miles through city streets from downtown 
los angeles to the federal building in westwood where more 
demonstrators greeted them with cheers 
some passing drivers honked and flashed the twofinger peace 
sign in shows of support while other motorists shouted curses at 
the protesters estimated to number 600 
speakers at the rally sponsored by a coalition of los 
angelesarea peace groups praised the ceasefire agreement signed 
last week by nicaraguan contra rebel leaders and the leftist 
nicaraguan government 
but gary prevost of the nicaraguan solidarity committee told the 
st paul rally that it was premature to celebrate the agreement 
between nicaraguas rulers and the contras 
the united states government has not given up its goal it has 
not decided the nicaraguans are to live in peace he said

a leaking tank of propane gas ordered out of a 
pennsylvania town was safely emptied here sunday but delaware 
officials complained they never gave permission for the tank to be 
brought into their state 
were very upset because they didnt notify us they planned to 
move it and because of the hour they chose to move it john e 
wilson iii secretary of the state department of natural resources 
and environmental control said sunday 
herm bruce spokesman for the state emergency response team 
said amtrak officials had the tank and its explosive contents moved 
into delaware in the middle of the night an amtrak spokesman said 
the transfer was done after 530 am sunday 
delaware state officials learned of the shipment only because 
fire dispatchers in pennsylvania told their local counterparts 
across the line in delaware that the shipment was en route bruce 
said 
state police then halted four other tanks before they entered 
the state including two that also showed signs of minor leaks he 
said those four tanks were taken to eddystone pa where they 
were to be drained overnight police there said 
bruce stressed that the leaking tank problem was not a serious 
threat 
but residents in a sparsely populated area near the amtrak 
railroad yard here were advised to stay indoors for about five 
hours sunday as workers transferred the propane from the leaking 
tank into an intact one bruce said nearby roads also were closed 
as a precaution 
on friday train traffic was disrupted around ridley park pa 
when the leak in the tank was first discovered interstate 95 
which runs over railroad tracks at the spot the tank and four 
others were being stored also was closed for a time 
the tanks about 50 feet long and 6 feet in diameter are used 
by amtrak to hold propane that fuels heaters during wintertime to 
thaw out track switches said amtrak spokesman clifford black 
it appeared the leak in the one tank was successfully capped 
friday evening black said but another leak was discovered late 
saturday afternoon and once again rail traffic and interstate 
traffic were suspended 
he confirmed that the tank had been transferred to delaware on 
sunday but said he didnt know anything about the charges that 
state officials had not been notified he said the tank left ridley 
park about 530 and arrived in delaware about an hour later 
two of the four tanks that were returned to ridley park have 
small leaks but are not an imminent danger black said sunday 
ridley park fire chief raymond l lonabaugh said saturday that 
he ordered amtrak to remove the leaking tank the tank was 
disconnected from the other tanks and loaded onto a railroad car 
lonabaugh said 
lonabaugh said two amtrak employees were injured friday night 
when they tried to cap the leaking tank without donning protective 
clothing or respirators but black said he didnt know about any 
workers being injured

michael dukakis has laid out plans to establish 
himself as the democratic presidential frontrunner by building up 
a lead of 250350 delegates over his nearest challenger targeting 
delegaterich new york pennsylvania and new jersey 
in addition the dukakis organization hopes to reap delegates 
from what it sees as two rival campaigns about to collapse as well 
as pick up support from super delegates and others now counted 
as uncommitted 
i think that theres a magic number in this process in terms 
of what kind of distance is going to be adequate to separate a 
frontrunner from second or thirdplace candidates in this 
process said tad devine who handles delegate selection for the 
massachusetts governor 
that magic number is probably somewhere between 253 the 
unpledged number of delegates from congress and 362 the number of 
votes on the democratic national committee 
the strategy wont guarantee the nomination for dukakis but a 
strong delegate lead would encourage party leaders and uncommitted 
delegates to rally round the leader to avoid the spectacle of a 
deadlocked convention in july 
dukakis with 597 delegates currently is locked in a threeway 
race for the delegate lead in the democratic presidential race 
holding a narrow edge over jesse jackson at 585 and a wider 
margin over tennessee sen albert gore jr at 363 
devine said he believed it was a real possibility that 
dukakis could pick up the 1500plus delegates he needs to clinch 
the democratic nomination as early as may 
but an aide to gore echoing the statements of other campaigns 
said it was all but impossible for anyone to have the nomination 
won before the seasons june 7 finale the california and new 
jersey primaries 
i dont think its in the cards for any candidate to have 
anywhere near 2082 delegates by june 7 said rick hutcheson who 
follows delegate selection for the gore campaign 
in private dukakis aides are willing to discuss specifics 
outlining how the campaign plans to do in each of the remaining 
states however neither the jackson or gore campaign want to talk 
about their prospects in such detail jacksons campaign declined a 
request for an interview 
we havent designated any state as a makeorbreak state for 
us and were not going to hutcheson said instead were 
focused on a steady accumulation of delegates both by participating 
in the processes and by wooing as we have done successfully to 
date a good many of the super delegates 
the dukakis campaign hopes to deliver a onetwo punch by winning 
the new york primary on april 19 and the pennsylvania primary on 
april 26 a total of 359 delegates are at stake in those two 
northeast states 
there are real opportunities for one candidacy one candidate 
in this process to move up from the pack devine said the 
break point in this process to put together a nomination is between 
april 19 and april 26 
in addition 253 members of the house and senate are to be 
chosen as super delegates in democratic caucuses april 1920 on 
capitol hill other super delegates who hold seats automatically 
at the national convention because of their positions in the party 
or government include members of the democratic national 
committee democratic governors and former party leaders 
that week is almost a mini super tuesday devine said 
so i see that as a time when a candidate must put some distance 
between himself and his competitors 
the only place where a competitor could make up a lot of ground 
in one spot is new jersey with 109 delegates at stake but dukakis 
is strong there devine said california with 314 delegates at 
stake is the largest single primary for the democrats but the 
rules are structured that big delegate gains there by any candidate 
over another are unlikely he said 
a total of more than 300 national convention delegates now 
committed to missouri rep richard gephardt and illinois sen paul 
simon would be up for grabs if those two candidates whose 
campaigns are fading drop out of the race 
im not predicting that either simon or gephardt is going to 
get out of this race in the immediate future devine said im 
just saying that i think that the pressures to sustain a candidacy 
without putting on the board delegates are going to be substantial 
and maybe insurmountable

refuse to take questions i have an opening statement i thought 
nancys performance was absolutely wonderful raisa top that

jesse jackson won michigans primarylike 
caucuses on saturday blowing past michael dukakis for an 
industrial state victory that tightened the democratic presidential 
race for richard gephardt third place meant the end was near for 
his white house hopes 
jackson defeated dukakis by almost 21 by running strongly 
across the state and winning huge majorities in detroit that broad 
support meant the preacherturnedpolitican scored a delegate 
plurality as well 
today is a message of hope jackson said in milwaukee 
people are responding to authenticity and message and soul over 
just money and mechanics 
this is not my night alone he said when we the working 
people stand together we win and we make america stronger 
it was a disappointing night for dukakis who has been tried to 
break away from jackson to become the frontrunner for the 1988 
nomination 
i dont think i did very well in michigan the massachusetts 
governor said as he congratulated jackson 
the news was not all bad for dukakis as he picked up a win 
saturday in north dakota and was gaining strength in the iowa 
county conventions 
for gephardt the michigan miracle did not happen aides had 
said the missouri congressman probably would withdraw from the 
presidential race and file for reelection to his house seat with 
such poor results 
were going to go home tomorrow and meet with our family and 
well have some word for you the first of next week gephardt 
said in milwaukee we havent decided anything were going to go 
home and have a family meeting 
however a missouri state party leader state rep anthony d 
ribaudo said he spoke with gephardt by telephone late saturday 
and that dick gephardt has informed me hed like to proceed with 
his career in congress the congressional seat becomes his no 1 
priority 
ribaudo the missouri house majority leader said he was told 
gephardt would fly monday to jefferson city mo to file for 
reelection even while keeping his presidential candidacy alive in 
some form 
with returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in michigan 
jackson had 107689 or 55 percent to 55337 or 28 percent for 
dukakis gephardt had 24995 or 13 percent 
sen paul simon of illinois had 4069 for 2 percent and sen 
albert gore jr of tennessee had 3818 for 2 percent neither man 
put significant resources into the state 
jackson won enormous majorities in detroit in the 1st 
congressional district jackson beat dukakis 25427 to 1808 and in 
the 13th the margin was 17715 to 1536 
the michigan raw votes translated into national convention 
delegates initial calculations gave jackson 61 dukakis 43 
gephardt 22 and 12 undecided among the 138 pledged delegates 
in north dakota the precinct caucus results made this the 
preliminary split for national convention delegates dukakis 5 
jackson 3 and gephardt 2 five would go as uncommitted delegates 
these results tightened the delegate race a bit in the ap 
delegate count dukakis has 59655 to jacksons 58455 gore had 
3628 delegates gephardt 178 simon 1715 and uncommitted 3716 
now we can talk about twin bills double headers and that 
sort of thing said joel ferguson jacksons state coordinator 
i think were going to take the majority of congressional 
districts which we consider a major victory 
weve got lots and lots of contests up ahead dukakis said 
this is a marathon and its going to continue to be a marathon 
theres much to do and there are many miles to go 
dukakis won in north dakotas precinct caucuses where the 
process of picking 15 delegates to the national convention was just 
beginning 
he picked up strength in the iowa county conventions while 
gephardt slipped gephardt won the feb 8 precinct caucuses there 
but he was trailing dukakis in returns from the county meetings 
the next step in the complicated delegateselection process 
turnout in michigan was much higher than in 1984 when about 
123400 democrats voted democratic party chief rick wiener said 
the total would top 200000 
gephardts hopes for a win were hurt by the refusal of national 
labor union leaders to fall in behind his candidacy he 
particularly felt the failure to win an endorsement from the united 
auto workers big supporters of gephardts trade policies and the 
biggest union in the state 
dukakis built an impressive organization in this industrial 
state where he hoped a win would give him a lions share of the 
delegates as well as a popular vote victory the organization a 
heavy dose of television advertising and backing from detroit mayor 
coleman young helped give the massachusetts governor the lead in 
the polls 
you just tell them to go with the guy with the eyebrows and 
well have a very good saturday dukakis told the polishamerican 
century club in hamtramck mich referring to his distinctive 
heavy eyebrows 
jackson whipped up fervor across the state with large 
enthusiastic rallies and a bit of television advertising 
the talking is over its time to work jackson said in 
pontiac everybody who even looks 17 or older they are eligible 
to vote 
michigan residents who are 17 but who will turn 18 by the 
general election may vote in the caucus 
the caucus was actually a limited primary voters merely had to 
show up at the poling places provide michigan identification 
declare their democratic allegiance and then vote 
michigan republicans split up their 77 delegates at their state 
convention two months ago giving the lions share to george bush

democrat richard gephardt who had tried 
to restart his presidential campaign in michigan said saturday he 
would meet with his family sunday to decide whether he would pull 
out of the race and run for reelection to congress 
gephardt running in third place in returns from michigans 
caucuses behind jesse jackson and michael dukakis on saturday had 
said he needed to do well in michigan to sustain a candidacy that 
took off in iowa but stumbled in the south on super tuesday 
were going to go home tomorrow and meet with our family and 
well have some word for you the first of next week gephardt 
said late saturday we havent decided anything were going to 
go home and have a family meeting 
however missouri state rep anthony d ribaudo the missouri 
house majority leader said late saturday that gephardt will file 
monday for reelection to his congressional seat although he will 
keep his presidential candidacy alive in some form 
ribaudo said he spoke to gephardt who informed me hed like to 
proceed with his career in congress the congressional seat becomes 
his no 1 priority 
tuesday is the deadline for gephardt to file as a candidate for 
reelection to congress from missouri although aides said he could 
file for reelection and remain a candidate for president his 
showing in michigan increased the chances he would drop out of the 
presidential contest 
gephardt joined the other democratic presidential candidates in 
speaking to wisconsin democrats at the partys annual statewide 
jeffersonjackson dinner in milwaukee 
he said there was no question that his long bid for the 
presidency was worthwhile a quest that he said throughout the day 
had taken him to 49 states in 24 months of campaigning 
campaign manager bill carrick said no decisions about the future 
of his campaign would be made before sunday the mood among 
gephardts forces was somber and there appeared to be a feeling of 
resignation to events that had not gone gephardts way 
asked whether he would decide sunday gephardt said i really 
dont know 
gephardt leaped to the top of the democratic field when he won 
iowas caucuses feb 8 he forged a plurality victory in that 
leadoff event through widely acclaimed television ads and a strong 
populist message that prompted critics to charge he had switched 
positions on an array of issues in an effort to appeal to 
disaffected voters gephardt based his campaign on his call for 
tough trade policies with foreign countries 
he finished second in new hampshire and won south dakota but 
won only his home state in the 20state voting on march 8 
earlier saturday gephardt crossed paths with three other 
presidential candidates dukakis and sens albert gore jr and 
paul simon in wausau wis as they campaigned toward wisconsins

an estimated 50000 young people 
jammed the streets of this desert resort saturday for traditional 
spring break revelry watched closely by a reinforced police 
presence 
at least 15 arrests occurred during the day mostly for 
trespassing in hotels or public drunkenness on top of roughly four 
times as many arrests friday night 
another 15 arrests mostly for public drunkenness were reported 
in the evening as the young visitors took to their cars and created 
gridlock 
the traffic right now is backed up past the aerial tramway 
which is several miles out of town said sgt ron starrs adding 
that no major disturbances were reported 
the 100degree heat kept many partying high school and college 
students indoors earlier those who chose to saunter under clear 
skies wore bathing suits shorts tanks tops as little as 
possible said police officer karen holtz who estimated the 
number of visitors at 50000 in a city with a population of 36000 
larger problems took place friday night when police made about 
60 arrests mostly for public drunkenness and disturbing the peace 
and wrote about 200 citations lt lee weigel said 
there were a couple of disturbances but nothing out of 
hand ms holtz said when you have alcohol involved mouths 
start getting bigger and guys start thinking theyre tougher than 
they are 
police have beefed up their forces with the help of the 
california highway patrol and riverside county sheriffs deputies 
to prevent a recurrence of the rock and bottlethrowing melees of 
two years ago that ended with nearly 600 arrests 
in addition sheriffs jail and transportation officers have 
been hired for the week and 10 agents from the state alcoholic 
beverage control board will be on the lookout for liquor sales to 
minors officials said 
during the 1986 spring break hundreds of vacationing youths 
went on a good friday rampage hurling bottles at police tearing 
clothes off young women and briefly taking over the main street of 
town 
to prevent a recurrence last year palm springs distributed 
45000 pamphlets to local schools and colleges warning that 
visitors were expected to obey the law a strengthened police force 
awaited vacationers including 40 officers from the riverside 
county sheriffs department and the california highway patrol 
the result was 708 arrests and 4943 misdemeanor citations 
issued for such infractions as stepping off the sidewalk into the 
street and riding a bicycle without reflectors but crowds were 
generally wellbehaved officials said despite one episode of 
bottlethrowing that dented a police car

an israeli court on sunday sentenced mordechai 
vanunu the former nuclear technician who spilled his countrys 
atomic secrets to a british newspaper to 18 years in prison for 
treason and espionage 
a threejudge panel announced its sentence in a closeddoor 
session at jerusalems district courthouse shortly after hearing 
sentencing arguments from both sides 
vanunus trial has been shrouded in secrecy since it began in 
september officials said an open trial would harm state security 
the crimes for which vanunu was convicted carry a maximum death 
penalty in israel however prosecutors said earlier they would ask 
for a life sentence which in israel is limited to 20 years the 
court lightened that sentence by two years but its reasons were not 
made public 
according to israeli law vanunu could be released on good 
behavior after 12 years legal commentators said early release was 
unlikely given the nature of vanunus crimes 
defense attorney avigdor feldman said he plans to appeal to 
israels supreme court 
vanunu 34 was convicted last week of treason and espionage for 
telling the sunday times of london israel had nuclear weapons 
a jewishborn convert to christianity vanunu worked for 10 
years at israels nuclear facility in the southern desert town of 
dimona he then left israel smuggling out photographs he took from 
inside the facility 
in october 1986 vanunu handed over the photographs and details 
about israels nuclear program to the sunday times based on his 
information the newspaper reported israel stockpiled the worlds 
sixth largest nuclear arsenal 
israel never responded directly to allegations of its nuclear 
capacity saying only it would not be the first country to 
introduce such weapons into the middle east 
several days after the newspaper published his revelations 
vanunu disppeared from london 
how he returned to israel was never revealed but his family said 
he was lured to rome by an american woman named cindy then 
kidnapped by israeli agents and spirited home to stand trial 
during a pretrial appearance last year vanunu managed to flash

government to release vanunu 
during sentencing arguments sunday judges refused to allow an 
american expert on international law testify for the defense 
the expert richard falk of princeton university in princeton 
nj said he was shocked the court refused to let him testify and 
criticized vanunus convictions on treason and espionage charges 
individual conscience is more important in the nuclear age 
than the security of the state falk told reporters the state 
can be wrong 
vanunu has testified he made his revelations to alert the middle 
east and the world to the dangers of nuclear weapons not for 
personal gain or out of a desire to harm his country

tamil youths looted and torched at 
least 25 moslemowned shops and businesses in the eastern town of 
kalmunai police and residents reported sunday 
a police officer at the kalmunai police station speaking on 
condition of anonymity said members of the liberation tigers of 
tamil eelam the largest tamil militia were responsible for the 
attack saturday about 125 miles northeast of colombo 
but a roman catholic priest in nearby batticaloa said the 
looting was done by unemployed tamil youth who were released late 
last year from jails after being detained as political suspects 
there are scores of these tamil youths in the east they are 
jobless and penniless said the priest who also spoke on 
condition he not be identified they grab every opportunity to 
make a fast buck this is a growing problem in the entire area 
the police official however claimed the attack on moslem 
establishments was a part of a grand design of tiger rebels to 
drive sinhalese and moslem civilians out of the eastern province 
he said that more than 1500 moslems fled kalmunai after the 
attack and sought refuge in mosques and schools in nearby areas 
tamil militants have been blamed for killing more than 125 
people most of them sinhalese civilians in the eastern province 
since march 2 when the latest round of violence erupted 
officials say tamil militants are engaged in driving away 
sinhalese and moslem residents of the eastern province to ensure 
complete dominance in the region 
most of the tamils are hindus sinhalese are mostly buddhists 
although some of them are moslem 
tamil rebels claim the government is deliberately resettling 
members of the majority sinhalese community in the east to upset 
traditional tamil control of the area 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
say they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who control 
the government and the military tamil rebels are fighting for a 
separate homeland in the northern and eastern provinces where most 
of them live 
india and sri lanka signed a peace accord last july to end the 
tamil ethnic crisis but tamil tigers have not honored the pact 
more than 50000 indian peacekeeping troops are in sri lanka to 
disarm the rebels and enforce the peace accord that grants some 
autonomy to the tamils

yasser arafats fatah guerrillas have 
taken control of lebanons largest palestinian refugee camp after a 
twoday wave of violence left five people dead police said sunday 
the latest victims were a fatah guerrilla and a palestinian 
woman killed saturday in a shootout at the ein elhilweh camp on 
the outskirts of this southern port city police reported 
they said guerrillas of abu nidals radical fatahrevolutionary 
council opened fire on the fatah fighter identified as haitham 
diab when he failed to stop at an one of their checkpoints in the 
sprawling shantytown 
diabs killing touched off a brief firefight between arafats 
supporters and abu nidals guerrillas in which the woman passerby 
badea oweida was killed police said 
there have been frequent clashes between supporters of arafats 
palestine liberation organization including fatah and rival 
syrianbacked factions as well as abu nidals group 
police said the latest wave of violence that flared friday 
prompted the plos proarafat military police known as the armed 
struggle corps to take charge of ein elhilwehs security 
on friday gunmen ambushed the motorcade of farid hourani 
fatahs military commander in the camp killing him and two of his 
bodyguards nine other hourani aides were wounded 
police said there was no link between fridays ambush and 
saturdays shootout 
but the two incidents have led to an agreement to turn over 
the camps security to the armed struggle corps a police 
spokesman said 
units of the force patrolled the camps narrow alleyways on foot 
and in jeeps sunday without challenge from arafats rivals police 
said 
the agreement was reached during a meeting late saturday between

less than a month before the filing deadline 
fewer than half of americans have finished their tax returns but 
refunds are bigger the irs is doing a better job answering 
questions and taxpayers are making fewer mistakes than had been 
expected 
im happy to report that so far the filing season is going 
much as we had predicted and hoped irs commissioner lawrence b 
gibbs tells audiences 
the internal revenue service is almost 3 percent behind last 
years pace in processing returns but blames that chiefly on 
taxpayers slowness in filing this year officials say there is 
nothing to signal a repeat of 1985 when faulty computer programs 
set off a chain of events that resulted in the worst filing season 
in modern times 
through march 18 476 million returns had been logged at the 10 
irs service centers just under 35 million had been processed 
more than seven of every 10 returns are qualifying for refunds 
25 million refunds totaling 20 billion an average of 809 apiece 
the number of refunds is down slightly and the average is up a bit 
from 1987 
so far this year about 44 percent of the 107 million expected 
individual returns have been filed at the same stage last year 
the irs had received almost 46 percent of the 104 million that 
eventually were filed 
the irs has come under heavy criticism for having given the 
correct answer to only 748 percent of taxpayers calls for 
assistance earlier this year but in recent weeks gibbs says the 
accuracy rate has crept up to nearly 78 percent as telephone 
assistors become more familiar with the new law 
perhaps the most surprising statistic is that taxpayers are 
making only 2 percent more mistakes than they were at this time 
last year according to the most recent estimate thats nearly 55 
million errors a number that had been expected to be far higher 
since this is the first year that returns reflect the massive 1986 
tax revision 
the low error rate comes despite reports that many taxpayers are 
finding some of the changes much more confusing than congress 
anticipated 
one possible explanation is that most of the confusion comes 
from tax changes that affect moreaffluent taxpayers such as 
complicated new forms for calculating passive losses and taxes on 
childrens income 
these taxpayers are less likely to qualify for refunds and 
thus are in no hurry to file their mistakes likely would come 
later in the filing season 
the new law cut tax rates increased the personal exemption to 
1900 boosted the standard deductions for nonitemizers and 
reduced or eliminated several deductions 
but most of the mistakes are not resulting from those changes 
taxpayers instead are having problems with their arithmetic 
misreading the tax tables and misunderstanding a new provision that 
prevents one person from being claimed as a dependent on two tax 
returns 
one of the most common mistakes on the singlepage form 1040ez 
which may be used only by single taxpayers whose taxable income is 
under 50000 is on the bottom line many users of this form as 
well as some who file the longer form 1040a are unable to 
subtract actual tax liability from the amount withheld and get the 
correct answer 
a common error among itemizers is incorrect addition or 
subtraction on schedule a where deductions are listed on 1040a 
and 1040 some are unable to multiply the number of personal 
exemptions by 1900 and get the correct answer 
some mistakes are clearly a result of carelessness many filers 
of 1040a are neglecting to write how much tax was withheld other 
taxpayers use the wrong income figure for determining how much tax 
they owe 
but the most common mistake is a misunderstanding of the 
standard deduction and personal exemption allowed a taxpayer who 
can be claimed as a dependent by someone else this affects a 
student with some income whose main support is provided by a 
parent or a parent supported by a son or daughter 
a single person who cannot be claimed by another gets the full 
2540 standard deduction and the full 1900 personal exemption 
but a student for example who can be claimed by a parent gets no 
exemption and may be entitled to a standard deduction of as little 
as 500 depending on income 
some taxpayers are neglecting to answer whether they may be 
claimed by another others are taking the wrong standard deduction 
if the irs can correct your errors such as arithmetic or 
failing to take the correct standard deduction it will 
but the irs will put your return aside and write you for more 
information if for example your schedule a deductions dont add 
up you neglect to say whether you may be claimed as a dependent by 
another you dont sign your return or your neglect to attach your

the recent elections have 
further polarized politics in el salvador and handed a major defeat 
to the political center cultivated by the united states as an 
antidote to extremism 
the rightist victory in legislative and municipal elections 
march 20 sets the stage for the escalation of leftist guerrilla 
conflict in this country already ravaged by eight years of civil 
war 
the nature of preelection violence which included car bombs 
and clubwielding masked youths rampaging through the capital 
augured badly for those who had hoped that six years of civilian 
rule by the christian democrats would promote moderation in the 
search for solutions to el salvadors problems 
no country in the hemisphere gets more us assistance than el 
salvador which president reagan has held up as an example of 
success in washingtons avowed policy of fostering democracy in 
latin america 
this massachusettssized country of 5 million people received 
about 550 million in us military and economic aid last year 
us assistance has totaled 35 billion since 1981 
a rightist party linked in the early 1980s to death squads 
responsible for thousands of political murders won a landslide 
victory in the municipal and legislative elections 
liberty is written with blood el salvador is the tomb 
where the reds will meet their end goes the party anthem of the 
republican nationalist alliance or arena 
the party captured a majority in the 60seat national assembly 
and most of the countrys municipalities 
sigifredo ochoa perez a retired army colonel and one of the 
partys ideologues wednesday called for a crackdown on leftists 
active outside guerrilla ranks 
in the 10 days before the vote leftwing university groups and 
labor organizations staged several antigovernment marches in the 
capital the marchers their faces covered with bandannas and 
carrying twobyfours studded with nails commandeered buses to 
block side streets burned telephone exchange boxes and set fire to 
several vehicles 
police exercised restraint resorting only once to tear gas to 
disperse the demonstrators 
we cannot allow this to continue the destruction of state 
property private property ochoa said on a morning tv news 
program we have to impose law and order 
for their part marxist guerrillas waging the stalemated war 
against the centrist christian democratic government plan to 
broaden their campaign according to rebel documents captured by 
government forces 
the documents outline a plan the guerrillas call fire it 
calls for formation and indoctrination of mass organizations 
mostly among students and labor union people to deepen the 
crisis 
its authors reportedly members of the guerrilla general 
command said the governments options to increase repression or 
continue allowing the demonstrators to act with relative impunity 
both favored the revolution 
if they crack down on a big scale the insurrection will 
increase in response to the repression and if they do not 
insurrection will advance as a result of the crisis and hunger 
it says 
it says if fire succeeds in forging a mass front 1988 
provides circumstances propitious for the seizure of power 
guerrilla commander joaquin villalobos predicted last tuesday 
that as a result of the election the country will become 
ungovernable 
speaking on radio vencermos the rebels clandestine station he 
said the rightist victory favored the rebels by giving the people 
a clear choice 
alfredo cristiani president of arena told the associated press 
his party would try to hammer out with other parties in the 
assembly a peace proposal to submit to the guerrillas 
if the guerrillas do not accept the proposal which will be 
the result of a national consensus they do not leave any other way 
out but a military solution he said he indicated that would 
mean steppedup combat 
ruben zamora vicepresident of the democratic revolutionary 
front told the ap wednesday he did not believe the vote indicated 
the electorates shift to the right the revolutionary front is 
allied with the guerrillas and declined to take part in the 
elections 
what happened was that the electorate punished the christian 
democrats for all the promises they did not fulfill he said 
president jose napoleon duarte was elected in 1984 on a platform 
of ending the war and improving the average familys lot the war 
continues unemployment is about 40 percent and inflation is 
running at about 40 percent annually 
the victory improves arenas prospects in presidential elections 
set for next march 
adolfo rey prendes the frontrunner for the christian 
democratic presidential nomination told reporters if arena 
takes power other parties possibilities will be diminished the 
democratic process will be restricted

in roman catholic areas of west 
belfast british soldiers with rifles cocked patrol grimy streets 
whose graffitifilled walls boast of irish republican army killings 
a fiveminute drive away the center of the city bustles with 
shoppers after nightfall dozens of bars restaurants and 
nightclubs come alive with northern irelanders determined despite 
19 years of conflict to enjoy themselves 
like beirut belfast is a city compartmentalized by sectarian 
strife and shadowy armed factions calling themselves 
paramilitaries the front lines are the street junctions where 
workingclass catholic and protestant neighborhoods adjoin 
murderous rampages this month at two ira funerals in which five 
people died inflamed the nerves of a city that has lived with 
violence for nearly 20 years of the socalled troubles 
on both sides of the sectarian divide there is frustration 
anger and a longing for peace for some years with the violence 
in a sharp decline and signs emerging of economic rejuvenation 
optimists dared to hope belfast was getting a fresh chance but 
with the latest violence and no sign of a political solution many 
people now talk of leaving 
the outlawed ira and its legal political wing sinn fein remain 
committed to ending british rule and uniting the 
protestantmajority province with the overwhelmingly catholic 
republic of ireland 
the protestants under the banner no surrender are equally 
determined to keep northern ireland in the united kingdom 
a cartoon in dublins irish times noted that while ceasefires 
were being discussed in nicaragua and afghanistan in northern 
ireland after almost 20 years of fighting we are discussing the 
policing of future funerals 
the sense of conflict neverending is shared by young people who 
have known nothing else 
im really fed up with the trouble on both sides said 
gail mccann 23 a student at queens university in belfast 
when i get my degree i think ill go away and work if things 
keep going like this theres no future here 
ms mccann was part of a huge and mainly protestant crowd which 
thronged the grounds of city hall on thursday for a memorial 
service for two british corporals who were beaten up and stripped 
almost naked by mourners at an ira funeral on march 19 and then 
shot dead by ira gunmen 
the murders climaxed two weeks of rising tension after british 
commandos shot dead three ira guerrillas who were unarmed but 
allegedly plotting a bombing in gibraltar 
on march 16 a protestant gunman attacked mourners at the 
guerrillas funeral in the catholic milltown cemetery killing 
three people and wounding 68 the soldiers were murdered at the 
funeral for one of the milltown victims an ira man 
i dont want to be called irish anymore a government 
architect who identified himself only as ivan said at the memorial 
service where some people brought british flags and wreaths bearing 
the initials of queen elizabeth ii 
its savage bestial i cant see any future ivan said 
i think until children are educated together it wont change 
most northern ireland schools are segregated according to religion 
bring back capital punishment for both sides shouted a 
middleaged man but start with sinn fein chimed in a young 
man 
three miles away in the heart of catholic west belfast an 
elderly man stood at the door of the andersonstown social club an 
irish nationalist haunt overlooking the garbagestrewn parking lot 
where the soldiers bodies were dumped 
its just another day to us theres still plenty of 
tension he said 
on andersonstown road where the soldiers were seized two 
unemployed catholics objected to the fuss about the murders 
to them the real outrages were in gibraltar when commandos 
reputedly from the elite special air service unit opened fire on 
unarmed ira members and in milltown when the protestant let loose 
with pistol and grenades 
the sas men who killed the three will get a medal so why 
dont they give a medal to the men who killed them two soldiers 
asked one who gave only his first name liam 
its been the same for the last 20 years depression and 
frustration said francis mccann 29 theres nothing they 
catholics can do about it but they wont take abuse anymore 
on the catholic falls road the latest graffiti makes sas stand 
for stripped and shot on the adjoining protestant shankill 
road a fresh slogan says three dead with one stone the 
milltown gunmans name is michael stone 
in prosperous north belfast where middleclass protestants and 
catholics live peacefully side by side 26yearold karen mccomish 
said you can forget about it here to a certain extent 
but after the events of last week its hard to deal with but 
its either that or get out she added 
bigname london stores have moved in to central belfast nearly 
200 new restaurants and several dozen nightclubs have opened in the 
last three years and tourism is up 14 percent 
but the fear endures its so bad i want to go away says 
mary eakin a public relations executive but my husband says

april fools day was the date of the first two 
save the pun dinners but good friday falls on april 1 this year 
causing mass confusion among punsters 
instead the dinner is sharing april 4 with the oh punning 
day of the chicago white sox joked joyce heitler the dinners 
organizer well both have a ball 
heitler is head of the chicago chapter of the international save 
the pun foundation 
why save the pun because its in danger of extinction she 
said 
but heitler made it clear during an interview saturday that the 
pun still is very much alive at least in her conversation 
well have everything on the menu from soup to nuts but we 
promise not to serve soup to nuts heitler said 
we would have had alphabet soup but we didnt want guests 
groping for words she added 
more than 200 punsters are expected to attend the dinner at 
which the foundation will celebrate its 10th anniversary and 
present its first punster of the year award 
we asked members to send us their votes and there were a 
great many votes for president reagan they feel america is safer 
with a ray gun in the white house said john crosbie founder 
and chairman of the bored at the foundation which he says has 
78000 members worldwide 
reagan didnt win but the identity of the awards recipient is 
being kept a secret until the dinner 
crosbie a toronto writer and marketing consultant said in a 
telephone interview saturday from his canadian home that there also 
is a serious side to puns 
statistics tell us that one in five people in the united 
states and canada is functionally illiterate and if we can get 
kids to see the fun there is with words we can get them interested 
in reading he said 
teachers and professors are using our newsletters in the 
classroom and getting students to enjoy reading said crosbie 
who publishes a newsletter for punsters that costs 19 a year 
heitler who teaches kindergarten at a roman catholic school on 
the citys north side said her pupils like puns and she uses them 
in the classroom 
heitler who also works as a clown magician and publicist 
thinks english is the best language for punsters because almost 
every word has a double meaning and punsters delight in twisting 
the language 
while she acknowledges many people cannot stomach puns or 
punsters heitler notes that punning has been around for centuries 
and says the ranks of famous punsters include groucho marx 
shakespeare and queen elizabeth i 
shakespeare had 1062 puns in his plays noted crosbie

more than 7000 residents were 
evacuated and 14000 ordered to stay indoors sunday while dutch 
army explosives experts defused a huge bomb from world war ii 
no one was injured in the operation in a densely populated 
residential district life returned to normal after authorities 
removed the bombs ignition shortly after 4 pm 
sundays 315 million operation involved more than 2000 police 
and city officials it was the largest evacuation since 1953 when 
massive floods in the southwestern netherlands killed more than 
1700 people 
at least 14 people were arrested for ignoring the order to stay 
indoors 
authorities also vacated an indoor skating rink to accomodate up 
to 700 pets whose owners insisted on their evacuation but only 
four cats a dog and a handful of birds were taken there said city 
hall spokesman ben van der schaaf 
the 1000pound bomb was dropped by a typhoon bomber of the 
british royal air force on nov 29 1944 during what was meant to 
be a precision raid on the local headquarters of the nazi security 
service or sicherheitsdienst 
the building 500 yards from the site of sundays operation in a 
densely populated innercity district was only slightly damaged in 
the raid and most of the 61 killed were local residents 
the raf bomb tore into a back yard only a few yards from an 
apartment block it was soon forgotten and lay buried more than 30 
feet deep until a resident reminded city hall of its presence 
during renovation work last may 
all residents living within 300 yards of the bomb were 
evacuated police searched their homes to make sure they were 
empty shut off gas and water mains and sealed front doors 
all residents living 300 to 600 yards away were ordered to close 
their doors and windows draw their curtains and stay indoors 
two army explosives experts using a 50yard rope then unscrewed 
the ignition of the 5footlong bomb said their chief maj 
adriaan sprangemeijer 
the tensest moment of the defusing operation came as the pair 
had to leave their heavily armored cabin to pull out the ignition 
with a pair of forceps sprangemeijer said 
its scary said 16year old daniella barto as she leafed 
through a magazine at the energy hall sports center where about 
350 evacuees were spending the day 
daniellas father jozef barto said he remembered the 1944 
bombing raid by four typhoon squadrons of the rafs 14th wing 
it was terrible but at least i came through ok said 
barto a 69yearold retired bicycle repairman 
although the authorities had launched a massive media effort 
weeks in advance of the operation police said they had to break 
open more than 100 homes of people who were not there and had not 
handed in their keys in advance

as they fight a 23count indictment the key 
figures in the irancontra affair may take a cue from two watergate 
burglars and assert a good faith belief that the white house 
gave them a lawful covert mission to perform 
bernard l barker and eugenio r martinez paved the way for this 
defense by winning reversal of their convictions for a burglary 
they conducted on assignment from the nixon white house 
the 1976 appellate court ruling said the trial court erred by 
preventing the two watergate foot soldiers from putting forth the 
good faith defense at their trial 
daniel e schultz the lawyer who represented barker and 
martinez said in an interview that irancontra defendants richard 
v secord and albert hakim would have the best chance of asserting 
the defense 
secord and hakim were private businessmen recruited by a white 
house aide oliver l north to secretly arm the nicaraguan contra 
rebels when such assistance was banned by congress and to arrange 
for covert arms shipments to iran which were authorized by 
president reagan 
schultz said north also might be able to use the good faith 
defense because he has asserted that he received lawful directions 
from his superiors his boss at the national security council 
john m poindexter and the late cia director william j casey 
i never carried out a single act not one in which i did 
not have authority from my superiors north told the 
congressional irancontra committees last july 7 
the fourth defendant poindexter would have a difficult time 
using the defense schultz said as norths boss at the nsc 
poindexter was at a level where he was making decisions rather than 
taking orders 
in fact poindexter told congress july 16 that he personally 
approved the diversion of profits from the iran arms sales to the 
contras and kept the decision from the president 
secord and hakim have excellent arguments on a good faith 
belief of participating in a lawful activity said joseph 
digenova the former chief federal prosecutor for the district of 
columbia and now a private attorney 
their orders were from high government officials its clear 
in cases like this that hakim and secord will be able to argue they 
had authority to do this 
the independent counsel will want to show their perception of 
authority was skewed by their desire to make money 
the indictment accused the defendants of embezzling more than 
17 million from the arms sales to iran the difference between 
the 30 million paid by the iranians and the 122 million turned 
over to the us government 
the grand jury said the defendants conspired to secretly and 
deceptively divert millions of dollars from those profits the 
indictment said that secord hakim and north personally profited 
from the diversion and that the nicaraguan contras received 
assistance in violation of a congressional ban on such aid 
barker and martinez were convicted in the september 1971 
burglary at the office of daniel ellsbergs psychiatrist dr louis 
j fielding ellsberg was a former defense department official who 
leaked the secret pentagon papers that were critical of the vietnam 
war 
the two burglars were part of a secret white house unit known 
as the plumbers that was established to investigate leaks of 
classified information they also were among the men who broke into 
the democratic party offices in the watergate building in 
washington 
barker was a former cia operative and martinez was on a cia 
retainer when they were recruited for the fielding burglary by a 
white house official e howard hunt 
after their conviction they appealed successfully to the us 
court of appeals for the district of columbia they argued the 
trial judge erred when he refused to admit the defendants claim of 
a good faith reliance on hunts authority to assign them to a 
lawful operation after the reversal the government declined to 
retry the defendants who had pleaded guilty and served time for 
the watergate breakin 
in the 21 appellate opinion judge malcolm richard wilkey 
wrote there was abundant evidence in the case from which the 
jury could have found that the defendants honestly and reasonably 
believed they were engaged in a topsecret national security 
operation lawfully authorized by a government intelligence agency 
schultz said that successful use of the good faith defense must 
depend on the background and knowledge of the defendant asserting 
it 
in the barkermartinez case the appellate court recognized that 
the assignment from hunt was entirely consistent with the 
defendants prior covert missions 
both testified at trial that they had no reason to question 
hunts credentials the appeals court said he clearly worked 
for the white house and had a wellknown background with the cia 
during the entire time they worked for the cia neither barker nor 
martinez was ever shown any credentials by their superiors not 
once did they receive written instructions 
nevertheless they testified their understanding was always 
that those operations had been authorized by the government of the 
united states 
hunts instructions and actions were in complete accord with 
what their previous experience had taught them to expect 
in the irancontra case secord a retired air force major 
general had expertise in covert missions that prior experience 
including the way he received assignments could determine if 
there was a red flag for him in the irancontra affair schultz 
said 
schultz said poindexter would have a problem with the good faith 
defense because the higher someone rises in job responsibility 
the more suspect your claim of lack of knowledge about legality 
north is somewhere in the upper middle schultz said hes 
not the legal adviser hes an operational man he can present a 
very credible picture of someone who had every reason to believe 
the irancontra decisions were lawful 
if hakim was not accustomed to covert operations in which the 
authority of the supervisor is rarely questioned he may actually 
have a weaker case schultz said without having received such 
assignments he could be expected to raise questions about 
lawfulness schultz said

abraham lincoln paid just 1500 for 
the only house he ever owned but nearly 150 years later 22 
million has been spent to fix it up before its reopened to the 
public this summer 
back at that time he got a good buy for his money said 
gentry davis of the national park service it was a corner lot 
and a prime location with easy access to downtown 
a threeyear renovation of lincolns twostory frame house will 
enter its final phase wednesday when workers remove a vinyl 
polyester shroud that cloaked the structure and allowed restoration 
to continue through the winter 
workers then will put the finishing touches on the exterior and 
begin grading and landscaping 
at this point were on budget on time and on schedule 
said richard a lusardi the park services maintenance chief for 
the project it will be ready for the grand reopening june 16 
once it reopens park service officials expect a tourist boom 
with the number of visitors swelling from the 500000 average of 
past years to as many as 1 million annually 
lincoln was 35 a prosperous lawyer and a former state 
legislator considering a bid for congress when he moved his family 
into the house in 1844 five years after it was built 
he and his wife mary todd lincoln and their four sons lived in 
the house until 1861 when he moved to the white house 
the house administered by the park service since 1972 has 
undergone several renovations most recently in the 1950s but the 
current effort stresses historical accuracy 
features added after lincoln left for washington have been 
removed the park service has installed fire detection and 
suppression systems burglary monitors and humidity controls but 
they are neatly disguised 
the exterior has been painted in an authentic color for the time 
mocha brown insulation and a vapor barrier were installed in the 
walls which were replastered 
the interior is being refurnished with exact reproductions of 
wallpaper and rugs 
the furniture had suffered ultraviolet light damage and the 
house had no air conditioning prior to the restoration causing 
glue joints to dry out and separate said larry blake the park 
services site chief for visitor services 
some additional period pieces are being added to fill out the 
house they are mostly knickknacks and accessories on bureaus for 
example to add a livedin look 
to ensure the restoration is as accurate as possible restorers 
analyzed paint and reviewed records of shops where the family 
bought household goods 
its almost like trying to solve a mystery blake said 
you have to do a lot of detective work 
the finish on the woodwork for example was a very dark 
varnish but a paint analysis showed it should be offwhite and 
the change has been made 
every day a new question comes up that doesnt have an easy 
answer said davis superintendent of the lincoln home for the 
park service 
one of the biggest surprises for restorers was the discovery of 
a cache of documents inside a kitchen wall the items which will 
be displayed at the house date to the 16th presidents days as a 
congressman and include part of an envelope addressed and signed by 
lincoln four letters to him and a printed antislavery speech 
the cost of the renovation is being borne by taxpayers not by 
tourists a stipulation in the will of robert lincoln the 
presidents oldest son who deeded the property to the state of 
illinois prohibits visitors from being charged

the reagan administration has spent more than 
70 million since 1981 trying to persuade americas teenagers to 
abstain from premarital sex a small sum in an era of 
trilliondollar budgets 
but theres a problem says american civil liberties union 
attorney janet benshoof she charges the money from the adolescent 
family life act is going to religious organizations to promote 
their beliefs a clear violation of the constitutional separation 
of church and state 
our position is this is a statute which funds religious 
organizations to teach sex education said benshoof head of the 
aclus reproductive freedom project 
since you cant fund these organizations to teach math this 
is unconstitutional theyre blatantly funding religious groups 
to teach not only religion but antiabortion propaganda 
the federal department of health and human services disagrees 
and the case goes before the us supreme court on wednesday the 
arguments indirectly pit the aclu against president reagan an 
outspoken proponent of what he once called my adolescent family 
life program 
a decision in the case is expected some time before the courts 
july 3 summer break it should provide a first look at newly 
appointed justice anthony m kennedys views on family life 
questions 
currently 82 organizations split 10 million in federal money 
under the program each applicants program is reviewed for 
religious content before funds are shipped more than half is spent 
to assist pregnant teens 
at least one organization has lost its funds in the past three 
years for crossing the bounds out of the secular domain 
the adolescent family life program has been under fire since 
1983 two years after the bill was sponsored by former alabama sen 
jeremiah denton and quickly approved by congress 
denton a staunch reagan republican believed it provided an 
alternative to planned parenthood and could reduce teenage 
pregnancies but opponents derisively termed it the federal 
chastity act denton said he feels the acts goals are still 
valid 
there should be a place if the federal government gets 
involved as it has with planned parenthood which permits a 
churchaffiliated group to work with a child he said adding he 
was disheartened the case had gone this far 
its ok to say no denton continued i dont think its a 
rightwing nut idea i just hope the idea doesnt go away 
the programs impact around the country is uncertain figures 
from the national institute for adolescent pregnancies indicate the 
number of annual teenage pregnancies remained at about 1 million 
for 1986 and again in 1987 
in legal briefs filed in the supreme court action the 
government acknowledged some serious problems in the 
churchstate area of the family life program but claimed they have 
been corrected there was no further ontherecord comment from the 
government 
it is in litigation and we have a policy about not commenting 
on cases in litigation said nabers cabaniss deputy assistant 
secretary for population affairs in health and human services 
through it all the bill has never lost the support of reagan 
who called a us district court decision which struck down the 
program as a perversion of the first amendment which mandates 
separation of church and state 
benshoof in turn blames reagan for much of her organizations 
busy schedule over the past eight years 
since 1980 reagan has obviously used his power over executive 
agencies to implement antiabortion laws whether or not congress 
has approved them she said 
as evidence she pointed to a case still in litigation involving 
health and human services regulations issued jan 29 which limit 
access to information about abortion at more than 4000 federally 
funded family planning clinics 
the changes violate the first amendment and turn health 
officials into mouthpieces for the reagan administrations 
antiabortion ideology she charged when filing suit against the 
regulations

this northeastern florida city has a 
booming economy a revitalized downtown and an active community 
leadership and now a new ordinance may help reduce its stench 
if theres one issue that transcends this city rich and poor 
black and white its the odor issue said firstterm mayor tommy 
hazouri odor is the only issue keeping us from being a 
worldclass city 
few of the citys 610000 residents whove lived with the 
industrial odor for four decades would argue that the air needs 
cleaning 
ill tell you exactly what the air smells like its like 
being locked in a portolet at the county fair theres no 
escape said homeowner jeanne oster 
you never get used to it said yellow cab driver joe greene 
i pick people up in my cab at the airport and coming down 
interstate 95 the smell hits them and it gets real quiet and i 
think to myself i wonder if they think i belched wrong 
hazouri has made a stink about the stench in his eight months in 
office demoting the citys pollution control chief hiring eight 
more odor fighters pumping up his legal staff to take polluters to 
court and forming a smell strike force with duval state attorney ed 
austin 
and last tuesday the city council passed hazouris antiodor 
bill 
violations of the law can be criminal offenses punishable by up 
to 60 days in jail and a 500 fine or civil cases with penalties 
of up to 10000 the law also levies 50 fines for 41 other 
offenses 
this ordinance will get the job done the mayor said 
the mayor blames the lions share of odor on two pulp mills 
seminole kraft and jefferson smurfit and three chemical plants 
scmglidco organics reichhold and union camp 
but the companies say they have spent millions on odor control 
and are being picked on 
the administration has zeroed in on the pulp mills and 
chemical plants as the bad guys said seminole kraft general 
manager frank lee adding that the firm has spent 7 million at the 
plant to control odors but there are other contributors 
including landfills and sewage plants 
the mayors concept is so motherhood and apple pie no 
rightthinking person would ever say im for odor but pulp 
mills have always had odor problems and always will lee said 
if the mayor has his way completely i dont think the pulp mills 
and chemical companies could stay open 
under the new law if five people in five households complain of 
a smell and an inspector can validate the complaints and track the 
odor down the city can impose fines 
you may as well call it the lawyers relief act of 1988 
george robbins president of scmglidco said of the new ordinance 
whats objectionable odor if you get five guys together and 
they complain about the smell of hamburgers coming out of a 
mcdonalds is the city going to fine mcdonalds 10000

a survey of college presidents indicates women 
may have trouble combining marriage with a climb to the top of the 
academic ladder 
in a survey released sunday by the american council on 
education 90 percent of male college presidents but only 35 
percent of the female presidents said they were married 
excluding nuns priests and other members of religious orders 
it said the difference narrows somewhat among the lay 
presidents 93 percent of men but 49 percent of women were 
married 
the women presidents were more likely to be divorced 11 
percent compared with 3 percent of the men 
the survey indicated the typical college president is white 
male married and 53 years old 
the council sent questionnaires in 1986 to all 2822 accredited

a wild bash celebrating the 100th 
anniversary of the cherished cable cars 15 years ago was so much 
fun san francisco is doing it again 
any excuse for a party goes in this town and the excuse monday 
is the centennial of the powell street lines the picturesque 
junior circuit to the older california street line 
the city marked 100 years of tipsy trolleys in 1973 with 11 days 
of parades nightly parties speeches and plenty of jazz in these 
more austere times the occasion will be marked by a single parade 
a 40aplate benefit lunch for the homeless 15000 balloons and a 
giant birthday cake 
presidents on the campaign trail movie stars on location and 
millions of tourists and san franciscans have rumbled up and down 
powell during the past century enjoying breathtaking vistas on 
some of the citys steepest slopes one of the lines climbs past 
chinatown to fishermans wharf with a view of famed alcatraz 
island 
during the years there were spectacular accidents and annoying 
breakdowns and dramatic changes as neighborhoods shifted from one 
ethnic group to another and buildings went up and came down 
through it all the cable cars groaned and squeaked along the 
hills at 9 mph the two powell street lines now carry about 41000 
passengers a day 
you could have seen a lot of change from these cars over the 
past 100 years says gripman phillip shaw whos seen his share 
in 26 years plying powell only the hills stay the same 
shaw worked the gears and clanged the bells for presidents 
eisenhower and nixon but wasnt around when soviet leader nikita 
khrushchev came for a ride in 1959 
fellow gripman john shipman a 15year veteran says the job 
never gets dull its the same line but every trip is different 
because of the people its an adventure besides im a skier so i 
love the hills the steeper the better 
hyde and mason streets where the two lines run are just right 
for him with 12degree grades in some spots 
powell street is where perennial bellringing champ carl payne 
chimes through town delighting riders with his melodies at night 
when fog creeps over the city there isnt a more soulful sound 
than the muffled peals of a cable car bell 
the powellmason line opened a few months before incandescent 
lamps made their debut in the city at the bijou theater today the 
path of the maroon gold and white trolleys is aglow with lights 
in earlier days humphrey bogart hopped aboard the powellhyde 
line as the man with the new face in dark passage and author 
dashiell hammett stepped on near johns grill 
the great earthquake and fire of 1906 destroyed most of the 
tracks and the lines powerhouse and barn but 27 cars outside the 
fire zone survived unscathed and the line was restored 
the cable cars became symbols of this frontier citys eccentric 
and indefatigable spirit enchanting tourists and winning the 
hearts of many san franciscans 
when bureaucrats bus companies and unenchanted citizens 
complained over the years about accidents and inefficiency cable 
car boosters have joined to save the lines from destruction 
the most vocal and earnest was freidel klussman a neighborhood 
mover and shaker who will be remembered monday when mayor art agnos 
proclaims it freidel klussman day

dominos pizza promises delivery in 30 
minutes or less but some of the nations neighborhoods are so 
violent the company wont let its drivers venture into them 
its not worth risking a driver for a 10 pizza said robert 
rutick night manager for the dominos store in irvington 
at least three dominos drivers were killed last year 
recent incidents such as a driver being robbed of a pizza at 
gunpoint and the throwing of rocks and bottles at cars led to the 
cutting off of night service to parts of irvington just west of 
newark where some neighborhoods are so dangerous theyve never had 
any service 
the only times we stop delivery to an area is when there have 
been a number of incidents said rutick 
delivery constitutes the majority of dominos pizza sales with 
only a small amount of takeout business many dominos outlets 
around the nation do not offer any eatin service 
in camden across the delaware river from philadelphia service 
is limited to only a few welllighted areas with roundtheclock 
security like hospitals and the rutgers university campus said 
robert lermanis night manager for a store that serves parts of 
camden and burlington counties 
many drivers are leery of delivering into camden because its 
a highcrime area lermanis said we couldnt get anybody to 
work here if we went into camden 
customers whose areas are cut off are told they can always come 
to the store to pick up a pizza said dennis obert security 
director for the dominos region that includes southern california 
hawaii arizona and nevada 
one driver was killed in oberts region last year when three 
gang members confronted him after he delivered a pizza in san 
bernardino calif 
john gomez night manager for a store in san bernardino said 
the crime rate in the city 50 miles east of los angeles is 
staggering even compared with his native new york city 
most of my drivers are scared anyway gomez said but i 
understood myself coming from a lowincome family that those people 
deserve the same service as the rest of the city we just have to 
tell them because of the area we cant deliver at night 
dominos policy is not shared by at least one of the national 
parcel delivery services but they would not normally deliver at 
night 
we have no company policy against not delivering to certain 
areas said betty todd a customer service agent at federal 
express regional headquarters in memphis tenn our couriers 
deliver to the address on the package 
our couriers dont carry money its not like pizza deliverers 
who might have 25 on them to make change 
united parcel service offices in newark and new york city were 
closed sunday and officials could not be reached for comment 
in chicago dominos manager donnie crown said he wont allow 
drivers in certain large areas 
the cops didnt tell us not to go there its just common 
sense crown said citing incidents where delivery people had 
been robbed at gunpoint 
ron hingst a spokesman for the main dominos office in ann 
arbor mich said there was about one securityrelated incident 
for every 400000 deliveries last year 
dominos has a 3yearold program of having a security director 
in each of its 13 regions to teach delivery people and managers 
ways to avoid becoming a crime victim 
such advice includes being wary of telephone numbers with a 
fourth digit of eight or nine which usually indicates the call was 
placed from a telephone booth 
in some instances police have posed as drivers to capture 
wouldbe assailants in areas where a rash of attacks and robberies 
have occurred 
however obert said most departments dont have the time 
two people were killed in the companys southeast region last 
year said larry jerue regional head of security in atlanta 
in one case in vicksburg miss a delivery man was killed after 
being robbed of two pizzas and 4 five people apparently disposed 
of the body and spent the money on beer to go with the pizza 
investigators said 
we kind of mirror society jerue said violent crime is 
going up and unfortunately weve had drivers shot and killed

shepard nevels opponents to be 
national convention delegates for michael dukakis from floridas 
18th congressional district had the name recognition and 
experience but nevel had the energy the buses and the chicken 
salad on rye 
the 28yearold assistant dade county attorney won a trip to the 
democratic national convention in atlanta in july with a landslide 
margin in a 14candidate field 
florida democrats met in caucuses saturday in the states 19 
congressional districts to select people to represent the 
presidential candidates who earned delegates in the march 8 
primary the lowkey atmosphere of the caucuses was in marked 
contrast to the excitement and media hype of super tuesday 
theres not the same adrenalin and excitement about this that 
there was about super tuesday nevel said comparing the caucuses 
to the mixed doubles coming after the mens championship at 
wimbledon 
nevel president of the dade county young democrats club had 
some secret weapons veteran miami beach getoutthevote 
organizer harry mildner and his father joseph nevel a civic 
activist and owner of the famed wolfies delicatessen 
the number of delegates for each presidential candidate was 
decided by the popular vote march 8 but delegates werent listed 
on that ballot 
the popular vote in the 18th district which includes miami 
beach heavily latin hialeah and a predominantly black section of 
miami and is represented by 87yearold rep claude pepper gave 
dukakis two delegates and jesse jackson one 
nevel who has been doing volunteer work in political campaigns 
since 1976 but had never been a delegate faced opponents for the 
dukakis slots including hialeah mayor raul martinez two state 
legislators a popular former lawmakers and two city commissioners 
they will win on name recognition im hoping that ill be 
more motivated than they are nevel said as he ate breakfast 
early saturday 
nevel had picked dukakis a year earlier although he disagrees 
with dukakis on foreign policy issues such as not aiding nicaraguan 
contra rebels he admires the massachusetts governors progressive 
social record 
nevel hosted a 30ahead fund raiser for dukakis and cohosted 
a 250 fund raiser later he also volunteered six to eight hours a 
week organizing and working telephone banks 
soon after the super tuesday results were known nevel shifted 
his attention to the delegate race one problem was most of his 
fellow young democrats and professional colleagues live in 
moresuburban districts 
he miami beach activist evelyn manset and ray zeller head of 
the south dade democrat club and running to be the districts one 
alternate formed a coalition to run as a slate 
next nevel enlisted mildner president of the miami beach 
retirees inc with whom nevel worked closely in turning out beach 
voters for dukakis on march 8 they worked the telephones 
contacting some 200 potential supporters 
nevel and ms manset each chartered a bus costing some 200 
each they had paper palm cards with their slate printed up to 
hand out 
nevels father made up buttons and stickers for his son 
and he threw in several dozen deli sandwiches 
the buses began pickups at six elderlydominated apartment 
buildings across miami beach at 9 am 
a few stops later with 45 supporters on board nevel took the 
bus intercom to explain the caucus system the supporters would be 
asked to produce proof they were registered democrats fill out a 
form stating they supported dukakis then proceed to an auditorium 
for the actual voting 
at the auditorium delegate ballots were handed out and marked 
afterward nevels supporters got their lunch 
mayer levy a retiree from new yorks east side recalled the 
tammany hall era they the bigcity political bosses would get 
us cockeyed on all the beer we wanted then they told us to vote 
early and vote often 
lillian alderson also from new york said she liked nevel but 
she also liked the free lunch i waited an hour for the bus 
shows how greedy we are she said laughing 
then the results came in nevel won in a landslide with 92 
votes 68 ahead of his nearest competitor ms manset and zeller 
also won 
nevel reflected when i think back to what a longshot dukakis 
was a year ago and then to what a longshot i was and now to be 
going to the convention

the navys trident ii program to build a 
newer more deadly submarinelaunched missile is sound stable 
and disciplined according to a review released sunday by the 
house armed services committee 
in rare praise for a us nuclear weapons program the 
democraticcontrolled panel said the trident ii scheduled to enter 
service in about 18 months appears to be on time and under budget 
the other programs weve looked at had a variety of problems 
so this is kind of a manbitesdog story but it is important to 
give credit when it is due said rep les aspin dwis chairman 
of the panel 
the committees report was the latest in a series of studies on 
us nuclear weapons programs but it was the first in which the 
panel praised the pentagon 
the trident ii also known as the d5 is a submarinelaunched 
weapon that will be put aboard trident submarines starting next 
year it has a longer range and is more accurate than the trident i 
weapon it will replace 
although the trident weapons comprise a growing portion of the 
us nuclear arsenal they have generally escaped the controversy 
that has enveloped president reagans programs to build new 
landbased nuclear missiles and longrange bombers after a series 
of cost overruns early in the trident program few problems have 
surfaced 
the committees review singled out for praise the navys 
strategic systems program office sspo saying it has a wellrun 
program 
weve some elements of what the sspo is doing in other 
programs but not as many as were seeing in this one program 
aspin said 
for instance aspin said the office is managing 
weaponsbuilding programs longer and has more wideranging 
authority than other pentagon offices 
the trident ii will cost at least 36 billion but the eventual 
cost is unclear because the navy hasnt finally decided how many of 
the trident missilefiring subs it will build 
congress has already authorized 15 of the boats which each 
carry a dozen missiles that can carry up to eight warheads each 
the trident ii missile is now being flighttested at cape 
canaveral fla eight of the nine scheduled tests have been 
finished and the results show seven successful shots one failure 
and one delay the failure has delayed the program but there is 
enough flexibility in the schedule so that the missile is still 
expected to be completed on time the report said 
while the house report praised the navy it said that technical 
difficulties have been discovered in the inertial measurement unit 
the part of the guidance system that directs the weapon to its 
target 
aspin has been sharply critical of the air force because of 
inertial measurement unit problems in the mx nucleartipped 
missile but the situation is not as serious in the case of the 
trident he said the two weapons use different units

more than 123 million cars trucks vans and 
motorcycles valued at 52 billion were stolen over a 13year 
period the federal government estimated sunday 
after recovery of about 65 percent of them losses were 
estimated at 29 billion in 1985 dollars 
insurance payments reduced actual losses to vehicle owners to an 
estimated 161 billion according to an analysis of the bureau of 
justice statistics national crime surveys for the years 1973 
through 1985 
the number of thefts per 1000 registered vehicles fell 33 
percent over the surveyed period from nine to just six the bureau 
concluded in an analysis of its semiannual surveys of more than 
40000 households nationwide 
over the period the number of estimated vehicle thefts per 
1000 households also declined by 21 percent from 133 in 1973 to 
105 in 1985 
in addition to the vehicle thefts during the period there were 
an estimated 7 million attempted thefts said bjs director steven 
schlesinger about 64 percent of those were not reported to police 
he said and 13 percent of the actual vehicle thefts also went 
unreported 
half of the thefts involved a loss of 2455 or more before 
recoveries and insurance payments about 10 percent involved losses 
of 10000 or more 
the vehicle stolen in 76 percent of the cases surveyed was a 
car the rest were trucks vans and motorcycles 
in 7 percent of the completed thefts the vehicle was in a 
garage at home thefts most often took place at night and in 
parking lots on the street or near the victims home 
the most likely to be victimized by car theft were blacks 
hispanics households headed by people under age 25 people in 
multipledwelling units central city residents and lowincome 
households 
those least likely to be victims were people 55 years and older 
homeowners and rural residents 
stu smith bureau spokesman said the report was based on a new 
computer analysis of the extensive crime surveys the statistics 
bureau conducts every six months 
he said officials believe the statistics are more accurate than 
police reports because they are based on actual interviews with 
people in the households surveyed and cover crimes not reported to 
the police

soon boston cab riders will be able to reach 
out and touch someone even while sitting in traffic 
nynex mobile communications corp will begin installing the 
first 20 car phone units in independent taxi operators association 
cabs monday nynex vice president peter harrigan said 
another firm downer communications also reported similar 
negotations with the red amp white cab association and the boston cab 
co 
with a halfhour trip facing him we think that a stockbroker 
on his way to work may well want to place a call to hong kong on 
his way to execute an early trade said president charles w 
downer 
the cost of a twominute local call will start at 350 to 
370 well above the 10cent charge on a boston street pay phone 
and long distance connections will cost more charges will be 
payable by credit card 
nynex and downer plan to pay cab operators a percentage of the 
local call charge the cabs will be marked so prospective riders 
can tell they are equipped with telephones which will carry only 
outgoing calls 
similar telephones were tried last year in a few british cabs 
and several were installed in black car taxis in new york city 
which are barred from picking up fares on the street 
each unit costs 1500 to 2000 but downer believes they could 
make a profit on a few calls a day

the race for the white house focuses for 
a week on wisconsin as democrat jesse jackson rolls into the 
traditionally liberalvoting state on the heels of a stunning 
triumph in nextdoor michigan and michael dukakis urgently needs to 
ignite some excitement 
george bush looked on the verge of sweeping the republican 
primary almost by default as bob doles campaign withered 
wisconsins primary is a week from tuesday on april 5 and the 
state has an importance outstripping its 81 democratic delegates at 
stake 
connecticuts primary tuesday was the next event on the 
presidential calender but bush in another of his home states 
had it sewn up in the gop balloting dukakis strength in a state 
that borders his home of massachusetts reduced the stakes there for 
the other democrats 
for democrat richard gephardt the road to the white house may 
have ended in milwaukee where he spoke to state democrats late 
saturday night knowing that his poor thirdplace finish in michigan 
hadnt come close to the showing he had needed to sustain a 
credible candidacy 
he went home to washington by private jet accompanied only by 
his wife and a few aides to consider his next move 
all things considered id rather be back in des moines 
said gephardt who won iowas leadoff caucuses seven weeks ago but 
was unable to capitalize on it elsewhere 
aides said beforehand that without a victory in michigan he 
would drop out and seek reelection to congress from missouri 
wisconsin presents a contest of major importance for the two 
other democrats paul simon and albert gore jr 
gore was investing heavily in television ads in wisconsin and 
has already been on the air in the state for a week the tennessee 
senator has yet to break out of single digits since the campaign 
left the south and his strategists were hoping the state would 
return him to the top ranks of contenders just before the giant new 
york primary on april 19 when 255 democratic delegates are at 
stake 
i need your help and im here to ask for it gore said as he 
stumped in the state over the weekend 
for simon wisconsin offered a perhaps final chance to get back 
into the race his hopes turn on whether the state whose history 
of liberal primary winners includes eugene mccarthy in 1968 and 
george mcgovern in 1972 will embrace simons campaign as the 
unapologetic traditional liberal 
there was little sign that it would however as simon was out 
of money and jackson emerged from michigan with a major win as the 
liberal candidate although wisconsin is only 4 percent black 
jackson was likely to exceed the 10 percent he gained in the state 
in 1984 
jacksons virtual 21 victory in michigan over dukakis was a 
strong blow to the massachusetts governor heretofore the 
frontrunner who many democrats had been depicting as the 
inevitable nominee once the race moved into the ethnic and 
industrial northern states where he should do well 
that argument of inevitability became harder to sustain after a 
third place finish in illinois and a distant second in michigan 
in some sense its a lot of poetry jackson said in 
milwaukee the results still coming in from michigan where george 
wallace won 16 years earlier its a lot of history we also have 
the numbers and its a lot of reality 
republican dole had looked to wisconsin as a chance to recoup 
and he stumped the state last week but he also was hinting he may 
quit before wisconsins primary and said bushs nomination was a 
foregone conclusion 
the only recent poll conducted by the milwaukee journal 11 days 
ago gave bush the lead over dole by better than 21 among 
democrats dukakis had 38 percent to jacksons 30 percent with the 
rest far behind 
wisconsins primary is an open event so republicans could cross 
over to vote in the more competitive democratic race it has been 
unkind to frontrunners as walter mondale lost here to gary hart in 
a 1984 popular vote that did not award delegates

nicaraguan exiles bowed their heads in a 
special outdoors palm sunday mass and prayed that last weeks 
contrasandinista ceasefire pact is not sandinista treachery 
the general feeling is confusion what will happen now in 
nicaragua said roberto serrano an engineer who has worked as a 
medley wine importer since leaving his homeland we have to wait 
and see 
he and more than 300 nicaraguan exiles gathered in ronselli park 
in this nicaraguan exile enclave to pray with exiled monsignor 
pablo antonio vega 
we want peace in nicaragua but we dont believe we have 
enough guarantees to go back for we believe the sandinistas dont 
like to be at peace inside nicaragua said eduardo salgado 
the nicaragua civic union which represents some nicaragua exile 
groups called the mass to show solidarity salgado said 
the gathering in this western dade county city home of little 
managua came a day after about 200 peace demonstrators applauded 
the ceasefire pact in downtown miami and a handful of 
demonstrators blasted it outside a miami hotel where contra leaders 
were holding closeddoor meetings 
under the agreement which declares a ceasefire until june 1 
the contras have agreed not to accept any more us military aid 
in return the leftist sandinistas promised a gradual amnesty for 
contras and unrestricted freedom of expression that would allow 
them a role in nicaraguas political process 
no matter what we as individuals believe in theres only 
one ideal that prevails to keep on the struggle of the nicaraguan 
people until the soviets and communist cubans leave nicaragua 
said manuel molina the sandinistas are no problem to us because 
they are a very small group of criminals but the soviet force 
thats a whole different ball game 
the peace pact also has divided the 54member nicaraguan 
resistance assembly in a special sixhour session saturday it 
created a commission to monitor its five directors when they resume 
negotiations with the sandinistas this week 
the assembly which represents nine nicaraguan political 
opposition groups was formed last year and has the right to 
overrule its directors 
assembly leaders said the 60day ceasefire pact signed 
wednesday in nicaragua by directors adolfo calero and aristides 
sanchez is only the first step in ending the sevenyear civil war 
if we dont get freedom through negotiations well get it 
through war calero said sunday on nbcs meet the press 
we will not disband and we will not lay down our weapons he 
said 
at saturdays meeting former nicaraguan vice president silvio

the first man to invoke colorados make 
my day defense in a shooting arguing he was protecting his 
family has been convicted in a separate case of murdering his 
estranged wife and wounding her boyfriend 
david guenther 35 sat emotionless saturday when adams county 
district court judge harlan bockman read guilty verdicts for 
firstdegree murder attempted firstdegree murder and firstdegree 
assault 
bockman set a may 6 sentencing date a person convicted of 
firstdegree murder in colorado must serve 40 years in prison 
before becoming eligible for parole prosecutors said earlier they 
would not seek the death penalty 
it made my day coprosecutor bruce levin said of the 
verdict referring to the socalled make my day law which 
allows residents to use deadly force in their homes against 
intruders it was nicknamed after a line in a clint eastwood film 
in which a cop invites a criminal to make my day and give the 
cop an excuse to shoot 
guenther was the first person to invoke that defense saying he 
could not be charged with the fatal shooting of a neighbor and the 
wounding of two other people outside his home in 1986 because he 
was protecting his family 
guenther was acquitted but that was overturned by the colorado 
supreme court the charges were reinstated and a jury acquitted 
guenther in the second trial last oct 22 but on the basis of 
selfdefense rather than the make my day rule 
on march 1 1987 guenther shot and killed his wife pamela 30 
and wounded her boyfriend stanley stinson outside a commerce city 
restaurant 
the guenthers two children christopher 13 and jennifer 11 
saw the shootings and were key prosecution witnesses along with 
stinson 
when the trial opened tuesday both sides agreed there was no 
question that guenther killed his wife and wounded stinson at 
issue was whether he acted with deliberation as the prosecution 
contended or whether he fired eight shots in the heat of 
passion when he saw his wife kissing stinson 
prosecutor tim meinert reminded jurors of a pattern of threats 
and violence by guenther against his estranged wife who took her 
children and left him about a month before she was killed 
testimony showed he took his wife hostage at their home one week 
before her death releasing her unharmed after a standoff with 
police that lasted several hours 
the jury deliberated for three hours 
stinson said of the verdict they gave this guy exactly what 
he deserved i can get a good nights sleep now i havent slept 
for about a year

amiram nir prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
counterterrorism adviser involved in the irancontra affair has 
resigned the government announced sunday 
the government also announced the resignation of yosef harmelin 
head of the shin bet secret service for more than 11 years 
shamir accepted nirs resignation two weeks ago and it will take 
effect on april 1 the government announcement said 
the government gave no reasons for the resignation media 
reports said the reasons were political and not related to the 
irancontra affair 
nir a former journalist was appointed by labor party leader 
shimon peres who became prime minister after the inconclusive 
elections in 1984 
in january 1986 nir became involved in the iran operation and 
took over from three israeli middlemen foreign ministry director 
david kimche businessmen yakov nimrodi and al schwimmer 
before nirs involvement the three mediated a secret 1985 arms 
deal between iran and the united states in exchange for the freedom 
of us hostages held by proiranian shiite fundamentalists in 
lebanon 
israel then shipped 508 usmade tow antitank missiles and 18 
hawk antiaircraft missiles to iran the united states took over 
the shipments in february 1986 but continued to use israel as a 
transfer point for the arms 
in testimony before congressional investigators last july 
former us national security council aide lt col oliver north 
listed nir as a main mover behind the weapons deals 
north alleged nir was one of the first to propose diverting 
funds from the arms deals to nicaraguas antigovernment rebels 
the contras 
north recently pleaded innocent in federal court in washington 
dc to a series of charges in connection with the irancontra 
affair 
since news of the iranian deals broke israel has mantained that 
it only acted in cooperation with the united states and denied any 
knowledge of alleged diversion of funds to the contras 
nir has been sought for questioning by special us prosecutor 
lawrence e walsh in exchange israel has insisted on an agreement 
that nir be granted immunity from prosecution 
shamir had planned to dismiss nir in 1986 under a powersharing 
agreement with peres 
peres who is currently foreign minister served as prime 
minister from 19841986 under the accord with shamirs rightwing 
likud bloc shamir took over as prime minister in october 1986 
news reports said that shamir could not fire nir in 1986 because 
he feared his dismissal might be interpreted in the united states 
as punishment for nirs involvement in the weapons deals 
harmelin 65 joined israels secret service soon after the 
jewish state came into being in 1948 
he held various intelligence posts before becoming chief of the 
secret service in 1964 
harmelin was responsible for building israels intelligence 
network in the west bank and gaza strip after israel captured these 
lands from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
he left the post in 1974 to become israels ambassador in iran 
and south africa in july 1986 he was called back to the secret 
service as a temporary replacement for avraham shalomahituv who 
resigned after the socalled shin bet affair 
in the affair shin bet agents were accused of fabricating 
evidence to conceal their role in the beating deaths of two 
palestinians who hijacked an israeli passenger bus in april 1984

the baby m surrogate motherhood case is 
to draw to a close in a courtroom here monday but elsewhere 
problems will be just beginning for two people who look and act 
like mary beth whitehead and william stern 
by coincidence producers are to film a scene for a upcoming 
twopart tv miniseries on the baby m case in a new jersey turnpike 
rest area at the same time the reallife litigants are to be in 
court for a visitation hearing 
the hearing was ordered by the state supreme court to determine 
how much mrs whitehead may visit baby m now legally known as 
melissa stern 
to some extent its a sad coincidence said ilene berg 
executive producer of the film which is scheduled to be broadcast 
in may on abc its sad that this is still not resolved that 
its never going to be perfect 
the producers were scheduled to film one of the early meetings 
of stern and mrs whitehead now known as mrs whiteheadgould 
after her second marriage at a rest area about 8 miles south of 
the bergen county courthouse 
the two used to meet there before they would drive together to a 
clinic in new york city where mrs whiteheadgould was inseminated 
with sterns sperm as part of a 10000 surrogate contract 
the scene is part of a fourhour miniseries that covers the 
introduction of the sterns and whiteheads the birth of baby m the 
surrogate mothers flight to florida with the child after she 
decided she couldnt give up the baby and the lower court custody 
trial which mrs whiteheadgould lost 
at the end of the film an update will tell of the state supreme 
court decision that reversed most of the lower court ruling 
granting custody of the baby to stern but restoring mrs 
whiteheadgoulds parental rights 
the highway rest area scene is the last to be filmed the rest 
of the movie was shot in a van nuys calif soundstage where 
producers built a replica of the bergen county courtroom where the 
baby m case was played out 
ms berg said the coincidence of the new jersey filming on the 
same day as the visitation hearing was a bit of good fortune for 
the miniseries 
it shows if anything that our movie is still very timely 
she said 
since neither side in the baby m dispute agreed to take part in 
the movie producers wrote the script from court documents and news 
reports they said they tried to take no sides in the battle 
letting the facts speak for themselves 
i expect people will be arguing about this after it the 
movie is over said producer gordon freedman 
actress jo beth williams seen in the big chill and the 
day after plays mrs whiteheadgould while actor john shea 
plays stern and soap opera actress robin strasser plays sterns 
wife elizabeth 
hill street blues bruce weitz plays the surrogate mothers 
first husband richard whitehead actress anne jackson plays baby 
ms legal guardian lorraine abraham and dabney coleman of the 
slap maxwell story plays the sterns attorney gary skoloff 
ms williams said she studied for the part by reading court 
documents and newspaper clippings and watching television news 
reports 
in playing mrs whiteheadgould the actress said she found 
that the surrogate mother was neither a victim nor a heroine 
its difficult to put a single label on her ms williams 
said shes a woman who was put in a very difficult situation 
some of what mary beth did was impulsive but it was out of 
desperation 
i feel very strongly for both sides of this story they both 
have been through tremendous pain

antiapartheid clergyman allan 
boesak said sunday that if he is killed the government and police 
should come under suspicion 
over the last week there have been more death threats said 
boesak leader of the mixedrace branch of the dutch reformed 
church and president of the world alliance of reformed churches 
i want the world to know the light of suspicion should fall on 
the south african government and the police if something like that 
should happen he said at a news conference 
one doesnt say these things to create an atmosphere of 
martyrdom it has happened before in this country people have died 
mysteriously 
capt jl barnard a spokesman for national police headquarters 
in pretoria said boesak had made a totally unfair untrue and 
malicious statement 
it is another example of how untested unsubstantiated 
onesided allegations are made in public in a bid to discredit the 
south african police as well as the south african government he 
said 
boesak said volunteer student guards had seen a police car drive 
by his home early tuesday a passenger in the back seat pointed a 
gun out the window but the guards shined lights and the car sped 
away he said 
this is a very sinister development boesak said he said 
police later denied dispatching a car to the area 
barnard said he could not comment on the facts of boesaks 
allegations about the car 
boesak and other south african church leaders have vowed to take 
a more confrontational approach since the government banned the 17 
leading antiapartheid groups last month among the protesting 
clergymen are anglican archbishop desmond tutu winner of the 1984 
nobel peace prize and the rev frank chikane head of the south 
african council of churches 
authorities arrested 25 of the church leaders feb 29 when they 
tried to march to parliament with a petition protesting the bans 
the government also banned a new committee for the defense of 
democracy set up to take over activities of the outlawed 
organizations 
boesak on sunday lamented statements by the white branch of the 
countrys dutch reformed church saying he and tutu dont represent 
the church 
the white dutch reformed church is saying to the state these 
people are not the church and do not represent the church 
therefore when you act against them you are not acting against 
the church said boesak once you create that kind of 
atmosphere almost everybody out there who is angry with us could 
feel justified in threatening our lives because the church said 
they were not acting against people of god 
boesaks news conference was attended by a delegation from the 
world alliance it had come to express solidarity with south 
african clergymen who are challenging the government and its 
apartheid segregation policies 
leaders of the alliance based in geneva said they represent 
164 churches with a worldwide membership of 70 million sundays 
cape town delegation included a swiss minister edmond perret 
general secretary of the aliance and joachim guhrt president of 
the reformed churches of west germany 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

gov evan mecham attempting to convince 
the arizona senate that his 80000 loan from a protocol fund was 
on the upandup suggests that if he hadnt borrowed the money 
others might have spent it 
you know money is like honey mecham said during his 
impeachment trial honey attracts bees and money attracts people 
people heard there was money and they came in with ideas to 
spend it can we do this with it can we do that with it 
he said during his testimony last week he had the best idea for 
the funds that had been raised by his inaugural committee to pay 
off campaign debts when a state law blocked use of the money for 
that purpose mecham said he proposed the protocol fund 
other governors had such funds he said and the purpose was to 
make sure the governor wouldnt have to go into the hole for 
incidental expenses 
for instance he said the fund could pay for his wife 
florence to accompany him to official events out of town 
it was my understanding this was to keep me from having to 
spend my own personal money for things for my office said the 
governor 
he conceded there were items for which he knew he couldnt use 
the fund politics and living expenses but he said he never 
suspected that loaning the money to his own car dealership was 
forbidden and he never considered the fund public property 
i never heard the words discussed public funds said the 
firstterm republican governor the first us governor to face an 
impeachment trial in six decades 
in the second of three impeachment charges mecham is accused of 
misusing state funds by borrowing the 80000 earlier in the 
trial senators heard evidence on a charge that he tried to halt an 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a member of his staff 
on both charges the governors basic defense is ignorance of 
the facts on the first count he contends he was never fully 
informed of details of the alleged threat and had no idea a crime 
might have been committed on the second count he argues he was 
never told the fund had become public money and wasnt aware that 
borrowing the 80000 might violate conditions of a legal agreement 
for its use 
he said he received instructions about the money from william 
long his inaugural chairman who signed an agreement with the 
maricopa county attorneys office to avoid a lawsuit over use of 
the proceeds from mechams inaugural ball 
mr long said we have gone through all of this rigamarole 
and you can spend it for any damned thing that you want except you 
cant spend it for politics or living expenses mecham testified 
long is ill and has not testified he submitted an affidavit 
that seemed to support mechams position 
at no time was governor mecham informed that these monies were 
a gift to the state of arizona or a gift to anyone other than evan 
mecham to be used for the lawful purposes which had been agreed 
upon long said 
with the trial entering its fifth week the senate has yet to 
take up the charge considered most critical the allegation that he 
concealed a 350000 campaign loan from developer barry wolfson it 
is the only one of the three counts which also is the basis of a 
criminal felony case set for trial april 21 
meanwhile the governor continues to campaign for reelection in 
a recall election scheduled for may 17 a poll released sunday 
showed that mecham would still be one of the front runners if the 
election were held now but 54 percent of voters said mecham would 
be unacceptable as governor the poll was commissioned by the 
arizona republic and kpnxtv

jesse jacksons victory in michigan forces the 
democratic party to take a more serious look at his presidential 
bid and increases his chances of winning in the highstakes new 
york primary political analysts said sunday 
jackson defeated frontrunner michael dukakis by almost 21 in 
michigans primarylike caucuses saturday infusing new momentum 
into an already strong campaign that is within striking distance of 
first place in the national delegate count 
there are still some in the political establishment who think 
1988 is an inevitable replay of 1984 said ann lewis a 
democratic strategist and an informal adviser to jacksons 
campaign the day after michigan a new world has dawned 
with returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in michigan 
jackson had 107689 or 55 percent to 55337 or 28 percent for 
dukakis jackson won enormous majorities in detroit in the 1st 
congressional district for example jackson beat dukakis 25416 to 
1809 in the 13th the margin was 17725 to 1539 
jackson treated as a fringe candidate in 1984 has won in eight 
states michigan alabama georgia louisiana mississippi 
virginia south carolina alaska and puerto ricos nonbinding 
contest the victories are forcing the party to reexamine the 
theory that a black cannot be nominated for president in 1988 
jesse is running to win the nomination ms lewis said 
what does the democratic party give him the morning after 
michigan he earns the right its not what we give him 
paul maslin pollster for illinois sen paul simons campaign 
said jacksons michigan victory and possible wins in wisconsin and 
new york could give him the most national delegates 
a real extraordinary endgame is presenting itself to the 
democratic party they have to be seriously thinking about the 
prospect of a jackson nomination maslin said 
jacksons win also puts greater pressure on dukakis who has 
failed to win in major contests in illinois and michigan and faces 
a serious challenge in new york which has 255 delegates at stake 
in its april 19th primary 
new york is going to be a major test ms lewis said 
michigan greatly raises the stakes in new york 
the stakes could not be more critical said maslin he 
dukakis cant just finish second to jesse jackson he cant say 
im the leading white candidate its not going to work this year 
a new york daily news poll published sunday shows dukakis 
favored by 45 percent of the 528 democrats surveyed to 29 percent 
for jackson the poll conducted between monday march 21 and 
thursday march 24 had a margin for error of plus or minus 45 
percentage points 
however new york gov mario cuomo has said that if two or three 
candidates are left in the democratic race prior to the primary 
jackson has a chance of winning 
missouri rep richard gephardt was expected to drop out of the 
race to run for reelection to his congressional seat 
in addition a marist college institute for public opinion poll 
found that 57 percent of 459 democratic voters surveyed earlier 
this month gave jackson a favorable rating to 30 percent 
unfavorable the same survey conducted in january gave jackson a 
44 percent favorable rating to 41 percent unfavorable 
new york is a fairly volatile state said david garth a 
media consultant who is working for tennessee sen albert gore 
jrs campaign there is a strong potential jewish vote 
in the marist college survey 36 percent of the jewish voters 
gave jackson a favorable rating an increase from 17 percent in 
january fortythree percent gave jackson an unfavorable rating to 
62 percent in january the poll has a margin of error of 5 percent 
garth said jackson can win in new york because dukakis has 
proven he cant stop him but the consultant said the party has 
become more conservative in recent years 
new yorkers have generally moved from the left to much more 
moderate democrats they got to have somebody to win the 
election he said it used to be the ndc national democratic 
committee was novemeber doesnt count the old new york is not 
the same its a wideopen race

jesse jackson drew thunderous crowds from east detroit to flint 
and saginaw while michael dukakis ended a muddled day on the road 
before a small audience at a polishamerican hall in hamtramck 
crowds waited patiently for jackson to appear but in comstock 
park the grumbling was evident when dukakis arrived about half an 
hour late due to logistical problems that wiped out many of his 
planned events 
make them wait we did yelled one older man as dukakis cut 
short his town meeting in the grand rapids suburb to hold a news 
conference and rush to a fundraiser 
speak english this is america said another as dukakis 
spoke in greek and spanish with those in the uaw hall who addressed 
him in those languages 
on saturday the fervor of jacksons backers became a tidal wave 
of votes that gave the civil rights leader his biggest victory yet 
defeating dukakis by almost 21 
campaign events are an extraordinarily unreliable guide to 
election results jackson drew big crowds in 1984 and still 
finished third in the democratic presidential race that year 
but the rallies and town meetings and handshaking tours can be a 
window into the reality of the campaign and into how the voters are 
reacting 
in michigan the view through that window was accurate 
jackson worked this industrial state hard even delaying his 
departure from the state on saturday to travel by motorcade and on 
foot through mostly black neighborhoods encouraging his supporters 
to turn out 
dukakis in contrast spent relatively little time in the state 
he flew in monday night for a quick visit held a pair of news 
conferences wednesday night and then struggled through the day 
friday 
part of the difference in schedules came from dukakis 
commitment to return to boston to work as governor part from 
dukakis greater attention to fundraising and part from campaign 
judgments about allocating candidates time among the various 
states 
and when dukakis was in the state he found himself explaining 
over and over again that he had not flipflopped on the trade 
issue that his backing for a trade bill by sen don riegle of 
michigan was not just a political ploy rep richard gephardt 
grabbed the front pages by pounding away at dukakis on trade it 
didnt help gephardt he finished a dismal third but the blows 
kept dukakis on the defensive 
jackson steadfastly refused to be drawn into a democratic trade 
war sticking to flowery positive phrases about expanding exports 
and knocking down walls 
the messages from the two candidates were also substantively 
different dukakis talked of competence and compassion as his 
televisions ads mentioned balancing budgets and creating jobs 
jackson hit over and over again at his theme of hope for those 
who are down who are jobless who are out of luck 
in a state where the auto industry has put thousands out of 
work jacksons more optimistic message was the stronger one as 
dukakis came close to admitting saturday night in defeat 
the people of michigan have been through a very difficult 
time there is great unhappiness great concern great uncertainty 
there are laidoff workers workers today who have jobs are worried 
they are going to be next dukakis said jesse has strong 
feelings about that as i do 
dukakis relied on an impressive organization in michigan as he 
has in other states plus endorsements from detroit mayor coleman 
young and riegle 
dukakis congratulated jackson for his win but the victor took 
something of a swipe at dukakis 
it was the message of the soul and authenticity of jesse 
jackson versus money and technology and the people prevailed 
jackson told about 40 supporters sunday at westchester county 
airport in new york 
everybody won something in detroit dukakis won mayor youngs 
endorsement i won the peoples votes jackson said late saturday 
night 
two stories from the campaign trail highlighted the differences 
in michigan 
at dukakis final event in hamtramack his staff was desperately 
trying to round up people to fill the halfempty hall as the 
governor was about to arrive when dukakis did finally show up the 
hall had filled up a bit more but news people and plainclothes 
policemen made up at least a quarter of the audience 
that same day when jackson was holding a rally at a union hall 
in detroit two plainclothes policeman stopped their car about a 
block from the event to ask a reporter what was going on 
told jackson was speaking at the hall the policemen parked 
and went in to listen to the candidate speak

the assemblies of god hopes to lay the 
jimmy swaggart scandal to rest after the churchs highest governing 
body meets monday to discipline the television minister for an 
alleged relationship with a prostitute 
the pentecostal denominations 250member general presbytery is 
charged with resolving the conflict between the executive 
presbytery the churchs 13member national board of directors and 
church officials in louisiana who have proposed what some say is 
too lenient a punishment for swaggart 
swaggart the denominations most prominent minister confessed 
feb 21 from his baton rouge la pulpit to unspecified sins 
swaggart did not elaborate publicly but reports have linked him to 
voyeurism involving a prostitute 
swaggart who addressed his congregation briefly in baton rouge 
on sunday as he has done several times since formally 
relinquishing the pulpit is not expected to appear at mondays 
meeting said church spokeswoman juleen turnage 
in response to reporters shouted questions as he drove from the 
service swaggart said he wasnt planning to leave the ministry 
adding why should i 
the assemblies louisiana presbytery recommended a twoyear 
rehabilitation and a threemonth suspension from the pulpit for 
swaggart mrs turnage has said that all other assemblies ministers 
who have confessed to moral failure were barred from preaching for 
at least a year 
the executive presbytery discussed the matter for 11 hours feb 
25 and 26 before asking louisiana officials to reconsider the 
executive presbytery headed by general superintendent g raymond 
carlson apparently wanted tougher penalties for swaggart 
but after gathering again feb 29 for what was described as an 
emotional ninehour session the louisiana presbytery stood by its 
original decision 
the louisiana presbytery has close ties to swaggart for 
instance state superintendent cecil janway also sits on the board 
of jimmy swaggart world ministries 
reports were circulating that swaggart would leave the 
denomination if church officials suspended him for longer than 
three months but a spokesman for swaggarts ministry said the 
preacher has made no decision on how he might react mrs turnage 
said she did not believe the general presbytery would be swayed by 
rumors heard through the media 
mrs turnage said the churchs national officials have the final 
say but until now have always been able to work out an agreement 
with state leaders 
the general presbytery whose members include representatives 
from each of the churchs state councils is a court of last resort 
on ministerial credentials generally a minister would appeal his 
case to the group after his course of rehabilitation had been 
decided by the executive presbytery the executive presbytery 
shortcircuited that process when it decided march 3 to turn the 
swaggart case over to the larger body 
the twoday meeting at the denominations headquarters is to 
open at 2 pm monday the group will debate according to 
parliamentary rules of order and a majority vote will decide 
swaggarts fate mrs turnage said she expected a decision to be 
made late tuesday afternoon 
jimmy swaggart world ministries with television broadcasts that 
reach several foreign countries took in an estimated 150 million 
in 1986 the group contributes 12 million a year to the foreign 
missions program of the national church 
donations have fallen off since swaggarts confession forcing 
his ministry to lay off about 100 workers and suspend construction 
at the jimmy swaggart bible college 
but swaggart who addressed his congregation last week seems 
undaunted and apparently is counting on the general presbytery to 
follow the louisiana districts recommendation of a threemonth 
suspension 
swaggart told his congregation wednesday that he was going out 
of his mind but when im back in the pulpit on may 22 ill be 
back in my mind 
may 22 would be three months from the start of swaggarts 
voluntary abstention from preaching 
on sunday swaggart introduced a speaker and led some hymns 
later as he drove away with his wife and son he said in response 
to a reporters question that there was no reason for him to leave 
the assemblies of god 
but he declined to answer further questions responding to a 
male reporter who asked him to come over here and talk to us by 
shouting back youre not pretty enough

jesse jackson parlayed his builtin core of 
support the potent black voice of the michigan democratic party 
into a landslide victory in the states democratic caucuses 
jackson galvanized the black community which responded with a 
highly organized getoutthevote effort for saturdays caucuses 
but jacksons commanding 55 percent of the vote far outstripped 
the states black population according to 1980 census michigan is 
13 percent black 
jackson himself campaigning in connecticut on sunday 
downplayed the racial breakdown of the balloting saying his first 
concern was to count the votes not the color 
its a campaign of growth a campaign of hope he said 
i think the major factor was the level of intensity of jackson 
supporters and the lack of intensity of other supporters 
michigan house speaker gary owen said sunday 
owen who supports tennessee sen albert gore jr said early 
sunday that hed gone out campaigning several days and found an 
overwhelming lack of enthusiasm for all of the candidates except 
jackson 
i know there was excitement in seeing a presidential candidate 
and hearing a presidential candidate but i never felt that degree 
of intensity among the crowds for those other candidates he said 
zolton ferency a former state democratic party chairman said 
organized labor leaders liked rep richard gephardts tough trade 
stand but his campaign was dying they didnt want to back a 
loser 
michael dukakis on the other hand wasnt wellknown in 
michigan and had to introduce himself to the states democrats then 
try to get them to go out an vote for him ferency said 
dukakis he added wasnt the kind of candidate that can 
generate instant enthusiasm 
jackson buried dukakis in vote totals with 107689 votes or 55 
percent to dukakis 55337 or 28 percent while gephardt came in 
third with 24995 or 13 percent sen paul simon had 4069 or 2 
percent gore had 3818 or 2 percent 
those totals represented 94 percent of the vote counted the 
state democratic party said it wouldnt have full figures until 
monday 
the delegate projections from those results showed jackson 
getting 74 of the states 138 committed delegates while dukakis 
would get 50 gephardt 11 and uncommitted 3 
another 12 delegates are michigan members of the democratic 
national committee who go to the national convention not pledged to 
any particular candidate 
jackson particularly swamped dukakis in the predominantly black 
1st and 13th congressional districts which cover detroit in the 
1st jackson had 25416 compared with 1809 for dukakis while in 
the 13th he had 17725 to dukakiss 1539 
state rep alma stallworth a democrat from detroit said those 
figures represent a lot of young people and new voters who got 
involved for the first time 
stallworth said the highly organized jackson campaign also got a 
boost from black churches which urged people to vote 
but jackson also did well in mostly white districts covering the 
western southern and eastern lower peninsula 
he was saying what people wanted to hear said state sen 
david holmes ddetroit it all boils down to breadandbutter 
issues regardless of race color or creed he outworked outtalked 
and outcampaigned the other candidates in all 18 congressional 
districts 
organized labor which carries great weight in bluecollar 
michigan didnt make any endorsements unlike 1984 when it was 
solidly behind walter mondale 
stallworth said although labor took no formal action some union 
members worked for the jackson campaign

a judges unusual decision removing attorney 
general edwin meese iii from investigating an fbi agents 
harassment charges adds to a string of cases involving potential 
conflicts of interest by the nations highest law enforcement 
officer 
in some cases meese has disqualified himself leading 
congressional critics to suggest he is not in command at the 
justice department meeses aides say there havent been enough 
cases to have an effect 
in other cases meeses failure to remove himself has brought 
him legal difficulties as well as criticism from political foes 
that he is insensitive to the high ethical standards to which an 
attorney general should conform 
chicago federal judge john f grady disqualified meese from the 
criminal civil rights investigation involving black fbi agent 
donald rochon 
grady said meese and assistant attorney general william bradford 
reynolds would not be able to remain impartial in a federal grand 
jury investigation because they are defendants in a civil suit 
brought by rochon last november 
rochon says he was the victim of death threats from white 
colleagues in the chicago fbi office and that justice department 
and fbi officials engaged in a coverup of his complaints 
the judge called for a chinese wall between justice 
department attorneys conducting the criminal investigation and 
meese and reynolds who heads the departments civil rights 
division 
in one instance where the question of conflict has arisen meese 
decided not to request appointment of an independent counsel to 
investigate two former justice department officials involved in an 
environmental protection agency controversy his decision overruled 
department subordinates meese had earlier attended a white house 
meeting where aspects of the epa controversy were discussed 
his behavior casts a pall of favoritism on the office of 
attorney general declared sen carl levin dmich 
this is absolute nonsense responded terry eastland a 
justice department spokesman the attorney general has made a 
diligent effort to recuse himself from matters in which there might 
be a conflict and he has kept himself in cases where he doesnt 
have a relationship that would give rise to questions 
when meese came under criminal investigation last may 11 in the 
wedtech scandal he hired private washington legal counsel who 
represent other clients in criminal investigations and prosecutions 
before the justice department 
under a process put in place because of the criminal probe of 
meese his washington lawyers regularly provide client lists to the 
justice department 
we advise justice and they advise his office so that the 
matters are screened said meese lawyer nathan lewin 
lewin said that there may be a couple of dozen cases 
involved meese has removed himself from these matters even though 
only rarely do our criminal cases merit the attention of the 
attorney general said lewin 
on that basis meese is excluded from the espionage case against 
an israeli air force officer brig gen aviem sella who 
recruited navy counterterrorism analyst jonathan pollard as a spy 
lewin represents sella 
also on that basis meese was recused from the bidrigging and 
kickback probe of the international telecommunications satellite 
organization intelsat 
in his previous job as white house counselor meese helped round 
up political support from the teamsters and the unions president 
jackie presser 
because of the potential conflict meese has removed himself 
from any role in proposed justice department efforts to place the 
teamsters union under trusteeship he also disqualified himself 
from reviewing the criminal investigation of presser who was 
indicted in 1986 
meese disqualified himself last year when the reagan 
administration opposed renewing the federal law which created 
independent counsels to investigate top government officials the 
criminal investigation of meese is being conducted by one of those 
counsels 
meese has been criticized for continuing to involve himself in 
other matters that might represent conflicts 
for example meese first gave grand jury testimony in the 
scandal surrounding wedtech corp the bronx ny defense 
contractor in march of last year despite his grand jury 
appearance meese didnt recuse himself from the wedtech 
investigation being conducted by us attorney rudolph giuliani in 
manhattan until the second week in april 
in his march grand jury testimony meese was appearing only as a 
witness and he said that he quickly removed himself in april when 
he was told that his financial adviser w franklyn chinn and a 
longtime friend e robert wallach were under investigation by 
giuliani both were indicted last december for allegedly extracting 
payments from wedtech in an attempt to influence meese and other 
public officials to assist wedtech 
the timing of meeses recusal from the wedtech case was of 
concern to independent counsel james mckay who investigated 
whether meese may have passed along sensitive law enforcement 
information about giulianis probe to wallach sources familiar 
with the mckay probe have said speaking on condition of anonymity 
meese also owned 14000 in stock in the regional bell telephone 
companies at a time when he met at the justice department with 
executives of four of the companies in 1985 and 1986 the 
executives sought and ultimately succeeded in getting a 
reversal in the justice departments position on whether the baby 
bells ought to be allowed to expand into several new types of 
business the department now favors expansion into several new 
areas 
mckays office has been examining meeses baby bell stock 
holdings to determine whether he may have violated federal 
conflictofinterest laws 
on another matter meese attended a dinner party in switzerland 
paid for out of a fund maintained by ambassador faith whittlesey 
later meese turned down appointment of an independent counsel to 
investigate alleged misuse of the fund and obstruction of justice 
by whittlesey

helicopters carrying tired 
dirtsmeared us soldiers swarmed back to this military base 
sunday and the troopers prepared to return home 
we accomplished what we came here to do put the nicaraguans 
back in their place sgt matthew west said as he climbed out of 
a helicopter at the end of a flight from training exercises in 
juticalpa about 40 miles from the hondurannicaraguan border 
now we just want to get clean said west 21 from dallas 
soldiers from the 82nd airbrone division based at fort bragg 
nc are expected to begin returning to the united states at about 
5 pm est monday they will be the first to arrive home after an 
11day training exercise meant as a show of us military strength 
in the central america region 
units of the 7th light infantry division headquartered at fort 
ord calif also were flown here in the show of force 
president reagan sent the 3200 soldiers to honduras on march 
1718 after honduran president jose azcona hoyo asked for help 
azcona said an estimated 2000 nicaraguan troopers had entered 
honduran territory in the bocay region 
honduran military officials said the invading sandinistas were 
after a major supply depot the usbacked nicaraguan rebels 
maintained just inside honduras 
american soldiers said their mission was a success 
our presence here definitely made a difference said sgt 
dale taylor 22 of red springs nc it proves how serious we 
are about what we are doing and that we can get here in 18 hours if 
the need arises 
the reagan administration called the military action a training 
exercise but it also was meant as a warning to the sandinistas 
against further action inside honduran territory 
and despite a few tense days during which the honduran air force 
twice bombed sandinista positions in the bocay region of western 
olancho province the us soldiers were involved only in training 
maneuvers 
the sandinistas while claiming their soldiers had never entered 
honduran territory withdrew their troops from the area about two 
days after the american troops arrived 
taylor said he is one of the lucky ones who will be among 
the first to parachute into a training field at ft bragg monday 
its going to be a sisboombah occasion theyre going to 
have a band and our families will be there its great to be going 
home he said 
pfc edward broker 27 of denver said he is going to kiss 
the ground when he gets back to ft bragg and then drink a beer 
and have my wife take me out to a restaurant 
were all glad to be going home said spec 4 michael greco 
21 of pittsburgh pa this makes you appreciate what you have at 
home 
maj gary hovatter the us military spokesman for the forces 
here said all of the soldiers from fort bragg and fort ord should 
be home by wednesday 
he said some training continued sunday at bases in jamastran in 
eastern honduras and tamara in southcentral honduras 
some of them will be leaving monday night late but then the 
last guys probably wont be getting out until wednesday he said 
they want to make maximum use of all their training time

richard gephardts tough trade 
message was a winner in chicks rooster lounge here just as it 
was in iowa but gephardt never found the momentum from his iowa 
caucus victory and ended up a loser after michigans caucuses 
gephardt finished a distant third to jesse jackson and michael 
dukakis here a state that should have been receptive to his trade 
message but the auto industrydominated state handed the missouri 
congressman his 28th defeat in 31 events this year and doomed his 
bid for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination 
he is expected to formally withdraw from the race gephardt 
scheduled a news conference monday afternoon in washington to 
announce his plans 
gephardts clear and consistent message a tough trade policy 
designed to protect american jobs resonated with workers worried 
about foreign competition 
i like his enthusiasm his buy america ideas we have to 
take care of ourselves first said bar owner chick mahoney 
looking over a restaurant full of workers cheering gephardt 
wellknown on capitol hill as a leader in the house but 
littleknown across the country gephardt never could transform 
enthusiasm about his message into victories 
gephardt worked iowa hard with the message and won a narrow 
victory on feb 8 but it wasnt much of a boost 
gephardt got very little momentum out of iowa said 
democratic party professional elaine kamarck his win over paul 
simon was narrow and pat robertsons surprise secondplace finish 
on the gop side over george bush dominated the news 
once robertson mucked up the republican race the democrats 
lost their best chance to have a giant among the candidates she 
said 
dukakis won his backyard primary in new hampshire the next week 
but then gephardt went into south dakota and won the primary there 
feb 23 with his trade message 
but that was it for gephardt except for a homestate win in 
missouri on super tuesday 
bob squier a democratic media consultant said gephardt didnt 
freshen his message for the southern primaries on super tuesday and 
apparently didnt have the money to get his message out 
if the hyundai had become a pickup truck as it crossed the 
masondixon line it might have worked squier said referring to 
gephardts centerpiece trade ad that singled out the korean car 
squier said gephardts campaign was guilty of kamikaze attacks 
in the south running a lot of ads in parts of florida for 
example where dukakis was very strong 
gephardts message also triggered counterattacks that he seemed 
unable to answer adequately 
everywhere i go they say hes the protectionist candidate 
that is a great way for the opposition to smear you and get rid of 
your issue gephardt told reporters at lunch one day in new 
hampshire 
he strongly denied his policies were protectionist but it was a 
charge that he could never shake 
gephardt also had strong competition from the other candidates 
for his message 
jackson for one has a powerful message to those worried about 
their economic situation but jackson is an eloquent speaker of 
genuine force while gephardts rhetoric has been honed in the 
rarified halls of the capitol 
and jackson says over and over again his message is one of hope 
and the future while gephardts emphasis on trade protections 
seemed to emphasize what cannot be done not the possibilities to 
come 
in addition the missouri congressman was not known well outside 
of washington kamarck said that poses a problem in laying out a 
strong message that some may not like since the voters do not know 
enough about the candidate to trust him even if they may have 
doubts about his message 
gephardts populist antiestablishment themes also met with 
skepticism from reporters and others who knew him to be the 
consummate washington insider 
his message also never brought him the organizational support he 
needed 
the united auto workers stayed officially neutral a major blow 
to his chances 
in iowa the state affiliate backed gephardt and gave him troops

the sandinista government freed 100 
political prisoners sunday under an amnesty program fulfilling the 
first part of a ceasefire pact with nicaraguan rebels 
interior minister tomas borge called the gesture possibly the 
beginning of the end of the war 
tearful family members embraced their loved ones who were 
released from the zona franca jail on the outskirts of managua but 
amid the joy was an air of doubt 
they say i dont have anything to fear said feliz pedro 
chavaria gomez 32 holding a plastic sack containing his 
belongings im happy but i hope it doesnt fail 
chavaria said he was arrested in 1980 and charged with being a 
counterrevolutionary 
cesar augusto flores mireando 25 was arrested more than two 
years ago in managua the majority of the peasants here are 
innocent he said 
the release of the prisoners was the first step in an amnesty 
plan the sandinistas agreed to wednesday when they signed a 
ceasefire accord with leaders of the usbacked rebels known as 
contras the sides declared a truce march 21 and a a 60day 
ceasefire is to begin april 1 
in another development president daniel ortega suggested the 
united nations send a multinational peacekeeping force to the 
nicaraguanhonduran border to stabilize the area 
of the prisoners freed sunday 24 were workers arrested for 
joining illegal strikes 
the release was ordered under an amnesty law the national 
assembly approved by a margin of 822 saturday night the law could 
result in the release of about 3300 political prisoners jailed 
since the sandinistas seized power in a 1979 revolution that 
overthrew rightwing president anastasio somoza 
sandinistas hold 61 seats in the 96member assembly 
according to the legislation another undisclosed number of 
contras taken prisoner during the sixyear civil war will be 
released at an unspecified later date the government also plans a 
general review of the cases of about 1800 members of somozas 
nowdisbanded national guard ortega said 
speaking to reporters saturday night ortega said the former 
guardsmen all have been accused of human rights violations or 
crimes against humanity such as the indiscriminate shooting of 
civilians during the oneyear revolution that brought the 
sandinistas to power 
many of them have been sentenced to the maximum penalty of 30 
years imprisonment ortega said the downfall of somoza a rightist 
proamerican strongman ended 42years of ironfisted rule by his 
family usually enforced by the national guard 
ortega said the case of each guardsmen will be sent to the 
organization of american states interamerican human rights 
commission for review before a release is ordered to safeguard the 
sandinista government from criticism that it acted unfairly 
on saturday ortega said he had told gilberto schilittler head 
of the un delegation that it is important to achieve the 
stabilization of the border zone with honduras and this is only 
possible with a multilateral force 
ortega said that without a peacekeeping force the united 
states can continue heating up the border provoking conflicts 
increasing its presence to threaten nicaragua 
the un team inspected the border thursday and friday scene of 
a reported incursion into honduras by sandinista army troops 
pursuing contra rebels 
the sandinistas pardoned and released 900 political and rebel 
prisoners in october and november as a goodwill gesture in an 
unsuccessful effort to bring the contras to the bargaining table 
but in a surprise move leaders of the contra umbrella 
organization the nicaraguan resistance met with the sandinistas 
last week and agreed thursday on a 60day ceasefire beginning 
april 1 further negotiations will follow to reach a more permanent 
truce 
an informal ceasefire both sides had agreed to while the 
negotiations were in progress continued to hold sunday 
an estimated 50000 people have been killed or wounded since the 
contra war against the sandinistas began in november 1981 
ortega said the two sides will meet again on monday in the 
little southern village of sapoa near the costa rican border to 
continue talks 
the negotiations will now center on socalled truce areas 
where the contras can gather and later turn in their weapons 
sundays amnesty was demanded by the contras as a condition for 
further talks it is also called for under a regional peace plan 
that ortega and the four other central american presidents signed 
last august 
the plan aims at negotiating an end to the contra war and to 
leftist guerrilla wars in el salvador and guatemala 
in honduras about 3200 american troops sent in two weeks ago 
by president reagan when sandinista troops allegedly entered 
honduras in pursuit of contra rebels prepared to return home on 
monday 
the reagan administration said they were sent both to bolster 
the honduran government and as a warning to the sandinistas against 
further incursions

court records scheduled to be unsealed this 
week may cast some light on death threats authorities say a 
prosecutor apparently fabricated 
us magistrate ronald j hedges last week gave the government 
until wednesday to object to his decision to unseal about eight of 
29 pages of transcripts of conversations he had with special 
assistant us attorney judy g russell about the threats 
the discussions from which defense attorneys were excluded 
came during hearings feb 15 on a request to extradite two sikhs 
accused by the indian government of terrorism in that nation 
the hearings which resulted in a decision to allow the pair to 
be extradited took place amid extraordinary security because of 
alleged death threats to ms russell and an anonymous letter to 
hedges us attorney samuel a alito jr disclosed last monday 
that the threats apparently were manufactured by ms russell 
no charges have been filed in connection with the alleged 
threats alito said an internal affairs division of the justice 
department is investigating he hasnt suggested any motive for the 
threats 
alito has alleged that ms russell cut out words from magazines 
to form threatening messages and mailed them to herself 
in part of an affidavit hedges already released ms russell 
mentioned four mailed threats in requesting tight security at the 
extradition hearing 
ms russell also allegedly told fbi agents a threat was 
handdelivered to her feb 4 when she was staying in a secret hotel 
location under 24hour guard an fbi affidavit released last monday 
said none of the guards noticed anyone enter the area during the 
time she claimed to have received the threat 
ronald kuby attorney for sikh defendant sukhminder singh also 
said ms russell told the fbi a fabricated story about a suspect 
who allegedly shouted at her in a mall a federal official 
speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed kubys statement 
her former colleagues in the us attorneys office have refused 
to comment publicly as has ms russells attorney robert fettweis 
fettweis has said only that ms russell is in seclusion in a 
private hospital 
ms russell left the us attorneys office to enter private 
practice before the extradition hearing and returned to handle it 
as a special assistant us attorney 
singh and the second sikh ranjit singh gill have asked a 
federal judge in new york to review hedges extradition decision 
alito has said he does not think the threats affected the 
extradition decision but he wants a new hearing to avoid the 
appearance of impropriety his office and defense attorneys are 
deciding how to proceed with the case

julian pierce was a rarity in racially 
troubled robeson county respected by blacks indians and whites 
but many of his supporters believe he was slain because someone 
didnt want a lumbee indian to be a judge 
there is absolute shock the rev mac legerton said sunday 
there is a feeling among people that oh my god we tried to seek 
change through the electoral process and look what happens 
we are hoping that all the citizens will choose nonviolent 
means to resolve our massive difficulties here 
pierces death early saturday from three shotgun blasts at 
pointblank range appeared to be the first time in the state that a 
candidate for political office had been murdered said robert 
morgan director of the state bureau of investigation no one had 
been arrested sunday 
pierce 42 was running for a superior court judgeship and would 
have been the first lumbee indian to serve in the post in robeson 
county if he had been elected 
pierce had been alone in his brick ranch house which is flanked 
by farmland and another small house 
someone was at the kitchen door and when he went to the 
door they were waiting for him robeson county sheriff hubert 
stone said 
it just looked like he was actually assassinated stone said 
saturday 
the indians are going to have to take the law into their own 
hands to protect their selves family and friends a local 
resident earl moore said saturday at pierces home 
moore who said he had known pierce for 15 years said the 
candidate knew that something could happen to him moore said 
he knew of a threat against pierce but said he would talk only to 
federal officials in washington not to county state or federal 
officials in north carolina 
theres a lot of leads that are being pursued state 
investigator cuyler windham said sunday declining to elaborate 
weve interviewed numerous people and we will continue to follow 
every lead that comes up 
robeson county which borders on south carolina is 37 percent 
white 37 percent indian and 26 percent black it is one of the 
states poorest counties and has long been torn by racial 
animosity 
activism particularly by lumbees has thrived since november 
1986 when an unarmed lumbee was shot and killed by a sheriffs 
deputy 
anger at what the indians call corrupt local government and 
entrenched racism boiled over most recently feb 1 when two 
lumbees took hostages at the robesonian newspaper in lumberton the 
county seat eddie hatcher and timothy jacobs said they engineered 
the siege in order to attract attention 
in a telephone interview from prison with the winstonsalem 
journal saturday night hatcher called on gov jim martin to 
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate both his allegations 
and the pierce killing 
how many dead indians and executionstyle killings of our 
people shall it take before you governor martin bestow upon our 
people the long overdue justice we deserve hatcher asked 
about 100 people stood quietly outside pierces home saturday 
he didnt have any enemies gladys freeman a lumbee said 
of pierce a lawyer who resigned from his post as director of a 
legalaid organization for the poor in january to run for the 
judgeship who could hate him no one could 
it makes me think theres no hope for the indians said 
janice locklear also a lumbee im so mad i could fight 
people questioned outside pierces home said they thought he 
would have won the election against joe freeman britt a white who 
has been district attorney in the county for 14 years 
they cited a vote earlier this month to consolidate the countys 
five school systems which had been divided along racial lines 
advocates of consolidation largely lumbee and black narrowly won 
the vote in this rural underdeveloped county of 100000 people 
an impromptu news conference outside pierces house by stone and 
morgan brought heckling from members of the crowd who asked as 
many questions of the law enforcement authorities as did reporters 
stone a white said he considered pierce a friend and britt 
called the murder sad and tragic in a statement 
pierce grew up in neighboring hoke county and worked in a 
virginia shipyard after graduating from college he returned to 
north carolina and attended north carolina central university law 
school then worked for the us securities and exchange commission 
from 1976 to 1978 
he then moved to robeson county to serve as the first director 
of lumbee river legal services representing those too poor to 
afford lawyers and practicing public interest law 
he was an easygoing guy he never had no problem with anyone 
that i heard tell of people liked him stone said 
the election effectively was to be decided may 3 the date of 
the democratic primary since no republicans were in the race 
britt and pierce were the only candidates and community leaders 
said they werent sure if another candidate could be entered at 
this late date 
robeson county had been given its own judicial district in order 
to give minorities a better chance of electing a judge the county 
had previously been part of a larger district 
at a rally in february pierce said he was running for the post 
because minorities were not respected by the criminal justice 
system that they were not a part of 
i promise you one thing if im elected judge ill be a just 
judge because i think we need that but i wont see color he 
said

convicted killer robert chambers forged 7000 
in stolen checks just before his murder trial began and used much 
of the money to buy cocaine the prosecutor at the trial has 
charged 
chambers lawyer jack litman angrily denied the allegations by 
assistant district attorney linda fairstein made in published 
reports sunday litman said she had made them in an obvious 
effort to save face because the trial did not end with a murder 
verdict 
in a surprise ending to the socalled preppie murder trial 
friday chambers pleaded guilty to firstdegree manslaughter in the 
august 1986 death of 18yearold jennifer levin 
the 21yearold college dropout had maintained throughout the 
12week trial that miss levins death had been an accident caused 
when he grabbed her and threw her off him after she hurt him during 
a sexual encounter in central park but he acknowledged in his 
guilty plea to manslaughter that he had intended to hurt her 
ms fairstein said saturday that her office received a tip from 
an informant that chambers had stolen the checks in october and 
used the money for drugs and petty cash she did not identify 
the victim but the daily news said court sources described the 
victim as an elderly woman who possibly was senile 
our belief is that he stole and forged 7000 worth of 
checks the prosecutor said we knew he was buying drugs but 
at first we didnt know where he was getting the money it went 
straight up his nose 
as part of the plea bargain that brought the trial to an end 
chambers pleaded guilty to one unrelated burglary charge one of 
three that had been brought against him under the bargain he is 
immune from prosecution from any other past crimes 
prosecutors had said that the burglaries were committed to 
support chambers cocaine habit for which he was institutionalized 
twice 
ms fairstein said the check theft was minor stuff that 
probably would have ended up as a misdemeanor 
litman called the allegations scandalous he said ms 
fairstein was upset that chambers pleaded guilty to manslaughter 
when they proclaimed from the rooftops that he intentionally 
murdered jennifer levin 
chambers entered the plea friday as jurors remained deadlocked 
on their ninth day of deliberations in the highly publicized case 
both sides feared a hung jury that would have required another 
emotionally draining trial 
chambers entered the rikers island jail on saturday to await 
sentencing april 15 under the plea bargain he faces a 
fiveto15year prison term

mordechai vanunu the former nuclear technician 
who said he acted as a spy for the common man when he gave israeli 
atomic secrets to a newspaper was sentenced sunday to 18 years in 
prison he was convicted of treason and espionage 
the sentencing climaxed a sevenmonth closeddoor trial that 
focused worldwide attention on israels nuclear capability 
the 34yearold israeli who told a british newspaper his 
country possessed nuclear weapons was convicted thursday 
the charges can carry a death penalty but the prosecution 
requested a life term which israeli law limits to 20 years the 
court then reduced the term by two years citing vanunus 
cooperation with investigators apparent signs of regret and the 
difficult conditions of his 18month solitary confinement 
under israeli law vanunu could be released on good behavior 
after 12 years but legal commentators said his early release was 
unlikely given the severity of the crimes 
defense attorney avigdor feldman has said he will appeal his 
clients case to israels supreme court 
the sentencing ended an affair shrouded in secrecy that began 
when vanunu a 10year employee of israels dimona nuclear 
facility gave photographs and details of the facility to the 
sunday times of london 
based on that information the paper reported israel had 
stockpiled the worlds sixth largest nuclear arsenal 
israel has never confirmed or denied that it has nuclear 
weapons it has said only it will not be the first country to 
introduce such weapons into the middle east 
vanunu a jewishborn convert to christianity testified during 
his trial that he made his revelations to warn the world of the 
dangers of nuclear weapons not for personal gain or out of a 
desire to harm his country 
in a poem quoted by his attorney on israeli television after the 
verdict vanunu called himself a spy for the common man 
he had negotiated a lucrative contract with the sunday times 
pending publication of a nevercompleted book and earlier 
approached several news organizations offering to sell his story 
for large sums 
vanunu made a final appeal at sundays court session but his 
remarks were not made public and his attorney refused to talk to 
waiting reporters 
vanunus family however expressed bitterness 
the trial was not conducted as it should have been said 
vanunus brother asher vanunu he said he would try to galvanize 
international support to press authorities for his brothers 
release 
meir vanunu another brother who lives in london said in an 
interview with british broadcasting co television israel wasnt 
able to give justice to mordechai 
he said israel was trying to shield its nuclear capability in 
all the kinds of games that they played about it for the last 25 
years 
meir vanunu faces arrest in israel for leaking details of his 
brothers journey to israel from london in october 1986 several 
days after the sunday times published vanunus revelations 
he told journalists his brother was lured from london to rome by 
an american woman named cindy presumably an israeli agent who 
promised him sex then he was abducted by israeli agents and 
spirited back to israel for trial he said 
meir vanunu 32 read a statement sunday night to the associated 
press 
this trial began by kidnapping continued in total secrecy and 
ended by putting the narrow interests of the state before the 
interests of humanity the statement said 
legally it is only the end of a chapter our struggle to free 
him continues politically by this trial israel has admitted that 
it has the bomb it was my brothers wish to make the middle east 
nuclear free it is up to the rest of the world to pick up this 
challenge 
in response to a question meir vanunu said he had asked the 
italian and british governments to intervene its the 
responsiblity of the british and italian governments to take some 
diplomatic steps or any kind of action to clear up this situation 
and demand the return of mordechai to europe where he was taken 
from he said 
before a pretrial court appearance mordechai vanunu managed to 
flash reporters a message scribbled on the palm of his hand saying 
he had been kidnapped in rome the incident embarrassed authorities 
and led to increased security precautions 
vanunu has received almost no support from israelis many of 
whom view him as a traitor 
but his cause has been adopted by international groups including 
antinuclear activists scientists politicians and the 
londonbased amnesty international human rights group british 
peace activists and legislators nominated him for the nobel peace 
prize last summer 
during sundays sentencing hearing defense attorney feldman 
presented a petition from noted american scientists including 18 
nobel prize laureates asking for leniency israel radio said 
the judges however denied a defense request to allow an 
american expert on international law to testify at the hearing 
the expert richard falk of princeton university in new jersey 
said he was shocked the court refused to let him testify and 
criticized vanunus conviction 
individual conscience is more important in the nuclear age 
than the security of the state he said the state can be 
wrong

a trial in the slashing and stabbing death 
of a worker at an atlanta fine arts center ended with life 
sentences for the victims wife and a man who claimed he was trying 
to aid a friends suicide 
nora ventura broomall 52 of clarkston and cecil eugene 
booher 36 of atlanta were convicted of murder saturday and 
sentenced for the oct 9 slaying of mrs broomalls husband 
george 50 a maintenance worker at the callanwolde fine arts 
center 
throughout the twoweek trial prosecutors contended that mrs 
broomall arranged her husbands death hiring booher for 25000 in 
hopes of collecting 100000 in insurance money 
broomalls throat was slashed and he had been stabbed twice in 
the chest when he was found in an upstairs hallway at callanwolde 
located in a 1920s tudorstyle mansion in atlantas stately druid 
hills neighborhood 
booher who says he has acquired immune deficiency syndrome and 
called himself a walking dead man also was found guilty of two 
counts of burglary for taking stereo equipment and liquor from the 
arts center after the slaying 
defense attorneys contended broomall planned his own death 
getting booher to help him commit suicide in an attempt to leave 
the insurance money to his wife 
chief assistant district attorney steve roberts said he was 
pleased with the convictions 
i think its a pretty heinous thing to hire someone to kill 
your spouse for money roberts said this puts to rest the 
theory and speculation that mr broomall wanted to commit suicide 
which we never believed for a minute 
boohers attorney darel mitchell said he was unsure if his 
client would appeal given his medical condition 
a life sentence in this case may have a whole new meaning 
mitchell said he will receive treatment while he is in custody 
where if he were free he has no insurance for medical care 
al hartley attorney for mrs broomall said she probably will 
appeal 
the case already has attracted the attention of people 
interested in securing book and movie rights both defense 
attorneys said 
the facts of this case just happen to be bizarre enough to 
attract a movie producers attention said assistant district 
attorney mike mcdaniel but i certainly would not like to think 
that anyone would benefit from criminal conduct

another soviet ethnic group 
dissidents described the stoppage in stepanakert in a region 
that armenians want transferred from the control of the republic of 
azerbaijan to the neighboring republic of armenia as a general 
strike 
soviet reports said more than 1500 civilian auxiliary police 
had moved into the azerbaijani city of sumgait and that similar 
forces patrolled the azerbaijani capital of baku 
stepanakert is in the disputed region of nagornokarabakh 
sumgait the scene of ethnic clashes that left at least 32 dead in

the capital of yerevan to crack down on street rallies calling for 
nagornokarabakhs annexation by armenia the official press said 
a moscow dissident alexander ogorodnikov on saturday described 
yerevan as a dead city with most people staying inside in 
silent protest 
armenians began strikes and street rallies feb 13 in 
stepanakert nagornokarabakhs main city demanding that the 
region be united with armenia 
armenians make up more than threequarters of nagornokarabakhs 
population but they say they suffer racial cultural and economic 
discrimination in azerbaijan most armenians are christians while 
azerbaijanis are mostly shiite moslems 
the government newspaper izvestia said sunday that authorities 
blocked the central streets of stepanakert and that militiamen were 
patrolling saturday 
the communist party newspaper pravda reported sunday that 1500 
civilian auxiliary police had been deployed in sumgait and in baku 
only reinforced voluntary public order squads made up of 
workers with red armbands who assist militia in the streets 
indicate that some tension still persists in baku pravda said 
the armenian nationalist protests subsided after soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev appealed feb 26 for restraint promising 
social and economic improvements 
but on wednesday the presidium of the supreme soviet the 
countrys highest executive body brushed aside the annexation 
demand 
armenians in nagornokarabakh then called for a general strike 
it began wednesday moscow dissident sergei grigoryants said sunday 
izvestia said sunday in a report from stepanakert enterprises 
in the city today saturday arent working except for essential 
services such as bread and milk factories transport water 
supply 
pravda said there is a relative lull in nagornokarabakh 
but the majority of enterprises of the regional center 
stepanakert are idle 
none of the articles however attributed the disruptions to a 
strike 
andrei bavitsky of the dissident journal glasnost had said in 
moscow that 15000 local policemen were patrolling stepanakert 
saturday 
grigoryants a former political prisoner who is half ethnic 
russian and half armenian said the stepanakert strike was 
scheduled to last through friday 
bavitsky and grigoryants said they received their information 
from telephone contacts in the region the government has barred 
foreign correspondents from the area and prevented phone calls to 
the region sunday

unpredictable consequences if they carry out demonstrations or 
strikes at least four armenian activists have been arrested in 
yerevan 
at least one of those arrested paruyr ayrikyan was charged 
under a law which gorbachevs administration has said was under 
review according to dissidents 
press club glasnost an unsanctioned moscow group of human 
rights activists said sunday it learned from ayrikyans relatives 
that he was charged under a law barring the defamation of the 
soviet union 
the very fact of ayrikyans arrest and charge represents a 
serious step backward a retreat to the times of repression against 
every independent opinion every free word press club glasnost 
said in an appeal to gorbachev to free ayrikyan 
ayrikyan 38 headed an underground armenian nationalist group 
called the national unification party and was jailed for 17 years

michigans primarystyle caucuses vowed sunday his democratic 
presidential campaign would continue to win and grow michael 
dukakis meanwhile acknowledged he had suffered a setback but 
told supporters the sweetest honey is made only slowly 
rep richard gephardt whose thirdplace finish in michigan may 
have dealt a fatal blow to his democratic bid spent sunday with 
his family deciding what his next move would be if the missouri 
congressman wants to seek reelection to his house seat he must 
file by tuesday afternoon 
gephardt scheduled a washington news conference monday afternoon 
to announce his plans aides speaking on condition of anonymity 
had already said a loss in michigan would finish his campaign 
jackson asserted that his michigan showing had put new punch 
into an alreadypowerful campaign 
it was the message of the soul and authenticity of jesse 
jackson versus money and technology and the people prevailed 
jackson told supporters at an airport news conference in new yorks 
westchester county its a campaign of hope that will 
continue to win and grow 
but dukakis said it was too soon to say how the democratic race 
is shaking out 
anyone that thinks that this race is over or even that its 
narrowed down to a twoperson or a threeperson race doesnt 
understand the unpredictability of american politics said 
dukakis who had hoped to seal an image of inevitablity with a 
michigan win there are no frontrunners 
jackson ran well across michigan but racked up enormous 
majorities in detroit in one of the citys congressional 
districts jacksons victory margin was better than 121 overall 
he outpolled dukakis by a nearly 21 margin 
the civil rights activist quickly turned to the next 
battleground heading for connecticut which holds its primary on 
tuesday 
with returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in michigan 
jackson had 107689 or 55 percent to 55337 or 28 percent for 
dukakis gephardt had 24995 or 13 percent sen paul simon had 
4069 or 2 percent and sen albert gore jr had 3818 or 2 percent 
when jackson got word of his michigan victory he was already 
campaigning in wisconsin which holds its primary on april 5 a 
statewide poll being published in mondays milwaukee sentinel

the poll indicated dukakis had the backing of 28 percent of 
democratic respondents while jackson had 27 percent and another 
22 percent were undecided simon had 10 percent gephardt 8 percent 
and gore 3 percent the margin of error in the telephone survey 
conducted march 1722 was 5 percentage points 
dukakis was in wisconsin when he heard the michigan results he 
flew home to boston then started stumping again in connecticut 
this is a long race he told backers in new haven on sunday 
at a greek celebration well have good days and notsogood 
daysbut this race is only half over 
dukakis was looking ahead to races like the new york primary on 
april 19 with 255 delegates at stake a poll published sunday in 
the new york daily news indicated he was the clear favorite 
trailed by jackson 
the daily news poll had dukakis favored by 45 percent of the 
democrats surveyed to 29 percent for jesse jackson none of the 
three other active democratic candidates was favored by more than 6 
percent of the voters who participated in the survey 
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 45 percent 
the massachusetts governor won precinct caucuses in north 
dakota which was just beginning its process of selecting 15 
delegates to the national democratic conventions and he also was 
winning iowas county conventions the latest step in that states 
complicated delegateselection process 
but dukakis has been trying to break away from the rest in the 
national delegate count and jacksons michigan victory which 
netted him a plurality of delegates from the state left him hot 
on dukakis heels 
in the latest ap delegate count dukakis had 60355 to jacksons 
59755 gore had 3628 simon 1715 gephardt 167 and uncommitted 
3626 
gore and simon did not seriously contest the michigan caucuses 
staking their hopes instead on the wisconsin primary 
gore was in connecticut sunday suggesting dukakis 
disappointing finish could help him by keeping the race wide 
open 
were building momentum steadilywere gaining speed he 
said said after a speech at an italianamerican club in the 
industrial city of derby this race has a long way to go it is 
wide open even more so after the results in michigan 
simon stressing his ties to wisconsin attended services sunday 
at a church in the tiny community of zachow where his late father 
was ordained as a lutheran minister 62 years ago simon later 
traveled to a site where his grandparents once farmed then to a 
family reunion with some of his cousins 
gephardt who has spent the last two years campaigning had said 
a michigan miracle could rejuvenate his campaign which had a 
strong start in iowa but has since racked up a string of losses 
we havent decided anything gephardt said were going to 
go home and have a family meeting on sunday afternoon spokesman 
mark johnson said no decision had been made 
but signs were pointing to a quick exit a missouri state party 
leader state rep anthony d ribaudo said he had spoken with 
gephardt saturday night and said gephardt indicated he would run 
for his house seat

copper once was king in montana but the 
monarch has been dethroned by gold 
while few would conjure visions of a gold rush on par with 
those of the last century theres no doubt that gold is fueling 
the states fastestgrowing industry 
we are looking at a period of major upswing said edward 
ruppell head of the montana bureau of mines and geology he 
expects a healthy amount of mining activity to continue as long as 
gold prices remain above 400 an ounce 
jim jensen executive director of the montana environmental 
information center believes weve got an oldfashioned gold 
rush on our hands 
while the state may not be experiencing a flood of major mining 
companies he said hordes of small one or twoman placer mining 
operations are tucked away in the backcountry theyre up every 
gulch and coulee in the state jensen said 
the scope of the mining is hard to measure because unlike the 
oncethriving copper industry centered in buttes huge openpit 
mines and anacondas giant smelter the search for gold is 
scattered out of sight in the hills and mountains 
people dont see in one spot the major impact mining has on 
the economy said gary langley executive director of the montana 
mining association 
montana has four major precious metal mines operating now 
employing about 900 people and producing more than 5 million ounces 
of gold and silver annually seven more projects in some stage of 
planning could more than double both employment and yearly 
production 
also exploration is booming the department of state lands 
which reviews all major mining applications estimates there are 
450 exploration projects under way the agency issued 111 
exploration permits last year twice the number recorded in 1982 
with so much exploration and so many projects on the drawing 
board i dont see that its going to turn around said kit 
walther chief of the departments hardrock bureau 
of the existing projects the pegasus gold operation at zortman 
and landusky is the states largest gold producer and the third 
largest supplier of silver opened in 1979 it produces 100000 
ounces of gold and 200000 ounces of silver per year 
the states largest underground mine near troy operated by 
american smelting and refining co since 1981 is the states 
largest silver producer at 36 million ounces annually 
the montana tunnels project south of helena started in april 
1986 and operated by pegasus expects to mine 85000 ounces of gold 
this year the golden sunlight mine east of whitehall began in 1982 
and produces up to 100000 ounces of gold per year 
the jardine joint venture planned for three miles north of 
yellowstone national park received state approval earlier this 
year and hopes for full production of 42000 ounces of gold per 
year by mid1989 
us borax and asarco inc have proposed large silver mines in 
the cabinet mountains of northwestern montana that together would 
produce 11 million ounces of silver per year 
langley said many of the mining ventures are centered on the 
same claims scoured by miners in montanas territorial days new 
technology in the use of cyanide makes it easier to separate gold 
from rock and more elaborate machinery smoothes the task of moving 
14 tons of earth to process one ounce of gold he said 
but the lure of gold is not without its problems 
jensen said the department of state lands does not have the 
experienced staff necessary to monitor all the mining projects 
properly especially those exempt from state review because their 
plans call for disturbing no more than five acres 
who knows what these people are doing until some problem 
occurs he said 
jensen also complains that mining companies take too lightly the 
danger of cyanide leaking into rivers and streams and that the 
state department is reluctant to require extensive environmental 
impact statements on projects he also said the state needs 
reclamation standards to govern openpit mines that dominate the 
precious metals industry 
dennis hemmer state lands commissioner denies his agency shies 
away from environmental reviews and langley said 
environmentalists opposition to mining projects is based on 
admittedly poor mining practices of the past the industry is more 
conscious of the environmental effects of its work than before he 
said 
but jensen is suspicious noting the state has yet to reject a 
single mine application 
maybe there should be a day when the state said here is a 
proposal to mine where the risk to other values clearly outweighs 
the benefits he said is mining something that can always go 
on and always has the highest value no matter what i dont think 
so

if you dont agree with one oilprice forecast 
for the 1990s just flip the page 
projections of perbarrel future prices are ranging from as low 
as 12 to as high as 46 with oil markets currently volatile and 
uncertain the future appears anything but clear 
some forecasters see a continuing market glut others see 
tightening oil supplies the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries is viewed both as on its way back to defining oil prices 
and as a fading force 
perhaps never before has the crystal ball of oil price 
forecasting been so buried in a blizzard of logic numbers and 
ultimately guesses 
since late 1985 prices for west texas intermediate crude the 
benchmark gauge of us prices have fluctuated from below 10 to 
above 20 in recent months the figure has gyrated between 15 and 
20 per 42gallon barrel 
although opec members agreed in december to keep the cartels 
official price at 18 per barrel reports of overproduction and 
price discounting by opec members have kept the market soft 
that picture could change dramatically in a few short years 
according to some experts chuck strain director of energy 
research at lovett mitchell webb amp garrison inc in houston 
projects that oil prices will rise from current levels to about 27 
in 1991 hitting a level that will last with fluctuations 
throughout much of the decade 
were basically more optimistic about crude than most other 
people strain said the kuwaitis and saudis will regain 
control of pricing in 19891990 
saudi arabia and kuwait are two of the cartels leading 
producers 
he believes increasing demand for opec oil will enable the 
cartel to enforce a firmer pricing line due to strong gasoline 
appetite and the limited attractiveness of energy alternatives 
the reason we level it off at 27 is that the saudis will 
raise the level of price to where it is below what would encourage 
alternate nonopec forms of energy said strain who also 
forecasts neither strong growth nor deep economic retrenchment 
during the next several years 
richard s pzena senior research analyst for sanford c 
bernstein amp co inc in new york believes oil prices will reach 
30 in 1992 rising to 3637 in 1995 gauged in 1988 dollars 
in my mind the issue is that the world needs opec oil and opec 
ought to try to charge the highest price it can get away with if it 
is being rational which is the highest it can charge without 
losing market share said pzena 
prices can probably keep going up to about 30 before you see 
a whole new category of nonopec oil become economic pzena 
said 
richard gordon director of market research for petroleum 
finance co in washington says he anticipates oil prices rising to 
29 to 46 per barrel in 1988 dollars in the first half of the 
1990s 
we believe it the price rise is going to come in first half 
of 1990s most probably in 1992 said gordon who says his 
research has been based on examination of oil prices over more than 
a century 
he estimates oil prices are subject to economic cycles of 
roughly 20 years from peak to peak and trough to trough 
we believe there are fundamental market factors that create 
this cycle and make it keep recurring and those factors are not 
related to opec and they are not a function of market shock 
gordon said they are related to longterm shifts in market 
fundamentals in the oil and gas sectors 
he believes the oil industry currently is focusing on trying to 
gain returns on safe projects rather than exploring new oil 
sources 
the industry has in effect begun a longterm strategic 
depletion of its reserves gordon said 
but joseph stanislaw managing director of cambridge energy 
research associates believes oil prices are unlikely to rise past 
24 per barrel over the next seven years he even has gone so far 
as to say prices could drop as low of 12 per barrel at some point 
in the 1990s 
stanislaw said in a recent speech that the oil industry should 
pay more attention to the individual motives of pivotal 
oilexporting countries such as saudi arabia iran and iraq and 
less attention to opec as a cartel 
forget opec i cant emphasize that enough stanislaw said 
adding that growth in nonopec production has diluted opecs 
influence every time we look we find oil 
another price bear is dale steffes founder of houstonbased 
planning amp forecasting consultants who believes oil prices in 1995 
are unlikely to be any higher than 14 measured in 1988 dollars 
why somebody thinks we are going to have high prices is beyond 
me he said there is too much oil in the world its 
overpriced and there is not enough demand

a prominent arab oil expert describing the 
present oil market as very weak warned sunday that the failure 
of opec members to abide by their output quotas could lead to a 
collapse of oil prices 
abdelaziz alwatari acting secretarygeneral of the 
organization of arab oil exporting countries said a recent arab 
energy conference held in baghdad iraq concluded that the oil 
market is very weak at present because of the absolute slowdown in 
oil demand and because projections of increase in demand have 
failed to come through 
in an interview with the kuwait news agency watari said this 
situation could last for five years he called for a profound 
commitment and high degree of credibility on the part of opec 
states to retain the present reference price of 18 a barrel 
the situation he said also required a high degree of 
cooperation from producers outside the 13nation organization of 
petroleum exporting countries seven of oapecs members including 
influential saudi arabia also are members of opec 
on friday crude oil prices firmed slightly in response to 
reports that members of opecs pricing committee would meet next 
month to discuss ways to stabilize the market 
on the new york mercantile exchange the may contract for west 
texas intemediate the benchmark us crude settled at 1703 per 
barrel up 7 cents from thursdays close 
saudi oil minister hisham nazer on wednesday called for an 
emergency meeting of the pricing committee amid reports some of the 
cartels members have been violating production quotas and prices 
decreed by opec 
the failure of states in opec to stick to the production 
sharing will set the stage for a price decline and any 
extraordinary increase in production could lead to the collapse of 
the price system in the foreseeable future watari warned 
in riyadh nazer discussed cooperation between opec and nonopec 
members with malaysian foreign minister datu alhaj abu alhasan 
ibn alhaj omar whose country is not a member of the cartel 
the official saudi press agency quoted nazer as saying that 
during the meeting the two ministers reviewed the role of 
nonopec producers in helping stabilize the oil market

corporate merger specialists tired of 
subsidizing coworker salaries quit and create their own company 
one of the countrys biggest law firms splinters in a feud over 
money and expansion an advertising giant teeters when executives 
join a newly formed rival wooing valued clients 
from madison avenue to wall street disgruntled managers are 
jumping ship with increasing frequency a trend that reflects their 
frustration at working for someone else and fear of getting 
victimized in an uncertain climate of corporate takeovers experts 
say 
companies are going to have to do more to give individuals the 
ability to function as entrepreneurs said frank palma senior 
vice president of executive search at goodrich amp sherwood co a 
management consulting firm if they dont well see more people 
venture into their own businesses 
to some extent management analysts say many talented 
executives feel they have a better survival chance if they start 
their own companies rather than remain loyal to employers that 
could suddenly become takeover targets 
instead of being the swallowee why not do the swallowing 
palma said i just see a change in the perspective of good many 
people because of all the insecure aspects of being a member of 
the corporate environment going into your own business is not 
perceived as such a big risk as it was 20 years ago 
denise rousseau associate professor of organizational behavior 
at northwestern universitys kellogg graduate management school 
said the urge to jump ship also is a result of a growing service 
economy in which the products are largely thoughts and ideas 
we just simply have a greater portion of the population in 
knowledge based businesses she said people can more readily 
take with them the wherewithal of their work 
some of the most visible departures came after the october stock 
market collapse which shrank wall street profits and forced 
austerity upon securities firms that had grown fat and complacent 
many takeover specialists grew annoyed over directives to take 
salary cuts especially when their dealmaking remained one of the 
few postcrash moneymakers 
at first boston corp coheads of the investment banking unit 
quit and formed their own firm the cohead of shearson lehman 
huttons mergers department quit after a reported clash with the 
chief executive 
last week salomon brothers inc lost one of its celebrities 
former white house budget director david stockman who joined the 
much smaller blackstone group as head of corporate acquisitions in 
addition merrill lynch amp co and kidder peabody amp co have 
suffered defections by some of their brightest stars 
the splintering also has affected the legal profession an area 
in which up until recently mergers and the growth of supersized 
firms had been common one of the biggest examples came last year 
with the demise of the nations fourthbiggest law firm finley 
kumble wagner heine underberg manley myerson amp casey which 
once had 700 attorneys in offices nationwide 
greed excessive expansion salaries paid with borrowed money 
and a management struggle at the top caused lawyers to start 
resigning en masse starting last summer according to press 
accounts of finley kumbles collapse 
another publicized episode of shipjumping came more recently 
when the chairman president and more than a dozen other key people 
at advertising giant lord geller federico einstein inc quit to 
form a new agency 
the mass departures stemmed from an autonomy dispute with lord 
gellers british parent wpp group plc fearing the exodus would 
collapse the firm and send clients over to the new rival wpp went 
to court to sue the defectors 
this type of litigation which centers around an area called 
intellectual property rights likely will increase as the number of 
employees who quit to form their own companies rises experts say 
theres a fine line between what is owned by a company and 
what is owned by the individual who works for it said edith 
weiner a partner at the management consulting firm of weiner 
edrich brown inc 
in the service business were finding more problems with 
intellectual property its expanding beyond the issue of taking 
clients into technical knowledge and ideas she said 
the technological revolution itself has erased some of the 
physical impediments of quitting and starting your own company she 
said particularly because of the vast sources of information 
available via computer 
its very easy to walk out the door all you have to do is 
walk out with it on a computer disk she said you used to 
have to take file cabinets

steve florio talked to his longtime advertising 
agency nearly every day but says he was as surprised as anyone 
when lord geller federico einstein inc began to unravel 10 days 
ago 
it was a friday afternoon and florio the president and chief 
executive of new yorker magazine inc called to discuss some minor 
changes in an ad layout 
he asked for arthur einstein jr a founding partner at the 
highly regarded agency that has been making new yorker ads for 17 
years 
einstein wasnt there his secretary told me arthur and dick 
lord had resigned that six of them had walked out florio said 
the walkout on march 18 was followed by other defections and 
within a week florio had decided he would drop lord geller as his 
ad agency other clients including giant international business 
machines corp said they are reassessing the situation too 
the events have been the talk of madison avenue where business 
and personal relations often seem inextricably bound 
einstein said he and his five colleagues left to start a new 
agency because they felt they couldnt operate as they wanted to 
under the management of wpp group plc which acquired lord geller 
last summer 
since the six top executives left an estimated 30 of lord 
gellers 325 employees have quit some joining their old colleagues 
at a new agency called lord einstein oneill amp partners 
lord geller has gone to court charging that the departed 
executives breached fiduciary duties and conspired to take business 
from the agency the firm asks that the defectors be enjoined from 
soliciting lord geller clients and employees a state supreme court 
hearing has been set for monday 
wpp which is headed by the financiallyadept martin sorrell 
bought lord geller as part of its 566 million purchase in july 
1987 of jwt group inc which also owned the advertising giant j 
walter thompson co 
lord geller and j walter thompson had been operated 
independently since lord geller was acquired by thompson in 1974 
einstein said he and his partners grew increasingly disaffected 
under wpps ownership but sorrell refused to discuss selling the 
agency to them 
they objected to wpps reported plans to set up a network of 
agencies in europe that could boast an affiliation with lord geller 
they bristled when sorrell prohibited lord geller from competing 
for general motors corps new saturn automobile account 
reportedly for fear of offending ford motor co j walter 
thompsons biggest client 
the new yorkers florio said einstein had never mentioned that 
he and his colleagues were having problems under wpp management 
after being told einstein had left the agency florio said he 
phoned einstein and told him that he wanted to continue working 
with him 
sorrell stopped by on monday to talk with florio and asked him 
to defer a decision on moving the account because two respected 
admakers dick thomas and chuck griffith would be staying on it 
but when florio called griffith the next day to discuss the 
changes he had in mind for the ad he was told griffith had left 
for good 
he asked for thomas was switched over and then told thomas had 
left the agency an hour ago 
florio asked to talk with sorrell who told him there were 
plenty of talented people at the agency to get the ad done but 
florio didnt like the idea that you could just slap somebody on 
the account and told sorrell to freeze my campaign for the 
time being 
florio said he was now genuinely worried about the ad deadline 
and called the lord geller executive who normally placed the new 
yorker ads he was told she had left the agency as well 
all the creative people and the media people that i had dealt 
with had resigned i literally dont know anybody there florio 
said 
on friday florio said he planned to send a letter next week 
dismissing the agency and would take the account to lord einstein 
the new yorker is a relatively small account spending about 
15 million on advertising this year lord geller handles billings 
of about 245 million a year which in turn is dwarfed by the 32 
billion that thompson bills 
the walkout touched off a scramble by other agencies for lord 
gellers accounts florio said he heard from six other agencies in 
the past week 
jerry della femina who heads della femina travisano amp partners 
is among them he bets most clients wont move to the new agency 
given the legal challenges that lord geller has raised 
della femina said some lord geller clients may say a plague on 
both their houses and look for a new agency

bowing out of the fight to take over american 
standard inc hasnt left black amp decker chairman nolan d 
archibald on the ropes 
hes still on the lookout for another good acquisition and wont 
rule out another hostile takeover bid and in the eyes of wall 
street walking away from the bidding war may have raised his 
standing a notch or two 
we have a list of companies weve been looking at for more 
than a year he said in an interview american standard was at 
the top of that list when another company hits the top well go 
after it it could be a week or six months 
archibald wants to make black amp decker a homerelatedproducts 
powerhouse the plan is to take advantage of the towson toolmakers 
worldwide distribution network and marketing skills by adding new 
products a process that began with its acquisition of general 
electrics home appliance group 
we dont want to be a conglomerate but we do want to become a 
much bigger company than we are now he said 
he wont say how big but taking over american standard would 
have created one of the baltimorewashington areas largest 
companies with sales approaching 5 billion 
he has enlisted the corps delite of investment banking shearson 
lehman hutton goldman sachs morgan stanley and first boston 
among others to beat the bushes for a suitable match 
had the run at american standard been successful archibald 
envisioned weaving its strong plumbing and fixtures lines into 
black amp deckers consumeroriented building product lines the 
merger would have made black amp decker a key player in the new 
housing market and complemented its strong position in professional 
power tools 
archibald said black amp decker has its eye on several companies 
and added that its next acquisition target could be smaller than 
american standard it could also be a friendly one 
there are a lot of companies out there up for sale due to past 
mergers and spinoffs a lot of the opportunities were looking at 
fall into that category he said 
however a few public companies are also being considered and 
archibald doesnt rule out the possibility of making another 
hostile bid 
archibald said hes not chagrined at losing american standard to 
kelso amp co which beat out black amp decker with a 25 billion 
offer the towsonbased power tool maker wasnt willing to match he 
said there is nothing he would have done differently from a 
tactical standpoint 
we could have bought the company but the bidding got to a 
level that wasnt in line with our financial objectives he said 
though the towson manufacturer lost the contest for american 
standard archibald walked away from the possibility of overpaying 
and diluting nearterm profits and pocketed a 25 million payoff 
from kelso which looks good to wall street 
they played a good wellorchestrated game but in the end 
decided it wasnt worth risking diluting earnings knowing when to 
walk away and getting paid for it demonstrates the maturity of this 
companys management team said bentley offutt president of 
offutt securities inc in towson 
people were relieved said robert o grady a securities 
salesman for alex brown amp sons in new york they were loading up 
with debt to purchase a 36 stock now the company has returned to 
what it was two months ago a beautifully run company with great 
earnings potential
