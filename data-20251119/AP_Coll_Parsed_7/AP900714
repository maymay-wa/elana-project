employees of a grocery store are losing 
patience with the continuing escapades of a squirrel that has taken 
up residence amid the coffee cakes doughnuts and hot dog rolls 
the critter has run up a 25 tab at the farm fare iga over the 
last two weeks 
employees took to shooing the squirrel outside but it keeps 
coming back 
it was a joke the first couple of times but now he is 
beginning to be a problem said store manager dick emery 
the squirrel once jumped over a womans shoulder as she reached 
for a box of rice leaving her shrieking as it hightailed it up 
the aisle 
i came in one morning and there he was just sitting down on 
top of the wine coolers in the front of the store emery said 
it was almost as if he was waiting for the chase to begin 
fritz sabbow executive director of the local humane society 
said the only way to catch the squirrel will be with a net and it 
wont be easy they are pretty quick

if math teachers are asked 98 questions 
on a certification test how many do they have to get right to 
pass a 90 b 70 c 60 or d 49 
in a new certification test in florida the correct answer is c 
and although a score of 60 would earn most students a d on a math 
exam the florida standard is high compared to some other states 
fifteen states use a different exam developed by a national 
testing company and have established cutoff scores that range from 
approximately 35 percent of 150 questions to a high of 
approximately 55 percent 
it wont do any good to have passing scores that nobody 
can reach said tom fisher head of testing for the florida 
department of education 
the supply and demand of teachers is a problem that always 
confronts states as they debate certification requirements said 
catherine havrilesky executive director of teacher programs at 
educational testing service ets in princeton nj 
and math teachers are in short supply everywhere according to 
iris carl president of the national council of teachers of 
mathematics and director of mathematics for the houston independent 
school district 
marita eng a high school math teacher in jacksonville who sat 
on an advisory panel that recommended a higher cutoff score in 
florida said international comparisons of student performance show 
that the united states is in the middle of a crisis in 
mathematics education 
one of the problems eng said is poorly prepared teachers 
carl conceded the scores required of math teachers across the 
nation seem low and concern her 
however defenders of the testing system point out that the 
exams include hard questions and arent designed to result in 
extremely high scores 
the ets developed the 150question test used by 15 states it 
also offers tests in about 40 other subjects 
some of the other cutoff scores include from 50 percent to 55 
percent for early childhood education from 40 percent to 45 
percent in earthspace science from 40 percent to 55 percent for 
chemistry and from 40 percent to 60 percent in physics 
in math the low qualifying score was set by kentucky at 35 
percent and the high by california at 55 percent 
rod roth who worked on adoption of the ets test in arkansas 
said he didnt think the overall national standards were low the 
test is designed to spread out the results by including some very 
difficult questions according to roth now dean of the college of 
education at the university of alabama at tuscaloosa 
the ets havrikesky said the important issue about the math test 
was whether it was fair 
besides the 15 states that use the ets test four are 
considering adopting it five other states have customized tests 
developed with the help of national evaluation systems in amherst 
mass nes does not have figures for those states 
probably about a third of the states dont require specific math 
certification tests for teachers according to roth 
emily feistritzer director of the national center for education 
information a private research organization in washington called 
it shocking that each state sets its own teacher certification 
standards 
the data is so scattered there really is no national data as 
far as teachers are concerned she said 
but carl noted that the same 1987 study that put the best us 
students near the bottom in international math ability found that 
most high school math teachers in the united states were better 
trained than their japanese counterparts 
fisher of the florida education department recommended to gov 
bob martinez and the cabinet last month that the state require a 
cutoff score of 49 
fisher based his arguments on the performance record established 
by the first several hundred people to take floridas test if 
prospective math teachers were required to correctly answer half 
the test twothirds would probably pass he said 
martinez and the cabinet members said 49 was too low but they 
also rejected an advisory panels suggestions that the state 
establish a score of 70 
if the state had adopted that standard only 14 percent of the 
first 332 people to take the math test would have passed with a 
passing score of 60 the success rate is expected to be 37 percent

here are the cutoff scores established 
by the 15 states that use the math teacher test developed by the 
educational testing service in princeton nj 
ets grading consists of converting a raw score of the total 
number of correct answers to 150 multiplechoice questions to a 
score on a scale ranging from 250 to 990 this is done 
statistically to account for any variations in the difficulty of 
various versions of the test 
roughly speaking the score of 500 equates to 35 percent and the 
score of 630 equates to 55 percent according to kim kimble an 
administrator of teacher programs and services with ets the median 
score of 540 equates to 40 percent 
arkansas 530 
california 630 
connecticut 580 
hawaii 530 
indiana 530 
kentucky 500 
louisiana 550 
maryland 520

new jersey 550 
north carolina 510 
pennsylanvia 540 
south carolina 560 
tennesseee 520 
virginia 580 
 
missouri nevada new york ohio in february were in the process 
of adopting the test and have yet to establish cutoff scores

it is 730 am time for the new daily 
ritual that precedes the one ernest hemingway made famous 
an hour before the running of the bulls a line of 30 policemen 
sweeps down the blockedoff cobblestone streets that lead from 
pamplonas corrals to the bullring clearing out drunken revelers 
street cleaning machines follow armed with highpowered hoses 
that blast away another nights accumulation of plastic cups 
champagne bottles and other trash 700 tons each day according to 
one local newspaper 
this years raucous weeklong san fermin festival was to end 
today the annual fiesta immortalized in hemingways 1926 novel 
the sun also rises has been held continuously since 1591 but 
the flood of foreigners who now attend has changed the nature of 
san fermin 
the main problem is that its overcrowded said jose miguel 
olaiz who helps coordinate the navarre regional governments 
special 12ambulance emergency service during the festival 
when i was a kid we were mostly locals with a few outsiders 
now its the opposite the 37yearold pamplona native said many 
locals leave the city during the fiesta to avoid the noise and 
crush 
handling the media takes up so much time now that the regional 
emergency service last year began sending out daily faxes with 
information on gorings and other injuries the computerized 
information is broken down according to age sex time of day and 
type of injury 
records kept since the festival began indicate 52 people have 
met their deaths on the horns of running bulls 13 since 1924 when 
hemingway reportedly first saw the event 
the morning running of the bulls which usually lasts no more 
than five minutes is covered live on national television and radio 
more than 100 people mainly young men test their mettle by 
running ahead of and alongside the bulls and six steers along the 
halfmile route to the bullring where the bulls are killed in the 
days bullfight 
city fathers now issue special passes to limit the number of 
photographers and cameramen allowed on the specially built 
barricades that separate the bulls and runners from the public 
they have also tried to reduce the number of people who run with 
the bulls during the annual festival which honors the patron saint 
of pamplona a city of 200000 
up to 100 people some of them firsttimers pumped up by 
alcohol now join the core group of 2030 natives or mozos 
who carry rolled up newspapers to fend off the bulls 
the novices sometimes get in the way of the natives and 
occasionally mistreat the bulls and steers this week one youth 
dressed in the traditional white shirt and pants and red bandanna 
punched another runner who hit a bull 
women traditionally do not run with the bulls and few are ever 
seen among the runners 
the number of tourists has also increased the incidence of 
injuries related to drunkenness olaiz said 
its not that the local people drink less but at least they 
go home at the end of the night he said some of the 
foreigners seem to come expressly to drink they dont understand 
the spirit of the fiesta 
since the hotels are filled to overflowing many foreigners 
sleep less than the youth of pamplona who generally dont go to 
bed until the 8 am running of the bulls is over 
families that begin their day with the daily bull run now are 
oblivious to sleeping revelers stretched out on city benches on 
top of cars in doorways and on park grass 
but the worst time of the day according to the navarre 
emergency services faxes comes at around 3 pm 
thats when the energy level of the fiesta goes down and 
people who have been drinking sit down and realize just how bad off 
they are olaiz said

it was the moment arjan xhaferi had been 
waiting for 
hundreds of albanians were surging into foreign embassies in the 
capital he learned one night two weeks ago in no time the 
32yearold factory worker was on the phone to his friends in 
shkodar a city in northern albania 
i said hurry we can win our liberty he recalled a few 
nights later xhaferi his pregnant wife his daughter and their 
friends clambered over the wall of the west german embassy in 
tirana 
on friday they were among more than 4000 people who were 
ferried out of albania to italy in a sealift set up through un 
mediation 
i have sacrificed everything even my life said xhaferi 
speaking in italian we have searched for liberty for so much 
time 
he gazed at his wife who was smiling despite the heat and 
fatigue a hand resting on her swollen belly 
we hope the baby is free he said grinning shyly 
the xhaferis had some particular reasons for being unhappy in 
albania 
a friend had tried unsuccessfully to flee the country and his 
family was under pressure from the government xhaferi said 
but they had more general reasons too the poor quality of life 
and the ban on the practice of religion which hurt the roman 
catholic family 
albania was 70 percent moslem before the government closed all 
mosques and churches in 1967 
we want freedom we want a new economy a new government and a 
new society of democracy xhaferi declared 
while the west german embassy provided the door to a new life 
the xhaferis did not have an easy time there 
every day the albanian government shut off the water for 
several hours in the building packed with 3200 refugees toilets 
stopped working and overflowed men slept in a few rooms crowded 
on the floor women and children in other rooms 
nonetheless he says west german diplomats were wonderful 
giving them meat and bread as well as milk for 5yearold arrisa 
the xhaferis finally got to leave the embassy late thursday 
after ferries sent by western european governments for the refugees 
docked in the port of durres 
but the ordeal was not over yet the heat in the 
governmentowned busses was oppressively high and it was 
impossible to open the windows xhaferi said 
their ferry left at 3 am friday and pulled into port seven 
hours later still ahead for the family was a 30hour train trip to 
west germany 
but there were no complaints 
we are leaving communism forever xhaferi grinned

while the government is redesigning currency 
to thwart counterfeiters it ought to make the bills more 
attractive says a man who used to run the treasurys 
moneyproducing agency 
the principles and history of a country are recounted in the 
art of bank notes robert j leuver told the senate banking 
committee on friday we seem to have lost the art majesty and 
history provided in our national bank notes of 1896 silver 
certificates of 1896 and the beautiful 2 bill of 1976 
the tin lizzy vintage car on the back of the 10 bill 
harkens to a different time and does not afford the counterfeit 
detection we need said leuver a former chief of the bureau of 
engraving and printing who now directs the american numismatic 
association 
leuver said most of the anticounterfeiting deterrents built 
into currency are less effective than they could be because of the 
50yearold design of the bills 
as an example he mentioned the mylar security thread that 
soon will become a part of every greenback the thread will include 
printing that can be read only in indirect light 
this deterrent will particularly thwart counterfeiters who ply 
their trade outside of the united states he said however the 
current design of the note obscures the thread or causes it to 
be overlooked 
leuver along with officials from the secret service and the 
bureau of engraving and printing endorsed a bill to toughen laws 
against counterfeiting 
carl v dalessandro assistant director of the bureau told the 
committee that currency and other securities can be counterfeited 
with remarkable accuracy using widely available computers printers 
and copiers 
the potential counterfeiter no longer requires any particular 
expertise in printing but only the inclination and the electronic 
devices he said 
just as the counterfeiting of currency by multicolored copiers 
has increased greatly over the past few years so will the use of 
computer laser scanners as a means to scan store and subsequently 
counterfeit currency said william j ebert who heads the secret 
services counterfeit division 
ebert said 138 million of counterfeit currency was passed in 
this country last year and 752 million was seized before it was 
put into circulation some 103 million in bogus us bills was 
confiscated abroad 
the measure dallesandro and ebert endorsed would make it a 
crime to possess any lasertype device the treasury department 
concludes would help a counterfeiter and would ensure that 
duplication of currency by any electronic method is illegal 
it would bar private possession of any counterfeitdeterrent 
device including watermarks and seals just as the distinctive 
paper on which greenbacks are printed now is protected 
but kenneth a wasch executive director of the software 
publishers association whose members develop computer programs 
said the bill is so broad that many heretofore legal activities 
may now be made illegal 
he said the prohibition on private possession of certain optical 
devices could mean document scanners desktop computers a number 
of software programs laser printers and other hightech wonders 
could be outlawed even though they are in use everywhere

president bush is eager to sign civil rights 
legislation aimed at drawing millions of disabled americans into 
the work force and marketplace 
this legislation will serve as a declaration of independence 
for millions of persons with disabilities in this country bush 
said friday after a 916 senate vote sent the americans with 
disabilities act to the white house 
it will change the way we live forever said the chief 
senate sponsor democrat tom harkin of iowa 
in a dramatic conclusion of nine months of debate on the bill 
harkin addressed the senate in sign language as a tribute to his 
brother frank who is deaf 
i wanted to say to my brother frank that today was my proudest 
day in 16 years in congress harkin explained 
the bill aims at doing for people with mental and physical 
impairments what the 1964 civil rights act strived to do for blacks 
and other minorities it bans discrimination against the disabled 
in employment public accommodations transportation and 
telecommunications 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush would sign the 
bill into law as soon as a ceremony could be arranged probably as 
early as next week fitzwater called the measure one of the most 
important accomplishments of this administration 
civil rights lobbyists complain that the white house did little 
to help the bill after the senate initially passed it last 
september by a 768 vote fridays vote was on a compromise version 
theres no question that president bush and attorney general 
dick thornburgh played a constructive role in fashioning a 
bipartisan consensus in the senate in 1989 said ralph g neas 
executive director of the leadership conference on civil rights an 
umbrella group for civil rights and labor organizations we have 
applauded that effort 
but neas added theres no question that since september 1989 
the administration has done very little 
in the meantime the bill went through a series of house 
hearings leading to house approval of its own version 40320 in 
may the house passed the compromise 37728 thursday night 
between the original votes in the house and senate lawmakers 
were lobbied strongly by the chamber of commerce and the national 
federation of independent business which complained the bill is 
excessively burdensome 
although a few minor concessions emerged the senate bill 
remained basically intact the senate bill had been refined after 
extensive negotiations with the white house 
the bill was conceived in 1988 by the national council on 
disability a 15member commission appointed by president reagan 
the original legislation introduced by sen lowell weicker 
rconn and cosponsored by harkin was scuttled because of various 
problems harkin sponsored the new bill last year 
the final hurdle was an amendment from the house that would have 
let employers reassign aidsinfected workers from foodhandling 
duties 
under an agreement reached early thursday by house and senate 
negotiators aidsinfected workers could be reassigned only if the 
department of health and human services found that the disease 
could be passed along through contact with food 
hhs secretary louis w sullivan and other officials say no 
evidence exists that aids is spread through food or casual contact 
in an effort to ease its impact on business lawmakers included 
language phasing in the bills requirements the bill also exempts 
from the hiring provisions businesses with fewer than 15 employees 
voting against the bill friday were sens christopher s bond 
rmo jake garn rutah jesse helms rnc gordon humphrey

the agency that ran nuclear weapons production 
in the 1940s rejected secret advice to study cancer risks for its 
workers even though it knew some were exposed to large doses of 
radiation documents show 
records of the atomic energy commission also show that airborne 
emissions of radiation continued at the hanford nuclear reservation 
in washington state from the plants startup in 1944 until at 
least the mid1950s 
the aec was a predecessor to the energy department which owns 
all the governments nuclear arms factories 
the government first acknowledged the hanford problems publicly 
in 1986 although much information about radiation releases there 
is still classified as secret 
on thursday a panel of health experts disclosed that one in 20 
residents living near hanford on the columbia river near richland 
wash between late 1944 and december 1947 absorbed a level of 
radiation equal to 1200 times what the energy department now 
considers a safe limit 
the panel of independent health specialists said the releases of 
radioactive iodine a byproduct of extracting plutonium from 
uranium were serious enough to justify a study of potential 
illnesses or deaths related to the emissions 
the release of the report marked the first time the government 
has publicly acknowledged that radiation releases from its nuclear 
arms factories could have harmed human health 
yet the government was made aware shortly after the hanford 
plant began operating in september 1944 that airborne contaminants 
posed serious health risks 
in a march 1948 report the radiation health and safety chief at 
hanford wrote that emissions of radioactive particles from the 
plants plutoniumprocessing buildings can produce radiation 
damage he also said that the theoretical possibility of injury 
developing 10 to 15 years from now poses a serious problem 
the atomic energy commission rejected a recommendation by its 
biology and medicine advisory panel in early 1949 that studies be 
conducted on possible links between cancer and hanford workers 
exposure to radiation aec records show 
the aec records were cited in a december 1989 report by the 
democratic majority staff of the senate governmental affairs 
committee that recommended the energy department make public more 
of its longsecret data on radiation releases at hanford 
the latest government admission of potential health hazards to 
people near hanford is part of an evolution of openness about 
nuclear weapons operations 
in a 1945 government report that revealed the existence of the 
oncesecret hanford and other plants an army official involved in 
the project wrote factors of safety used in plant design and 
operation are so great that the hazards of the home and the family 
car are far greater for the personnel than any arising from the 
plants 
gene plock who worked as an engineer at hanfords 
plutoniumprocessing buildings from 1946 to 1950 said in an 
interview friday that he and others in his work crew were informed 
of the emissions problem in late 1946 months after it was 
discovered by general electric co which ran hanford under a 
government contract 
plock said he and some other workers then began wearing 
protective masks 
he said he recommended that military guards outside the building 
also be informed and that they be required to wear protective 
masks he said ge rejected his suggestion 
their response was no lets not alarm them he said 
the hanford study released thursday contains the most specific 
information known to the public about radiation releases at that 
facility yet it tells only part of the story of accidental and 
intentional emissions of radiation from hanford 
in addition to the radioactive iodine significant amounts of 
plutonium particles ruthenium americium and other potentially 
cancercausing products were released from processing stacks on the 
560squaremile plant in 1940s and 50s according to aec records

the republican party is urging its local leaders 
to rally behind president bush as he considers tax increases that 
many in the gop wish he would go back to opposing 
the presidents abrupt switch on taxes late last month caught 
most republicans off guard and left many questioning why bush 
would abandon his campaign pledge with crucial 1990 elections just 
four months away 
after initially lying low in the tax debate party leaders came 
out swinging friday painting bushs turnabout as a tough but bold 
move to help erase the federal deficit 
republican illinois gov james thompson said bush had the 
courage to summon up the political will to do what was right for 
the country 
but angry conservative leaders called a news conference in 
washington to denounce bushs retreat on taxes and other stands and 
threaten a possible reelection challenge 
if the president stays in his present course he will be 
challenged in 1992 almost certainly in the republican primaries 
and certainly in the general election said howard phillips 
chairman of the conservative caucus 
bush has dealt a crippling blow to his own credibility 
added david a keene chairman of the american conservative union 
despite their understandable trepidation over the possible 
political fallout thompson said it was no time for republicans to 
back away from bush 
it is the obligation of republicans i think to stand up for 
the president when the president is willing to take the political 
heat to stand up for the nation the governor said 
the gop leaders led by vice president dan quayle insisted the 
next move is up to democrats they said the democrats must offer 
significant domestic spending cuts and budgetprocess reforms or 
watch bush call off the bipartisan budget talks 
we have put revenues on the table quayle said in a speech 
to the republican national committees midyear meeting today i 
call on the congressional democrats to come forth with their 
proposed spending cuts their silence on this issue as usual is 
deafening 
quayle told the rnc members that bush would not cut a deal 
favorable to democrats 
his position is simple quayle said a good deal or no 
deal at all 
if the democrats dont make significant proposals soon many 
republicans believe bush should walk out on the talks 
such a move won a ringing endorsement from peggy noonan a 
former speechwriter for reagan and bush who wrote bushs read my 
lips no new taxes pledge 
noonan who is no longer involved in party affairs won applause 
from the rnc when she suggested bush should push himself away 
from the table and cut himself a walking stick unless democrats 
offer sizable spending cuts 
i truly believe we must not lose the tax issue she said 
there is no more potent issue than this

the research team will use a recently developed cloning process 
to extract genetic chains from samples of skin and bone tissue

the idea will be to look for dna sequences comparable to the 
sequence left by aids infection dr jan gelen a biochemist 
working on the research team said friday 
the tissue analyses are scheduled to begin early next year

the prosecution in marion barrys trial is 
nearing the end of its case and the mayors lawyers say they plan 
an extensive defense that could last nearly two weeks 
ten to 15 witnesses will appear on barrys behalf at his cocaine 
and perjury trial defense attorney r kenneth mundy said friday 
he said the testimony is going to be full of thrills and 
surprises 
its not been decided whether barry will take the witness stand 
in his own defense but the mayor is champing at the bit to 
testify mundy told reporters 
the government began presenting its case june 19 and is expected 
to finish tuesday when the trial resumes its remaining witnesses 
are two friends of the mayor bettye smith and doris crenshaw 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson said he anticipates 
the defense case could take the trial into the last full week of 
july 
on friday a longtime friend of the mayor darrell sabbs said 
his recollections of the timing of cocaine use with the mayor were 
heavily influenced by the fbi and prosecutors 
sabbs who was reluctantly testifying for the prosecution said 
he used cocaine with barry five times between 1986 and 1989 but he 
said he has great difficulty remembering the years of the alleged 
use 
sabbs said he was under intense pressure by the government to 
testify 
mundy suggested to sabbs that he had been told by the fbi 
regarding certain details of his alleged cocaine use with the 
mayor it had to be this way 
yes sabbs replied 
that happened repeatedly said mundy 
it happened quite a few times sabbs agreed 
you have difficulty with events and its difficult to say 
with specificity when where and what occurred mundy said at one 
point 
its been hard yes sir sabbs responded 
he said the criminality and the politics have been so intense 
in this case that my responses only reflected the stress i 
was under 
sabbs told the fbi in march that he snorted cocaine with the 
mayor at a restaurant in 1989 in may he told the fbi it had taken 
place a year earlier he then changed it back to 1989 when he 
testified before a federal grand jury 
he settled on 1987 when he testified thursday at barrys trial 
after prosecutors showed sabbs an invitation to his own birthday 
party at the restaurant he said however that he had birthday 
parties at the restaurant twice and now thinks barrys appearance 
was at the one in 1987 
i am very confused it leaves me very baffled said sabbs 
barry is charged with 10 counts of possessing cocaine one count 
of conspiracy and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury 
about drug use 
cesar gaviria the presidentelect of colombia said in an 
interview in todays editions of the washington post that if barry 
were not convicted a lot of damage would be done to his 
embattled countrys war on druglords 
we are on the front lines we are losing so many lives 
confronting terrorism and bombings fighting the 
narcotraffickers gaviria told the newspaper 
to see a person who has been mayor who has been a very 
important person in this country and consumes drugs and he 
doesnt have any sanctions we would have a lot of damage in 
colombian opinion 
barrys press secretary lurma rackley said the mayor would 
have no comment on gavirias remarks

the census bureaus claim that it has counted 
995 percent of all us households on its master list does not 
mean the census will be accurate two lawmakers say 
the claim is as nonsensical as a little kid saying his room is 
all clean after he has shoved all of his clothes and toys in the 
closet and closes the door rep charles schumer dny said 
friday 
sen daniel p moynihan dny agreed 
when it is declared that a city a county has been 100 
percent enumerated that simply means that all the known residences 
have been heard from moynihan said there will always be 
some missing in the count 
the criticism came at a senate governmental affairs committee 
hearing on the status of the headcount and the nomination of 
barbara everitt bryant to be director of the bureau of the census 
schumer contended that the 1990 census has been riddled with 
inaccuracies and omissions that will render it the worst national 
head count in us history 
the magnitude of the census bureaus mission does not excuse 
it from the sorts of logistical and bureaucratic gaffes we have 
witnessed over the past few months schumer testified 
but bryant who has been acting census bureau director for seven 
months stressed that the tally isnt finished and the fat lady 
has not sung 
this has been a wellplanned census despite what some 
detractors said she said 
schumer ticked off a list of problems including the fact that 
at least 18 percent of new york citys households did not receive 
forms because the bureaus mailing lists were so bad 
however rep tom sawyer dohio who chairs the house post 
office subcommittee on census and population declined to call the 
census a failure 
i dont believe either that the census bureau has failed to 
execute the best census it could he said but what i am 
prepared to say at this juncture is that the design of the census 
appears inadequate to measure a society as diverse and complex as 
ours 
officials from the general accounting office congress 
investigative arm agreed that the 1990 census presented unusual 
challenges 
l nye stevens director of the gaos business operations issues 
department pointed to a lowerthanexpected response rate to 
mailed questionnaires staffing problems and money shortages 
gao believes that the 1990 census experience demonstrates the 
need for fundamental rethinking of how the 2000 and future censuses 
should be taken he testified 
new york city and several other large urban centers have gone to 
court to force the commerce department to statistically adjust the 
census for an expected undercount such methodology now exists 
moynihan said but the commerce department overruled the census 
bureaus plans to use it 
it is on the edge of scandal he added they said do not 
do what was clearly a constitutional responsibility 
new york mayor david n dinkins said the commerce departments 
reluctance to adjust for an undercount is politically motivated 
i can find no other rationale to which to assign this decision 
except political consideration he said 
dinkins asked the committee to make sure that bryant and the 
census bureau live up to the courtmandated agreement to make an 
adjustment decision no later than july 15 1991

the army is closing 50 college rotc units in 
27 states as part of a broad plan to shrink the service 
the shutdowns effective at the end of the 199091 academic 
year will affect students at colleges and universities primarily 
in the northeast and midwest that have small numbers of cadets 
g kim wincup assistant army secretary for manpower and reserve 
affairs said friday that closing the reserve officers training 
corps units was deemed necessary to cut the armys overall size by 
20 percent over the next five years 
its a pretty painful process for the army he said we 
just need fewer lieutenants to come on active duty 
wincup said the army also faces increasing budget pressures as 
congress tries to reshape the nations defenses in line with a 
collapsing sovietbloc military threat 
the elimination of 50 rotc units will save the army about 23 
million a year wincup said and will cost the jobs of 740 army 
personnel involved in the programs 
he said he could not estimate how many cadets would be affected 
but he said the armys aim was to reduce the total number of 
graduating rotc cadets to about 6000 a year from about 7800 
after the 50 rotc units are closed the army will have 363 units 
left in 50 states and the district of columbia puerto rico and 
guam eleven units were closed earlier this year 
wincup said cadets who are in one of the units to be closed next 
year but not scheduled to graduate by then will be guaranteed a 
place in an rotc program on a nearby campus only if they are on a 
scholarship others wishing to continue in a program will have to 
arrange their own transfers he said

conservative leaders are muttering about 
running a candidate in 1992 if president bush doesnt toe their 
line 
it is too early to tell what any of us is going to do 
howard phillips chairman of the conservative caucus said at a 
news conference friday 
but if bush stays in his present course he will be challenged 
in 1992 almost certainly in the republican primaries and certainly 
in the general election phillips added 
the chief complaint is the presidents abandonment of his no 
new taxes pledge which the conservatives fear will hurt 
republican candidates 
bush has dealt a crippling blow to his own credibility said 
david a keene chairman of the american conservative union and a 
bush presidential campaign manager in 1980 
we believe that it was because of us that he got elected 
and we need reassurance said l brent bozell iii executive 
director of the conservative victory committee 
whenever theres a close presidential race and the republican 
nominee abandons his conservative voters they lose said richard 
a viguerie president of united conservatives of america 
viguerie cited as examples the races of 1948 when new york gov 
thomas a dewey lost to president truman 1960 when richard nixon 
lost to john kennedy and 1976 when president ford lost to jimmy 
carter 
viguerie bozell keene phillips and john cregan president of 
the us business and industrial council held their new conference 
to coincide with a meeting of the republican national committee in 
chicago rnc spokeswoman leslie goodman said she had not seen the 
conservative remarks and could not comment on them 
the five conservatives released a letter to party chairman lee 
atwater protesting that the administration had in effect told 
conservatives that it does not intend to honor the commitments 
made to the american people in the 1988 presidential campaign

america could have much to fear in the 
future as blood banks fail to ensure a safe aidsfree blood 
supply witnesses told a congressional subcommittee 
but stephen richards senior vice president of the american red 
cross told reporters the united states has the safest blood 
supply of any country in the world 
witnesses before the panel friday laid much of the blame on the 
blood industry charging that thousands of people became infected 
with the aids virus through blood transfusions because the industry 
reacted too slowly to the epidemic 
based on blood banks past performance the nation could have 
much to fear in the future said ross eckert a member of the 
food and drug administrations blood products advisory committee 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce investigations subcommittee said that according to fda 
inspection reports some american red cross blood centers have 
released infected blood mixed up records or violated aids testing 
procedures 
the american red cross which collects over half of all the 
whole blood in the united states has had serious and persistent 
problems with its procedures for testing and keeping track of this 
blood dingell said 
earlier this week an fda inspection report showed that the red 
cross had failed to comply with its own procedures by informing the 
fda of only four of 228 cases of possible aidsrelated transfusions 
richards dismissed criticism that the red cross has failed to 
educate the public about the spread of aids and has moved too 
slowly in instituting donor screening programs the risk of 
becoming infected with the aids virus through a transfusion is 
about 1 in 40000 he said 
we can assure the public it the blood supply is safer now 
than ever he said it is as safe as it can be with medical 
science and testing 
according to the federal centers for disease control 3425 
transfusionassociated aids cases had been reported to the agency 
as of may 1 
the red cross notes that only 11 of those cases have been 
diagnosed since blood banks began testing donated blood for aids in 
1985 
however it can take as long as 10 years for infection with the 
human immunodeficiency virus or hiv to become fullblown aids 
the blood industry was reluctant early in the epidemic to screen 
highrisk donors and implement safety testing because it feared 
these steps would threaten the financial viability of a blood 
bank said dr marcus conant a professor at the university of 
california medical center in san francisco 
while donors give blood voluntarily and free their blood is 
sold by blood banks to hospitals and patients 
conant and other witnesses told the house energy and commerce 
investigations subcommittee that blood banks knew in early 1983 
that aids was likely transmitted by blood 
dr edgar engleman medical director of the stanford university 
medical schools blood bank said his facility was criticized by 
other blood banks when in july 1983 it became the first in the 
nation to screen donated blood with a test designed to reduce 
transfusion transmission of aids 
critics argued that there was no proof that aids could be 
transmitted by blood transfusion and that the test we were using 
was experimental and too costly he said in his testimony

the house appropriations committee while 
approving 504 billion for agriculture spending in fiscal 1991 is 
angering house agriculture committee leaders by virtually 
eliminating crop insurance 
rep glenn english dokla whose agriculture subcommittee has 
been working on improvements to the crop insurance program said 
friday an amendment to restore funding would be offered during full 
house debate if the program is not reinstated sooner 
abolishing the program while major improvements are under 
consideration creates a situation whereby those improvements cannot 
be put into effect in an orderly manner agriculture committee 
chairman kika de la garza said in a letter to appropriations 
chairman jamie whitten 
the letter also was signed by english rep edward madigan 
rill and rep thomas coleman rmo 
madigan is ranking republican on the full agriculture committee 
and coleman the ranking gop member on englishs subcommittee 
meanwhile congressional leaders said the senate expects to 
start debate next week on the 1990 farm bill with budget

the house wants to freeze spending on office 
expenses of former presidents amid complaints they are millionaires 
who already receive generous pensions 
with this government tottering on the financial brink of 
disaster taxpayers in this country might wonder about the sanity 
of forcing them to give a half a million dollars each to four 
wealthy men who are already collecting 107000 each in pensions 
said rep andy jacobs dind 
the action came on amendments to a 207 billion appropriations 
bill for fiscal 1991 spending by the treasury department postal 
service the office of the president and independent agencies 
the bill provides new authority for the us secret service to 
join the fbi in investigating savingsandloan fraud 
it authorizes 300 new secret service agents a 50 percent 
increase for the agency to join the 600 fbi agents at work in the 
sampl scandals 
the secret service while known for protecting the president 
has long been responsible for investigating counterfeiting and 
securities credit card and computer fraud 
the bill approved on a 30072 vote goes to the senate 
jacobs a frequent critic of taxpayer spending on former 
presidents tried to amend the bill by slashing all office expenses 
for former presidents totaling nearly 16 million 
but the house voted 30091 to amend jacobs amendment so that it 
freezes the office expenditure at 1990 levels that represents a 
cut of 8 percent 156000 in the total spending on former 
presidents including their 107300 a year pensions 
richard nixon gerald ford jimmy carter and ronald reagan

eternity were shocked by its strong language and sexy scenes but 
even steamier was author james jones original manuscript a 
professor who found it says 
editors from scribners publishing house in new york forced jones 
to rewrite many lewd passages and tone down the language in the 
book about army life in 1941 
it was heavily edited scribners was afraid of what would 
happen if the language was not toned down university of illinois 
english professor george hendrick said thursday night rightly 
so given the times it was 1950 censors would have banned it 
hendrick who found the 1300page manuscript while gathering 
jones letters for a 1989 collection to reach eternity said 
the original work was superior to what was published 
i think it is a better book the language is grittier more 
reflective of army speech in prewar hawaii than the one scribners 
published the scenes were much better the way jones wrote them 
too he said in a telephone interview from his home in urbana 
ill 
jones who was stationed in hawaii while serving in the army in 
prewar hawaii complained about the editing demands but gave in 
because it was his first novel hendrick said 
im not blaming scribners they had to do what they did 
hendrick said 
even more sanitized than the novel was the blockbuster movie 
based on the book starring burt lancaster and frank sinatra 
there are major changes its a good story but not one jones 
wrote the scene on the beach usually appears in film histories 
said hendrick referring to the torrid scene between lancaster and 
deborah kerr in the hawaiian surf 
if the book were published in 1990 hendrick said no changes 
would be made in the manuscript 
absolutely it would be published today as it was he added 
it was a wonderful novel he said 
but he thinks jones wrote an even better novel 
the thin red line was even better it was not as popular 
but jones had learned a tremendous lot by having written his first 
novel said hendrick who met jones in 1962 when the author was 
touring europe 
after from here to eternity was published in 1951 jones 
who died in 1977 at age 55 gave the manuscript to lowney handy as 
a birthday gift 
mrs handy jones lover operated a writers colony in his 
southern illinois hometown of robinson hendrick said 
he fictionalized the affair with mrs handy in his second novel 
some came running but during a visit to new york for its 
publication he met gloria mosolino and they married 
jones wanted the manuscript back but mrs handy refused and 
after her death in 1964 relatives stored the document in a garage 
it ended up in a bank vault where hendrick found it 
widow gloria jones and daughter kaylie were on hand in april for 
ceremonies in connection with the university of illinois 
acquisition of the manuscript 
it was the first time they had seen the manuscript they were 
pleased to see it and have it in the hands of an institution 
said hendrick

congressional democrats are one signature 
short of the 12 needed to demand the appointment of a special 
prosecutor to examine the collapse of a savings and loan led by 
neil bush 
meanwhile former rep thomas l ashley said friday he has been 
regularly advising president bushs son on his savings and loan 
troubles as a longtime family friend but not at the presidents 
request 
neil bush told federal regulators last december that ashley a 
banking industry official who was a college classmate of the 
presidents apparently you know called my father and then so 
at dads request he called me 
ashley confirmed in a telephone interview he has talked to the 
president about neil bush but said he contacted the son on his own 
after reading of his troubles in the newspaper he said president 
bush was well aware of his activity 
rep edward f feighan dohio withdrew his name friday from a 
petition to trigger the independent counsel law in the neil bush 
case leaving democrats one short of the 12 signatures needed to 
trigger the independent counsel law 
the law requires the signature of at least 12 democrats a 
majority of the 21 on the committee to make the request for a 
special prosecutor 
andrea camp a spokeswoman for rep pat schroeder dcolo who 
is organizing the democratic effort said i dont think its a 
question of whether we get another signature but when its a live 
proposal 
feighan wrote in a letter to attorney general dick thornburgh 
although i had originally signed a draft of this request i 
notified the authors of the letter earlier today that my name and 
signature should be withdrawn from the document that would be 
delivered to you 
he did not indicate why he had changed his mind 
and democratic house speaker thomas s foley lashed back at a 
republican officials accusation that the democrats were to blame 
for a national sampl crisis expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of 
billions of dollars 
ed rollins chairman of the republican congressional campaign 
committee said the democrats had sold out for a few million 
dollars in campaign contributions but the normally mildmannered 
foley dwash angrily dismissed rollins as in a panic an 
out of control person making an unrestrained and totally raw 
partisan accusation 
tempers on all sides have risen as more attention has been given 
to neil bush who faces a public disciplinary hearing before 
federal regulators in september on his role as a director of the 
bankrupt silverado banking savings and loan 
he has been accused of conflict of interest but has said he has 
done nothing wrong his father the president has twice defended 
his honor and integrity during news conferences but has 
promised to stay out of the investigation 
neil bushs statement to federal regulators is contained in a 
deposition included in documents released by the office of thrift 
supervision it was first reported friday in the denver post 
asked by the regulators whether he had ever discussed operations 
of the sampl with his father the younger bush replied 
i didnt discuss details with him and if he inquired about 
silverado it would have been very rare i mean if at all and i 
dont know if i ever voluntarily disclosed to him when i was a 
member of the board anything about the goings on of silverado 
he added i never i can state this with great clarity that i 
never intentionally brought him into you know i mean i never 
asked him for assistance or advice on silverado matters 
in response to the regulators questions neil bush said no one 
had suggested to him what his testimony on any matter should be 
schroeder one of the petition signers among the democrats on the 
judiciary committee said their request for a special prosecutor 
was made because the people have a right to feel were doing 
everything to get impartial justice done 
she said there is a public sense that in the sampl mess and now 
the aftermath its who you know not what you know or what 
youve done 
justice department spokesman dan eramian said the letter is 
under consideration as provided for under the independent counsel 
statutes 
thornburgh has 15 days to decide whether to open a preliminary 
inquiry to determine if a special prosecutor should be appointed 
then another 15 days to tell congress how he acted on its request 
he has 90 days from start of the preliminary inquiry to determine 
whether to appoint an independent counsel 
ashley a former democratic congressman from ohio said friday 
ive talked to the president about his sons situation on a 
couple of social occasions when were alone i talk about the 
kids neils one of the kids 
ashley said that his own experience in politics and in bank 
regulation made him a good source of advice for neil bush the 
situation is such that he cant go to his father and talk to him 
ashley said 
ashley who was a college classmate of george bushs at yale 
denied president bush had asked him to intervene he said if 
neil thinks his father called me hes mistaken 
ashley 67 is president of the association of bank holding 
companies a banking lobbying organization based in washington the 
organization generally does not get involved in savings and loan 
issues ashley said 
he said he contacted neil bush on his own last winter after 
reading about his troubles in newspapers 
since then ive seen neil a half dozen times we talk about 
it ashley said 
he said he is not trying to serve as a gobetween for neil bush 
and the president nor trying to influence any decisions im too 
smart for that ashley said 
ashley and bush have remained close friends since they were both 
members of the secret society skull and bones while they were 
undergraduates at yale university in the late 1940s 
is everyone who is close to the president supposed to stay 
away from neil ashley asked president bush doesnt go along 
with that he rejects that the former lawmaker added 
ashley said that neil bush has made up his own mind in the 
matter including his decision to fight the case and refusal to 
negotiate an outofcourt settlement 
im a good sounding board he said its not a partisan 
matter or he wouldnt be coming to a democrat

a black woman who wants her two children placed 
with a white suburban couple is opposed by social workers who 
believe they belong in the same socioeconomic environment as their 
mother the inner city 
a final decision was postponed friday when attorneys told a 
childrens court judge they might be able to reach an outofcourt 
agreement on placement of the 5monthold girl and her 14monthold 
sister 
the childrens mother wants them to stay with a white foster 
family the milwaukee county department of health and social 
services says a black family environment would be better 
the older girl is already with a black foster mother after 
living temporarily with a white family in nearby oak creek both 
children were taken from their mother in february because she was 
declared financially unable to maintain a proper home said 
jeff aikin a department spokesman 
the 30yearold mother has not been named in court papers to 
protect her childrens identities 
she petitioned the court to have her children placed with david 
and beverly cox at their delafield home in suburban waukesha 
county the coxes said they were eager to care for the children 
until their mother is ready to be reunited with them 
i am looking forward to the day i can take the children to her 
and say take over weve done a good job mrs cox said but 
judge ronald goldberger ruled last month the coxes have no legal 
standing in the case 
aikin said the black foster family chosen by the department 
meets several conditions that are important theyre of the same 
race the same socioeconomic status and they live nearby the 
mother 
roselyn clipps vice president of the wisconsin association of 
black social workers said black children raised with white 
families lack role models who truly understand what 
afroamericans have been going through historically and are still 
going through 
michael vruno the childrens courtappointed lawyer originally 
favored moving the younger child to the black home chosen by social 
workers 
but he told goldberger after a 3hour attorneys conference 
friday that new information led him to alter his position 
somewhat he would not elaborate 
victoria schroeder the coxes attorney said there may be a 
settlement 
goldberger adjourned the hearing until aug 16 saying the 
younger child can stay with the coxes at least until then 
the girls 12yearold brother lives with an aunt a 3yearold 
brother lives with another aunt 
aikin said that of about 1680 foster homes licensed by the 
department 60 percent are black and 35 percent are white almost a 
reversal of the ratio of three years ago

a convicted rapist has been indicted on 
murder charges in the slayings of six young women and teenagers 
whose bodies were found in shallow desert graves 
david leonard wood 33 of el paso was charged friday after new 
evidence was presented to a grand jury said district attorney 
steve simmons 
wood who is serving a 50year sentence for a 1987 rape has 
filed a lawsuit saying investigators are using him as a scapegoat 
to counter criticism they did not move quickly enough in the case 
the decayed remains of the victims ranging in age from 14 to 
23 were found in shallow graves within a halfmile of each other 
in the desert about 18 miles northeast of el paso between sept 4 
1987 and march 14 1988 
some were runaways or prostitutes police were criticized for 
not responding more quickly to reports of their disappearances 
im sure if we felt earlier on that we were involved with a 
serial killing police would have handled it differently simmons 
said 
simmons would not detail the new evidence leading to woods 
indictment 
wood had been mentioned before as a suspect he denied killing 
anyone and last year filed the 205 million lawsuit against police 
chief john scagno claiming police schemed to implicate him because 
they could not solve the case 
the lawsuit is pending 
the indictment said one of the victims was stabbed several 
times but the medical examiner was unable to determine how most 
were killed because their bodies were decomposed

a fire that continued to smolder early today 
turned a subway tunnel under construction into a 1500degree oven 
and collapsed a stretch near a downtown freeway 
six workers in the tunnel smelled smoke and escaped unharmed 
friday 
the metro rail subway project aimed at bringing underground mass 
transit to some of the nations most congested streets was already 
plagued by delays and cost overruns before the fire brought it 
further behind schedule 
up to three miles of the heavily traveled hollywood freeway 
looked like a parking lot friday morning when hundreds of 
thousands of commuters were mired on their way to work others 
alerted to the problem simply stayed home 
the fire collapsed a 100foot stretch of tunnel within 10 feet 
of where it passes under the freeway about three miles of the 
highway was closed because of the fire and was to remain that way 
into next week 
the section of tunnel under the freeway was a charred core of 
twisted steel and burned timber officials said 
the fire roared through the 750foot tunnel fueled by lumber 
and plastic sheeting that covered excavated earth city fire 
spokesman gary svider said 
firefighters could not venture into the tunnel to battle the 
flames for more than 12 hours 
any time youre in a tunnel youre basically in an oven 
said robert ramirez an assistant fire chief 
with temperatures reaching 1500 degrees in some spots 
firefighters in breathing gear were sent in 
if hell was like this i think i would go to church more 
often said firefighter john gonzalez 
dozens of firefighters were treated for heat exhaustion the 
stubborn blaze smoldered early today sending up a huge plume of 
white smoke 
the hollywood freeway is a stretch of us highway 101 which 
links northern and southern california and the downtown area with 
the a host of suburbs 
no commuters were hurt 
the cause of the fire was under investigation 
the metro rail already was 18 months behind schedule the 13 
billion 4mile subway project was scheduled to open in 1993 
the fire was not expected to affect todays inaugural run of the 
22mile blue line light rail trolleys that runs on surface lines 
between los angeles and long beach

prosecutors fighting delays in the trial of 
a winery worker accused of killing his wife two daughters and four 
other people dont object to the latest weeklong postponement 
superior court judge phrasel shelton on friday granted the delay 
in the trial of ramon salcido until july 23 after his attorney 
marteen miller made a lastminute plea for time telling the judge 
his wife was ill with malaria 
the district attorneys office didnt protest the move during a 
court session in redwood city where the trial was to begin monday 
with jury selection 
the request was based on the illness of mr millers wife and 
she was hospitalized so we didnt object said deputy district 
attorney mike mullins were ready to go however 
on thursday a state appeals court refused without explanation 
to grant miller a twomonth trial delay until september 
miller has said he needs time to convince mexican authorities to 
hand over extradition papers that could prevent prosecutors from 
seeking the death penalty but prosecutors have argued that miller 
is simply trying to delay the case and theres no truth to the 
argument that a usmexico treaty bars the death penalty in the 
case 
the trial was moved from sonoma county the area north of san 
francisco where the slayings occurred to san mateo south of the 
city because of pretrial publicity 
salcido 29 is accused of killing his wife two daughters his 
motherinlaw her two daughters and a coworker 15 months ago 
a third daughter who was two years old had her throat slit but 
survived and has since been living with a foster family 
miller said he doesnt plan to dispute the facts in the case 
salcido gave a full confession to police shortly after he was 
arrested in mexico where he fled but miller said he plans to 
fight the death penalty by arguing that salcido was drunk and high 
on cocaine at the time of the slayings and that he had some sort of 
mental disturbance 
superior court judge reginald littrell who will preside over 
the trial said he expects jury selection to take about six weeks 
followed by at least one month for the rest of the trial

in an era of hubble trouble and sputtering 
shuttles astronomers get by with a little help from their friends 
amateur stargazers who sometimes find bright lights the 
professionals miss 
while most major discoveries in the universe are made by 
astronomers using jumbo telescopes hobbyists sometimes come 
through 
the big telescopes are expensive and overbooked by the 
professionals says russell genet an air force engineer and 
astronomy enthusiast who lives in mesa ariz 
with your own home telescope the equipment is yours the 
amateurs almost have an advantage over the professionals he said 
genet was one of about 700 members of the astronomical society 
of the pacific the nations largest popular astronomy group who 
gathered friday for the beginning of a sixday conference at boston 
university 
the conventioneers professional and amateur alike came 
equipped with calculators and slide rules ready for speeches with 
titles like the birth of binary stars and astrophotography 
made easy 
andrew fraknoi executive director of the san franciscobased 
group says it has been a mix of scientists and enthusiasts right 
from the start 
in 1889 thousands flocked to the west coast where a solar 
eclipse was visible there were only three astronomers in 
california at the time so they enlisted the aid of amateur 
starwatchers to help track the event and explain it to the 
spellbound crowds the astronomical society was formed from that 
coalition 
those may now seem like the good old days in the 1990s 
astronomers must fight for money telescope time and with nasas 
recent embarrassing setbacks respectability 
the hubble spacebased telescope has not produced clear images 
because of flaws in one of its massive mirrors nasas entire space 
shuttle fleet is grounded because of persistent leaks from hydrogen 
fuel tanks 
frank drake an astronomer at the university of california 
santa cruz who led the first radio search for extraterrestrial life 
in the 1960s recently had his proposal for a continued search 
ridiculed in congress 
the house axed the programs proposed 12 million budget the 
senate had not yet taken up the measure 
we are being affected by the backlash of nasas troubles 
says drake movie makers spend millions on close encounters of 
the third kind but we cant get 12 million to do the real 
thing 
as in 1889 home stargazers are helping as access to 
observatories becomes more tightly allocated amateur astronomers 
increasingly lend a hand occasionally catching things the pros 
miss 
genet has discovered 12 variable stars suns that emit varying 
amounts of light he says that while stargazing alone is 
satisfying theres nothing like the thrill of actually finding a 
bright new light in the cosmos 
you always have this itch to make some addition to mans 
knowledge a desire to contribute to that edifice genet says 
you get hooked on this great tradition of science and you want 
to add your little piece 
robert fried was a pilot for delta airlines before he retired 
four years ago to pursue his interest in stargazing fulltime 
ive known people with phds in astronomy who didnt know 
which end of a telescope to look in he says and ive seen 
some amateurs who were pretty sharp 
fried 59 built a 16inch miniobservatory at his home in 
flagstaff ariz though he admits hes no galileo fried says hes 
as handy with a telescope as the next academic 
he said his telescope made the only recording of a visual light 
curve or variation in light emissions from v404 cygnus an xray 
binary star 
doing that i started to feel like i was giving something back 
to this world instead of just taking fried says

prime minister vp singh offered to 
resign today saying he has lost the trust of the people and the 
parties in his 7monthold governing coalition 
bowing to the general sentiment i wish to step down from the 
prime ministership singh said in a letter to the president of 
his janata dal party 
singh has been beset by party infighting brought to a head by 
the resignations of three cabinet ministers on friday 
critics charge that singhs efforts to hold his party together 
have diluted his efforts to tackle problems such as rising food and 
gasoline prices and separatist revolts by sikhs in punjab and 
moslems in kashmir 
his national front coalition formed a government in december 
after prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party lost power in 
novembers general elections 
in his letter the prime minister asked the president of his 
party to call a meeting of the partys member lawmakers to choose a 
new parliamentary leader the leader in turn would seek to form a 
government and become prime minister 
but singh himself could be reelected the partys parliamentary 
leader a move that would enable him to continue as prime minister 
singhs tactic of sending his letter to the party president was 
designed to keep power in his partys hands if he had made his 
resignation offer to the countrys president the opposition 
congress party could have been asked to form a government 
singhs party rules as a minority government but it is 
supported by leftist and rightwing groups the congress party 
holds the largest number of seats in parliament but does not have 
enough for a majority 
the resignation offer came after singhs deputy prime minister 
devi lal ignored the wishes of many in the party and installed his 
son as chief minister of haryana state on thursday three of 
singhs national cabinet ministers resigned in protest friday night 
the rationale of my being in the office of the prime minister 
was the trust of the people of the members of the national front 
and of the supporting parties singh wrote the developments of 
the last two days have shown that i have lost this trust 
the text of the letter was released by government officials 
gandhis congress party now the chief opposition has been 
predicting that dissent within the coalition could lead to singhs 
downfall 
the congress party holds the largest number of seats in 
parliament but does not have enough for a majority

trust in the united states that hmong 
people developed as they fought alongside americans during the 
vietnam war is strained by a dispute over corrective surgery for a 
boy born with clubfeet a hmong leader says 
social workers want to force surgery on 6yearold kou xiong to 
repair the condition and another birth defect a dislocated hip 
the boys parents believe spirits inflicted the deformities on him 
to punish the family for an ancestors wrongs 
operating on the boy against his parents wishes would amount to 
religious persecution hmong leaders say 
acting on the advice of a shaman or religious leader the boys 
parents say trying to correct the defects could bring more divine 
retribution against the family possibly including kous death 
neither defect is lifethreatening and the boy born with the 
deformities in a thai refugee camp can walk and play with other 
children he also opposes the surgery believing he is serving the 
family by living with his condition 
but county social workers won a us supreme court ruling last 
month to force surgery on the advice of doctors who say the boy 
likely will become crippled otherwise 
kous parents have won a stalemate however because no hospital 
will undertake the operation without their consent now the boys 
fathers lawyer is trying to have the case dismissed 
this xiong case has become a concern of the hmong people 
across the country because that is something that involves the 
culture and religion of the hmong people said dang vang 
president of the hmong human rights committee in fresno 
hmongs are an ethnic minority within laos living mainly in the 
mountainous north they fought with americans during the vietnam 
war and tens of thousands fled communist persecution afterward 
most maintain animist beliefs that include faith in a pantheon 
of spirits thought to control human events 
like many hmong refugees invited to relocate in the united 
states since the mid1970s kous father ger xiong now 40 spent 
his youth working as a medic or fighting during the vietnam war 
about 75000 hmong came to the united states an estimated 
50000 live in california other large hmong communities formed in 
wisconsin and minnesota 
the united states had been involved with the hmong people 
during the war and the hmong had some kind of relationship with 
the american people vang said so that motivated the hmong 
people into a trust the hmong people feel like the united states 
is a country of freedom peace and justice 
now he said we just feel like we are here in somebodys 
country and they can do whatever they want to do and we have no 
rights 
this case in fresno is a telling case because it has brought 
to the fore a lot of tensions between the host and the newcomer 
said eric crystal director of southeast asian studies at 
university of california berkeley 
their main agenda is not rapidly assimilating into the 
american culture they are people who have struggled through 
thousands of years of history to maintain this identity crystal 
said 
the xiongs consider the battle as much of a threat to their 
personal safety as the war that forced them to flee laos 
this is no kind of fight for them after what they have been 
through said monte james a law clerk for the firm representing 
ger xiong

a team of us experts will travel to cambodia 
july 24 to examine the remains of what may be us servicemen 
unaccounted for from the vietnam war says sen charles robb dva 
robb a vietnam veteran visited cambodia earlier this year to 
appeal for cooperation in obtaining an accounting of the 83 
americans missing and believed dead in that country 
the visit is the first of its kind since the communist triumph 
in cambodia in 1975 
meanwhile a bipartisan group of leading senators fearing a 
return of the khmer rouge to power has drafted a letter urging 
president bush to change the administrations policy toward 
cambodia 
the presidents policy in cambodia is indefensible senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine a leader of the 
petitioners told reporters this week 
how can we the united states which has already enacted into 
law a prohibition on aiding the khmer rouge engage in a policy 
which does precisely that said mitchell 
a draft of the letter urges bush to open the door to some 
contacts between the united states and the government of hun sen in 
phnom penh 
the united states supports a coalition of groups that are 
fighting the cambodian government and the khmer rouge who 
slaughtered more than a million cambodians when they ruled the 
country in the 1970s 
the united states has received cooperation from vietnam and laos 
on the mia issue all told the 2302 missing americans are 
believed to be in those two countries and cambodia 
state department spokesman richard boucher said he did not know 
how many sets of remains the american experts will be invited to 
examine in cambodia 
he said the mission was strictly humanitarian in nature but a 
senior state department official asking not to be identified said 
the gesture by the cambodian government apparently was aimed at 
achieving increased international recognition 
there has been no american presence in cambodia since the 
usbacked government was ousted by the khmer rouge rebels in 
april 1975 the khmer rouge was ousted by vietnamese forces in 1978 
after 3 bloody years in power 
boucher said that if any of the remains appear likely to be 
those of americans a us air force plane will repatriate them to 
hawaii for further analysis 
we appreciate the support of the phnom penh authorities for 
this undertaking which we consider an important humanitarian 
endeavor and if successful will help alleviate the continued 
uncertainty of the families of the missing americans boucher 
said 
robb who had met with hun sen and other officials in phnom 
penh made the announcement in a speech friday to the national 
league of american prisoners and missing in southeast asia which 
is holding its 21st annual meeting in washington 
this is obviously only the beginning of a process which we 
hope will allow for the accounting of every missing american 
robb said

the marketers of japanese products have found a new 
selling point environmental consciousness 
the takashimaya department store in tokyo recently designated a 
slew of gift items labeled as generous to the earth like 
stationery made from recycled paper 
the actual environmental benefits of some supposedly 
earthfriendly products jams and jellies for example might be 
a bit of a mystery 
but the retailers say their main aim is to raise public 
awareness of about ecological issues 
what we stores can do is to provide consumers opportunities to 
think about the environment said kiyoshi hasegawa a spokesman 
the mitsukoshi department store chain which has a sales campaign 
centered on the beautiful earth 
nomura securities co japans biggest stockbroker recently 
introduced its earth environment fund with stock in companies 
related to environmental products 
products such as hairsprays that do not use chloroflurocarbon 
propellants and biodegradable cleansing products are making their 
way onto the market 
nonremovable tabs on beverage cans replacing the throwaway 
pull tab were introduced only this year that antilitter move has 
been effect for years in the united states 
a recent fashion fad has been clothing with floral and plant 
patterns and some traditional staples of the japanese diet such 
as buckwheat noodles are being marketed as health foods to tie in 
to the ecomarketing trend 
the japan environment association a government group judges 
certain products as pollutionfree and awards an ecomark 
designation to be used in marketing them 
consumers should realize they can somehow live without harming 
the environment says kyoko kato a spokeswoman for the 
association 
but there are no scientific standards for the awarding of the 
ecomark which has been granted to 513 products companies pay a 
fee ranging from 250 to 660 when they submit products for 
approval 
ms kato says she suggested setting up other categories of the 
ecomark for products with some specific environmental benefit 
such as recyclable cans and bottles but there have been no takers 
yoko tomiyama acting director of the japan consumer union said 
she thought it might be more useful to identify products that are 
bad for the environment 
but many people just dont care she said 
many japanese companies are feeling pressured to show concern 
for the environment even if its as much a matter of style as 
substance 
the suntory brewery recently opened a trendy tokyo eatery called 
the earth with a pink hemispheric dome people wait hours to 
get in 
the restaurant is a tiein to a new suntory beer by the same 
name with a tab that sticks to the can rather than coming off to 
be tossed away suntory says it retooled its manufacturing line to 
make the cans with stayon tabs 
its no longer socially acceptable if we care about nothing 
but productivity and sales said suntory spokesman kenji yokomizo

an inventor won a nearly 52 million judgment 
against ford motor co in a 12year battle to protect his patents 
for intermittent windshield wipers 
robert kearns 63 of gaithersburg md sought 141 million 
claiming unauthorized use of his electronic work developing the 
wipers that slow to make periodic passes across windshields 
the judgment friday was welcomed by ford but relatives of 
kearns said he likely would appeal 
were pleased with the verdict returned by this jury ford 
spokesman mark miller said it also saw that dr kearnss 
contribution to intermittent wiper technology was modest 
especially when you compare it with the contributions made by 
fords own engineers and suppliers 
kearns rejected a 30 million settlement offered by ford in 
february said his son dennis kearns 
the inventor is suing 19 other automotive companies including 
general motors corp chrysler corp daimlerbenz honda toyota 
and nissan 
a federal jury ruled jan 29 nearly 12 years after kearns 
filed suit that ford infringed on his patents the same jury 
found may 8 that fords infringement was not deliberate but it 
failed to agree on how much to award kearns 
a new jury heard testimony in the damages portion of the trial 
and on friday awarded 63 million but us district judge avern 
cohn ruled kearns could be compensated only for 5163842 
reflecting damages incurred after april 1978 when he first filed 
suit 
kearns spent an estimated 15 million on his fight relatives 
said his son said the verdict likely will discourage other small 
inventors from waging costly legal battles against large companies

in this ancient center of chinese judaism 
a jewishchinese girl from new york city marked her passage into 
adulthood today with a traditional bat mitzvah ceremony 
it is so unique for my heritages to be united in one place 
said yiling chenjosephson 13 the daughter of a jewish father and 
a chinese mother 
cantor david lefkowitz incorporated a chinese folk song into the 
ceremony held in a hotel because kaifengs synogogue was destroyed 
in the 19th century 
kaifeng about 390 miles south of beijing in henan province was 
once home to chinas largest jewish community 
about 40 friends and relatives attended the ceremony including 
the us ambassador to china james lilley and john kluge 
chairman of metromedia co who is listed by forbes magazine as the 
richest man in america 
yilings father marvin josephson is chairman of josephson 
international parent company of international creative management 
one of the worlds largest literary and talent agencies 
he said he thought of holding his daughters bat mitzvah in 
kaifeng after reading about a boy whose parents took him to krakow 
poland for his bar mitzvah in memory of his grandparents who died 
in the holocaust 
jewish boys traditionally have bar mitzvahs at age 13 to mark 
reaching adulthood in modern times girls also have gone through 
the ceremony called bat mitzvah 
todays service originally was planned for last summer but was 
postponed after the armys bloody attack on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in beijing instead yiling had a bat mitzvah in new 
york last november 
but the family did not give up the idea of holding the ceremony 
in china which yilings maternal grandparents left more than four 
decades ago the grandparents returned for the first time for the 
ceremony 
yiling said last week that coming to china helped me to 
realize how special this is to have a combination of two sides 
of a family like this 
before i just took it for granted that this is what i am 
she said now its beginning to take some meaning 
kaifeng was chinas capital from the 10th to the 13th centuries 
at about the time jewish traders began arriving by sea and across 
central asia via the silk road 
in the early 18th century several thousand jews attended the 
kaifeng synagogue each week but by the mid19th century chinas 
jews had become largely assimilated speaking only chinese and 
adopting chinese names and customs 
a 1980 study found only 79 jewish families totaling 166 members 
still living in kaifeng although other accounts say the figure is 
double that 
through intermarriage they are virtually indistinguishable from 
other chinese and most have no knowledge of judaism or only dimly 
remember older generations practicing some jewish customs

the head of the secret police is 
predicting the government will soon nab pablo escobar the reputed 
leader of the medellin drug cartel 
the official gen miguel maza marquez said in an interview 
published friday in the bogota newspaper el tiempo that the battle 
against the drug cartel is being won 
the medellin cartels breathing room has been reduced and we 
now see some slipping at the very top specifically with respect to 
the ochoa family maza said 
the brothers jorge luis fabio and juan david ochoa have been 
considered escobars closest allies in running the cocaine empire 
maza said the brothers have abandoned escobar 
the government has raised from 400000 to 600000 the reward 
for information leading to the capture of the enormously wealthy 
escobar 
about 2000 soldiers and policemen are hunting for escobar in 
the northeastern region known as magdalena medio using helicopters 
and land patrols 
earlier in the week police said they had escobar surrounded 
but he escaped into the jungle it was the third time in a year 
escobar had evaded a police dragnet 
since the operation began six days ago soldiers and troops have 
seized some 8500 pounds of dynamite assualt rifles sophisticated 
radio equipment and documents belonging to the medellin cartel and 
about 21 cartel employees were arrested maza said 
meanwhile police in medellin on friday discovered a truck in a 
public parking lot loaded with about 450 pounds of dynamite 
security forces deactivated the explosives 
the police said the truck had been parked there for about two 
weeks 
so far this year five powerful car bombs have exploded in 
medellin killing at least 60 people officials blamed the drug 
traffickers who have been locked in an 11monthold war against 
the government 
in washington meanwhile colombias presidentelect cesar 
gaviria said the united states must curb its appetite for drugs 
before his nation can significantly stem illegal cocaine production 
gaviria told reporters friday after meeting with president bush 
that the demand for drugs is the engine of the trafficking 
problem if the united states and the industrial countries dont 
get a way to reduce consumption we will not solve the problem 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the two presidents 
had discussed the administrations pending proposal for 805 
million in drugfighting assistance to colombia

the target of an fbi investigation into a pair 
of fatal mail bombings will be jailed in secrecy until his trial on 
unrelated witness tampering charges authorities said 
judge wilbur d owens jr on friday ordered walter leroy moody 
jr 56 held without bail until his trial he also ruled that 
moodys wife susan mcbride moody 28 could be released on a 
250000 property bond 
a tentative sept 17 trial date was scheduled for moody 
us marshal bill breese said security precautions prevented him 
from saying where moody would be housed until the trial 
the moodys were arrested tuesday and charged in a 13count 
federal indictment with conspiracy obstruction of justice 
subornation of perjury bribery of a witness and tampering with a 
witness 
the charges arose from moodys alleged attempts to erase a 1972 
conviction for explosives possession after a pipe bomb injured a 
previous wife 
moody spent nearly three years in prison but always contended 
that an acquaintance made the bomb and left it in his house without 
his knowledge 
more than a decade later a woman testified that she was with the 
acquaintance the day he allegedly left the package at moodys home 
she later recanted the story prosecutors say moody bribed and 
intimidated her into giving the false testimony 
the materials used in the 1972 pipe bomb reportedly were similar 
to those found in four december mail bombs one of which killed a 
federal judge while another killed a lawyer 
at one point friday owens closed the hearing after a prosecutor 
mentioned the mail bombings he pointed out that neither defendant 
has been indicted in those bombings 
the moodys home had been searched earlier by federal agents 
investigating the mail bombings it was searched again on tuesday 
moody has denied any connection with the bombings 
letters claiming responsibility for the mail bombs said they 
were sent by a racist hate group

the slashing of a cellblock muslim leader 
sparked a melee at rikers island that injured 39 guards and 56 
inmates as prisoners sought revenge for the knifing attack 
authorities said 
fighting broke out friday afternoon when a group of inmates at 
the maximumsecurity lockup stormed the cell of the inmate accused 
of slashing their religious leader said correction department 
spokeswoman ruby ryles 
sixty inmates took part in the brawl nine were taken to area 
hospitals and 47 were seen treated at a jail clinic for minor 
injuries ryles said 
seventeen weapons were recovered in the cellblock hallway after 
the fight she said 
the fight stemmed from the thursday night slashing of andrew 
jackson 26 by rolando gonzalez 24 ryles said jackson is the 
imam or spiritual leader of the prisons muslim population 
fortyeight muslim prisoners were returning from religious 
services around 3 pm when they passed gonzalezs cellblock 
they tried to crash the block and get their revenge on 
gonzalez she said a dozen inmates in the hallway clashed with 
the muslim prisoners and 50 correction officers were called in to 
subdue the brawlers 
most of the 39 injured officers were taken to local hospitals 
for treatment the severity of injuries was not immediately 
available she said 
correction officers were searching inmates and their cells for 
additional weapons it was unclear what prompted the thursday night 
fight between jackson and gonzalez ryles said 
the brawl erupted in one of nine maximumsecurity city jails on 
the island in the east river 
ryles said gonzales is serving a 15yearstolife sentence in 
state prison for murder and jackson is serving 25 years to life 
also for murder 
both men were being held at rikers so they can testify at 
ongoing court proceedings against them she said

the trolley which gasped its last in this 
smoggy city three decades ago is reincarnated today as part of a 
10 billion effort to wean angelenos from the automobile 
the 22mile metro blue line is an overheadpowered trolley 
system running between downtown and long beach financed by a 
halfcent county sales tax approved by voters in 1980 
actually it is a reinvention of the old pacific electric red 
car line that began covering the very same route 90 years ago 
those trains nostalgically recalled in the movie who framed 
roger rabbit were derailed in 1961 by a city that had become 
hopelessly hooked on cars 
the movies plot in which the red car line is destroyed 
mimicked real life in which automakers managed to sideline the 
trolley in favor of buses and other gasguzzlers 
although sleeker and faster than its predecessor the blue line 
could be sidetracked itself by a 1990s problem many neighborhoods 
along the 22stop route are now among the most ganginfested in the 
city prompting some critics to dub it a streetcar named 
disaster 
the 877 million line is the first part of a 10 billion 
150mile rail grid planned into the next century for los angeles 
which is ribboned by freeways so jammed that the simplest commute 
can take an hour or more as a result the area generates some of 
the worst air pollution in the country 
included in the proposed grid is the 13 billion metro rail 
subway which suffered a setback friday when fire ravaged a 
maintenance tunnel under construction the first 4mile segment was 
scheduled to open in 1993 
in order to spur public interest the blue line will offer free 
introductory rides over the weekend with thousands expected to 
attend what one official called a 20milelong block party 
others are in a less festive mood including merchants who claim 
security fences along the rail line are blocking their customers 
while bus riders are likely to prefer the train getting 
angelenos out of their beloved automobiles is the real challenge 
the key to success is how well we do in attracting the rider 
who has alternatives who has some other way to get around other 
than public transit said edward mcspedon of the los angeles 
county transportation commission 
as far as organized gang activity there hasnt been any 
said county sheriffs capt frank vadurro maybe they dont even 
know about it 
vadurro is in charge of the 118deputy force contracted to guard 
the blue line deputies will ride trains in uniform and undercover 
but not every train will include a deputy 
an estimated 15000 gang members live within a 2milewide strip 
along the rail line 22 percent of all gangsters in the county 
vadurro said since november 300 arrests have already been made by 
the transit force for crimes such as narcotics vandalism and theft 
we have made an overinvestment in security mcspedon said 
we want to make sure that security is not even a factor in the 
riders mind 
a computerized control room dubbed the uss enterprise includes 
an arc of color screens showing the progress of each train and a 
bank of 64 television monitors keep an eye on the 22 stations 
operators of the 1 million japanesebuilt electric trains are 
in constant radio contact with the control room but cars can be 
stopped or slowed by remote control 
a projected 5000 to 7000 riders a day are expected to board 
the airconditioned rubberwheeled coaches that will glide over 
nearly seamless rails at speeds of up to 55 mph for a oneway fare 
of 110 
ted kalivas 66 of long beach said he rode the red car line as 
a teenager but said he would stay off the blue line 
its good transportation but it goes through a bad area 
kalivas said in a coffee shop near the anaheim street station i 
would say it will be very dangerous the cops had better be right 
there

the soviet prime minister kgb chief and defense 
minister were dropped today from a completely revamped communist 
party politburo whose only holdovers are mikhail s gorbachev and 
his deputy 
the move announced after the 28th party congress that closed 
friday night advanced the goal of president and party chief 
gorbachev of further separating the party from the government 
apparatus 
vaulting into the politburo the partys leading body that was 
doubled in size to 24 members were the party leaders from the 15 
soviet republics as well as several moderate reformers and 
officials little known outside their areas of specialty 
the new politburo elected by the partys new central committee 
represented a sharp break with past practice in which the politburo 
was the locus of all power in the soviet union and its members also 
held the senior positions in the government 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov kgb chairman vladimir a 
kryuchkov and defense minister dmitri t yazov as well as 
gorbachev adviser alexander n yakovlev foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and traditionalist yegor k ligachev all were dropped 
from the politburo 
all but ligachev remain central committee members however 
the new composition of the politburo underscores that the 
party fully breaks with the former practice when it was organically 
built into the command and administrative system and was on the 
top of the hierarchy said ivan frolov the editor of the party 
newspaper pravda and a new politburo member 
frolov announced that in addition to the heads of party 
organizations in the soviet republics himself gorbachev and 
deputy party leader vladimir a ivashko the new politburo will 
include 
yuri prokofiev the moscow communist party chief prokofiev is 
known as a moderate reformer 
gennady yanayev who became head of the central council of 
trade unions last year after labor unrest began spreading through 
the country he will be responsible for international affairs 
galina semyonova editorinchief of peasant woman 
magazine she will be responsible for womens issues 
gorbachev who has engineered a shift of power to the presidency 
at the cost of his party chief position acknowledged that the 
partys days of monolithic power were over 
were on the threshold of a multiparty system i dont see 
anything frightening in that he told cbs news on friday 
gorbachev was critical of prominent liberals who quit the party 
including maverick boris yeltsin the president of the vast 
russian republic and the mayors of moscow and leningrad the 
nations biggest cities 
but he admitted that such defections point to a gap between 
the people and the party 
the congress was the stormiest kremlin gathering since 1921 
when bolshevik revolutionaries faced violent uprisings by workers 
and sailors 
at the congress gorbachev was victorious in removing such 
hardline critics as ligachev from the policysetting central 
committee as well as from the politburo 
in yet another victory for the soviet leader delegates elected 
a 412member central committee that appeared to be packed with 
moderate reformers of the gorbachev mold 
under his guidance the party last winter also relinquished its 
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power 
despite his successes gorbachev displayed some chagrin at the 
defections of leading reformers yeltsin elected in may as 
president of russia told the congress thursday he was quitting the 
party 
as president of the russian republic which has threequarters 
of the soviet unions territory and 52 percent of its people he 
must listen to all political parties and cannot obey only the 
communist party he said 
the mayors of moscow and leningrad gavriil popov and anatoly 
sobchak on friday joined yeltsin in quitting the party they 
issued a statement saying the congress itself showed the complete 
inability of the party to offer the country a real program of 
transition to a new society 
members of the reformist democratic platform bloc said they 
would hold a founding congress for a new noncommunist party in 
october they predicted many in the party would follow them 
gorbachev told cbs he had contempt for those who left the 
party and told the congress those quitting had dealt a blow to 
the entire cause of revolutionary renewal 
but he also told delegates the party was determined to bridge 
the stillexisting gap between the party and the people 
thousands of people have quit the party in recent months and 
the departure of the reform leaders and the rising anger of coal 
miners and other workers appeared likely to accelerate that process 
the nearly 4700 delegates to the 28th party congress ended the 
session by giving themselves a standing ovation and singing the 
internationale the socialist anthem

a black worker was killed 
today in the bombing of a hotel frequented mostly by whites police 
said 
police said there also was an explosion this morning at the 
suburban johannesburg home of a reported rightwing white activist 
no one was injured police said 
police spokesman lt peter du preez said commercial explosives 
were used in the blast at the will smith hotel in florida a suburb 
of johannesburg 
no one claimed responsibility and there was no immediate 
evidence the attack was politically motivated police and the hotel 
owners said 
rightwing whites have claimed responsibility for a recent spate 
of bombings aimed at blacks and at whites who oppose apartheid but 
the latest attack did not appear to fit the pattern 
florida is a middleclass and workingclass area and most of the 
whites tend to be relatively conservative 
the blast caused relatively minor damage according to police 
and hotel owners the slain man was a waiter in the hotel bar 
there were about 130 patrons at the bar at the time of the 
blast all of them white said rod rodrigues one of the owners 
the other explosion was at the home of hans binneman whom the 
independent south african press association described as a member 
of the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement it quoted police as 
saying he recently was detained for questioning about bombings in 
johannesburg 
police say they suspect rightwing whites in the recent attacks 
and nine have been detained for questioning but no one has been 
charged 
rightwing whites have vowed to resist president fw de klerks 
plans to dismantle apartheid and share power with the 30 million 
black majority 
the african national congress the leading black opposition 
group supports a guerrilla campaign against the government but 
major attacks have ceased in recent months

the city transit authority is making a new push 
to get rid of derelicts drifters and displaced who use the 
countrys biggest subway system as a place to sleep 
beginning sunday police will force all passengers to get off 
the a train when it arrives at the northern end of its 30mile 
route which includes the entire length of manhattan 
anyone who balks will be physically removed officials said 
the atrain trip takes about 1 hours making it especially 
attractive to people who use the subways which run 24 hours a day 
as a place to sleep 
theres really no problem with sleeping on the trains but we 
cant allow people to sprawl out and take up several seats said 
jared lebow a transit authority spokesman 
he said a worse problem is the behavior of some homeless people 
when they are awakened at the final stop a station where subway 
cars are cleaned and made ready for the return trip 
some of them get pretty upset when the workers try to get them 
to move some of our people have been hit kicked and even spit 
on lebow said 
the new policy follows a crackdown in early june aimed at 
removing hundreds of panhandlers and homeless people from the 
subways and the citys two major rail terminals grand central 
terminal and penn station 
the new effort will be extended next month to another of the 
citys subway routes the e train 
the transit authority said workers from outreach programs will 
assist any homeless people who want to go to shelters 
as with the earlier campaign to displace the displaced from 
grand central and penn stations the latest move prompted a sharp 
reaction from advocates for the homeless 
when are they going to learn moving homeless people from one 
area to another accomplishes nothing said mary brosnahan 
director of the coalition for the homeless when is somebody 
going to stop playing the shell game and work on real solutions to 
the problem

irish envoy adrian mcdaid met today with 
a syrian intelligence officer in an effort to gain some information 
on the hopedfor release of irish hostage brian keenan 
mcdaid first secretary of the irish embassy in baghdad which 
also oversees irish affairs in lebanon was scheduled to meet later 
with prime minister salim hoss 
the results of the meeting between mcdaid and syrian brig ali 
hammoud were unclear hammoud is in charge of security in west 
beirut 
a source at the irish consulate speaking on condition of 
anonymity said mcdaid was trying to find out from brigadier 
hammoud whether the syrians had any information on the hostage 
release he refused to elaborate 
the irish diplomat flew to lebanon thursday in an effort to 
verify a report by irans official news agency that a european 
hostage held in lebanon would be released soon 
the report issued by the islamic republic news agency last 
week did not identify the hostage to be freed but sources close 
to the command of syrias 40000 troops in lebanon said it would be 
keenan 
mcdaid visited the iranian news agencys west beirut office on 
friday to inquire about the agencys sources 
irnas resident correspondent mussayeb naimi said we stressed 
that our sources are reliable and we explained to mr mcdaid that 
the hostage to be released will probably be a european national 
he asked us about the reports that said keenan will be 
released and we explained to him that our report did not name the 
hostage naimi added 
the 16 western hostages held mainly by proiranian underground 
shiite factions are keenan six americans four britons two west 
germans two swiss and an italian the longest held is terry

artists are expressing themselves in a new way 
with modern technology but theyve got to get their fax right 
artists love new toys to experiment to look for new visual 
results said karen indeck cocurator of the university of 
illinois faxart exhibit visual art is about images and its an 
incredible use of a new technology to create these images 
cosponsored by university of illinois school of art and the 
school of the art institute faxart features the work of their 
alumni and other artists worldwide and is entirely composed of work 
transmitted by fascimile machine 
on july 2 a fax machine was activated at gallery 400 an old 
bra and girdle factory converted into a gallery 
ever since the phone has been ringing with entries some 
artists redialed more than five hours before getting through 
beyond its novelty another appeal of fax art to artists is its 
shortlived quality 
judith kitzes an evanstonbased artist submitted a piece 
consisting only of the words learn to live with ambiguity the 
computergenerated sentence is repeated 108 times on 10 sheets of 
paper 
i like the idea that i wrote one sentence repeated it the 
original in the computer does not exist the original on paper i 
destroyed after faxing it and the work of art the fax will 
fade she said 
its a contradiction of what we expect art to be this 
precious thing it really isnt thats something that appeals to 
my sense of the bizarre selfdestructive art 
the transient informal nature of the medium also appealed to 
indeck and cocurator mary min who have been busily pinning and 
taping landscapes abstracts and portraits to the walls and columns 
at gallery 400 
since indeck and min plugged in a donated fax machine and loaded 
the first roll of paper about 900 artworks have been received 
the show is the first major exhibit featuring only fax art its 
curators said 
david hockneys 144sheet tennis match faxed from california to 
a gallery in saltaire england in november is one of the first 
fax art pieces ever exhibited 
so far indeck and min have used 1600 pushpins and countless 
rolls of doublesided tape to hang about 300 works some from as 
far away as spain and the netherlands 
the rest lie in piles on the floor 
on friday just hours before the exhibit was to open to the 
public an uninterrupted stream of works still flowed from the fax 
machine while an assistant sorted and filed the entries 
min said the challenge of creating images that would have an 
impact even after being faxed and the speed by which those images 
could be transmitted worldwide sparked her curiosity 
you finish something you send it out and you get a response 
its an artists dream said min a chicagobased neon artist 
and when the shows over poof its gone 
images created on the thermal paper used in fax machines last 
about six months less if theyre exposed to sunlight or bright 
artificial illumination 
fax art can be carefully preserved by deacidifying the paper 
but not the works exhibited at faxart 
min said the pieces will be recycled when the show closes aug 
17 
so when talk arose about whether to put the artwork up for sale 
it really was just in jest 
said chicago artist julie richman how would you sell this 
would someone with a fax machine say i want to buy this and 
then i would fax it

the first of more than 3000 
albanian refugees arrived in west germany by train today joyously 
waving their hands in victory as they savored their new freedom 
about 125 albanians reached southern heidelberg aboard a special 
west german train that left basel switzerland after a brief 
stopover en route from italy 
there was no way to live avni azizi a 23yearold albanian 
tailor said of his hardline communist homeland we all think 
that at the most in one year the whole albanian people will be 
free 
the refugees began crowding into foreign embassies in tirana two 
weeks ago seeking to flee albania which has resisted the kinds of 
sweeping democratic reforms that radically altered other east 
european countries since last fall 
about 4500 albanians were evacuated in a sealift across the 
adriatic sea to brindisi italy early friday 
today 56 refugees sheltered in the polish embassy in the 
albanian capital reached warsaw by plane and were taken to an army 
facility northwest of the city 
another 39 albanian refugees including six women and two 
children arrived in budapest hungary by plane and were sent to a 
refugee camp in the buda hills near the capital according to news 
reports 
on the same plane were five albanians who took refuge at the 
bulgarian embassy they departed budapest for the bulgarian capital 
of sofia budapest radio said 
most of the refugees were reported to want to emigrate to 
western europe or the united states where they have relatives and 
friends the radio said 
the french foreign ministry announced in a communique that the 
ferry orient star carrying 544 albanians will dock at marseille 
on sunday 
a special train will transport 514 to reception centers near 
reims and they will then be bused to reception centers in 
mourmelon creil and emance the remaining 30 will be taken to 
centers at perigueux and st astier in the dordogne region of 
southwestern france 
the ship had been scheduled to arrive in marseille today but 
fell behind schedule when a pregnant woman dirianda daja 21 
became ill and had to be evacuated to italy agencefrance presse 
said 
four ships chartered by the west german italian and french 
governments had picked up the 4500 albanians in the albaninan port 
of durres early friday under an agreement worked out with united 
nations mediation 
before albanian authorities sealed off the embassy compounds 
asylumseekers scrambled up embassy walls and pushed their way 
through gates sometimes braving police gunfire 
the albanian government agreed to let the refugees leave the 
country after supplies of food and medicine in the embassies ran 
low and hygienic conditions deteriorated 
three west german trains were sent to italy to collect the 3200 
albanians who sought refuge in the west german embassy in tirana 
in basel they boarded smaller trains taking them to 14 towns in 
west germany 
those arriving in heidelberg 60 miles south of frankfurt were 
the first to reach their destination 
they arrived tired after a sevenhour boat journey to brindisi 
and 26hour train ride to west germany but they said they were 
elated by the prospect of a new life 
enkeo halili a 24yearold mechanic said we are leaving our 
country because we dont want these communists we are young we 
are poor weve never even seen a discotheque 
the german red cross said 10 of the 125 refugees were sick and 
would be taken to hospitals carl bauer a red cross spokesman in 
bonn said they were suffering from fever diarrhea and weakness 
other albanians were taken to a former clinic in heidelberg that 
until recently housed east german refugees 
a defection of tens of thousands of east germans last fall 
fueled the downfall of that nations hardline communist government 
the albanian government introduced limited reforms last year 
including some religious freedom and travel abroad which albanians 
were not permitted for 45 years 
on friday about 100000 people rallied in the albanian capital 
of tirana in support of the communist leadership the state ata 
news agency reported 
the rally was organized in skanderbeg square close to the 
diplomatic community where the refugees began seeking asylum on 
june 28 
xhelil gjoni a member of the partys policymaking politburo 
told the rally that albania and its peoples power are unshaken 
by degenerate people who abandon their homeland or by anyone 
else said a tirana radio broadcast monitored in london

on dec 22 1988 mayor marion barry rushed 
his aides through a session on the city budget and then left 
hurriedly saying he needed to attend a funeral 
but according to testimony in barrys drug and perjury trial 
the mayor first drove that day to the hotel room of an 
acquaintance drug dealer charles lewis lewis has said in court 
that barry presented him with a crack cocaine pipe and the two men 
tested it 
the events of that afternoon provide a glimpse into the life of 
a man whose official duties included grappling publicly with the 
difficulties of a large urban city while according to numerous 
witnesses at the trial routinely using illegal drugs in private 
medical experts say juggling such activities would be difficult 
but not impossible and that substance abusers can hide their 
problems from close associates 
but they pay a price 
the bottom line is that in policymaking jobs when you talk 
about alcohol and drugs theres no question that they will have an 
effect on job performance said dr michael stoil of the 
washingtonarea chapter of council on alcohol and drug abuse 
normally you see the effect mostly with attention span and 
concentration 
studies of alcoholism in particular generally suggest that 
work is the last thing to go said dr marc hertzman a george 
washington university psychiatry professor who studies the effects 
of substance abuse 
when all else marriage family life is gone most people 
can still carry on effectively enough so that their associates and 
superiors do not suspect a problem hertzman said in an interview 
last week 
barry has pleaded innocent to all charges although he has 
admitted using cocaine in what he says was an fbi entrapment when 
he was arrested last jan 18 during a sting operation at a 
washington hotel 
so far in the trial which resumes tuesday eight prosecution 
witnesses have testified that they saw barry use drugs including 
cocaine crack cocaine marijuana and opium with the first such 
allegation dating to 1985 one witness rasheeda moore testified 
that she and the mayor used drugs more than 100 times together 
following his arrest barry spent seven weeks in florida and 
south carolina substance abuse treatment programs he has said he 
was treated for addictions to alcohol and two prescription 
medicines 
the experts experience that a substance abuser can continue to 
work even though impaired conforms with the recollections of 
barrys top advisers 
he seemed very distracted unfocused said one top barry 
aide in recalling the december 1988 meeting on the city budget 
he was in a real hurry to leave and here we were talking 
about the possibility of a budget deficit he did not give his full 
time and attention to the meeting the aide said 
even before that day in 1988 the mayors own aides had begun a 
quiet surveillance of their own keeping track of how many morning 
meetings barry missed and whether he was paying attention in the 
ones he did attend 
something was wrong one aide said he had always been so 
sharp but he just wasnt anymore 
it was like with families of alcoholics said another top 
aide wed meet with him come out and ask each other well how 
did he look today 
the aides spoke only on condition that their names not be used 
by the fall of 1989 many of barrys top assistants had concluded 
privately that the mayor had a substance abuse problem 
they recall being startled in november 1989 when barry used a 
city cabinet meeting to give a speech on the dangers of drug abuse 
and then introduce seven recovering addicts who discussed their 
problems 
at the end of the meeting in front of all 50 of us the mayor 
asked one of them what cocaine felt like said one cabinet member 
who was there 
and at the next months cabinet meeting less than a month 
before his arrest in the sting operation barry invited two 
doctors to address the group on the medical effects of drug abuse 
it was almost like he was going through a cathartic 
experience crying out for help and dragging us along said 
another cabinet member who also spoke only on condition of 
anonymity many of us were ignorant about drugs and the mayor 
certainly cast himself in that camp 
one drug counselor says barrys behavior fits a wellknown 
pattern 
generally speaking that is part of the manipulation that goes 
on in a persons mind to deny the use to cover their tracks with 
other people says jill wiedemannwest a drug counselor with 
hazelden services inc 
part of the denial is to make people believe you are not in 
any way shape or form involved in drugs

millions of east europeans expected the 
tide of democracy that swept the communists from power last year to 
solve all their problems it hasnt and discontent is spreading 
janos lampert a 32yearold electrician in budapest hungary 
was an avid supporter of the democracy movement 
three months after democratic elections gave hungary its first 
noncommunist government in four decades he still moonlights to 
support his wife and two children 
laid up after an accident lampert watched democracy at work 
live televised parliament sessions 
disgusting he said i just cant see those guys yakking 
all day while the economy is in shambles 
problems in budapest may differ from those in bucharest east 
berlin prague sofia or warsaw but disappointment is widespread 
some east europeans question whether the battle for democracy 
has really been won others are depressed by the long road to 
prosperity that lies ahead 
hungarians have been subjected to price increases new taxes and 
business bankruptcies that produced unemployment the mood is 
sullen many believe the new government of political neophytes is 
unequal to the task of improving conditions with a minimum of pain 
for hungarians thinking of starting a business government 
permission takes up to three months 
inflation exceeded 30 percent in the first quarter industrial 
production dropped more than 8 percent and an estimated 50000 
people were unemployed compared with 3200 a year ago the foreign 
debt of 206 billion is the highest per capita in eastern europe 
decades of communist mismanagement in romania left many 
industries and services barely functioning but there is enough to 
eat for the first time in a decade 
in a country unused to even a trace of freedom the meeting of 
basic needs appears to be reason for economic contentment the 
political situation is less promising 
multiparty elections held may 20 were generally fair but were 
preceded by campaign violence unequalled in the region many 
romanians still fear and distrust the victorious national salvation 
front whose leaders they consider commmunist 
the governments inauguration last month was preceded by violent 
attacks on government institutions and mob rule by miners answering 
a government appeal for help 
after such a bloody riot it is very easy to bring people back 
onto the streets adrian severin who is charged with introducing 
a market economy said afterward the hate in the peoples soul 
was not at all consumed 
political turmoil also contributes to a sense of insecurity in 
bulgaria the only east european country where the ruling 
communists won democratic elections 
threats of escalating strikes forced the resignation july 7 of 
president petar mladenov a reform communist and protests continue 
by activists seeking a full reckoning with the past 
concern that a government hamstrung by protest would not be able 
to deal with pressing economic problems added to the pessimism in 
bulgaria 
it has had to suspend payments of all but interest on the 10 
billion debt an estimated 60 percent of industry is unprofitable 
and unemployment is growing 
nowhere does the connection between economic and political 
problems seem so clear as in poland where the solidarityled 
government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki won partially free 
elections more than a year ago 
stores are relatively well stocked and people appear to be 
managing but workers have gone on strike over rising prices and 
wage controls 
mazowieckis critics want to replace president wojciech 
jaruzelski the former communist leader with solidarity leader 
lech walesa they say the people are less willing to make economic 
sacrifices when the president and many members of parliament are 
communist holdovers 
in a speech to workers july 8 walesa said we were not 
prepared for the work that would come after the abolition of 
communism 
even czechoslovaks left with a relatively healthy economy are 
having trouble with economic adjustments food prices were 
increased 25 percent on july 11 
rents and energy costs are scheduled to rise in the fall 
followed by total price decontrol and accelerated conversion to 
private enterprise early next year 
i dont know what ill do if things go on like this said 
pensioner libuse klementova 
east germans are assured of relatively quick prosperty through 
union with west germany but are bracing for shortterm turmoil 
onethird to more than onehalf the countrys 8000 major 
enterprises are expected to go broke in a few months millions of 
people could lose their jobs and many people have predicted a hot 
autumn of strikes 
with west germany financing economic reform officials say the 
situation will begin to improve next year

influential senators are joining an effort to 
persuade president bush to revamp us policy toward cambodia 
saying the current one could return the dreaded khmer rouge to 
power 
in the draft of a letter to bush the group says the khmer 
rouge represents an unacceptable threat to the people of cambodia 
and that american policy should be based first and foremost upon 
preventing the return of the khmer rouge 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine and a 
bipartisan group of 10 other senators suggest in the letter that 
bush should open the door to contacts between the united states and 
the vietnamesebacked phnom penh government of hun sen 
they also ask bush to implement a congressionally authorized aid 
program for children who are victims of the countrys civil war and 
loosen restrictions on us development and humanitarian aid to 
cambodia 
the letter circulated for signatures last week is the latest 
sign of growing congressional opposition to a decadeold policy 
which sends us aid to a loose political coalition fighting the 
hun sen government 
it has become increasingly clear that the khmer rouge whose 
regime was responsible for the deaths of more than a million 
cambodians in the 1970s could be indirectly riding the us 
support back into power as the dominant member of the coalition 
while the bush administration insists that none of the us aid 
is helping the communist rebel group there is increasing 
restiveness on capitol hill last month the senate intelligence 
committee voted to kill a covert aid program for the resistance 
reportedly worth 10 million 
the united states also has a 7 million program of overt 
nonlethal aid to the resistance coalition 
those pressing for the policy change included intelligence 
committee chairman david boren dokla vice chairman william 
cohen rmaine and committee member john danforth rmo 
appropriations committee chairman robert c byrd dwva and 
senior committee republican mark hatfield of oregon 
also included were foreign relations committee chairman 
claiborne pell dri and committee members nancy kassebaum 
rkan and alan cranston dcalif as well as sen charles robb 
dva a past strong supporter of administration policy and sen 
bob kerrey dneb 
the administration and its congressional supporters say the aid 
is important to keep alive an alternative political force that 
could vie for power if negotiations succeeded in bringing about 
elections but the critics are not buying that 
the presidents policy in cambodia is indefensible mitchell 
told reporters last week it doesnt make any sense how can we 
the united states which has already enacted into law a prohibition 
on aiding the khmer rouge engage in a policy which does precisely 
that 
he expressed hope that the letter from capitol hill would help 
strengthen those within the administration who are embarrassed 
about the us stance 
mitchell and others including rep chet atkins dmass have 
suggested that with vietnams withdrawal from cambodia last year 
the khmer rouge now represents a far greater threat 
they believe us cambodia policy is a symptom of a larger bush 
blind spot when it comes to china the khmer rouges chief 
sponsor it all goes back to china the administration doesnt 
want to offend china mitchell said 
we believe that american policy can and should more clearly 
and effectively help prevent future khmer rouge domination of 
cambodia stated the letter 
the group asks that bush clearly state that the united states 
will not support a negotiated solution that would give the khmer 
rouge a role in cambodias future or increase the likelihood of a 
khmer rouge military victory 
and noting a promise by hun sen to hold unsupervised 
elections it expresses the hope that you will see value in 
opening up direct contacts with representatives of the regime in 
phnom penh 
it also asks for a more thorough investigation into reports of 
military coordination between the noncommunist resistance forces 
including the usbacked faction led by prince norodom sihanouk 
and the khmer rouge 
and it asks for an end to us support for any participation by 
the khmer rouge in cambodian representation at the united nations 
better an empty seat than one which bestows international 
legitimacy upon the forces of the infamous khmer rouge leader pol 
pot the letter contends

republican leaders trying to get the party back 
on sure footing after a stretch of rocky road are setting out on a 
trusted course attack 
it has been a tumultuous year for the gop beginning with a 
divisive debate over abortion in january and then the news in march 
that party chairman lee atwater had a brain tumor he has been 
sidelined ever since 
more recently republicans have been on the defensive as 
democrats try to blame them for the savings and loan crisis and gop 
candidates try to cope with president bushs abrupt abandonment of 
his no new taxes campaign pledge 
but at a threeday meeting in chicago that ended saturday the 
republican national committee resolved to go back on the offensive 
controlling the agenda is the way to continue winning said 
mary matalin atwaters top deputy at the rnc we somehow allowed 
ourselves to fall off of offense but the message is clear now 
a chorus of gop leaders used both public and private sessions 
during the gops midyear meeting to urge republicans at both the 
state and national level to be more aggressive 
the obituaries are premature ed rollins head of the 
partys house campaign arm told the group in a speech laced with 
blistering attacks on democrats 
from a lesserknown republican mayor sue myrick of charlotte 
nc came a demand that republicans at all levels stop trying to 
look and sound like democrats 
far too many republicans are not drifting but rather diving 
headlong into softened stands on such issues as abortion flag 
burning and more taxes rather than more prudent spending myrick 
said at one session it is time to stand up to be counted to 
fight 
the new effort relies heavily on the core strategies of past gop 
success frame the debate on major issues and paint democrats as 
the party that taxes as a first resort 
bush pollster bob teeter told the gathering that if republicans 
articulate their partys differences with democrats then voters 
will side with the party that taxes last and taxes least not the 
party that taxes first and taxes most 
but bushs reversal on taxes has many gop officials wondering 
whether the president has ditched the republican partys defining 
issue just four months before the 1990 elections 
top party leaders and strategists told gop officials from across 
the country that republicans cannot drop the tax issue bushs 
announcement notwithstanding and they promised that bush will 
protect the partys interests by fighting any attempts to raise 
income taxes 
matalin believes the message took hold 
we got done here what we had to do she said in an 
interview this was the perfect forum for us to remind ourselves 
that we do best when he define the differences between republicans 
and democrats 
that such a lesson was necessary appears directly attributable 
to the absence of atwater 
the energetic raspyvoiced chairman had become the partys 
singular spokesman relied on by the white house and reporters 
alike 
without him a party renowned for speaking with one voice 
suddenly had many and the message got muddied 
it has been a little fuzzy and it certainly has been distorted 
by democrats matalin said 
weve hit a few bumps but were ready to get back on track 
said haley barbour a leading gop strategist and rnc member from 
mississippi 
still even if the gop can launch a unified offensive the 
partys challenge this fall is daunting 
the decline of communism has stripped republicans of one core 
issue and bushs switch on taxes at a minimum makes it tougher for 
the gop to get an edge on that front in addition the party 
controlling the white house traditionally loses seats in midterm 
elections 
at the same time the democratic party appears to be having 
success in articulating a unified message of its own a populist 
pitch blaming republican greed for the sampl crisis 
not surprisingly democratic party chairman ron brown said the 
gops decision to mount an offensive was made out of fear 
they dont want to talk about george bush breaking his read 
my lips pledge and what kind of sampl bailout he is planning 
brown said they dont want to talk about americas nogrowth 
economy so of course theyll come up with wild charges and finger 
pointing 
but matalin and other gop leaders left the meeting satisfied 
that better days lie ahead 
this is not brain surgery matalin said this is campaign 
101 were not going to sit there and let them define the debate

older people are more avid newspaper readers 
than young people but the young are more apt to be reading books 
according to a study released sunday 
those who get their news from newspapers appear to be better 
informed than those who rely on radio but not necessarily better 
informed than television news watchers and people with children 
are more likely to watch the sunday morning news interview shows on 
television than people without 
these tidbits are from a new study by the times mirror center 
for the people and the press called the american media who 
reads who watches who listens who cares 
the study divides people into four groups based on the interest 
they show in the news 
twelve percent are news sophisticates who form the regular 
audience of national public radio public televisions 
macneillehrer newshour and such magazines as the atlantic 
harpers and the new yorker 
eight percent do not read a daily newspaper or watch or listen 
to the news regularly 
another 39 percent dont quite make news sophisticate but 
nevertheless read a news magazine or a major metropolitan daily 
newspaper or watch sunday morning interview shows or cable news 
network they are called serious news consumers 
the remaining 41 percent the largest group are moderate 
consumers who regularly read a daily paper or watch or listen to 
the news 
fortyone percent of the nonnews users and 16 percent of the 
news sophisticates are in the 1829 age bracket 
the analysis was based on 4890 telephone interviews conducted 
in the first four months of this year the margin of error was plus 
or minus 3 percentage points 
the survey shows that 24 percent in 1829 bracket said they had 
read a daily newspaper the previous day this rose to 61 percent 
for persons over 80 the percentage increased steadily with age 
except for a slight slump among people in their 70s 
fortythree percent of people under 30 one of every two people 
in their 30s and 40s and 44 percent of people 50 and over said they 
listened to news on the radio regularly 
for television the percentages were 63 percent under 30 71 
percent in the 30s and 40s and 84 percent at age 50 and over 
five percent of childless people said they watched the sunday 
interview programs regularly this rose to 11 percent for married 
couples with children and 12 percent for single parents 
thirtyeight percent of people 18 to 29 said they were reading a 
novel or other book this increased to 39 percent among people in 
their 30s and 41 percent for readers in their 40s 
after that it dropped off to 35 percent for the 50s and 70s 31 
percent for the 60s and 29 percent for people over 80 
the habit of watching cnn regularly rose from 21 percent in the 
youngest age bracket to 28 percent for people in their 50s and 60s 
it dropped to 22 percent for viewers over 70 
among people who had spent one hour or more reading a daily 
newspaper on the previous day 20 percent correctly identified 
czechoslovakian president vaclav havel compared with 16 percent 
for those who spent an hour or more watching television news and 11 
percent for those who spent that much time listening to news on the 
radio 
in the same survey 90 percent of the newspaper readers 92 
percent of the television watchers and 82 percent of the radio 
listeners knew where panamas gen manuel antonio noriega took 
refuge 
fortyseven percent of readers 50 percent of watchers and 34

the united states had warning prior 
to the 1986 bombing of a west berlin discotheque that libya planned 
a terrorist attack a news magazine reported today 
der spiegel west germanys leading news magazine said the us 
government learned that libya was planning an attack after at least 
one cia agent infiltrated the group that prepared the bombing 
the blast on april 5 1986 killed two american soldiers and a 
turkish woman and injured more than 200 people in west berlins la 
belle discotheque which had been popular with us servicemen 
there were also reports shortly after the blast that the us 
knew an attack was imminent and that planning for the attack was 
traced to the libyan embassy in east berlin 
the us retaliated by bombing the libyan cities of benghazi and 
tripoli and the heavily guarded compound of libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi 
spiegels storys appeared to be the first report involving a 
cia informer the flow of information from the informer stopped 
several days before the la belle bombing possibly explaining why 
the attack on the discotheque was not prevented the magazine said 
the us embassy in bonn refused to comment on the magazines 
report 
the magazine said it based its report on documents from the 
former east german ministry for state security and former east 
german agents it also said the documents showed how closely the 
nowdisbanded east german secret police worked with libyan 
terrorists 
the group that planned the la belle attack was composed mostly 
of employees of the libyan embassy in east berlin the magazine 
said 
spiegel provided excerpts of its report to news media on 
saturday in advance of its monday publication 
spiegel said the cia informer apparently was a double agent who 
also worked for the east german police or stasi and carried the 
code name alba 
the agent provided information on the transport of weapons and 
explosives and on the possible targets of the attack spiegel said 
the west german newspaper die welt reported on thursday that 
east germanys ousted communist party leader erich honecker and 
stasi chief erich mielke knew about the planned attack on the disco 
nearly two weeks before the bombing but did nothing to stop the 
libyans

the winds of democracy blowing from 
eastern europe have reached kenya setting off bloody street 
battles in what had been considered the most stable nation of black 
africa 
several political explosions have rocked africa south of the 
sahara this year demands for reform have shaken other oneparty 
governments in ivory coast gabon zambia cameroon zaire and 
benin 
analysts say the protests reflect awareness that oneparty rule 
was swept aside in eastern europe last year and the weariness of 
africans with often authoritarian and corrupt leadership 
in kenya at least 28 people were killed in riots that began at 
a banned rally for multiparty politics july 7 the demonstrators 
stoned a plainclothes policeman and officers responded with tear 
gas and gunfire starting four days of street battles that spread 
to other parts of the country 
multiparty democracy is an international catchword which has 
been adopted by all those who have a grievance against the 
government said a western diplomat based in nairobi 
they may not know what it means but they know that they are 
unhappy and that what theyve got hasnt worked said the 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
rising food prices skyrocketing debt burgeoning populations 
and steady economic decline have added fuel to the political fires 
in zambia a failed coup july 1 followed five days of the worst 
urban violence in the nations history at least 23 people were 
killed in student riots over food price increases 
the students also demanded westernstyle democracy and the 
ouster of president kenneth kaunda who leads the united national 
independence party since 1972 the only legal political movement in 
the southern african country 
protests against austerity measures and corruption in ivory 
coast in march grew into violent antigovernment demonstrations 
demanding that president felix houphouetboigny relinquish his 
30year monopoly on power 
the protests forced him to legalize political organizations 
other than his own democratic party 
president omar bongo of gabon installed a multiparty system in 
may after a coup attempt late last year and student protests in 
january and february france sent troops to protect oil workers 
when more riots broke out in may 
benin also adopted political pluralism after dropping a 
marxistleninist style of government late last year 
paul biya cameroons president came to power in 1983 promising 
more democracy but his government has cracked down on advocates of 
pluralism since february 
six people were killed at a prodemocracy rally and authorities 
arrested 10 prominent citizens who tried to form an alternative 
party to his democratic rally of the cameroonian people 
kenyas president daniel arap moi appears to be following the 
cameroonian model 
his government has arrested and charged more than 1400 people 
in connection with the riots and threatens continued use of force 
against prodemocracy demonstrators seventeen people have been 
detained without charge including the most prominent advocates of 
multiparty politics 
moi who has governed kenya since 1978 contends political

mikhail s gorbachev on saturday cleared the 
communist party politburo of the countrys most important officials 
in a final break with a decadesold precept of total party 
domination 
a new central committee elected on the last day of the partys 
28th congress in turn chose a 24member politburo packed with the 
communist party leaders of the 15 republics moderate reformers and 
political unknowns 
gorbachev and his newly elected deputy vladimir ivashko were 
the only holdovers from the previous 12man politburo 
it was clear the politburo would not wield the total power it 
once had but government ministers remain in place and they appear 
now to be the most powerful men in the soviet union 
gorbachev holds government power as soviet president while he 
continues to lead the party even though they are no longer 
politburo members prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov remains in 
charge of the economy dmitri t yazov remains defense minister 
vladimir a kryuchkov is still kgb chief and eduard a shevardnadze 
remains foreign minister 
the structural changes move their base of power from the 
communist party apparatus to the government a goal that gorbachev 
has espoused for at least two years he has tried to reshape the 
party so it concerns itself with broad policy goals rather than the 
countrys daytoday affairs 
before gorbachevs reforms began any high government position 
was secondary to the officials standing in the communist party 
until saturday it was understood that combination with a high 
party position was an indication of a government officials power 
the new composition of the politburo underscores that the 
party fully breaks with the former practice when it was organically 
built into the command and administrative system and was on the 
top of the hierarchy said ivan frolov the editor of the party 
newspaper pravda and a new politburo member 
it will now be a force competing with other social and 
political forces and asserting its advantages mostly in the 
ideological and political struggle he told a news conference 
ryzhkov kryuchkov and yazov remain members of the 412member 
central committee shevardnadze however does not 
shevardnadze and gorbachev adviser alexander n yakovlev a 
member of gorbachevs presidential council said during the 
congress that they did not see the need to remain on the politburo 
gorbachevs traditionalist rival yegor k ligachev was trounced 
by ivashko in his bid for the partys no 2 job and announced he 
was going home to siberia to write a book 
the leader of the radical reform wing boris n yeltsin quit 
the party on the day before the congress ended and some of the 
countrys most prominent reformers quickly joined him 
gorbachev expressed contempt for those who quit the party 
but acknowledged that the communists were facing the beginning of a 
multiparty system he pledged that the party would try to help 
government bodies rather than simply dominate them 
frolov said that in addition to the heads of party organizations 
in the soviet republics himself gorbachev and ivashko the new 
politburo will include 
alexander s dzasokhov a former ambassador to syria and 
currently chairman of the supreme soviet parliaments international 
affairs commission he will be responsible for party ideology 
yuri prokofiev the moscow communist party chief a job that in 
the past has entitled the holder to politburo status prokofiev is 
known as a moderate reformer 
galina semyonova editorinchief of peasant woman 
magazine she will be responsible for womens issues 
gennady yanayev who became head of the central council of 
trade unions this year after labor unrest began spreading through 
the country he will be responsible for international affairs 
oleg shenin the party leader in the vast krasnoyarsk region of 
siberia his will handle organizational issues 
igor stroyev elevated last year to the partys secretariat by 
gorbachev he will be responsible for farm issues 
boris gidaspov the leningrad party chief whom reformers suspect 
of being a hardliner trying to undermine gorbachev was elected a 
national party secretary 
it is unclear how the politburos function will change but it 
appeared unlikely to meet as frequently weekly politburo meetings 
for years thrashed out decisions on all key policy questions 
by putting the party chiefs of the 15 republics on the 
politburo gorbachev has tried to give the party a better forum for 
discussing ethnic issues they range from hardliners such as 
mikolas burokjavicus the head of the small lithuanian party loyal 
to moscow to georgian givi gumbaridze who is leading his 
republics party to endorse the drive for local sovereignty 
their selection ensures that the partys highest body no longer 
will be dominated by russians who gradually worked their way 
through the party apparatus to important jobs in moscow 
frolov reported a very heated debate in the central 
committee over which of two candidates from the baltic republic of 
estonia to select they settled on ennarno sillari a 
representative of the faction that has announced its intention to 
split from the party

with a tough campaign looming back home rep 
arlan stangeland didnt miss a chance to talk turkey to his 
constituents in washington 
as the house agriculture committee put its final touches on a 
new fiveyear farm program the republican won approval for a 
turkey research center down the road from his lake house at pelican 
rapids minn 
porkbarrel research projects are nothing new in congress but 
congressional sources say lawmakers rarely use the farm bill to get 
them adopted 
its in the congressmans best interest and the interest of 
the people of the 7th district to have that facility in our 
district said tom hanson a spokesman for stangeland 
after the committees 1612 vote to authorize 500000 for 
planning stangelands project other panel members lined up to 
fatten the mammoth farm bill with a long menu of special studies or 
projects 
illinois rep edward madigan the committees ranking 
republican won approval for research at illinois state university 
on raising fish texas members got authorization for researching 
prickly pear cactus and mesquite a prolific southwest shrub for 
which the government once had an eradication program 
opponents hope to strip the projects from the farm bill before 
it goes to president bush 
critics who complain that research should be funded on merit 
rather than politics say earmarked programs divert scare federal 
funds from existing projects 
they just dont have the money to fund centers for all 50 
states that people think are important said chuck benbrook 
executive director of the national academy of sciences board on 
agriculture 
you can easily argue that we need more turkey research said 
rep george brown dcalif who chairs the agriculture committees 
research panel but thats a decision that the department of 
agriculture should be making 
brown tried in vain to block stangelands project arguing that 
it shouldnt be approved without a hearing and testimony from usda 
experts 
he has allies besides usda the senate agriculture committee 
turned down members pet projects and went on to propose a 
commission to find wasteful research that congress should stop 
if he succeeds in getting house and senate negotiators to 
eliminate the projects the project sponsors will still enjoy 
shortterm political gain back home brown said 
if he fails they will still have to convince the congressional 
appropriations committees next year to put the projects in the 
federal budget 
the turkey research center would be run by north dakota state 
university the school proposed the facility to stangeland because 
scientists want to do genetics research to improve turkey 
production in northern climates hanson said 
the congressman felt that with minnesota being second ranked 
in turkey production in the country and that since 50 percent of 
the turkeys grown in minnesota are grown in the 7th district it 
would be a natural place to have it he said

while the london and houston summits are 
behind him there are plenty of loose ends that president bush will 
have to confront in the next few months 
major differences remain among the allies on trade the 
environment and on economic aid to the soviet union 
facesaving compromises reached by summit partners to achieve 
common ground on several issues only guarantee that the divisions 
will resurface at a later time 
at first glance bush appears to have gotten most of what he 
wanted from the nato summits in london and the summit of 
industrialized democracies in houston last week 
thats what bush is good at said stephen hess a scholar at 
the brookings institution who specializes in the presidency hes 
brought to international relations the same skills that hes 
brought to domestic politics when you have no money split the 
difference 
he added its a way to put off decisions without leaving 
anyone too unhappy 
but the compromises either glossed over the lingering 
differences or bought participants more time 
for instance the allied leaders in houston were able to put off 
the issue of a joint stance on direct economic aid to the soviet 
union favored by west germany but opposed by the united states 
with a statement that talked about individual aid it also 
commissioned a study of the soviet economy by the international 
monetary fund 
a sixmonth time frame was put on the imf study when that 
report is complete it is likely that the divisions among western 
allies will resurface 
bush also made little real headway on the hotly debated subject 
of agricultural subsidies 
initially the administration had pressed for an agreement 
eliminating all such subsidies by the year 2000 european allies 
balked at that notion 
from the houston summit came a compromise in which the 
united states basically abandoned its insistence that all 
agricultural subsidies be dropped by 2000 and european allies 
agreed in principle that the subsidies should be cut 
however that just threw the debate back to negotiations under 
way in geneva under the auspices of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
those talks to produce a new set of liberalized international 
trading rules have been going on for three years and are bogged 
down on the agricultural subsidy issue 
bush has said repeatedly that he hopes the trade talks can be 
completed and an agreement on agricultural subsidies reached by 
the end of this year 
but if the year ends and the talks remain deadlocked bush will 
be forced to address the issue anew 
on the environment bush persuaded allies to retreat from 
insisting on a timetable on combatting global warming however his 
administration remained at odds with western allies on the subject 
and with basically the same differences coming out of the summit 
as going in 
at the london nato summit allies invited soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to address a meeting of the alliance probably 
in december and although the precise forum wasnt specified us 
officials said it was unlikely that gorbachev would address a nato 
meeting without bush in attendance 
furthermore both bush and gorbachev have pledged to try to 
complete work on treaties by the end of this year one to reduce 
conventional forces in europe and the other cut longrange nuclear 
missiles 
a third bushgorbachev summit seems likely possibly in moscow 
to sign a nuclear pact once negotiations on it are complete 
and completion of talks on reducing conventional forces in 
europe will produce a 35nation summit among european nations of 
both eastern and western blocs 
in the meantime bush is turning his attention to domestic 
issues and fundraising excursions to help republican gubernatorial 
and senate candidates 
hell switch over to nonstop politicking said white house 
spokeswoman alixe glen

a woman who has camped for two years in 
front of the motel where martin luther king jr was assassinated to 
protest turning it into a museum is under court order to move her 
tent 
but deputies probably wont try to force her to move until 
monday an official said today 
chancery court judge george lewis told jacqueline smith on 
friday she was trespassing and said he would send sheriffs 
deputies to move her today if she failed to leave voluntarily 
ms smith vowed to stay saying the lorraine motel should be 
used as housing for the homeless she repeated that promise this 
morning saying im sitting right here 
despite the judges statement shelby county deputies were not 
expected to enforce lewis order until monday said wes newman a 
dispatcher for the sheriffs department 
the information we have is the order has not been signed it 
will be signed monday morning and probably will be executed that 
same day newman said 
he added that sheriffs department employees who serve civil 
court orders generally do not work on weekends and no one had been 
called in for special assigment 
the lorraine is to become the centerpiece of a 9 million museum 
called the national civil rights center scheduled to open july 4 
1991 
king was assassinated at the small motel in 1968 
ms smith 39 a former employee and resident of the motel was 
evicted from the lorraine by sheriffs deputies after it was shut 
down to make way for the museum 
the deputies deposited her on a sidewalk in front of motel march 
2 1988 and she has been there ever since 
lewis issued his order for her to move on a petition from 
jamesonvaccaro construction co inc the primary contractor for 
the museum 
anthony vaccaro project manager for the museum said ms smith 
is camped in a spot that must be torn up for utility lines the 
sidewalk she is sitting on also is to be removed he said 
ms smith has rejected requests to move her tent across the 
street vaccaro said 
demolition work began at the lorraine last year and several 
preliminary construction jobs have been completed on the 
2squareblock project site lewis order against ms smith covers 
the entire site 
generally museum developers have ignored ms smith but vaccaro 
said she was in the way he said he had to stop work for several 
days because of her 
vaccaro said his company faces fines of up to 2500 a day if 
the museum is not finished on schedule 
the lorraine which was a popular stopping place for blacks when 
memphis hotels were segregated was falling apart in 1982 when a 
group of concerned citizens bought it at a foreclosure auction 
the group formed the lorraine civil rights museum foundation and 
spent the next several years convincing state and local officials 
to build the museum 
title to the property was turned over to the state

after spending two years in an east german 
prison for trying to break through the iron curtain to freedom 
steffaen petry is determined to live the freespirited life of a 
cowboy on wyomings open range 
from the time i was very little i wanted to be a cowboy from 
a little boy i knew about john wayne the 22yearold said 
through an interprreter during a break in work at the wyoming 
hereford ranch 
for the past few days petry has been pulling weeds and planting 
trees at the ranch just east of cheyenne he has yet to brand a 
calf drive cattle or shoot a rattlesnake but says im so 
happy 
he saddled a horse for the first time wednesday and rode across 
the green plains of southeastern wyoming 
i know that america is a free land and from cheyenne where i 
am i can see land open spaces and houses not only large 
apartment buildings he said sitting on a golden mare in a field 
of tall grass its so crowded in germany its so open here 
petry decided to head to the cowboy state in late june little 
more than six months after he was released from prison when he 
read a west german newspaper article saying there was a shortage of 
cowboys in wyoming foreign workers are being allowed to take 
cowhand jobs in parts of the west where there is a shortage of 
qualified american cowboys 
fantasizing about the freedom and expanse of the wild west he 
had seen on television and read about in books he sold his meager 
belongings purchased an airplane ticket and arrived at the 
cheyenne airport on a tourist visa 
he knew no one and could say only one word in english 
cowboy 
he approached an airport maintenance worker who had a friend who 
spoke german he finally was hooked up with the sloan hale family 
who speak german and own the sprawling wyoming hereford ranch 
for now petry is staying with the hales who serve as his 
interpreters until he can find a rancher with an opening for a 
cowboy who will sponsor him in hopes he can replace his tourist 
visa with a work permit 
he wants to spend the rest of his life in america but worries 
that his stay could be shortlived 
for me right now i am free but i wont know true freedom or 
what freedom really is until i know i can stay here he said 
despite his desire to be a cowboy he wore a white cotton blazer 
over a souvenir colorado tshirt jeans white socks and black 
loafers 
not until i am a real cowboy after i work for a year as a 
cowboy will i wear a cowboy hat he said then i will be a 
real cowboy 
petry a mechanic and son of a dock worker felt like thousands 
of other young east germans before the berlin wall tumbled down 
last fall isolated and yearning for freedom 
i had no freedom i could not purchase anything i could not 
go anywhere he said there was absolutely no freedom of 
opinion i couldnt even say i would like a cocacola if i were to 
say that bad things are bad and they didnt think they were bad 
they could put you in jail 
on may 12 1988 petry and a friend decided to leave 
it was very late at night i tried to escape through a forest 
and through a fence i cut the fence and then i came to no mans 
land and the west german border was right there the border was 
right next to us he said 
at that time four people came and arrested us we were taken 
to a holding place for 14 days until they decided what to do with 
us i was in prison for almost two years 
but now he is confident that no matter what happens his life 
will be better 
i told my parents if i did not write please dont have any 
worry everything will be fine

to hear neil bush tell it hes just a denver 
guy trying to make a living and raise a family and hes 
bewildered and angry at the attention hes receiving 
neil bush 35 slim tanned blond father of three children 
epitomizes the young enterprising businessmen who came to colorado 
in the early 1980s to get rich in the oil business 
we lived month to month begged for money from time to time 
and our business was relatively dormant bush recalls but he 
relishes that time in his life 
like his father bush speaks in deliberate runon sentences 
tipping his head during delivery jabbing his finger occasionally 
laughing an engaging hiccuppy sort of laugh displaying 
nearperfect teeth 
he is comfortable enough in front of a television camera to be a 
political commentator which he was briefly two years ago at kmgh 
in denver 
lately however bush hasnt been in the spotlight voluntarily 
bush faces a public disciplinary hearing before federal 
regulators in september on his role as a director of the bankrupt 
silverado banking savings and loan some democrats are pushing for 
a special prosecutor to examine the case 
he has been accused of conflict of interest and failure to 
disclose ties to men who received loans from silverado but has 
said he has done nothing wrong his father has defended his honor 
and integrity but has promised to stay out of the investigation 
the subject makes neil bush angry while some maintain he played 
a major role in pushing through suspicious loans while a director 
of silverado he is enraged that democrats are now making political 
hay out of his predicament 
neil bush is it for the democrats im the highestprofile guy 
they have to shoot at out there he said in an interview last 
week 
as a director of silverado i acted prudently i acted 
responsibly i acted and took my responsibilities seriously and i 
acted with diligence in overseeing the activities of silverado 
he also expresses anger at what he calls government 
mismanagement in the way troubled savings institutions are being 
sold off 
neil bush played his most prominent role on the hot steamy 
night of aug 17 1988 at the republican national convention in 
new orleans when he delivered all of colorados delegates to help 
seal his fathers nomination for president 
it was a heady moment for the third of george and barbara bushs 
four sons and it led to suggestions neil bush might have the stuff 
from which us house or senate candidates are made the 
possibility had him shrugging and smiling and saying maybe 
his job then he told reporters was to help his fathers 
campaign id hate to be the only son to have lost his home state 
for his dad 
dyslexic as a child bush practiced reading exercises until he 
was able to overcome his problem his brother george recalled he 
eventually earned undergraduate and masters degrees in business 
from tulane university 
until a few months ago neil and sharon bush and their three 
children lived in a tan brick twostory home in a friendly 
established neighborhood in central denver 
former neighbors say they would often pile into the family volvo 
for weekend excursions and they were community oriented with neil 
serving on the childrens museum board and sharon cochairing the 
1989 childrens hospital gala 
the family moved to a new house a 550000 structure on 
denvers wealthier newer southeast side it offers privacy 
something that i now thrive on bush says 
his downtown office is light and airy with western paintings 
and a clear view to the west where the rockies can be seen on most 
days his desk carries a name plate mr bush which belonged 
to his grandfather prescott bush when he was a us senator from 
connecticut 
it is more lavish than he was accustomed to when he was a 
partner in a fledgling exploration company jnb exploration co 
jnb paid him a salary he wont say how much but the business 
was later sold in 1989 and bush now heads apex energy also an 
exploration company 
my business is oil and gas he said 
bush says the oil business has been interesting and he made 
some profit selling leasehold interests 
the only problem is he recalls with a smile even though 
we kept things going and everything was in pretty good shape in 
terms of operations we didnt find any oil 
its a pretty highrisk business but we were successful to 
the extent we managed to put prospects together and sell them 
which is probably why we attracted the partners we did

a factory worker could wear a crucifix in 
public a mother noticed she could complain about food shortages 
without going to jail and a student began to talk openly with 
friends about the romanian revolution 
changes have come recently to albania europes last bastion of 
hardline communist rule according to refugees interviewed 
saturday shortly after they arrived in italy 
but they said their balkan nation of 32 million remains a land 
of fear and the government remains committed to communism 
the government has done things only with words a 
29yearold mother said on condition of anonymity for ideas the 
desire of the people to live better they havent done a thing 
the woman was one of 4500 people ferried friday from albania 
where in their quest for freedom they had escaped into western 
embassies some braving police gunfire 
a day later 804 refugees were in the abandoned army camp 
outside brindisi waiting to be resettled in italy about 3200 
traveled on to west germany and others to france 
at the italian camp known as restinco the albanians stood in 
line for new clothes ate steaming plates of lasagna showered away 
days of grime and reflected on the society they fled 
the mother watching her 3yearold son scampering amid rows of 
cots in a makeshift dormitory said the government had become 
slightly more tolerant as shortages of meat fruit and vegetables 
grew 
a few years ago even if you just said you lacked something 
you could go to jail she said 
but criticizing the government directly was still forbidden she 
said like most others interviewed she declined to give her name 
for fear of endangering relatives still in albania 
on the other side of the room a young factory worker sat on a 
cot beside her physically handicapped little brother a cross on a 
white string dangled from her neck 
she said she started wearing it two months ago when the 
albanian government of ramiz alia introduced limited reforms 
including some religious freedom and travel abroad which albanians 
were not permitted for 45 years 
albanians she said took heart from last years democratic 
revolutions in eastern europe particularly the revolt in romania 
previously one of the regions harshest communist regimes many 
albanians were able to follow the events on italian and yugoslav 
television 
theres so much discussion but so much fear she said in 
italian people are afraid the police will beat us that theyll 
get years in jail for one word 
she said anger at the government was rising i dont know im 
so afraid a war will break out they pit people against each 
other she said 
several other refugees said they detected growing signs of 
protest in may bombs exploded at a bookstore and near a statue of 
stalin in the albanian capital three men said several said there 
were demonstrations recently in the northern albanian city of 
shkoder as well as in tirana 
people are not as afraid as they were a year ago said a 
19yearold student who identified himself as ralphafter what 
happened in romania the people burst they began to talk about 
it 
still none of the refugees knew of any organized opposition to 
the government 
and they said fear was still rampant 
out of every four men one is a police agent said arben 
33 a factory worker as he stood in line for new clothing like 
others he gave only one name 
even in the embassies there were provocateurs sent by the 
government he said most apparently left the embassies before the 
boatlift he said 
burhan a 41yearold mechanic told his own story to indicate 
why albanians are so afraid 
one day in 1973 as he walked with a friend in tirana burhan 
said thought the theory of lenin is old now and i had a desire 
to go abroad 
seven years later the friend was arrested and during torture 
repeated what burhan had said the mechanic was sent to prison from 
1980 until last november 
look his bones are broken from the torture said ralph 
running a reporters fingers over burhans knobby collarbone 
most of the refugees said they hoped to move to the united 
states 
as his father looked on ralph said that in the united states a 
man could be whatever he wanted if he works hard of course 
our people believe only in america the father said

shura cherkassky was 12 years old and making his 
first us tour when he played piano for president harding 
violinist joshua bell was a year older and ronald reagan was 
president when he debuted with the philadelphia orchestra after 
winning the seventeen magazinegeneral motors competition 
cherkassky and bell took the stage separately at the mostly 
mozart festival friday night in an interesting contrast of blooming 
and ripened careers both performances reversed expectations 
gerard schwarz mostly mozarts music director and conductor of 
the seattle symphony and the festival orchestra were a fine 
sometimes brilliant constant 
but not at first 
the evening opened with mendelssohns overture to midsummer 
nights dream which because of its delicacy really has to be 
perfect perfect wind entrances in the expanding opening chords 
perfectly together strings in the fleet passages the orchestra 
unfortunately was merely almost perfect 
then came the seeming teenage idol 
bell of bloomington ind is 23 and looks 18 london records 
publicity pictures have him posing in jeans sneakers leather 
jacket and violin perched on thigh but youth and image became 
trivial in his performance of the mendelssohn violin concerto 
his interpretation showed a depth of understanding of the notes 
as music not just a solo display bell played stylishly though 
his flair never failed to serve the musical line and he showed a 
tremendous sense of ease not just with technical difficulties but 
with the music itself 
he was unfazed when a heathen began clapping at a particularly 
delicate moment in the first movement cadenza he looked up and 
went on with his concentration unbroken 
if there was a weakness it was in the slow movement where 
bells sound seemed to lack warmth that might have been the fault 
of avery fisher halls dry acoustics 
in the final movement he also seemed to back away from 
ascending lines leading to big orchestral climaxes but the final 
allegro buildup was explosive at the end schwarz seemed 
delighted smiling and slapping bell on the back 
the russianborn cherkassky 79 who followed intermission with 
mozarts piano concerto no 20 in d minor k 466 was a pupil of 
the legendary polish pianist josef hoffman hoffman himself studied 
with anton rubinstein one of the great pianists of the 19th 
century making cherkassky a direct descendent of a romantic age 
cherkasskys idiosyncracies were there a balding compact man 
he hunched over the piano stared down intently at his fingers 
popped up at the conductor in anticipation of the orchestras 
entrance 
the performance though lacked freedom and his expected 
romantic stamp 
cherkassky played with a curious intimacy and restraint perhaps 
out of character for this stormy and tragic concerto one of only 
two in a minor key by mozart 
what cherkassky did show was an extraordinary range of dynamic 
gradations and color tonal beauty and an incisive sense of rhythm 
the orchestra was superlative in the opening of the concerto 
schwarz maintained a wonderful hush and sculpted the lines deftly 
conductor and players generally kept up the high level in mozarts 
haffner symphony one the composers most exciting symphonies 
the players reverted to a bit of their midsummer night 
imprecision in the first movement and sometimes sounded hurried 
but overall schwarz brought out a good amount of detail and ended 
with a thrilling virtuoso display in the demonically difficult 
final presto

emboldened by their latest strike the 
sandinistas appear more determined than ever to make good on their 
promise to govern from below 
this is just the beginning the party newspaper barricada 
warned in an editorial a feeling echoed by the private sector 
the 10day sandinistaled strike that ended thursday was the 
second major walkout by public employees since president violeta 
barrios de chamorro took office on april 25 
the strikes forced mrs chamorro to grant broad concessions on 
wages and job security for government employees and to put on hold 
parts of her plan to return nicaragua to a free market economy 
the strike accord also shelved her plans to return confiscated 
farmland 
the sandinistas claim this clause as their greatest victory of 
the strike the business community regards it as mrs chamorros 
greatest betrayal 
gilberto cuadra head of the nations leading business group 
the superior council of private enterprise said mrs chamorros 
concessions will encourage labor unrest 
the campaign of strikes will continue he said 
the sandinistas are trying to govern behind the scenes but 
the reality is that they arent governing nor are they allowing 
anyone else to govern he said 
the latest strike culminated in four days of violence that 
claimed at least four lives pavingstone barricades fortified by 
burning tires and armed strikers paralyzed the city gunfire 
crackled across the capital 
in the countryside where the planting season was under way 
farm workers struck diminishing hopes for the bumper export crops 
on which economic recovery depends 
at the same time mrs chamorro came under attack from her own 
vice president virgilio godoy and the private sector the 
president they charged was buckling under sandinista pressure 
faced with chaos in the streets mrs chamorro settled the 
strike by giving in to many of the leftist demands and faced with 
revolt in the conservative ranks she appealed for a national 
policy dialogue 
the sandinistas claimed victory 
workers have achieved ratification of union participation in 
the decisions that affect the economic life of the country 
barricada claimed 
former president daniel ortega was blunt 
one must deal with sandinismo with the revolution to have 
stability in this country he said 
after mrs chamorros landslide victory in the feb 25 
elections ortega vowed the sandinistas would govern from below 
to block any attempt to dismantle more than a decade of 
revolutionary policy 
mrs chamorro had said she would privatize stateowned 
businesses return farmland confiscated after the 1979 revolution 
and trim the 65000person state payroll 
most of those plans were changed by concessions she made in the 
two strikes 
presidential advisers say that before the sandinistas left power 
they prepared the ground for future conflicts with the government 
the sandinistas who control two of the nations three daily 
newspapers and twothirds of its radio stations armed tens of 
thousands of people urging them to defend the conquests of the 
revolution 
they passed laws legalizing strikes and guaranteeing the jobs of 
thousands of public sector workers 
they also stopped currency devaluations a longstanding feature 
of nicaraguan life at the same time the amount of money in 
circulation rose sharply central bank records show 
when mrs chamorro took office she inherited a bankrupt 
government a nearly worthless currency and a huge payroll her 
government has since devalued the cordoba more than 20 times and 
plans to issue a new currency on par with the dollar

scientists are tackling the problems of growing 
old and finding some success helping frail flabby bodies become 
youthful again 
theres no cure for old age but scientists are developing the 
next best thing therapies that can forestall and even reverse some 
of the most disabling and disturbing effects of the inevitable 
there has been just a remarkable increase in interest at long 
last in the problems of older people said dr reubin andres an 
aging expert at johns hopkins university its a hopeful time 
that we are living in a lot of advances are being made but that 
doesnt mean that we have the youth pill 
while indeed none is exactly a youth pill scientists reported 
three discoveries in the past month that could help make growing 
old just a little easier 
the most dramatic announcement was the effects of human growth 
hormone which spurs the body to make muscle six months of 
injections wiped 20 years off elderly recipients sagging physiques 
doctors cautioned that they dont yet know how many people could 
benefit but if the hormone works as well as they hope it could 
give many the strength to keep walking and fending for themselves 
well into old age 
another team demonstrated that the prescription medicine 
etidronate can strengthen aging spines it stops and even reverses 
the gradual loss of backbone this sharply reduces the risk of 
crushed vertebrae a common and painful condition especially common 
among elderly women that results in stooped posture 
taking an entirely different tack a group of doctors showed 
that even nursing home patients in their 90s can build up their 
muscles through regular exercise 
it was just coincidence that the reports came out at the same 
time but the three studies share an important theme of geriatric 
care all are steps toward helping folks stay active mobile and 
independent into old age 
the need for this research is obvious growing old is a growing 
problem the census bureau estimates that by the year 2030 when 
baby boomers hit their senior years there will be 66 million 
americans over age 65 2 times more than 1980 
certainly even the most optimistic scientific seers do not 
expect to conquer death any time soon the human body is simply 
built to wear out beyond gray hair and wrinkles eyesight dims 
balance fails muscles turn to flab but these breakdowns are not 
quite so certain as they once seemed 
the general attitude has been that aging is a genetically 
programmed cellular event determined when you are born said 
dr seymour reichlin chief of endocrinology at new england medical 
center 
its programmed so that cells die at a certain rate and there 
you are he said the data with growth hormone raises the issue 
of whether some of the aging process is not genetically programmed 
or perhaps the program can be changed 
hormones in fact are one of the hottest areas of aging 
research the body generates lots of these proteins to regulate 
growth and other chores in the fourth decade of life and beyond 
much of this production begins to taper off so scientist are 
asking why not put them back 
hormone replacement is nothing new doctors have long advised 
women to take estrogen supplements to keep them healthy after their 
bodies slow the natural production of this sex hormone following 
menopause but now scientists are looking into keeping the body 
youthful with other varieties 
among the possibilities 
testosterone this is the major male sex hormone many men lose 
its production when they get old restoring it could help them 
build up muscle and regain lost sex drive 
somatomedin c human growth hormone stimulates the body to make 
this protein which in turn promotes muscle production 
blood cell growth factors the body produces a host of these 
hormones to stimulate the production of white blood cells that 
guard against cancer and infection finetuning these hormones may 
keep people healthier in old age 
nerve cell growth factors in theory at least these proteins 
might help the body replace brain cells that are destroyed by 
alzheimers disease or lost through the natural wear and tear of 
aging 
dr evan hadley chief of the geriatrics branch of the national 
institute on aging and others believe even more ills of aging will 
soon be controlled if not cured 
i am very hopeful he said there is a real possibility of 
significantly reducing the problems of physical frailty in old age 
over the next decade

mikhail s gorbachev has succeeded in reshaping 
the communist party in his own centrist image to brace for a 
challenge from workers and radicals who are quitting the party to 
organize an opposition 
the 28th congress of the communist party billed in advance as a 
bastion of hardliners closed friday after dumping most of the old 
guard the delegates also accepted much of gorbachevs plan to 
transfer decisionmaking from the party to the government which 
he also heads 
but the government faces increasing discontent especially among 
workers as well as ethnic unrest that is shredding the country at 
the edges 
the struggle intensified wednesday when coal miners across the 
country staged a oneday protest strike and urged workers to leave 
the party 
the miners also are organizing an independent trade union to 
press demands that the government resign and that all communist 
party assets be nationalized and distributed to rival political 
groups 
disgruntled workers might flock to the banner of boris n 
yeltsin who sent a shock through the kremlin thursday by walking 
out of the communist congress quitting the party he said his 
first loyalty was to his new job president of russia by far the 
largest of the 15 soviet republics 
other leading reformers followed yeltsin out of the party 
including the new mayors of moscow and leningrad the biggest 
soviet cities 
despite the split in the party the first since 1921 gorbachev 
was jovial friday as he closed the twoweek communist congress 
which many had predicted would be dominated by hardliners 
instead gorbachev scored a sweeping victory removing his 
leading hardline critic yegor k ligachev from the politburo he 
also won approval of a restructuring of top party bodies to 
transfer power to the government 
the danger for gorbachev is that central authorities could lose 
touch with the people 
the people in turn are using gorbachevs democratic reforms to 
win control of legislatures throughout the country and challenge 
central government and party bodies 
the atmosphere was tense in moscow before the national party 
congress because it followed harsh criticism of gorbachevs 
performance by traditionalists at a congress of party members in 
the russian republic 
ligachev led the attack urging gorbachev to relinquish the top 
party job if he retained the national presidency 
ligachev complained that the party politburo the body that 
traditionally has ruled the soviet union had been excluded from 
discussions of economic reform gorbachev had instead steered the 
program through the newly created presidential council 
the mood was so foreboding that yeltsin and other reformers 
recommended postponing the national congress 
but the workers and reformers took the offensive nine minutes 
into the first session miner vladimir i bludov demanded that 
gorbachev and other leaders resign 
gorbachev brushed aside the suggestion noting that the congress 
was due to elect the general secretary the politburo and the 
central committee 
he also told delegates that senior party leaders opposed his 
proposal to expand the politburo from 12 to 30 members and to 
create a new deputy party leaders post to direct daydayaffairs 
the congress was the stormiest since 1921 when the party faced 
armed uprisings from angry workers and sailors and the most 
momentous since 1956 when nikita s khrushchev denounced the late 
dictator josef v stalin 
the warmest applause was for ligachevs warning that 
anticommunist forces were gaining strength but his tone was 
milder than at the russian communist party congress and he did not 
repeat his call for gorbachev to relinquish the party leadership 
other hardliners tempered their rhetoric and together with 
moderates drew together under gorbachev many said that although 
they objected to one man heading the party and the government 
simultaneously he was the only person capable of holding the party 
together 
gorbachev engineered his election as chairman of the committee 
drafting new party rules working behind the scenes he revived his 
plans to restructure the party leadership 
the congress voted to expand the central committee from 249 to 
412 members most of them centrists like gorbachev 
the delegates also approved a gorbachev plan that drastically 
cut the politburos power doubling its size and including the 
party heads of the 15 republics a move designed to ease ethnic 
tension 
moreover he eliminated the old guard of the 24 politburo 
members only gorbachev and his newly elected deputy vladimir 
ivashko remain from the former group only gorbachev has been a 
member of the body more than eight months

abortion activists in at least three states are taking their 
fight directly to the people with initiative petition drives 
designed to steer around the opposition of elected officials 
the initiative campaigns reflect a nationwide trend toward 
direct voter involvement in hotly disputed issues and a 
frustration on the part of abortion activists with the pace of 
change 
antiabortion forces appear to have gathered enough signatures 
for two ballot initiatives in oregon and for a legislative 
initiative in michigan that gives legislators another chance to 
pass abortion restrictions that had been vetoed by the governor 
in nevada prochoice forces have succeeded in getting an 
abortion rights measure on the november ballot 
other abortionrelated initiative drives were mounted this year 
in oklahoma colorado missouri and washington but all but 
washingtons appear to be dead or dying 
prochoice forces are still collecting signatures in washington 
for an initiative designed to ensure that abortion remains legal 
even if the us supreme court overturns roe vs wade the ruling 
that legalized abortion 
abortionrelated initiatives have become an increasingly popular 
tactic in the 17 years since roe vs wade there have been 11 such 
initiatives since 1973 including four in 1986 and three in 1988 
its accelerating said patrick b mcguigan who studies 
voter initiatives for the free congress research and education 
foundation in washington thats hardly surprising he added given 
the volatility of the issue and the general growth of initiatives 
as a political tool 
antiabortion forces lost all four battles in 1986 and won all 
three in 1988 this year mcguigan said i think you can expect 
mixed results 
both sides in the abortion battle say they would prefer to gain 
their victories in the legislatures but in some cases they say 
the initiative is the best tool 
our basic perspective said burke balch of the national 
right to life committee is that in general we resort to 
initiatives and referenda only as a last resort 
that reasoning prompted antiabortion forces in oregon where 
the legislature leans strongly toward abortion rights to mount 
petition drives to place two initiatives on the november ballot 
one would outlaw abortion except in cases of rape or incest or 
to save a womans life the other requires a parent to be notified 
of a minors abortion 48 hours in advance 
backers of the initiatives already have filed what they believe 
are enough signatures to qualify for the ballot state officials 
are in the process of checking the signatures to verify them 
in michigan antiabortion activists seized on the initiative as 
a way of foiling gov james blanchard who vetoed a parental 
consent bill earlier this year 
right to life of michigan has filed petitions bearing 333187 
signatures about 140000 more than are required 
if enough signatures are valid the parental consent issue would 
go back to the legislature this fall if it passes blanchard would 
not be allowed to veto it if it loses the issue will be put 
before voters probably in november 1992 
in washington where the initiative system is similar 
signatures are due by jan 3 
the nevada initiative which has already qualified for the 
ballot would bar state legislators from changing the states 
existing abortion law 
in colorado an antiabortion initiative campaign was set back 
earlier this month when the state supreme court found that it was 
not clearly drafted and ordered it rewritten 
effectively this blows us out of the water said william l 
woodley president of the coalition for your right to know which 
sponsored the parental consent measure 
in missouri an abortion rights group said last week that it 
would fall short of the number of signatures needed to place a 
constitutional amendment on the ballot the measure would have 
repealed the restrictive abortion law that the us supreme court 
upheld last year in its webster vs reproductive health services 
ruling 
in oklahoma a group of baptist ministers is backing a petition 
drive that would allow voters to decide whether to outlaw abortions 
except in cases of rape incest or fetal deformity or when the 
mother is at risk 
however even if the sponsors collect enough signatures 
abortion rights activists have already said they would file suit 
against the measure and it appears likely to be delayed beyond the 
november election

andrew young long ago learned the art of the 
colorblind appeal its the way he won white support in his 
successful races for congress and for mayor of atlanta and its 
the way hes trying to become the first black governor of georgia 
how well the strategy is working will be shown by tuesdays 
democratic primary but some black supporters wonder if young has 
erred in ignoring his strength the black vote that nearly everyone 
has presumed to be his 
i think some of his advisers have cautioned him to do that 
to concentrate on the white vote play it lowkey with the black 
vote said the rev joseph lowery president of the southern 
christian leadership conference and a staunch young supporter 
if thats his strategy i think its a mistake lowery said 
i think youve got to stir up what youve got and what hes 
got is the potential at least guaranteed to make the runoff if 
he turns out the black vote 
young is among five democratic candidates running in tuesdays 
primary georgia requires an aug 7 runoff between the top two 
votegetters if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the 
vote in the primary 
a poll in saturdays editions of the atlanta 
journalconstitution showed lt gov zell miller was favored by 36 
percent of the likely democratic voters surveyed with young 
favored by 30 percent and the other three contenders trailing far 
behind the telephone survey of 829 people had a margin of error of 
3 percentage points 
a black macon minister the rev ed smith raised questions 
about youngs campaign at a meeting with the candidate earlier this 
summer 
one of the concerns ive heard is youre taking the black vote 
for granted smith told young that is a concern in the black 
community 
the concern stems in part from youngs public campaign it began 
not with the offthecuff folksy stump speech hes so good at but 
with a formal address taped before an invitationonly crowd in an 
atlanta tv studio 
youngs tv ads steadyashegoes pieces which could come from 
a politics 101 textbook pointedly show him shaking hands with a 
white supporter in elberton talking to a white cop and a black cop 
in augusta strolling through an integrated classroom of kids in 
atlanta 
some days those spots have been the total of youngs public 
campaign other candidates summon the press on a sometimes daily 
basis youngs campaign has at times told reporters that his 
media representatives cant be reached and taken more than a week 
to fill requests for the candidates schedule 
the last wouldbe historymaker to campaign in georgia 1988 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson made a staple of 
fiery emotional speeches to black congregations young is more 
likely to be found preaching his gospel of economic growth to a 
white civic club crowd 
young needs to have at least some support from white voters 
only about 25 percent of the votingage population in georgia is 
black and he needs twice that to garner the democratic nomination 
on a recent sunday the rev jasper williams blasted young from 
the pulpit at atlantas predominantly black salem baptist church 
he criticized young for not supporting the poor the jackson 
campaign or a popular but controversial black atlanta police 
official deputy chief eldrin bell 
ive not seen nothing hes done for us nada williams said 
and with bell looking on williams gave a hug to youngs chief 
rival miller who has traditionally enjoyed black support 
statewide albeit without having to face a top black candidate like 
young 
the young camp dismissed the criticism from williams were 
not going to spend a lot of time responding to one guy said 
spokesman nehl horton 
indeed the young campaign has taken steps to get out the black 
vote one fulltime staffers chief duty is to serve as liaison to 
black preachers and the campaign counts ministers from more than 
1000 churches among its supporters 
out goal is to get out our vote andys supporters from 
across the state said deputy campaign manager marian jones 
one of the key areas in contacting these voters will be through 
the churches 
at cascade we do it every sunday said lowery pastor of 
atlantas cascade united methodist church we encourage people to 
be good citizens get out and vote 
young has overwhelming support among black minsters and black 
church people lowery said 
here in savannah you cant find a black preacher who does not 
support andy young said the rev bennie mitchell of the savannah 
interdenominational ministerial alliance 
about the only overt injection of race into the campaign has 
come through what the young camp says was a mistake a hired 
telemarketing firm was telling voters they should support young in 
order to keep lester maddox the avowed segregationist from the 
1960s from becoming governor again 
in truth maddox is a distant fifth in the latest polls and few 
people other than the ebullient former governor have given him a 
chance 
maddox blasted young for the dastardly act of bringing race 
into the campaign young who maintained he had no knowledge of the 
antimaddox calls fired the marketing firm

a senior government minister resigned saturday 
two days after a magazine published an interview in which he 
accused germany of trying to take over europe and called the french 
obedient poodles to the germans 
trade and industry secretary nicholas ridley had retracted the 
comments thursday but the interview provoked outrage in his own 
conservative party as well as from the labor party and other 
opposition groups a spokesman for west german chancellor helmut 
kohl had said he was not amused 
the chainsmoking blunttalking ridley was one of prime 
minister margaret thatchers closest allies and an architect of her 
programs to sell governmentowned industries 
personally i shall greatly miss your loyal support for the 
policies we both believe in so deeply mrs thatcher said in a 
letter to ridley an ideological soulmate who had been a member of 
her cabinet since 1983 
she appointed peter lilley to replace ridley 
in an interview published in the spectator magazine ridley said 
plans for a european monetary union is all a german racket 
designed to take over the whole of europe it has to be thwarted 
this rushed takeover by the germans on the worst possible basis 
with the french behaving like poodles to the germans is absolutely 
intolerable 
he also condemned the breathtaking arrogance of a european 
community run by 17 unelected reject politicians 
im not against giving up sovereignty in principle but not to 
this lot you might just as well give it to adolf hitler 
frankly ridley said 
ridley was leading a trade mission in budapest when the 
controversy erupted and issued a short statement saying he withdrew 
his remarks 
in his resignation letter ridley again lashed out at plans for 
a european monetary union 
nothing but harm will come from trying to force europe into 
the straightjacket of a single currency with economic policy 
decided by people who are not accountable to the electors and 
taxpayers it would result in economic domination by the country 
with the strongest currency in the community 
but i recognize the difficulties which my failure to use more 
measured words have caused and in the circumstances i think it 
would be best if i now left the government he wrote 
ridley also wrote in particular i deeply resent the journals 
assertion that i associate presentday germany with the aggression 
of the past i do not hold that view 
his departure leaves mrs thatcher more isolated than she has 
been since she took office in 1979 wrote anthony bevins 
political editor of the independent newspaper so much so that it 
is wellnigh impossible to identify anyone in cabinet who now 
totally supports her antieuropean community sentiments 
polls comissioned by three sunday newspapers in london found a 
majority or plurality in favor of ridleys departure 53 percent in 
the sunday telegraph 52 percent in the correspondent and 48 
percent in the sunday times 
however the sunday telegraphs gallup poll based on interviews 
with 514 adults found conservatives evenly split 45 percent 
either way on whether ridley should stay or go 
respondents also rejected ridleys claim that monetary union was 
a german racket 68 percent disagreed in the sunday telegraph 
and 59 percent in the sunday times poll by the mori polling 
organization

dear margaret 
in view of the controversy aroused by the publication of an 
article in the spectator this week i think that now is the time 
for me to leave your government since i have already made clear to 
you that i had decided not to contest the next election 
i would rather have expressed my views about the future of 
europe directly and at a time of my own choosing in particular i 
deeply resent the journals assertion that i associate present day 
germany with the aggression of the past i do not hold that view 
nevertheless i believe that the proposal of the european 
commission for economic and monetary union in the community would 
be a disaster both for great britain and for the wider europe in 
which i passionately believe it would be heartless after fifty 
years of subjugation for the community to exclude the nations of 
eastern europe from participating in the european single market 
the opportunities must be open for the nations of the european free 
trade area to join all the nations of europe should be free to 
maintain their own political economic and national identities 
while enjoying the benefits of a free and fair trade 
great benefit will come to all from the completion of the single 
market free from internal barriers subsidies and restrictions 
trading openly with the rest of the world nothing but harm will 
come from trying to force them into the straightjacket of a single 
currency with economic policy decided by people who are not 
accountable to the electors and taxpayers it would result in 
economic domination by the country with the strongest currency in 
the community 
i believe that the views which i have expressed in this letter 
are very much in line with those of the government but i recognize 
the difficulties which my failure to use more measured words have 
caused and in the circumstances i think it would be best if i now 
left the government 
it has been a privilege and honor for me to have served you for 
the last eleven years you have achieved so much i wish to place 
on record my admiration for the transformation in the fortunes and 
selfconfidence of our country which you have wrought i will 
continue to support you in your essential further work on the 
nations behalf over many years ahead 
yours ever

mount bakersnoqualmie national forest had either been put out or 
were under attack they totaled less than 60 acres 
in wyoming firefighters battled yellowstone national parks 
12th small fire of the year 
the oregon fire named delicious had been contained at 600 
acres friday but late afternoon wind carried embers across a fire 
line and the flames spread quickly said doug decker of the oregon 
department of forestry 
there were 400 people on the fire lines saturday he said 
decker said no homes were in immediate danger from the fire 
about six miles south of sisters but firefighters were keeping

an estimated 50 million abortions half of 
them illegal are performed around the world each year and as many 
as 200000 women die from them according to a study released 
saturday 
the worldwatch institute said in its report that restrictions on 
pregnancy termination dont curb abortion rates they only cause 
more deaths most of them in third world countries 
but a spokesman for the nations leading antiabortion group 
denounced the report as a very polemic document lacking 
independent research 
its a little propaganda booklet said douglas johnson 
legislative director for national right to life 
the worldwatch institute an independent research group funded 
by private foundations and united nations organizations said the 
number of deaths from illegal abortions could be far higher than 
its statistics show because many go unreported and accurate figures 
from developing countries are difficult to obtain 
a moral smoke screen effectively obscures the huge public 
policy health human rights and social costs of restrictive 
abortion policies said the study entitled the global politics 
of abortion 
the author jodi l jacobson said the best way to reduce the 
number of abortions and related deaths is to make abortion a 
legitimate family planning component instead of making it a 
crime 
she said the rate of abortion has dropped quickest in countries 
where legalized abortion has been included in family planning 
programs 
but johnson disputed that saying all of the empirical 
evidence is on the other side 
in every nation thats legalized abortion you get a vastly 
greater number of abortions thats true in the united states he 
said adding that the number of abortions in the us have doubled 
since 1974 a year earlier the supreme court struck down state 
laws making abortions illegal 
the study said available data shows that in nations where 
abortion is legal pregnancy termination ranks fourth among the 
types of birth control after female sterilization intrauterine 
devices and oral contraceptives 
it said in countries where contraception methods are inadequate 
either because of supply religious or informational reasons 
abortion in the most popular method of birth control 
in developed nations abortion rates tend to be higher among 
teenagers and women aged 20 to 24 who want to delay childbearing 
for various reasons the report said 
abortion rates in most developing countries are highest among 
married women with several children who have no means of preventing 
additional unwanted pregnancies according to the study 
most women live in countries where blanket bans on abortion have 
been eased the study found that 75 percent of the worldss 
population is governed by laws that allow abortion on medical 
andor social and economic grounds 
women with little or no access to abortion facilities are most 
likely to live in africa latin america or moslem asia where they 
also have least access to safe contraception the study said 
johnson said the report advocates replacing illegal abortions 
with legal ones but in doing so youre just changing the 
complexion of the abortions 
also he said the report advocates use of abortion as a method 
of birth control which he said a majority of americans oppose

students in the soviet union will be able 
to get a diploma that epitomizes capitalism the master of 
business administration degree under a program clemson university 
is setting up in moscow officials said saturday 
officials from clemson and the soviet education ministry plan to 
sign an agreement sunday calling for the school to develop am 
mba program in moscow 
with the rapid changes both in the soviet union and europe 
they feel they need mbas who understand usstyle 
management said ryan amacher dean of clemsons college of 
commerce and industry 
were excited to be the initial degreemaking institution 
he said satuday in 10 years wed like to have 500 clemson 
mbas in the soviet union 
the program could begin as early as next year he said 
the agreement calls for a new group called the consortium of 
universities for international business studies to develop 
finance and operate the institute for international business 
studiessoviet union clemson heads the group of universities 
the consortium will provide faculty for an mba program and 
also offer nondegree managerial training through the institute in 
the soviet union 
in addition the consortium will encourage trade between the 
united states and the soviet union and facilitate cultural and 
academic exchanges between the two countries 
this is just the opening of a door which could eventually lead 
to a number of educational and research partnerships with the 
soviets amacher said 
an international business group called investment services 
will fund the program with money derived from business ventures 
within the soviet union 
amacher said the parisbased business group includes several 
international corporations the group wants ustrained soviet 
business leaders who can help with the expansion of trade between 
the soviet union and other countries amacher said 
plans call for the mba program to begin no later than 1992 
with some prerequisite courses offered in the fall of 1991 
professors would be selected by the consortium and would spend at 
least one semester in moscow 
clemson would benefit by having some of its professors and 
students travel to moscow for classes amacher said however 
american students would make up no more than 20 percent of the 
total enrollment he said 
the degree requirements will be identical to those of the mba 
program in clemson and all classes will be taught in english he 
said 
clemson organized the consortium after it became apparent the 
university did not have enough faculty members to run the moscow 
program without hurting at home amacher said 
other universities in the consortium are georgia florida state 
and mississippi state and amacher said it is hoped more will join 
the others also will have a chance to send students and faculty 
members to moscow and could eventually offer degree programs 
amacher said 
most students will be able to complete the degree requirements 
in two years he said

the outbreak of violence between mohawk indians 
and police over a white mans golf course is rooted in a dispute 
more than two centuries old and is symptomatic of rising native 
disgruntlement across canada 
if you continue to push people to a limit and the federal 
government continues to ignore their issues yes they will 
retaliate said matthew cooncome grand chief of the james bay 
cree indians 
for many indians on canadian reserves life is a continuous 
struggle against poverty alcoholism poor health services 
nonexistent plumbing primitive sewage disposal and poor drinking 
water death by injury or poisoning is quadruple the rate for the 
rest of canada and life expectancy is nine years less than that of 
a white canadian 
many indians on reserves want selfgovernment with the land and 
resources to give them a viable economy and an opportunity to 
improve their living conditions 
the underlying issue in the mohawk dispute is to try to 
settle land claims cooncome said his cree indians are fighting 
to stop further hydroelectric development in their vast northern 
quebec homeland they have been pushed back to the wall 
shooting broke out wednesday when police moved in to remove a 
roadblock set up by mohawks at oka about 20 miles west of 
montreal a police officer was shot to death in the confrontation 
but it is still unclear if he was shot by indians or a fellow 
police officer 
the mohawks had set up the roadblock to stop the municipality of 
oka from expanding a golf course to include land the indians claim 
robert mainville a lawyer whose firm represents indian bands 
across canada blamed inaction by the federal government for the 
violence 
you have this little municipality dialoguing with natives 
instead of the federal government and some policeman has to get 
killed over a ninehole golf course mainville said 
what is happening in oka is only symptomatic he said 
there is no doubt in my mind that the native population has 
undergone a major shift in philosophy and a major shift in 
approach violence is going to be seen more and more as an 
alternative particularly among young people 
there is a very very deep sense of frustration among the 
young indians of canada basically they feel they are being 
shortchanged they want action and they are not seeing any on the 
part of the federal government 
there are about 450000 registered indians in canada and 33000 
eskimos their 2234 reserves cover 64 million acres 
a renewed sense of pride emerged for many last month when 
manitoba legislator elijah harper a cree indian helped defeat a 
constitutional amendment that would have recognized quebec as a 
distinct society 
harper and other indians said canadian indians also have a 
distinct society but they are not mentioned in the constitution 
holding an eagle feather in his hand harper solemnly said no 
each time manitoba premier gary filmon tried to introduce the 
measure into the provincial legislature for ratification 
the measure failed when newfoundland premier clyde wells refused 
to bring it to a vote but harpers action helped contribute to its 
defeat 
for the first time the native population saw they had a 
chance to show real political muscle mainville said its the 
only time they have ever had the opportunity to do that in canada 
in canada as in the united states indians were regularly 
pushed from their land by white settlers and sometimes cheated out 
of land in treaties and agreements with the government or business 
indian bands in canada have filed dozens of land claims with 
federal and provincial governments 
as the mohawks confronted civil authorities oka the haida of 
british columbia protested what they said was a violation of their 
fisheries management plan by several commercial sport fishing 
lodges and in the northwest territories the dene were considering 
a proposed land agreement involving 500 million

thousands of broadcast workers defied 
a government warning and walked off the job saturday to protest 
legislation the opposition said would tighten the ruling partys 
grip on the industry 
the opposition said the bills will effectively allow the 
government to control ownership of networks and censor programming 
ahead of the 1991 national elections 
government officials denied any political motive for the 
legislation and argued the industry must be reorganized to 
introduce new programming private stations and more channels 
about 70 opposition lawmakers staged a sitdown protest at the 
national assembly after the governmentsponsored bills passed in a 
turbulent session marked by pushing and shouts of angry opposition 
lawmakers 
dissidents and union leaders urged a campaign to topple the 
government of president roh taewoo whose government they said 
rammed the legislation through parliament 
more than 6000 workers at the nations radio and television 
stations responded to the vote by walking off the job but the 
government warned it would not sit idly by 
in a joint statement broadcast network unions urged a campaign 
to dissolve the legislature and the governing party the assembly 
must be dissolved immediately because it lost the right to exist 
it said 
union leaders planned a protest rally monday 
rohs opponents said the government has been seeking 
constitutional and political changes to prolong power since the 
january merger of the governing party with two minor opposition 
groups 
hundreds of riot police were deployed outside kbs the largest 
staterun network in april riot police stormed the network to end 
a 19day strike 
news and other programs were shortened canceled or replaced 
with old tapes it was the first strike affecting all radio and 
television stations 
workers also left their jobs at the smaller christian broadcast 
service network and the catholicrun pyonghwa broadcasting co 
the government will not sit idly by if the current situation 
grows worse and is thought to have a bad effect on the nation 
said information minister choe byungyul 
choe accused network unions of staging unjustifiable political 
protests to protect their own interests 
the bills were passed quickly saturday opposition members 
blocked the speaker from entering the assembly then and vice 
speaker kim jaekwang surrounded by about 40 ruling legislators 
rushed to the speakers podium and read a list of 26 bills for 
passage in 30 seconds 
is there any opposition kim asked no answered ruling 
party lawmakers drowning out the opposition and effectively 
passing the legislation 
one lawmaker ran across tops of desks shouting fraud other 
opposition members pushed shoved and scuffled with ruling party 
lawmakers

nowhere does the threat of the zodiac gunman 
loom larger than in the workingclass neighborhood where the latest 
in a long line of mad city criminals claimed his first three 
victims 
i worry about my husband when he leaves i wonder will he 
come back alive again said bernice leach who lives on the 
street where the zodiac gunman shot his second victim on march 29 
the shootings have sparked the citys largest manhunt since the 
search for son of sam serial killer david berkowitz in the late 
1970s despite the small number of victims some new yorkers are 
genuinely worried about the killer in their midst and the 
probability he will strike again 
no neighborhood has felt the gunmans presence more keenly than 
the adjoining areas of woodhaven in the queens borough and east new 
york in brooklyn where the gunman struck three times in a 
sixblock stretch 
latenight travelers who use the subway are being met by 
friends redbereted guardian angels patrol the streets people 
call police if they see a stranger fitting zodiacs description 
a young man on crutches who gave his name only as greg seemed 
angry but resigned about the shootings if he comes back he 
comes back what are you going to do he asked 
greg leaned on his crutches and looked behind him people 
aint going to be sleeping on the dude no more theyre aware 
now he said 
the zodiac has preyed on the defenseless two victims walked 
with canes one was inebriated and the last was a homeless man 
asleep on a central park bench 
the zodiac gunman has vowed in six letters sent to police and 
news media that he will shoot 12 people one for each astrological 
sign the shooter believed to be a male has wounded three people 
and killed one 
the name he uses in his letters was taken from a killer who 
plagued the san francisco area about 20 years ago 
a massive citywide dragnet dubbed operation watchdog and 
involving more than 200 detectives failed to catch the gunman 
early thursday police had theorized that if the gunman followed 
his deadly pattern he would attack before dawn 
thursday was the 21st day since the zodiacs last shooting 
three of the shootings had been spaced 21 days apart a fourth 
shooting was 63 days apart from the others a multiple of 21 
detectives also were checking the fingerprints of all newly 
arrested crime suspects against a partial print found on the letter 
he left in central park after his last attack the new york daily 
news reported saturday 
so far detectives have failed to match that fingerprint with 
any prints filed in local and federal computer databanks 
in the woodhaven and east new york areas dozens of detectives 
patrolled in unmarked cars early thursday joined by anxious posses 
of citizens they all sought a suspect described as a black man in 
his 30s with a mustache and a receding hairline 
chief joseph borrelli who helped lead the son of sam 
investigation seemed weary but determined after spending thursday 
night directing the dragnet 
if you believe the psychologists they always say serial 
killers want to get caught borrelli said i dont think he 
wants to be caught he might have read in the paper that we were 
beefing up we may have deterred him 
the chief added just because hes got no formal education 
doesnt mean hes stupid

a man who received the states stiffest 
sentence for stealing sea turtle eggs was back in jail saturday 
after dropping a knapsack containing 127 eggs authorities said 
alvin george keel 46 gave an alias when he was arrested 
friday something he has done in the past to keep police from 
linking him to turtle egg poaching cases officials said 
but an officer involved in keels arrest last year recognized 
him after his latest arrest spoiling the alias ruse 
keel was held on 500 bail saturday on charges of disturbing 
marine turtle eggs resisting arrest without violence and 
obstructing officers said police officer craig gunkel 
gunkel said he expected the case to be turned over to the us 
fish and wildlife service because of harsher sentences possible 
under federal wildlife protection laws 
a resident called police friday to report she saw someone 
digging in the beach sand in this tony resort town when officers 
tried to question keel he dropped the knapsack and ran gunkel 
said 
about 30 eggs spilled from the pack and the officers gave 
chase after catching him investigators found keels boot prints 
around four disturbed turtle nests 
four state and local agencies last year charged keel with 12 
counts after arresting him four times for pilfering 582 eggs during 
the 1989 nesting season which runs from may through august 
keel who authorities believe to be a major supplier for the 
turtle egg black market pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year 
in jail a year on probation and a fine of 11250 
the eggs considered by some to be aphrodisiacs are laid at 
night on the beaches of south florida by several endangered species 
of turtle 
sgt kenneth parramore of the state game and fresh water fish 
commission said at the time he expected the jail term to keep keel 
behind bars for most of the 1990 nesting season but keel was 
released from the palm beach county stockade may 23 after time off 
for good behavior 
i thought he was still in jail when they caught him 
parramore said on saturday the last two years he seemed to be 
the major player hes been caught five times now in two summers

prime minister vp singh offered to 
step down saturday saying he had lost the peoples confidence but 
leaders of the governing party tried to persuade him to remain at 
his post 
singh has been beset by party infighting brought to a head by 
the resignations of three cabinet ministers on friday and six 
junior ministers on saturday they were protesting a power play 
involving the deputy prime ministers efforts to maintain his 
familys power in haryana state 
the issue has split singhs janata dal party and highlighted the 
feuds within the political alliance that ousted rajiv gandhi in 
november elections 
in his letter of resignation singh asked his janata dal party 
to chose a new leader to replace him 
he met the partys top leaders at his official residence late 
into the night but officials said the talks were inconclusive 
results of the meeting were not expected to be made public until 
sunday 
as the talks extended past midnight jaipal reddy the partys 
general secretary said singh had not yet retracted the resignation 
letter he had sent to the partys president sommappa rayappa 
bommai 
earlier bommai said he thought the resignation would be 
rejected 
the party is united the government will continue bommai 
said before convening the latenight meeting between singh and the 
partys decisionmaking body 
i hope i am confident there will be no occasion to elect a 
new leader 
singh who took office seven months ago said in his resignation 
letter that he had lost the trust of the people and the parties 
that make up his minority national front coalition government 
the opposition congress party dismissed the political crisis as 
a fraud 
frankly i think its a hoax if the prime minister really 
wanted to resign he should have done the logical thing and gone to 
the president of india said congress party spokesman mj akbar 
its a joke on the people of india 
had singh sent his letter of resignation to president ramaswamy 
venkataraman it could have opened the way for former prime 
minister rajiv gandhi of the congress party to form a new 
government or for elections 
critics charge that singhs efforts to hold his party together 
have diluted his efforts to tackle problems such as rising food 
and gasoline prices and separatist revolts by sikhs in punjab and 
moslems in kashmir 
nearly 1400 people have been killed by sikh extremists this 
year including 11 on saturday eight of those killed saturday died 
during a foiled attempt to assassinate a senior police officer 
united news of india news agency reported 
seven deaths in kashmir on saturday raised the toll there to 744 
this year six of those killed saturday died when troops found 
their path blocked by a horsecart and opened fire on a jeering 
crowd witnesses said army sources said the troop convoy was 
ambushed 
when singhs party ousted gandhi in elections last year it 
campaigned on an anticorruption ticket the congress party has 
been out of power only three years since india became independent 
from britain in 1947 
singh assembled a government based on a fiveparty minority 
coalition that relied on the support of communists and hindu 
rightwingers the only common ground has been antipathy to the 
congress party 
the political crisis was precipitated when deputy prime minister 
devi lal an entrenched political patriarch in his native state of 
haryana reinstated his son om prakash chautala as head of the 
local government 
chautala was forced from office in may after 12 people died in 
repeated electoral violence in his constituency one victim was an 
independent candidate for chautalas seat 
in his letter to bommai singh said the rationale of my being 
in the office of the prime minister was the trust of the people of 
the members of the national front and of the supporting parties 
the developments of the last two days have shown that i have 
lost this trust the rationale of my remaining in office is no 
longer there the letter said

sunday is the last day of the annual expedition into the cave to 
root bones out of the sloppy cave floor mud has to be carefully 
troweled from numbered 20inch squares then washed over a screen 
to separate out fragments of bone 
the remains of other animals also have been found in the 
primordial slime of the cave 
its probably the best single time line for ice age life in 
indiana said ron richards the museums curator of paleobiology 
it gives us sort of a history of life in southern indiana over 
the last 30000 years he said every 10 centimeters we dig in 
one cave room takes us back into time as much as 900 years 
richards didnt relish his week in the cave however 
for the most part its cold and damp he said even when 
the temperature outside nears 100 degrees the temperature inside 
seldom climbs above the upper 50s 
they work by the light of kerosene lamps a halfdozen people 
can crowd into the largest room a smaller one holds two or three 
everything you have on is permeated with moisture were 
standing in a couple of inches of water with steam pouring off our 
bodies richards said 
the diggers have found the jaw of a dire wolf now extinct and 
a piece of shell from an ancient tortoise theyve also found 
evidence of arctic shrews plains pocket gophers and rodents 
called yellowcheeked vole 
that shows that it was once a fair amount cooler here he 
said and it shows that at different times there would have been 
grasslands in indiana and prairie 
it will take the museum about a year to identify preserve and 
catalog what was found during the week in the cave some of them 
will be displayed at the indianapolis museum in february richards 
said 
the diggers believe the dire wolf jawbone found in this years 
painstaking work matches another piece of jawbone and a skull found 
last year 
you dig and dig until all of a sudden you hit bone and you 
start pecking around it little by little so you dont damage it 
but you dont know what you have said chip bickley 
finally when you come through to the bone its all worth 
it said bickley who spends the rest of the year working on 
state historic buildings

new government guidelines on art submitted for 
funding through the national endowment for the arts are 
preposterous and dangerous pulitzer prizewinning playwright 
edward albee said saturday 
we are turning into a passive society that wishes to be 
entertained to be taken out of itself to be fed easy truths he 
said simply because you are putting money into the arts doesnt 
mean that you have the right to diminish the arts 
bills to continue the nea are pending in both the house and 
senate and a fight is expected over several proposals to apply 
provisions restricting federal subsidies from going to art that is 
deemed obscene sacrilegious or otherwise offensive 
albee winner of several pulitzer prizes and author of whos 
afraid of virginia woolf spoke to about 200 people at carnegie 
mellon universitys college of fine arts after accepting the 
carnegie mellon commitment to playwriting award 
albee said the atmosphere of the 1960s and the kennedy 
administration fostered creative expression 
the government began pouring millions and hundreds of millions 
of dollars into the arts through the national endowment he said 
artists were willing to live dangerously and go out on a limb 
what is happening today is something we should worry about 
more any art that is safe is dead and any society that will not 
participate in the danger of the arts is a society in great danger 
of going down the drain

a baptist church founded in the 
mountain wilderness 215 years ago will celebrate its anniversary 
sunday with a bear feast to honor the animal that helped keep 
its founders alive 
it wasnt easy for the settlers to bring cows sheep and other 
domestic animals across the allegheny mountains said the rev 
joseph gluck pastor emeritus and historian of the forksofcheat 
baptist church 
thats why the black bear became one of the great sources of 
meat for the people who founded our church gluck said it was 
a staple we eat some every year as a sort of memorial besides 
its a lot of fun 
the church located on a hilltop overlooking the cheat and 
monongahela rivers has been serving bear meat at its annual picnic 
off and on since the late 1700s and each year over the last three 
decades gluck said 
the picnics mark the anniversary of the churchs founding on 
nov 5 1775 the celebration is held in july because we like to 
celebrate while the weather is nice said gluck 75 
beareating is not a johnnycomelately thing at the forks 
said the rev chuck yoke the churchs pastor the church 
founders used native bear meat to stay alive in the winter 
visitors and others eating bear for the first time are eligible 
to become members of the world bear eaters association said 
gluck who has the title of bear master at the church 
i say some magic special indian words tap them on the head 
three times with the magic tooth taken from a west virginia black 
bear and give them a certificate so they can prove to people 
theyve actually eaten bear gluck said 
mostly they just grin and eat it said gluck 
the associations membership is approaching 1500 members with 
representatives from at least 24 states and several foreign 
countries said gluck 
hunters from the eastern counties of west virginia provide the 
hind quarters cooked for the feast gluck said meat from 2yearold 
bears is best because yearlings are too scrawny and meat from 
older bears is tough 
lena nicholson 90 has been cooking bear meat for the feast for 
decades and she said its a daylong task she cuts the bear 
quarters into roasts trims the meat and then boils it in water 
three times 
that bear meat is awful strong and greasy said nicholson 
you have to cook it that much to get down to the good meat 
the meat is then put into a long pan with celery apple and 
onion all over it and put into the oven for several hours 
nicholson said 
i have to open all the windows and the door the smell gets 
pretty strong said nicholson when it comes out it has a little 
bit of a beef taste kind of like a cross between beef and pork 
people seem to like it real well said nicholson theres 
never any left and ive never had anyone complain yet 
gluck said he warns those eating bear for the first time that 
they may notice themselves growling afterward

the case against three teenagers charged with 
raping a jogger in central park has been greatly weakened by the 
governments failure to link the suspects through dna samples a 
defense lawyer said 
an fbi expert testified friday that semen samples taken from the 
body and clothes of the victim an investment banker did not match 
up in dna testing with samples provided by the three defendants 
the only sample that was linked to any of 15 people who 
submitted to the dna testing came from the joggers shorts and 
belonged to her boyfriend said special agent dwight adams of the 
fbis dna analysis unit in dallas 
the 15 who submitted sambles included the defendants the 
boyfriend and potential witnesses at the trial in criminal court 
semen samples taken from the joggers cervix and her sock 
matched each other but did not match the samples of the 
defendants adams testified other samples found at the scene were 
too small to match he said 
it weakens the prosecutions case tremendously it permits us 
to argue our clients had nothing to do with the rape of the central 
park jogger said peter rivera attorney for defendant raymond 
santana 
prosecutors have said that to get a rape conviction they dont 
have to prove the defendants had sex with the jogger only that 
they helped other defendants rape her 
dna testing done through bodily fluids illuminates a genetic 
fingerprint unique to each person 
when the dna tests in this case were first made public during 
pretrial hearings defense lawyers for the three teenagers said 
the results indicated an unidentified person had had sex with the 
jogger 
prosecutors say the woman was gangraped and beaten almost to 
death then left in a ravine near a popular park jogging route 
santana 16 antron mccray 15 and yusef salaam 16 are on 
trial for attempted murder rape sexual abuse assault robbery 
and riot in the attack on the woman and two male joggers 
the woman now 30 survived and returned to work but suffered 
brain damage and has no memory of the attack 
mccray santana and salaam are on trial in an adult court but 
if convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 
10 years in prison 
three other youths are to stand trial on the same charges later 
this year

each year 76yearold gudrun hertsgaard does 
what she can to reduce the national debt 
this year she wrote out a check for 300 leaving the balance 
at roughly 3000000000000 give or take a few dozen billion 
hertsgaard sent her money to the us treasury through citizens 
for a debtfree america a network of people who chip away at the 
national debt a few dollars at a time 
just the interest on the debt this year will approach 200 
billion about 15 percent of the federal budget friends tell 
hertsgaard her annual gestures are futile but she is undismayed 
i tend to think small anyway she said i look at the 
pennies i try not to think of the millions and billions and 
trillions 
nationwide 2345 people contributed more than 42 million in 
the past five years toward retiring the debt including 29 
minnesotans who gave 26301 
hertsgaard started sending money to the federal bureau of the 
public debt in 1986 i started with about 50 increasing every 
year she said i would like to give more its more important 
than anything 
after her first donation she received a letter of thanks from 
the government your donation and interest in the financial 
affairs of our country is appreciated states the letter signed 
by jo ann m kidwell section chief document control and 
distribution section accounting control branch bureau of the 
public debt 
isnt that just like the government hertsgaard said 
she encourages friends to help reduce the debt but few do 
i dont know if its because they dont give much to charity 
in the first place or they just dont believe in this 
but the deficit is so serious she said it puts us at 
such a disadvantage against other countries we arent top drawer 
anymore 
she blames the deficits on a national lack of will 
the defense stuff went way out of balance she said what 
burns me the most is that they dont ever do much about waste and 
then when they do identify something that could be cut somebody 
sends up a howl and it doesnt get done 
prompted by individual contributions congress established the

portauprince haiti ap president ertha pascaltrouillot 
ordered the arrest of a former paramilitary leader whose return 
from exile has worried prodemocracy forces however the leader 
remained free saturday 
the provisional president also brushed aside calls for her 
resignation for her handling of the issue she indicated she would 
not step down until elections set for nov 4 
all of us haitians must unite in order to hold elections that 
will establish a definite government mrs pascaltrouillot said 
in an address televised nationwide friday night 
mrs pascaltrouillot is under pressure to arrest two former 
officials who returned from selfimposed exile last week the two 
are believed to be in the capital portauprince 
roger lafontant who headed the brutal paramilitary police known 
as the tonton macoutes during the deposed duvalier regime returned 
saturday from the dominican republic lafontant was also a minister 
of defense and interior 
the other exofficial william regala is a retired major 
general who was in charge of security during the november 1987 
elections they were aborted after thugs supported by army soldiers 
killed 34 voters at the polls 
he returned from the united states on tuesday 
their return has given rise to fears it would be impossible to 
hold free and fair elections and widened a rift between the 
president and the council of state the 19member council shares 
power with the president and has veto power over her decisions 
mrs pascaltrouillot a former supreme court judge was 
appointed provisional president in march after military ruler lt 
gen prosper avril fled to the united states amid violent 
demonstrations 
a group of political leaders including many council members 
has given mrs trouillots government until monday noon to arrest 
the two officers they have vowed to call for strikes and protests 
to push for her ouster if the arrests are not made 
we want her out we dont trust her said max bourjolly 
leader of the communist party his party and seven others are 
pressuring for her ouster 
mrs pascaltrouillot also is accused of appointing former 
duvalier government officials to the cabinet without the approval 
of the council 
on saturday the us embassy said a 10 million loan has been 
approved for haiti to buy essential imports mainly petroleum 
president bushs administration has linked aid which was cut 
after the november 1987 election massacre to free elections this 
year 
mrs pascaltrouillot said she had ordered police to arrest 
lafontant but there was confusion saturday as to whether the 
warrant was legal by late saturday there were no reports of his 
arrest 
a new warrant for regala had not been issued 
my conclusion is that police dont want to arrest lafontant 
said bayard vincent the government prosecutor who issued the new 
warrant for lafontant two other warrants were issued last week but 
were not served 
military men have ruled haiti since jeanclaude baby doc 
duvalier fled in 1986 to exile in france he took power in 1971 
upon the death of his father francois papa doc duvalier who 
ruled haiti since 1957

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany arrived 
saturday for talks aimed at soothing the kremlins concerns about 
german unification and winning approval for united german 
membership in nato 
earlier in the day president mikhail s gorbachev and nato 
chief manfred woerner skirted the issue of the military allegiance 
of a united germany during talks but woerner expressed confidence 
a solution could be found 
woerner the western alliances highestranking official and 
first nato chief to visit the kremlin said gorbachev accepted an 
invitation to address the group at its brussels headquarters a 
date has not been fixed 
the official soviet news agency tass said that at a meeting 
between woerner and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
both sides had agreed that the nato chiefs visit was a symbol 
that the cold war has ended and europe is entering a new 
period 
shevardnadze later met kohl at a moscow airport tass said kohl 
will hold talks with gorbachev on sunday in stavropol the soviet 
leaders home region 
west german government spokesman hans klein told reporters on 
friday that the visit was in support of progressing the 
twoplusfour talks on the way to achieving a united germany in 
the western alliance 
the questions of germanys military and political obligations 
are being worked out within the framework of twoplusfour 
talks among the two germanys the united states france great 
britain and the soviet union 
woerners visit to moscow follows the july 56 summit by the 
north atlantic treaty organization in london where alliance 
leaders agreed on a new strategy and proposed a nonaggression 
declaration to the sovietled warsaw pact 
there is a clear coincidence in the approach set out by the 
alliance in london and the views of the soviet leadership 
woerner said the hand of friendship has been extended on both 
sides and there is agreement on building a new relationship 
woerner said he told gorbachev and shevardnadze that nato sought 
cooperation with the soviet union and that our alliance does not 
look upon you as an adversary but as a future partner 
but woerner west german defense minister from 1982 until his 
appointment to the top nato job in 1988 said the issue of german 
unity was not discussed 
since my soviet partners didnt raise the issue i didnt 
raise it but i would not draw any conclusion from that at this 
very moment the one which i have drawn is that i am confident we 
will find a solution he said 
woerner said he could understand soviet fears about a united 
germany given the horrifying experience of world war ii 
but he added a membership of a united germany in our alliance 
would increase stability and would not be a threat of any kind to 
the soviet union moscow will lose east germany a cornerstone of 
the warsaw pact once the german states merge it has opposed a 
united germanys membership in nato 
kohl has said he would like the twoplusfour talks to be 
wrapped up in time for allgerman elections in december 
other hurdles remain however including the size of the future 
german army 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said 
saturday the soviet union would receive a binding promise on 
the ceiling for the size of a united german armed forces 
genscher addressing a meeting of his free democratic party in 
zerbst east germany did not specify any figure 
the combined armed forces of the two germanys now number about 
600000 with west germany alone having 480000 troops 
genscher made his remarks shortly before he left for moscow to 
accompany kohl 
west german officials have said that kohl will not offer moscow 
any more money beyond the already promised 3 billion in 
governmentguaranteed bank loans announced last month to help the 
soviet economy shift to a freemarket system 
at last weeks summit in houston leaders of the seven major 
industrial democracies failed to establish a unified approach on 
the soviet aid issue they instead agreed to establish a joint task 
force which would make nonbinding recommendations by the end of 
the year 
west germany has led the way in offering economic assistance to 
the soviets apparently in an effort to gain moscows acceptace of 
rapid german unification

nelson mandela said saturday that he and 
south african president fw de klerk agree a settlement is 
urgently needed to end white minority rule in their nation 
the 71yearold deputy president of the african national 
congress made the comments at a news conference at the end of a 
threeday visit to kenya 
there is an understanding that the longer we delay with a 
settlement the more damage will be done to the country mandela 
said 
mandela who arrived wednesday accompanied by his wife winnie 
spoke before leaving for mozambique the last stop on a sixweek of 
tour of africa europe and north america 
thousands of people welcomed mandela at the airport in maputo 
the mozambican capital where he was greeted by president joaquim 
chissano 
children gave him flower garlands during the welcoming ceremony 
before the mandelas left by motorcade for the city center 
mandela is due to return to johannesburg on tuesday one day 
before his 72nd birthday 
at his nairobi news conference mandela said the anc and 
government would resume negotiations immediately after his return 
the anc is the leading group fighting white rule 
both parties involved are keen on a settlement mandela said 
he said the anc was prepared to deal with threats by white 
rightwing groups opposed to the abolition of the apartheid policy 
of racial discrimination 
but it is not for us here to discuss what we propose doing 
about that threat mandela said but naturally it is a matter 
that involves priority in our thinking in our strategy 
mandela described as genuine but unfounded the fear by some 
white south africans that they would be dominated by blacks when 
majority rule came to the country 
our policy makes it clear that we will not tolerate any form 
of racialism no matter who practices it mandela said 
mandela refused to discuss the kenya governments recent attack 
on supporters of multiparty politics 
six prominent kenyans have been detained without charge in the 
crackdown and at least 28 people were killed in four days of riots 
that began after police used gunfire and tear gas to break up a 
prodemocracy rally 
armed riot troops patrolled the city saturday apparently 
bracing for a possible repeat of last weeks violence 
mandela also refused comment on an open letter from the wives of 
seven prominent kenyan supporters of multiparty politics who either 
have been detained are in hiding or have fled the country to avoid 
arrest 
we are not keen to be involved in the internal affairs of 
kenya mandela said it is up to the people of kenya to decide 
their own affairs 
the wives had asked mandela to intervene with moi on their 
behalf and secure their husbands freedom 
mandela looked well after reportedly suffering a slight case of 
pneumonia and cutting short the ethiopian leg of his trip wednesday 
to seek rest and treatment in kenya

workers erected metal scaffolding saturday to 
shore up a subway tunnel that partially caved in during a blazing 
hot fire and was threatening the collapse of a stretch of downtown 
freeway 
the 1mile stretch of the hollywood freeway was closed for a 
second day because of fears it would collapse under the vibrations 
of cars and trucks 
a 100foot section of a metro rail red line subway tunnel 
adjacent to the freeway collapsed friday when fire raced through 
construction materials inside it 
the subway line is part of a 150mile rail grid planned for los 
angeles mayor tom bradley on saturday inaugurated the first 
stretch of the system a 22mile electric commuter train line 
beteeen downtown los angeles and long beach 
the tunnel blaze broke out shortly before 2 am friday and 
portions still smoldered saturday afternoon 
the cause remained unknown but deputy fire chief ray rojo said 
there were no indications of arson six workers in a nearby tunnel 
smelled smoke when the fire broke out and escaped unharmed damage 
was put at 5 million 
about 250 feet of the tunnel runs under the freeway which is 
part of us highway 101 the portion under the freeway is 
surrounded by an 8footthick band of chemically treated concrete 
or grout the failed portion was not officials said that made all 
the difference the cavein stopped just 10 feet from the freeway 
the chemical grout prevented a cavein said dave roper 
deputy district operations director with the california department 
of transportation the one area that wasnt chemically grouted 
collapsed that tells us something 
traffic chaos reigned on friday and authorities hoped to have 
the freeway open for the monday commute about 250000 vehicles use 
the route daily 
the contractor did not use grout on the section that collapsed 
because it was topped by vacant land roper said in the collapsed 
portions the blaze ate away wood supports and about 16 feet of 
earth and metal framing tumbled down 
timbers that were part of the tunnel support system continued to 
smolder saturday as firefighters let embers burn themselves out 
the tunnels metal ribs stayed intact but some twisted from the 
intense heat of the blaze which hit 1500 degrees 
despite the fire the 13 billion 4mile metro rail system 
which is 18 months behind schedule will open as planned in 
september 1993 said al perdon assistant general manager for 
southern california rapid transit district 
the damaged tunnel is only a spur not the main tube that will 
transport passengers in trains official said even if the damaged 
tunnel isnt fixed in time a parallel tunnel can be used 
temporarily in its place perdon said

the zulu political organization 
inkatha opened its doors to whites saturday as it pressed its 
campaign to rival nelson mandelas group as a leader in the fight 
against white rule 
the announcement came at the partys congress in the capital of 
the kwazulu homeland ulundi some whites joined the blacks at the 
event 
mangosuthu buthelezi leader of both inkatha and the zulu 
homeland announced that inkatha would participate as a multiracial 
party in elections he hopes will take place before a new 
constitution is negotiated to end apartheid 
president fw de klerk is negotiating to give the countrys 
black majority a say in the political system 
inkathas chief rival is the african national congress whose 
leaders include mandela there are some whites in the anc 
leadership most notably joe slovo the head of the south african 
communist party 
supporters of the anc and inkatha have been fighting for power 
in kwazulu and natal province since 1985 leaving more than 4000 
people dead 
both inkatha and the anc oppose apartheid but differ over plans 
for a future south africa inkatha is relatively conservative and 
contends the anc is unjustly trying to claim the role of principla 
negotiator for the black majority 
buthelezi referred to the rivalry with the anc in his speech to 
the party congress 
we will just not allow the anc and its south african communist 
party partner to crush all opposition to it and emerge as the only 
viable political party buthelezi said 
nothing that the anc can do will shake inkathas resolve to 
come out as a new inkatha and a political party to claim its 
rightful place at the negotiating table he said 
the party congress adopted a platform calling for multiparty 
democracy peace and reconciliation education for all south 
africans equality before the law respect for cultural heritage 
and wealth creation to help the underprivileged 
inkatha was formed in 1975 to organize zulus against attempts by 
the south african government to turn the kwazulu homeland into an 
independent state 
buthelezi and his organization successfully resisted the policy 
which would have stripped zulus of their south african citizenship 
inkatha became the dominant political party in the zulu areas and 
runs the homelands semiautonomous government 
the organization claims 15 million members buthelezi has 
described it in the past as a cultural liberation movement but it 
began admitting nonzulus in 1979

a japanese company will likely face a 43 
million penalty for keeping double books to avoid paying union 
wages to the filipino crew of a logging ship a federal judge said 
an award that size would be the largest wage judgment in 
maritime history said richard dodson a lawyer from louisiana who 
represented the 21 crew members in us district court 
a defense lawyer said saturday the shipping company would appeal 
the judges expected decision in favor of the plaintiffs 
delica shipping company officials said the company kept two sets 
of books on all 10 of the companys ships for the past eight years 
pine forest the company ship involved in the lawsuit was seized 
in tacoma in january and released only after the owner posted a 19 
million bond 
they admitted they cheated dodson said friday 
both sides agreed that crew members were required to sign two 
sets of monthly wage receipts one indicating payment according to 
levels specified in agreements with the international transport 
workers federation and another showing the actual pay rate 
forest pine crew members said they were paid onefifth the 
contractual rate after being hired in march 1989 when 13 of the 
crew asked to leave the ship to pursue wage claims they were 
blacklisted from future work testimony indicated 
company lawyers argued unsuccessfully that judge jack tanner 
lacked jurisdiction because no cargo was unloaded in western 
washington state 
under us law the courts have jurisdiction over wage cases 
involving foreign ships and crews when their voyages end in us 
waters 
defense attorney joseph stacey said saturday that delica would 
appeal tanners expected decision against the company 
stacey said the crewmen were paid about 70 percent of union 
scale wages not the 20 percent alleged he said the case covered 
about 15 different pay grades and that he could not state actual 
wage amounts 
stacey earlier said the crew members knowingly and voluntarily 
agreed to less pay than required under the union agreement and that 
what they did receive was still a highly desirable rate for the 
philippines 
the flagofconvenience vessels have never paid these itf 
wages he said in our case even the itf never expected 
anybody to receive itf wages 
in a hearing friday dodson asked tanner to award 150000 in 
back pay 16 million in compensatory and penalty wages and 27 
million in punitive damages from delica 
i might as well tell you youre looking at a judgment near or 
around that figure tanner told company lawyers this case 
cries out for punitive damages in a substantial amount of money 
both to punish your client and to deter others from such 
outrageous malicious and intentional conduct 
the judges decision was expected later this summer 
the pine forest is registered to delica a panamanian 
corporation it flies the flag of vanuatu a small pacific island 
nation and is operated by inui steamship co of japan a 
subsidiary of mitsui inc 
the ship is chartered by yet another japanese company to bring 
logs from the weyerhaeuser co through tacoma and longview 
dodson said the double bookkeeping system boosted profits by 
400000 a year 
he said he had filed a 100 million civil suit against delica on 
behalf of 2000 other crew members another delica ship the fir 
grove also is the subject of a civil case after being seized in 
coos bay ore 
the pine forest case was hailed friday by paul chapman director 
of the center for seafarers rights at the seamens church 
institute in new york 
this case represents a systemic problem that is rampant 
throughout the shipping industry around the world chapman said 
each year thousands of seafarers are cheated out of their earned 
wages and are virtually blackmailed into signing false wage 
receipts and unfair contracts

connie chung got a little miffed saturday 
while being barraged with questions about the glitz factor of her 
newly redone interview show on cbs 
you people are so insulting she told a roomful of 
television critics at the century plaza hotel 
the reporters were grilling her about the news value of face 
to face with connie chung formerly saturday night with connie 
chung which moves with its new name to mondays at 10 pm on 
july 23 
chung who also anchors the sunday cbs evening news insisted 
that celebrity interviews were not the driving force of her 
hourlong program despite recent network promotions that accentuate 
her starside chats 
the television critics insisted otherwise 
look its a magazine program chung said her voice rising 
were going to have all kinds of stories 
chungs press conference was part of the annual cbs summer media 
tour for tv critics 
chungs infamous interview last winter with an uncooperative 
marlon brando was an excruciating experience for me she said

me 
the move from saturday nights to mondays allows chung to follow 
murphy brown and designing women two of the toprated 
programs on cbs 
chung said she hoped the switch would boost her ratings which 
never pushed into the high numbers on saturday an unpopular night 
for most television networks

the government saturday said it was 
helping about 190000 refugees return to the south where they had 
fled famine and civil war 
however it denied a us newspaper report that the refugees 
were being forced to return to their villages in southwestern bahr 
elghazal province 
in its report friday the new york times quoted village chiefs 
and un relief workers who said the government was making the 
refugees go home and further straining food supplies in the region 
the article quoted a report by the un childrens fund which 
said the refugees were taken by train and truck for part of the 
route it said they then had to walk as many as four days to their 
villages 
brig gen pio yukwan deng a member of the ruling military 
council dismissed the times report as sheer unfounded 
allegations 
during the 7yearold civil war in the south about 2 million 
refugees have fled the fighting and famine settling in shantytowns 
around the capital khartoum 
hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled to other sudanese 
cities as well as to neighboring ethiopia and uganda 
peter orat the minister for relief and displaced persons 
denied that any southerners were being coerced into leaving the 
capital 
our declared policy is to help the displaced return to the 
south not by force but by their own free will orat said 
he said those who wished to remain in the north would not be 
allowed to stay in their shantytowns but would be moved to nearby 
production areas to help boost production he did not 
elaborate but apparently was referring to agricultural areas 
the refugees live in about 27 shantytowns around the capital and 
in the nearby central region about 10000 inhabitants of one camp 
in a suburban industrial area near khartoum have already been moved 
to another suburb because the camps water was polluted 
mohamed elhassan awad elkarim the commissioner for displaced 
people said that about 190000 refugees had asked to return to 
their homes in bahr elghazal 
we are currently contacting concerned bodies local and 
international to help us in transporting them elkarim said he 
said it was not possible for the government to transport all the 
refugees 
we are providing food for three months in addition to tents 
blankets drugs and agricultural tools to anyone wishing to return 
home 
the arrival of large numbers of war refugees in khartoum and 
other sudanese cities has created tensions with local residents who 
resent having to share their already meager food resources and job 
opportunities 
there are also tribal and religious differences 
the southerners are mostly christians or animists of african 
origin the northerners are predominantly moslem of arab descent 
the rebel sudan peoples liberation army took up arms against 
the government in 1983 demanding more autonomy and a greater share 
in the countrys economic wealth 
government troops killed 160 rebels in fighting this week around 
the towns of yei and maridi in the southern equatoria region brig 
gen dominique kassiano a member of the ruling military council 
said saturday he did not mention government casualties 
western relief agencies say that in 1988 alone more than 
500000 southerners were killed in the fighting or starved to death 
for the past two years the government had prevented the 
southern refugees from returning home fearing that they would 
provide new recruits for the rebel army the times reported 
the times article said some relief workers believed that by 
sending the refugees back the military government was trying to 
strain food supplies and disrupt life in rebelheld areas in the 
south 
the military government is led by lt gen omar hassan 
elbashir who took power in a june 30 1989 coup that overthrew 
the civilian prime minister sadek mahdi

its back to the future for smoggy 
trafficchoked los angeles where electric trolleys rolled again 
saturday for the first time in 30 years 
thirty years after the last red car served this community 
today we launch the beginning of the new blue line declared 
mayor tom bradley in a ceremony at the lightrail mass transit 
lines downtown pico station 
the 22mile 877 million metro blue line runs along an old 
pacific electric red car route from downtown to long beach it is 
the first operating segment of a 150mile 10 billion rail grid 
planned for completion in the next century 
president bush sent a message saying the construction 
demonstrated civic cooperation and the kind of local 
commitment necessary 
less than a mile away from the inauguration site workers 
erected metal scaffolding to shore up a subway tunnel that 
partially caved in during a fire that began friday and was 
threatening the collapse of a stretch of the busy hollywood freeway 
the tunnel is part of the 4mile metro rail subway system a 
section of the rail grid scheduled to open in 1993 
the blue line completed in five years is an overheadpowered 
trolley system financed by a halfcent county sales tax voters 
approved in 1980 
the old red car system was built 90 years ago and dismantled in 
1961 in favor of cars buses and freeways that decision also 
produced some of the worst air pollution in the nation and chronic 
traffic congestion 
when 12000 passengers per day ride this blue line next 
year it will reduce smog problems said lt gov leo mccarthy 
cheers went up as the politicians clanged a silver bell and one 
of the red white and blue 1 million trolleys rounded a bend 
sounding its horn 
i was 8 years old when the red car stopped running said 
corey smith a security guard waiting to take a trolley to work at 
the long beach transit plaza i have good memories my 
grandfather worked as a motorman 
smith who collects red car memorabilia believes the blue line 
will be a success 
im going to take it on a regular basis he said it will 
take a while for some people to get used to it but once used to it 
they will probably leave their cars 
after the civic leaders and reporters headed south down the line 
for ceremonies at some of the other 21 stations the blue line 
began offering free rides for the weekend a 110 fare goes into 
effect monday 
eric jacobson 35 waited in the 90degree heat to be among the 
first to ride his father had taken him on the last red line 
commute in 1961 
it was the end of meaningful mass transit he said now 
weve come to our senses a little bit hopefully this is the start 
of a viable mass transit system in the la area 
as the blue line began operating the hollywood freeway remained 
closed for a second day near downtown because of the tunnel fire 
the morning rushhour traffic jam friday illustrated the freeway 
systems vulnerability to a single incident and the lack of mass 
transit alternatives 
a dozen guardian angels the selfstyled community crime 
fighters stood by in their red berets for the blue lines debut a 
familiar sight on transit lines in the east they came from san 
francisco and san jose to ride the los angeles trolleys 
the general game plan is to ride from 5 pm until it shuts 
down thats when most crimes are committed well be a visual 
deterrent said trey scharlin who is organizing angels for the 
blue line which will run until 8 pm 
concerns have been voiced about the safety of the line which 
travels through territory that is home to an estimated 15000 gang 
members 
the los angeles county sheriffs department has been contracted 
to provide 118 deputies as security for the blue line and its 
riders

the first top dog world championship prairie 
dog shoot competition got under way saturday with more than 100 
shooters despite the efforts of about two dozen animal rights 
activists 
two protesters were issued citations for trespassing 
authorities said 
when plans for the shooting contest became known three months 
ago outraged animal rights activists successfully lobbied gov roy 
romer and us rep ben nighthorse campbell to come out against it 
but local citizens rallied round the organizers and all but three 
of 318 people who attended a town meeting on the subject voted in 
favor of the contest 
one of the people at the meeting suggested a yuppie shoot 
might be in order and after the vote mayor john vanderpool 
invited romer and campbell to buzz off 
more than 7000 in prizes was at stake for hunters in the 
twoday competition billed as a way of reducing the population of 
the foottall grayish brown rodents relatives of the squirrel 
by the end of the hunts first day organizers said 1162 
prairie dogs had been killed way over the maximum 500 predicted 
hunt organizer roger culver attributed the high rate to 
availability of dogs good weather and marksmens skill but added 
that no shooter had hit the 50 dogs allowed 
prairie dogs have multiplied geometrically in recent years 
because of the drought landowner paul carkhuff said 
there used to be oats in that field thatd reach three feet 
he said nobody can grow anything on land that the prairie dogs 
have gotten to like this 
sixinchtall mounds around prairie dog burrows spaced only a 
few feet apart harming plants and creating a hazard for livestock 
animal rights activists however believe shooting the animals 
at all much less for sport is immoral 
its a contest of cruelty said shari janger of denver a 
member of the rocky mountain humane society and prairie dog rescue 
we just want them to stop this they think its their world down 
here it isnt its the state of colorado 
about 25 protesters appeared at the 6 am pancake breakfast at 
the moose lodge waving signs and shouting slogans there were no 
confrontations or incidents other than a lot of yelling between 
the protesters and local residents who turned out to watch the 
demonstration 
police worked to keep hotheads on both sides apart said 
montrose county sheriff tom gilmore 
many of the locals said they enjoyed the news media activity as 
much as the demonstrations and took as many photographs of 
reporters and television crews as they did of the protesters 
weve just never had anything like this kind of attention 
before said linda norton a local merchant and president of the 
areas chamber of commerce who estimated the combined population 
of nucla and nearby naturita in southwestern colorado at 1500 
nucla merchants also were pleased the only two motels in the 
region were booked solid for the first time in several years

sales 
one activist who allegedly crossed onto private property was 
issued a citation on the spot and a second demonstrator was removed 
by deputies taken to the local sheriffs office issued a summons 
and released undersheriff mike wiggins said 
we gave him the summons took him back out on the street and 
turned him around five times and let him go wiggins said 
the hunters carrying everything from biggame rifles to 
expensive target guns were sent out in twoman teams to separate 
ranches for six hours of shooting 
instead of letting the hunters just blaze away and counting up 
the carcasses later organizers established a point system 
successful shots longer than 200 yards counted for two points 
those under that distance one point hunters were penalized one 
point for every miss at more than 200 yards and two points at less 
than 200 yards 
two teams sent to one ranch said they got off 18 shots in the 
first hour 14 of them hits one man complained he and his partner 
went three hours without taking a shot 
gilmore who combined forces with neighboring san miguel county 
and state and federal land agencies to gather 25 officers said he 
would send a bill for the extra law enforcement to the shoot 
sponsor the ten ring gun club 
we know it wont get paid but theyll know how much this 
cost he said

delegates to the world conference of the 
seventhday adventist church ended their meeting saturday after 
making an exception to a hotly debated decision barring the 
ordination of women 
the ruling body of the church voted wednesday against allowing 
the ordination of women after hours of discussion and splits along 
geographical lines among the 1500 delegates to the 55th world 
conference 
on friday delegates extended to women members some ministerial 
duties denied in the earlier vote the change allows local 
congregations to grant women the right to perform marriages a duty 
formerly reserved for ordained ministers 
church spokesman herbert ford said the rule change does in 
effect allow women to be a little closer to ordination 
in the earlier decision delegates had voted along geographical 
lines 1173 to 377 to accept a commissions report that ordaining 
women would be disruptive to the world church and should not be 
allowed 
european and north american delegates offered the greatest 
support for ordination while leaders from africa asia and south 
american overwhelmingly opposed letting women preach the gospel 
the seventhday adventist church is separated into 11 geographical 
divisions encompassing 190 countries and 62 million members 
robert s folkenberg the churchs world leader capped the 
10day conference in downtown indianapolis on saturday with an 
overture for tolerance 
this unity is not uniformity folkenberg said in addressing 
the conference during worship service if god wanted a church of 
uniformity he would not have made flowers of different colors 
we are not a family of god unless we are building bridges to 
all people of all nations 
ford said women designated local elders by their 
congregation will be allowed to perform marriages with the approval 
of regional church officials to become local elders women must 
have an undergraduate theology degree and an adventist seminary 
graduate degree and gain the approval of their congregations 
leaders 
the earlier vote was influenced by a report from the churchs 
role of women commission the report said church unity would be 
threatened if women were allowed to preach

rebels stopped three buses and gunned 
down at least 35 moslem passengers in eastern sri lanka defense 
ministry officials said saturday 
also saturday a tamil politician claimed sri lankan soldiers 
massacred nearly 1000 tamil civilians during the past month of 
fighting with the rebels 
at least 2400 combatants and an undetermined number of 
civilians have died since ethnic tamils who are mainly hindu 
violated a ceasefire in june they renewed their fighting against 
government troops who are mostly buddhist sinhalese 
a top sri lankan army commander said saturday that the military 
could not win the civil war against the tamil separatists 
a political solution is the only way out said major general 
gh de silva who commands the government forces in the eastern 
region of this island nation 
he said the rebels are starting hitandrun operations 
effectively using crude but powerful land mines and guerrilla 
strikes against the army 
it is becoming difficult to control territory said de 
silva interviewed with several of his officers in the town of 
trincomalee 
when you hit he hides when you move out he comes back he 
said referring to the rebels 
defense ministry officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the rebels stopped three buses near the eastern town of 
kalmunai on friday and shot and killed at least 35 passengers 
all the victims were moslems they said moslem politicians put 
the number of dead at 150 
moslems who make up about 7 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people are often caught in the middle of the 7yearold war 
between tamil rebels and the sinhalesedominated government 
according to residents of kalmunai fridays killings were 
intended as a warning to moslems not to help soldiers hunt for 
rebel hideouts 
in another development a tamil politician accused the army of 
intentionally killing at least 1000 civilians in the latest bout 
of fighting which started last month after the rebels repudiated 
the 13monthlong ceasefire 
since the fighting began on june 11 we fear nearly 1000 
tamil civilians men women and children have been deliberately 
massacred by the army in the east said kandian premachandran 
we concede civilians die when caught in the cross fire but 
what is happening in the east is they are being deliberately 
massacred he said 
there was no immediate government reaction to premachandrans 
allegations 
on thursday defense secretary gen cyril ranatunge denied news 
reports that soldiers were killing tamil civilians after clearing 
towns and villages of rebels 
premachandran is an opposition member of parliament and a leader 
of the eelam peoples revolutionary liberation front a former 
guerrilla group that gave up arms before entering politics the 
party opposes the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the rebel group 
militia fighting for an independent tamil homeland 
tamils make up 18 percent of the population they claim they are 
discriminated against by sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the 
population and control the government and armed forces 
tamil militants launched their movement for an independent 
homeland in 1983 at least 13400 people have died in the 
insurrection

on oct 29 and took him across the columbia river to dodds 
vancouver apartment he repeatedly molested and tortured the boy 
and finally killed him the next morning then dodd hung the body in 
a closet for a time before dumping it in a lake 
dodd was arrested about two weeks later when he tried to kidnap

torture and kill children 
dodds scrapbook included photographs he took of lee iseli 
before and after his death beneath the photos were graphic and 
detailed captions 
he fantasized on it said prosecutor art curtis he killed 
children for sexual pleasure for fun for the thrill of the hunt 
defense attorney lee dane had argued dodd might be insane after 
the sentence dane said he was not surprised

more than that 
dodd had been convicted in 1984 of molestation charges in idaho 
and again in 1987 in the seattle area both charges involved young 
boys dodd served 118 days in jail on the seattle charges 
its real scary he had a normal childhood he blossomed 
into a mass murderer said prosecutor roger bennett 
bob iseli father of lee iseli said he was happy with 
saturdays verdict and didnt feel sorry for dodd 
i personally dont feel good about the death penalty iseli 
said but if were going to shed a tear for anybody were going 
to shed a tear for my boy and the neer boys

clair neer the father of the brothers 
the defense called no witnesses and presented no evidence during 
the trial nor did his attorneys engage in any real 
crossexamination of the states witnesses 
dodd became the 10th person on washingtons death row under a 
1981 state law that sanctions execution by hanging or lethal 
injection depending on the wishes of the inmate all nine of the 
previous sentences are being appealed dodds sentence also will be

the white house is getting ready to appoint a 
panel of experts to review nasa operations in the wake of 
embarrassing problems with two leaky shuttles and a flawed space 
telescope according to a report 
cbstv reported on its weekend news saturday that the panel 
probably will be named next week 
i think the white house is disappointed with the priorities 
coming out of the agency george washington university professor 
john m logsdon told the network i think there is a crisis of 
confidence in nasa as an organization in its management and its 
leadership 
i dont have any comments on the cbs report said white 
house spokesman sean walsh 
although the space agency has named committees of its own to 
look into recent problems a white house oversight panel could be 
seen as a response to congressional calls for an outside review of 
nasa procedures 
for example sen al gore dtenn head of the senate commerce 
space subcommittee has said that the new nasa management team 
ironically has been looking at this but the agency hasnt gotten 
attention from the president and thats whats needed now 
a white house review of nasa probably would be coordinated by 
the national space council which is headed by vice president dan 
quayle and meets next week 
cbs said quayle reportedly got an earful of complaints against 
nasa last week and is expected to take the lead in strategy 
meetings beginning monday 
the network said the white house concern is not so much with 
nasas recent string of technical problems but the agency 
bureaucracys failure to deal with them adequately despite the 
concern the report said nasa administrator richard truly recently 
appointed by president bush still has the white houses confidence

the spiritual leader of 250 million orthodox 
christians said saturday the third millennium of christianity 
should be a time for healing the ruptures that marked church 
history in the last thousand years 
divisions and schisms cannot be justified in the life of the 
churches patriarch dimitrios declared during a special service 
sponsored by the national council of churches at columbia 
university 
dimitrios the first orthodox patriarch to visit the united 
states arrived here from washington friday on the second leg of a 
monthlong tour 
saturday evening gov mario cuomo hosted a dinner honoring 
dimitrios at the windows on the world restaurant atop the world 
trade center 
at the morning service dimitrios was welcomed by the very rev 
leonid kishkovsky an orthodox archpriest and current president of 
the national council of the churches of christ in the usa 
kishkovsky said the variety of religion in the united states 
almost exceeds the imagination and that many american 
christians were seeking an overarching and basic christian 
identity and unity that may be found in the early christian 
tradition 
dimitrios responded that this century has seen the rise of an 
ecumenical spirit in the worlds religious communities 
but the patriarch whose own church came into being as a result 
of a great schism with rome in 1054 said that unhappily the 
second christian millennium became a period of successive divisions 
the ardent wish of all of us is that the impending third 
millennium will be a time of healing from those wounds he said 
speaking in greek through a translator 
the return to the undivided church of the first thousand years 
is not so difficult so long as it is based on common historical and 
theological sources and is purged of historical prejudices 
two hundred people attended the service at the chapel of 
interfaith center including cardinal john j oconnor roman 
catholic archbishop of new york who welcomed dimitrios as a man 
who can bridge the gap between east and west 
most of the eastern churchs 250 million adherents live in 
eastern europe but there are 6 million in the united states 
including 1 million in the new york area according to the greek 
orthodox archdiocese 
the 75yearold religious leader was in washington for a week to 
attend the 30th greek orthodox biennial clergylaity congress he 
also will visit pennsylvania san francisco chicago buffalo and 
boston 
ecumenical patriarch dimitrios i installed in 1972 holds the 
title archbishop of constantinople based in that city now 
istanbul he presides over the albanian bulgarian 
czechoslovakian georgian greek polish romanian russian and

the wrecked coast guard cutter 
mesquite was scuttled into a watery grave in lake superior on 
saturday to become a tourist attraction for sports divers 
she is on the bottom said capt jimmie hobaugh who 
commands the coast guard station at sault ste marie 
the 180foot cutter ran aground dec 4 off keweenaw point and 
was battered against rocks for several days leaving the hull in 
pieces 
the sinking had to wait until bulkhead cracks were welded shut 
so the mesquite could be towed to her resting place said petty 
officer frank jennings a coast guard spokesman at regional 
headquarters in cleveland 
salvagers removed excess air from the tanks before sealing them 
to make sure the ship sank he said 
a 250foot barge was brought in to tow the mesquite two miles 
south to keystone bay to become part of the proposed keweenaw 
underwater preserve 
before scuttling commercial salvagers removed anything of 
value hobaugh said what remained is just a piece of junk 
its like when a person dies he said the soul goes away 
and youve got a sack of oats left thats what a minister told me 
once to help me deal with picking up bodies its the same thing 
the mesquites captain lt cmdr john lynch faces court 
martial on negligence charges he was criticized for assigning too 
few crew members to check the ships position 
two other ships officers were reprimanded in the grounding 
officials say it would cost 35 million to replace the 
48yearold cutter

armed mohawk indians embroiled in a land 
dispute with authorities agreed saturday to lift a bridge blockade 
near montreal after a provincial official promised to reduce the 
police contingent in this town 
the agreement was announced after quebec native affairs minister 
john ciaccia met for more than six hours with indian 
representatives in an effort to end the dispute that has left one 
police officer dead 
the meeting came as indians manned barricades at a reservation 
near oka and blockaded the mercier bridge linking montreal with its 
populous suburbs onthe south shore of the st lawrence river 
ciaccia said the bridge blockade could be lifted as early as 
sunday but he refused to elaborate on the terms of the agreement 
but mohawk representative ellen gabriel said the indians had 
agreed to reopen the bridge in return for a significant 
reduction of the police presence in oka 
highways leading to the bridge were blockaded wednesday by 
mohawks of the kahnawake reserve following an armed clash between 
provincial police and mohawks manning barricades on the reservation 
near oka 
since the clash mohawks and police have been locked in a tense 
standoff in oka the indians have refused to take down their 
barricades 
ciaccia said the talks saturday resulted in the beginnings of 
proposals to end the oka confrontation 
you should all be very happy that we are announcing a solution 
for one very serious problem and the beginnings of a solution for 
the entire problem he told reporters 
ciaccia refused to elaborate on the proposals saying he must 
first consult with the provincial government he said he would 
return to oka on sunday to continue the talks 
gabriel also refused to discuss details of the negotiations but 
said she is optimistic a solution can be found to the oka dispute 
the confrontation has left one police officer dead after 
wednesdays shootout with mohawks manning barricades in oka 20 
miles west of montreal it is unclear if the officer was shot by 
mohawks or fellow police 
the mohawks from the kanehsatake indian community set up 
barricades at oka to stop the municipality from expanding a golf 
course onto what the indians claim is ancestral territory 
mohawk activists from the kahnawake reserve had threatened to 
destroy the mercier bridge if police moved to dismantle their 
blockade 
one banner strung across a trailer near the bridge said stop 
canadian apartheid and amerindian genocide 
the blockade of the bridge has sparked widespread anger among 
local white residents the highway to the bridge passes through the 
indian reservation 
the quebec provincial police riot squad was called out saturday 
for the second straight night as angry white residents milled

attractive says a man who used to run the treasurys 
moneyproducing agency 
the principles and history of a country are recounted in the 
art of bank notes robert j leuver told the senate banking

history provided in our national bank notes of 1896 silver 
certificates of 1896 and the beautiful 2 bill of 1976 
the tin lizzy vintage car on the back of the 10 bill 
harkens to a different time and does not afford the counterfeit 
detection we need said leuver a former chief of the bureau of 
engraving and printing who now directs the american numismatic 
association 
leuver said most of the anticounterfeiting deterrents built 
into currency are less effective than they could be because of the 
50yearold design of the bills

using ammunition provided by the federal 
reserve the stock market hit a lofty target this past week 
shortly after 130 pm on friday the dow jones industrial 
average crossed the 3000 level for the first time reaching that 
landmark faster than even many bullish analysts thought possible 
just a few weeks ago 
analysts gave alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve 
board credit for making it happen when it did 
greenspan surprised wall streets legion of fedwatchers in a 
congressional appearance thursday with what appeared to be a clear 
signal that the fed was making a significant shift in credit policy 
he told the senate banking committee that the central bank was 
ready to ease monetary conditions fostering lower interest rates 
in response to rising evidence of a squeeze on bank credit 
in so doing he hinted strongly that the fed had moved closer to 
mollifying critics in the bush administration and on wall street 
who had been urging the central bank to take steps to avert a 
potential recession 
the response in the financial markets was immediate as visions 
of more plentiful money and a stimulus to the sluggish economy sent 
traders scrambling to buy both stocks and bonds 
in addition many analysts said greenspans comments were taken 
as reassurance for investors who have been worrying that a 
stringent new approach among bank lending officers and regulators 
might put a chokehold on the economy 
i think the most important thing he said is to acknowledge 
that he is as concerned about current lending practices in banking 
as we are said hugh johnson at first albany corp in albany 
ny we hadnt received that kind of acknowledgment before 
on friday activities by the fed in the money markets appeared 
to confirm the message that it was seeking to encourage shortterm 
interest rates to decline 
but with all those promising developments observers said the 
markets still faced obstacles 
in the past they noted expressions of willingness from the fed 
to try to avert recessions have not always meant immediate success 
on that score 
furthermore they added any commitment by the central bank to 
easier credit could waver should the news on inflation start to 
turn uglier at any point 
the price of gold widely regarded as an sensitive measure of 
inflationary expectations sounded a faintly ominous note by 
rallying along with stocks and bonds on the prospect of stimulus by 
the fed 
still stockmarket investors made their endorsement of 
greenspans move easy to read the dow jones average of 30 
industrials closed friday at 298020 up 7525 from the week 
before 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 455 to 
20033 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
rose 790 to 46844 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was up 512 at 36399 
volume on the big board averaged 17127 million shares a day up 
from 12507 million the week before 
anticipation of a fed move toward easier credit increased on 
wall street with a recent push in the white house and congress 
toward a plan for reducing the federal budget deficit 
any moves to cut government spending or raise taxes would 
represent a tightening of fiscal policy which would stand to slow 
the economy further 
so many commentators began looking for the fed to adopt a 
counterbalancing approach by relaxing its monetary policy 
those hopes seem to have been fulfilled now stock and bond 
traders can set up watch to see whether the fed can get results to 
realize its new stated intentions

for a while it looked like the good old days 
with takeovers defensive alliances and stock rumors coming one 
after another two phone giants merging a french hotelier buying 
an american budget motel chain two technology companies forming a 
strategic joint venture 
there even was wild speculation that mitsubishi group the 
japanese industrial conglomerate that made the planes used to 
divebomb pearl harbor would buy a big piece of an old world war 
ii aviation adversary mcdonnell douglas corp 
but that rumor was denied and a closer look at the deals done 
this past week showed they bore little in common with a typical 
wild week of takeover news in the last half of the 1980s 
for one thing there was an absence of junk bonds the risky 
ious used to bankroll many of the highprofile transactions of the 
past decade 
the corporate buyers of 1990 must carry less speculative tools 
like cash stock or secured bank loans partly because attempts to 
peddle junkbond debt to raise takeover money are largely futile 
now the rising number of junkbond defaults has scared most buyers 
away 
another difference in the deals of this past week was that none 
of the buyers were unfriendly outside investors motivated by the 
greedy quick money mentality that colored many other highprofile 
takeovers of the past decade on the contrary all had a direct 
business interest in what they were buying 
the most obvious example also was the biggest not only of the 
week but the year contel corp the nations no 3 independent 
telephone company accepted a takeover offer from gte corp the no 
1 independent in a stock swap valued at 6 billion 
the merger will create a leading operator of cellular phone 
systems one of the fastestgrowing segments of the 
telecommunications industry both partners called their marriage 
a perfect combination 
the weeks other prominent deal was the french lodging company 
accor sas 13 billion agreement to buy motel 6 one of the 
bestknown purveyors of budget roadside lodging in the united 
states accor thus will become the biggest operator of lowpriced 
hotel rooms in the world 
the deal also was notable because of the identity of the seller 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co the new york investment group made 
leveraged buyout a household term last decade and holds the record 
for the biggest lbo in history the 25 billion debtfinanced 
acquisition of rjr nabisco inc early last year 
the ultimate wisdom of kohlbergs rjr deal remains unclear but 
its purchase of motel 6 five years ago appears to have been a sound 
choice investors who participated in that debtfinanced 
transaction will make a 215 percent rate of return on their money 
when accor completes its purchase 
the third notable corporate transaction of the week was a 
strategic alliance by international business machines corp and 
diebold inc to manufacture and market automated bank teller 
machines worldwide 
the combined atm operation will be the nations largest and will 
enable each company to benefit from the others strengths without a 
costly investment a major motivation for many companies that have 
sought joint ventures recently 
the developments of the past week reflect the underlying themes 
of a longterm strategy that has shaped a growing number of other 
recent takeovers 
philip morris cos for example is buying a swiss candymaker 
for 38 billion conagra inc is purchasing beatrice co for 134 
billion in both instances the buyers existing businesses will be 
strengthened 
in what may be an ironic twist the increased takeover action 
has coincided with a reluctance by many corporations to take 
advantage of tough antitakeover laws that many legislatures have 
enacted to protect state businesses 
earlier this month for example hj heinz co said it 
voluntarily would relinquish the antitakeover protections offered 
by its home state pennsylvania which enacted the nations 
toughest antitakeover law last spring 
in other business and economic news this past week 
the nations top banker surprised the markets by acknowledging 
the possibility of a credit crunch and his willingness to ease 
interest rates the remarks by federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan energized wall street pushed stocks to a record and 
briefly vaulted the dow jones average over 3000 
readings of the economys health suggested reduced chances of 
recession the government said retail sales rose sharply in june 
the first big gain in five months while inflation remained 
moderate major automakers said sales strengthened in midjuly 
extending a sales gain in the troubled industry that began in june 
the savings amp loan scandal grew in severity the former head of 
a big texas thrift was indicted on 17 counts of fraud and other 
crimes president bush felt compelled to publicly defend son neil 
for his alleged role in the collapse of a colorado thrift and the 
senate passed a crime bill that would punish highlevel sampl 
executives convicted of fraud with life imprisonment 
the first jury trial against a wall street professional 
incriminated by notorious inside trader ivan boesky ended with a 
conviction on four counts and a mistrial on 26 others defendant 
john a mulheren jr a stock speculator and former boesky 
confidante said he will appeal the guilty verdict

them

the center for seafarers rights which provided an attorney

seamens church institute of new york and new jersey which is home

major restructuring announced last month 
campbells chief executive officer david w johnson made the

of the business that have been dragging down our earnings 
campbell told the analysts

in fiscal 1989 on revenues of 567 billion a sharp drop from 
profits of 2741 million or 212 per share on revenues of 487 
billion the year before the decline was due to previous 
restructuring costs 
campbells recent sluggish performance and depressed stock price 
have made it the target of frequent takeover rumors some members 
of the founding dorrance family which owns a major stake have 
urged a sale of the entire company 
over the next few years johnson said campbells plans to boost 
its earnings per share by 20 percent annually he said the company 
also plans to achieve at least a 20 percent return on equity and a 
20 percent cash return on assets
