yo good buddy yeah you with the bible 
whats youre handle 
truckers are calling the rev s anthony battaglia who 
broadcasts from a citizens band pulpit chaplain man 
the barberturnedpreacher dispenses guidance for the soul and 
directions for the road to his congregation of truckers drivers 
battaglia 60 found a new calling when the baltimore port truck 
plaza wanted to hire a cb radio buff to guide tired hungry and 
lost drivers on the busy interstate 95 corridor 
hes a right responsible fellow hes kind of a caretaker 
around here he helps guys who get into a bind said steve 
newton a former driver who is now a trucking agent in baltimore 
sandwiched between a gift shop complete with mud flap 
ornaments including the popular chrome reclining nude and a 
coinoperated laundry battaglia mans his radio pulpit in the 
security office of the truck stops motel 
every weekday from 7 am to 3 pm battaglia sits with his 
imitation leather bible at a desk piled with a 40channel cb radio 
police scanners atlases and phone books 
battaglia an ordained baptist minister is a chaplain at a 
suburban baltimore church and a volunteer chaplain for the 
baltimore county police and fire departments he wears his fire 
department uniform to the truck stop in case he gets a call 
he spent 30 years as a barber then switched directions and 
worked as a real estate agent 
now his congregation includes drivers with handles such as 
the rubber duck low rider and the destroyer 
how bout that chaplain man one driver calls out we got 
an abandoned trailer its an evergreen 
another driver leaving the fort mchenry tunnel wants directions 
to eastern avenue 
that driver coming out of the hole that exit is 59 
battaglia replies this is the baltimore port truck plaza 
welcoming you to baltimore 
that greeting is about as much as he is allowed to say on the 
air waves about the truck stop because federal communications 
commission regulations forbid advertisements over the radio 
basically were here to help the drivers when they come into 
baltimore its one big maze of streets battaglia said 
truckers are lonely too they have marital problems they can 
feel free to come in for counsel he said 
i tell them sometimes you just have to make a decision to go 
out on your own with your own truck or if things are slow they 
need someone to encourage them to tell them to just hang on

texas businessmen and church leaders 
are living in fashionable homes with government subsidized rents 
because of loopholes in federal homeless housing guidelines a 
newspaper reported 
the fort worth startelegram in a story for sunday editions 
said people who have too much money to qualify for welfare food 
stamps or other housing assistance qualified as homeless under a 
program intended for the poor 
obviously these kinds of abuses are unacceptable said walt 
sevier a regional deputy administrator for the us department of 
housing and urban development i dont want to overreact but 
that is simply obscene 
the startelegram found that the vaguely defined hud program 
aimed at providing temporary shelter to the nations homeless poor 
has helped some of them but also has resulted in abuses 
hud secretary jack kemp launched the program after he took 
office in february 1989 it makes available up to 10 percent of 
50000 foreclosed homes the federal government owns nationwide 
under the program hudapproved sponsors lease the homes for one 
year to those who qualify for the assistance the sponsors are 
given additional twoyear options to buy the homes at a price 10 
percent below market value 
after purchasing the homes the sponsors can resell them at 
market rates 
among examples of abuse cited by the newspaper 
businessman and parttime street minister roy gray of keller 
rents a 92500 home in the upscale dallas suburb of rowlett for 1 
a year 
the net worth of bill robinsons nonprofit company will soon 
exceed 1 million but the businessman and baptist minister has 
moved into a twostory home in arlington appraised at 92000 the 
newspaper said 
robert holton a construction contractor pays 348 in monthly 
rent for a fourbedroom 85500 home that he thought would be 
adequate to house our furniture 
hud regulations define a homeless person as virtually anyone 
without a permanent home regardless of income and agency failed 
to set limits on size and value of homes the newspaper said 
agency officials said they are investigating whether gray and 
robinson violated federal conflictofinterest rules by using their 
positions as churchaffiliated hud sponsors to lease the government 
homes for themselves 
the two are key officials in a small circle of area churches and 
nonprofit organizations linked with hud to provide housing for the 
homeless 
gray and robinson have said they had no profit motive in 
deciding who would benefit from the program gray said he had no 
apologies for his housing placements and said all met hud 
regulations 
weve got people in houses anywhere from zero income you 
know people who didnt even have a job to i think the highest 
one is about 2000 a month gray said 
a small charismatic church near keller calvary christian 
center become the nations largest sponsor for huds 
homelesshousing program almost overnight the newspaper said 
the center holds the leases to 97 government homes gray as 
program coordinator for the church has placed friends and family 
members in hud homes the newspaper reported 
the startelegram said at least four dallasfort worth area 
pastors or members of their families are living in hud homes meant 
for the homeless 
all the pastors said they or their family members qualified for 
a hud home under the governments guidelines because they were 
either strapped for cash or facing eviction from previous homes 
it could be such an incredible wonderful program said jan 
johnson director of community enrichment center a homeless 
sponsor affiliated with the richland hills church of christ 
its really sad if its been abused she said

authorities have issued an arrest warrant for 
former east german leader erich honecker on charges he personally 
gave shoottokill orders at the berlin wall justice officials 
said saturday 
german police traveled to a soviet military hospital south of 
berlin where honecker is staying to take the former communist party 
chief into custody an official said the charge is manslaughter 
but cornel christoffel a spokesman for berlins justice 
authorities later told the adn news agency that honecker would not 
be taken into custody saturday night 
news of the arrest warrant came on the eve of sundays first 
allgerman elections since 1932 honecker was overthrown in october 
1989 by a peaceful revolution that eventually led to german 
unification oct 3 
honecker was very composed when he received the news of the 
arrest warrant said one of his lawyers wolfgang ziegler 
ziegler said a soviet doctor maintains honecker is too ill to be 
jailed and he did not know when the soviets would make a decision 
on whether to turn over honecker to german authorities 
christoffel a spokesman for berlins justice department said 
the warrant links honecker 78 directly to the deaths of several 
people who tried to escape east germany during his rule 
he said new documents have been uncovered that show honeckers 
signature on an order for border guards to shoot east germans 
trying flee across the berlin wall and the inner german border 
a justice ministry official in bonn ludwig kirst confirmed the 
charge against honecker is manslaughter he said the warrant was 
issued by a berlin court late friday and that german and soviet 
representatives were trying to arrange the necessary papers for 
honeckers release to german authorities 
another berlin justice official jutta limbach said officials 
would have to speak with the head of the soviet military forces in 
the former east germany the commanding officer gen boris 
vasilievich snetkov was on a business trip saturday night 
if convicted of manslaughter honecker could face a sentence of 
five years to life in prison depending on whether the court 
considers extenuating circumstances 
honecker has been living at the soviet hospital in beelitz with 
his wife margot 
honecker is also being investigated for obstruction of justice 
on allegations his regime harbored west german leftist terrorists 
the former east german government that took over last year has 
also threatened to indict honecker for corruption and treason but 
formal charges have not been filed 
in a november interview with the european newspaper the former 
communist leader was quoted as saying in the end i will be seen 
to have been right 
he also rejected personal responsibility for those killed while 
trying to flee across east germanys borders 
i am not afraid of a show trial i consider all the charges so 
far brought by the prosecutors office untenable honecker was 
quoted as saying 
news reports earlier this year had said honecker was suffering 
from cancer however recent pictures and television footage of him 
have shown a fitlooking man walking on hospital grounds 
honecker ruled east germany for 18 years until he was swept from 
power in october 1989 as a communist party official he oversaw 
the construction of the berlin wall in 1961 
more than 200 people died trying to escape from east germany 
during the 28 years that the wall stood as the cold wars most 
notorious symbol 
the opening of the wall by east german authorities on nov 9 
1989 marked the beginning of the rush to german unity

surprise presidential challenger stanislaw 
tyminski claimed saturday on national television that he has 
damaging personal materials about lech walesa 
but the solidarity leader claimed no such documents exist and 
accused his opponent of a smear campaign 
tyminski refused to release the documents saying he wanted to 
maintain the noble tone of this campaign 
the two will meet in a runoff election on sunday dec 9 
there were 160 journalists at the news conference which was 
broadcast live 
i have a lot of material in my attache case tyminski said 
some of them are personal materials some are so serious that i 
believe it needs private discussion with the candidate 
i expect that the sb former secret police is preparing 
something i wont be able to answer i think that is tyminskis 
tactic walesa said 
this is a very serious accusation and i demand that those 
documents be revealed he said reveal it immediately if i 
win i wont let you leave the country until you prove it all 
walesa claimed if such documents existed the communist regime 
would have used them during its battles with the solidarity labor 
leader during the 1980s 
tyminski requested to postpone a scheduled sunday debate until 
thursday night but walesa said he will be waiting sunday by 
law campaigning must end at noon friday 
although saturdays twohour session was not a debate the 
candidates moderators and journalists clashed frequently 
the questioning was supposed to alternate between the 
candidates but the number of inquiries for tyminski far 
outnumbered those for walesa 
neither candidate was very specific about his programs walesa 
said his positions were well known tyminski often clashed with 
journalists who accused him of not answering their questions 
tyminski came from obscurity to defeat prime minister tadeusz 
mazowiecki for a runoff spot in the first round of elections a week 
ago 
tyminski a selfproclaimed millionaire says he can bring his 
business skill to poland and produce economic improvements within a 
month 
he has appealed to poles struggling through the harsh economic 
reforms carried out by the postcommunist government and has picked 
up support among rural smalltown and young voters 
the first opinion poll published after the first round of voting 
showed walesa leading tyminski 58 percent to 30 percent 
but walesa has expressed concern about the tyminski challenge 
and he repeated saturday night that the challenger represents a 
counterrevolution and an accident on the road of accelerated 
democracy 
we need those accidents but they should not win walesa 
said 
tyminskis candidacy has been clouded by some problems over the 
past week he has rejected an interior ministry report that the 
emigre businessmans passport file shows he was in libya seven 
times during the 1980s where he received visas to return to his 
homeland 
repeatedly questioned about whether former communist party 
members or discharged secret policemen were helping his campaign 
tyminski said the background of his aides did not concern him but 
that he would publish a list of their names sunday 
tyminski said he was prepared to renounce his peruvian and 
canadian citizenships if elected president 
the candidate was vague about whether he still believes that 
poland should have nuclear weapons as he wrote in a selfpublished 
book issued in september when he returned to poland after 21 years 
and decided to run for president 
tyminski said the country is sinking because of the 
governments economic reforms which seek to create a capitalist 
system from the socialist economy he said the economic situation 
is worse now then under the communists 
i think quick changes are possible tyminski said first 
we have to open government books and find out truth because those 
books have been closed 
walesa acknowledged many hopes were not realized but said 
quick results are not possible 
i am convinced that i can lead polish reforms to achieve what 
other candidates propose but in a realistic way and not a dreaming 
way walesa said

president hissene habre fled the country 
saturday following a string of rebel victories and the 
libyanarmed guerrilla fighters later marched into the capital 
western diplomats said 
habre and much of his government sought refuge in neighboring 
cameroon the diplomats said 
as the rebels closed in soldiers threw away their guns and 
uniforms leaving the city practically undefended there was wild 
looting in the capital ndjamena by civilians and renegades from 
the chadian army 
france began organizing the evacuation of french and other 
foreign nationals living in this northcentral african nation a 
former french colony 
it was not immediately known how many rebels marched into the 
city but it appeared they were mainly advance patrols most 
guerrillas seemed to have remained in eastern chad where they have 
made significant incursions 
the rebels biggest victory has been the capture thursday of 
abeche an eastern town of about 30000 people 500 miles from 
ndjamena 
the rebels led by former armed forces chief idriss deby are 
armed by libya but there was no indication the north african 
nation was involved in the latest fighting 
libya which has made historical claims to parts of chad denies 
involvement in the rebel offensive which began nov 10 
deby helped habre 48 oust former president goukouni oueddei 
from power in 1982 
the french news agency agence francepresse cited sources in 
ndjamena as saying deby would march into the capital sunday at the 
head of an army of guerrillas and government deserters 
alingue bawayeu president of chads national assembly and 
apparently the highestranking government official left in 
ndjamena appealed for calm in an address on radio chad he said 
negotiations were under way with deby 
bawayeu who is under the protection of french troops said he 
was leading an interim government comprised of national assembly 
members and urged soldiers to lay down their weapons 
western diplomats in ndjamena and highranking sources in 
paris all speaking on condition of anonymity said habre and his 
family fled to neighboring cameroon in a military transport plane 
before dawn saturday 
they said government ministers and their entourages escaped 
across a bridge into cameroon just west across the chari river 
from ndjamena 
some officials remaining in the capital said habre had left 
ndjamena to direct attacks against rebel forces 
troops deserted en masse after rumors spread of habres flight 
angry citizens attacked government buildings or fled to cameroon 
military boots and uniforms littered the roadsides apparently 
left behind by deserters hoping to avoid reprisals from the rebels 
many soldiers turned their rifles on motorists and commandeered 
cars for the trip to cameroon or nigeria which lies further west 
across the northern tip of cameroon 
others threw away their weapons which were quickly picked up by 
looters who fired them into the air and went on rampages renegade 
troops and civilians ransacked shops and houses setting fire to 
them or stealing belongings 
political detainees and common criminals broke out of the citys 
central jail with little opposition from jailers 
less than three years ago the capital city of 400000 was 
rebuilt after suffering heavy damage from fighting in 1978 1979 
and 1982 
about 1000 foreigners mostly french assembled at the 
ndjamena airport to be evacuated a boeing 747 was to arrive with 
the first 500 or so in paris on sunday morning with another to 
follow shortly 
in washington state department spokeswoman anita stockman said 
an unspecified number of americans will be leaving ndjamena on the 
frenchchartered planes and commercial flights bound for paris on 
sunday and monday 
however a us embassy spokesman said that no orders to leave 
had been given for the 300 americans living in chad french 
officials did not expect many to be aboard 
we are suggesting it is probably a good idea to leave now but 
it would only be voluntary said the us embassy spokesman 
there are lootings and firings but im not aware of anybody 
being hurt 
the libyan news agency jana monitored in rome carried a 
communique by debys popular salvation front that promised no 
reprisals against his opponents and urged foreigners not to leave 
we reassure foreign nationals not to worry for their lives and 
property the jana dispatch cited the communique as saying 
france said saturday it was sending 150 more foreign 
legionnaires to bolster operation sparrowhawk a permanent french 
force first sent in 1986 when libya threatened to capture 
ndjamena at one point french troops in chad numbered 2700 
about 1000 french troops are now stationed here under a defense 
agreement 
paris has said that the current fighting is among chadians and 
it will not interfere 
chad contends the rebels based in neighboring sudan are backed 
by libya which occupied twothirds of chad in 1980 after habre was 
defeated by goukouni in another power struggle 
the libyans withdrew in november 1981 but made incursions from 
the north in august 1983 in 1986 libya moved further into 
northern chad occupying much of the region known as the bet the 
initials of its three departments 
despite a peace treaty signed in 1989 chad and libya continue 
to dispute a libyanoccupied strip of land on the northern frontier 
of this nation of 52 milion people 
deby a highly regarded military strategist was the mastermind 
of a series of lightning attacks the following year that drove the 
libyans from the area 
he and several other highranking officials were charged by 
habre with attempting a coup in april 1989 deby escaped and 
established a base in eastern sudan

the nations roman catholic bishops said 
saturday they are worried by indications of growing antisemitism 
especially during the current presidential campaign 
they said they plan to condemn hatred toward jews and voice 
regret for antisemitic acts committed onppolish soil in a 
longawaited pastoral letter early next year 
the text of the letter to be read at masses on jan 20 was not 
disclosed saturday but the episcopate said it responds to signs 
of antisemitism which are growing stronger especially during 
the presidential campaign 
the document which will deal with the centuriesold tradition 
of antisemitism in poland was drafted after two years work by 
the episcopate commission for dialogue with judaism 
it was long awaited by international jewish groups and expected 
to have enormous influence in poland where 93 percent of the 38 
million people consider themselves catholics 
the commission felt obliged to repeat the words of the holy 
father polishborn pope john paul ii who said during ceremonies 
to mark the 50th anniversary of world war ii that hostility and 
hatred toward judaism is in contradiction to christian values of 
human dignity the epsicopate said in a statement to the official 
pap news agency 
the rev stanislaw musial the commission secretary recently 
said poles should ask forgiveness for doing too little to save jews 
during world war ii and wipe out antisemitism 
his statement was the first by a ranking church official to 
address polishcatholic culpability in the nazi extermination of 3 
million polish jews during world war ii and discrimination suffered 
by jews in poland before and after the war only a few thousand 
jews remain in poland 
the american jewish congress published an open letter in 
midnovember expressing distress that the bishops had not yet 
issued their letter and that the current resurgence of 
antisemitism in poland has not been sufficently addressed by the 
church 
antisemitism has tainted polands first democratic presidential 
election and hate grafitti can be seen throughout the country 
rumors circulated that the devoutly catholic prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki was jewish or that his government was dominated 
by jews and questioners consistently raised the issue at campaign 
events mazowiecki was defeated in the elections first round a 
week ago but analysts attributed the loss mainly to discontent 
with economic reforms

the national league of cities on saturday 
canceled its 1991 convention in phoenix because arizona doesnt 
recognize martin luther king jrs birthday as a state holiday 
the group which has 9000 members said it would take its 
annual convention to phoenix in 1995 provided the state adopt the 
holiday to honor the slain civil rights leader 
next years league gathering was expected to draw at least 
10000 visitors and generate 69 million phoenix officials said 
racism is not a problem that can be localized to arizona by 
any stretch of the imagination its a problem that exists all over 
the nation today said phoenix mayor paul johnson 
our city has a martin luther king holiday johnson said 
were the only city in the nation today and the only city that 
sits on that board that has a holiday that was passed by a vote of 
the people 
johnson said he was disappointed with leagues decision to pull 
the convention but pleased the organization appeared to be open to 
visiting the city in 1995 
its better than i expected johnson said 
the leagues decision to give phoenix a second chance in 1995 
was suggested by tucson mayor tom volgy montana and new hampshire 
also do not recognize kings birthday as a legal holiday 
this organization is an organization that has been built on 
diversity and mutual respect and wherever this organization goes 
it deserves to go only to the cities that do display that same 
mutual respect volgy said 
he said cities like phoenix and tucson should not be penalized 
for their states inaction 
we need this organization to say the right thing to phoenix 
because phoenix did the right thing volgy said 
daniel tabor presidentelect of the national black caucus of 
local elected officials and a councilman from inglewood calif 
said his group met friday night with johnson and other phoenix 
representatives but were not convinced to back holding the league 
convention in arizona 
the caucus serves as an advisory committee for the league which 
consists of elected municipal leaders who represent more than 1300 
cities in 49 states while we understood both the economic and 
other issues related to a convention of this size going to their 
city we thought a higher precedent was one that made a statement 
that nbcleo and its membership would not could not go to phoenix 
because we cannot separate phoenix from the state of arizona 
tabor said 
members agreed that regardless of costs and the ability to find 
a new location for the december 1991 convention it would be worth 
because they would not go against a previously stated position by 
the league 
i want to send a negative message to the voters of arizona who 
put us in this position said george d goodman executive 
director of the michigan municipal league and the only way we 
can do that is to postpone our convention in their state

which where agreed to by alyeska pipeline and government 
regulators for possible corrosion and subsequent weakening 
in a separate probe state and federal officials are 
investigating allegations that thorpe technical workers abused

the publisher of the strikebound daily news 
urged the metropolitan transit authority on saturday to seek an 
injunction if transit workers strike because of newspaper sales in 
subways 
publisher james hoge sent mta chief robert kiley a letter 
telling him it is illegal for transit workers to strike and he is 
required to seek an injunction if a strike is threatened 
the mta has a choice hoge wrote it can uphold the rule 
of law or it can capitulate to the rule of force we think that the 
choice is clear 
hoges letter resulted from furor over a temporary court order 
issued friday that allows hawkers to sell the daily news in train 
stations as long as they stay within 10 feet of newsstands or news 
vending boxes that dont carry the news 
unions striking the newspaper said they would picket alongside 
hawkers in train stations and transit union leaders said they would 
honor such picket lines a transit strike would be devastating to 
commuters 
john cunningham a spokesman for the mta would not comment 
saturday on hoges letter 
the newspaper filed a lawsuit friday challenging a decision by 
the mta to bar the hawkers from subways and commuter railroads 
which are run by the mta out of fear over a transit strike 
the court order temporarily restoring the hawkers right to sell 
the tabloid was issued by us district judge miriam g cedarbaum 
cedarbaums temporary restraining order expires in 10 days she 
scheduled a hearing for friday to hear arguments before deciding 
whether to issue a preliminary injunction which would stay in 
effect until the case is decided 
the newspaper has printed every day since the strike began but 
distribution has been a major problem the hawkers were taken on by 
the news after many newsstands refused to carry the newspaper 
during the strike circulation has dropped from 106 million per 
weekday to just over 500000 daily the news said 
the news said it depended on hawkers as the only viable 
means of distributing the newspaper in the transit system because 
hardly any newsstands haved carried it since the strike by about 
2100 daily news workers began oct 25

karpov for the world chess championship adjourned 
the two soviet grandmasters resume play sunday with each 
holding 75 points after 15 completed matches in the marathon 
competition 
they have had three draws in the french portion of the 
championship they had 10 draws in the 12 games played at new york 
between oct 8 and nov 7 
kasparov opened saturdays match with a scottish defense a move 
he normally does not favor but also used in the 14th match after 
an exchange of pawns karpov tried and failed to free up his 
center 
this allowed kasparov to pressure column c with his bishops and 
majority of pawns on the kings wing giving him advantage 
karpov put kasparov in check in the 12th move 
karpov was forced to sacrifice a pawn in the 16th move to free 
his pieces but in the event allowed kasparov to develop a queen 
attack 
karpov tried shoring his pawn defense but was left in a weaker 
position 
the players made their last 17 moves in 25 minutes before 
adjourning with karpov putting his opponent in check in the 38th

the countrys armed forces chief 
gen arnulfo cantarero lopez resigned saturday apparently due to a 
power struggle within the military 
president rafael leonardo callejas made a nationally broadcast 
statement to deny radio reports the general had been arrested 
the armed forces official announcement cited unspecified 
overriding personal reasons for the resignation but it 
appeared to be linked to a longrunning battle over promotions 
within the military 
cantarero 45 served 10 months of his threeyear command in the 
politically powerful post he was previously head of the navy 
the militarys high council which includes 50 key military 
officers said it would propose successors for cantarero infantry 
col jose de jesus banegas chief of the armed forces joint 
command will temporarily fill the post 
some local radio stations reported cantarero had been detained 
at an air force base outside the capital such detentions have 
occurred during some toplevel armed forces shakeups in the past 
but callejas said cantarero was at his home in tegucigalpa 
enjoying all of the rights and privileges conferred by the 
constitution the armed forces law and other legal rules 
the resignation appears to signal resurgence of a simmering 
struggle between different classes of graduates from the military 
academy younger officers have often backed efforts to change 
leadership which open opportunities for advancement 
the disputes led to several changes in national leadership when 
the military ruled honduras from 1963 to 1981 the military remains 
a powerful force in local politics 
according to the honduran constitution the legislature will 
name a replacement for cantarero by choosing from three officers 
submitted by the high council

the soviet union is still suffering too much 
from the war in afghanistan to be able to send troops to a persian 
gulf war a top aide to soviet president mikhail gorbachev said in 
an interview published sunday 
it would be unjust and unwise to expect direct involvement in 
a war georgi shakhnazarov told the washington post he referred 
to his countrys nineyear involvement in afghanistan that left 
nearly 15000 soviet soldiers dead the soviets withdrew in 
february 1989 
its the same situation as when the united states just 
finished the war in vietnam the 66yearold foreign policy 
adviser said in an interview in moscow 
shakhnazarov said he was speaking personally but the newspaper 
noted that such senior officials rarely contradict policy when 
giving interviews for publication 
on thursday foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said in the 
united nations that everyone should know that we will not 
hesitate to use force to protect soviet citizens still in iraq

president bushs selection of william j 
bennett to head the republican party is drawing fire from a civil 
rights group citing the former education secretarys opposition to 
affirmative action 
his department had a woeful record of enforcing the civil 
rights laws when he was secretary of education said ralph g 
neas executive director of the leadership conference on civil 
rights 
bush announced friday that he would ask the republican national 
committee to elect bennett its chairman when it convenes in 
january 
he also announced he was nominating outgoing florida gov bob 
martinez to succeed bennett in the position of director of the 
office of national drug control policy the nations socalled drug 
czar 
bush described bennett as a man of proven leadership 
intellect and commitment whose drive and determination will be a 
tremendous asset to the republican party organizations and 
operations 
neas however was sharply critical of bennetts opposition to 
affirmative action as education secretary from 1985 until the final 
year of ronald reagans presidency he linked bennett to sen jesse 
helms rnc and edwin meese iii who served as attorney general 
in the reagan administration 
bennett campaigned this fall for helms in his race for 
reelection to the senate from north carolina in a close contest 
with democrat harvey gantt who is black helms appeared to pull 
away after running a commercial that said the democrat supported 
racial quotas that would give jobs to blacks in preference to 
better qualified whites 
mr bennett is from the ed meesejesse helms wing of the 
republican party neas declared 
bennett would succeed lee atwater who has been sidelined by a 
brain tumor 
bush said atwater would assume the role of general chairman a 
post that doesnt currently exist 
im delighted that lee atwater will continue to provide valued 
counsel as general chairman of the party said the president 
he has been as you all know a close adviser and political 
strategist chief political strategist and a good friend 
atwater was manager of bushs 1988 presidential campaign and is 
regarded as a master political tactician 
bennett has no handson political experience but is viewed as an 
articulate spokesman for conservative views friday was bennetts 
last day as head of the government office of drug policy a post he 
held for the first 19 months of the bush administration 
republican operatives generally praised the choice of bennett 
particularly his ability to appeal to social and ideological 
conservatives 
if theres anything the republican party has lacked over the 
past year its been a voice said michele davis executive 
director of the gop governors association the base needs to be 
talked to in pretty plain terms and if theres anything thats a 
specialty of bill bennett its plain speaking 
the fact that the 47yearold bennett was a democrat until four 
years ago was viewed by some republicans as a plus 
bill can reinforce the conservative base of the party said 
edward j rollins cochairman of the house republican campaign 
committee hes a convert to republicanism so i think its a 
great statement to make to reagan democrats 
republicans also saw bennett as a spokesman able to hold his own 
in debates with democratic party chairman ronald h brown 
brown said he welcomed the appointment of bennett 
if bennett accomplishes as much for the republican party as he 
achieved at the education department and in ridding us of drugs and 
violence americans will have to begin worrying about the future of 
the twoparty system the democrat said 
bush said that in replacing bennett he was giving martinez a 
battlefield promotion for a leader who has earned his stripes on 
the front lines of the drug war 
in his four years as governor martinez stressed tough 
penalties law enforcement and prison construction over drug 
treatment and prevention but drug crimes escalated significantly 
during his tenure 
he stiffened the florida code and then added the prison space 
to enforce it as a governor who signed more than 130 death 
warrants he understands tough choices bush said 
but martinez nomination brought criticism from some on capitol 
hill that he was not well qualified sen joseph biden ddel 
chairman of the senate judiciary committee said martinez lacks 
the background and record for the post 
as for bennetts lack of experience as a political technician 
roger stone a republican consultant said the new party chairman 
is not lee atwater 
he cant be lee atwater stone said but if ron brown 
wants to debate affirmative action id have a lot of confidence 
sending bill bennett into that debate 
as an academic bennett wrote extensively in opposition to 
affirmative action 
bennett is an intellectual who believes that ideas move the 
world said gop consultant david keene a lot of politicians 
make the opposite mistake and assume that ideas dont have any 
consequence when in fact they do

a former regulator says sen alan cranston 
waged a telephone campaign to aid charles h keatings savings and 
loan association while keating was funneling large sums of money to 
groups formed by the lawmaker 
it was unusual for a senator to place so many telephone calls 
to me with regard to a single savings and loan institution m 
danny wall said in a deposition released friday by the senate 
ethics committee 
had i known at the time that the communications to me from 
senator cranston were contemporaneous with these substantial 
contributions from mr keating i would have been very disturbed 
he said 
wall former head of the federal home loan bank board will 
undergo public questioning next week at hearings on the keating 
five senators 
the five are accused of improperly intervening in the regulatory 
process on behalf of keating and his lincoln savings and loan 
association of irvine calif while receiving hefty political 
contributions from him 
lincolns 2 billion collapse has been perhaps the most 
spectacular of the savings and loan crisis and keating is now under 
indictment in california 
besides cranston a california democrat the five senators are 
republican john mccain of arizona and democrats dennis deconcini of 
arizona donald riegle of michigan and john glenn of ohio 
all five lawmakers have denied any impropriety and said 
contributions from keating were unrelated to efforts on behalf of 
lincoln 
cranston received the bulk of the 13 million keating and his 
associates gave to the campaigns and causes of the lawmakers 
keating gave 850000 to three voterregistration groups associated 
with cranston and 39000 to the california senators campaigns 
another regulator michael patriarca testified friday that an 
april 9 1987 meeting in deconcinis office with the five senators 
made him and several of his colleagues feel as if they had been 
called on the carpet over their examination of lincoln savings 
he said the mood changed when they told the senators there was 
evidence of criminal violations and that they were recommending a 
justice department investigation 
at first i think it was hostile the san franciscobased 
thrift examiner said 
i felt we were being dressed down by the senators for 
inappropriate behavior and the conduct and length of the 
examination he said 
supporting testimony from his former boss edwin j gray 
patriarca said deconcini was the leader of the senators efforts to 
help keating 
he said deconcini offered a deal that lincoln would make more 
home mortgage loans if regulators would back off a regulation 
limiting its ability to make speculative investments 
patriarca said the senators seemed to have made up their minds 
that the regulators were dragging their feet and harassing lincoln 
patriarca said it was wrong for a senator to attempt to 
influence to change the outcome of an examination 
my personal view is senator deconcini did that he said 
its not clear to me that any of the others did 
but patriarca also said he would fault the senators generally 
because they appeared to have made up their minds in advance 
that keating was right and the regulators were wrong in finding 
serious problems at lincoln
