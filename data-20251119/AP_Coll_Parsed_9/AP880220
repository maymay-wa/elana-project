secretary of state george p shultz will have 
to overcome yitzhak shamirs growing opposition if he expects the 
new us peace proposals to get anywhere 
the 72yearold prime minister a former underground fighter and 
senior spymaster has a reputation for being toughminded aides 
say he will not yield to the pressure of negative publicity or 
diplomatic armtwisting 
shamir has expressed serious reservations and some annoyance 
about american ideas for reviving progress toward peace in the 
middle east to clear the air in advance of the shultz visit next 
week he sent emissaries to washington to declare what he would and 
would not accept 
one envoy was ehud olmert a senior figure in shamirs 
conservative likud bloc who said he told shultz the prime minister 
would not agree to territorial compromise in advance of peace talks 
territory for peace is a nonstarter olmert said in an 
interview we are ready to negotiate on the territorial issue 
but that doesnt mean we are ready to accept withdrawing from the 
territories before negotiations 
israel has occupied the west bank and gaza strip since capturing 
them from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
shultz suggested the landforpeace formula in a speech to the 
council on foreign relations in washington and it apparently upset 
shamir 
the timing manner and phrasing was inappropriate inasmuch as 
he wants to have the prime minister in the process olmert said 
adding that he believed the secretary of state realized his 
mistake 
shultzs plan calls for 
an international forum that would convene by april to launch 
arabisraeli negotiations the soviets would likely play an equal 
role with washington 
an interim solution for the west bank and gaza in the form of 
selfrule for the 15 million palestinians who live there 
elections would be held by october to choose a selfgoverning body 
talks on the final status of the occupied lands to start by 
december even without progress on autonomy 
shamir initially indicated flexibility to encourage 
negotiations but the suggestion that he would agree to yield some 
of the occupied land caused a storm of protest among likud 
hardliners 
perhaps fearing concessions would be seen as giving in to arab 
rioters shamir has drawn back with tougher rhetoric and warnings 
between the lines that he will not accept pressure from the 
americans 
he has been cool to soviet involvement requested a clearer 
definition of the forum that would launch negotiations and 
expressed opposition to linking talks on a temporary solution in 
the occupied territories with negotiations on a permanent 
settlement 
he argues that several years of experience with limited 
selfrule is needed to build confidence for a stable solution 
there is a need for a considerable period of practical 
experience of coexistence between us and the palestinian arab 
authorities before the question of sovereignty can be approached 
shamir said in a speech this week 
shultz will begin a middle east shuttle thursday after a visit 
to moscow using jerusalem as a base and traveling to jordan egypt 
and possibly other arab countries israeli officials said 
his most intensive shuttle however may be between shamir and 
foreign minister shimon peres the two partners and rivals in 
israels coalition government and who disagree sharply on strategy 
for peace 
they are miles apart an official close to peres said 
privately shultz will try to bring them to together as he has in 
the past 
peres leader of the centerleft labor party has endorsed 
jordans proposal for an international conference which shamir 
says would be biased against israel labor accepts the 
landforpeace formula but the likud fears giving up land would 
make israel vulnerable 
aides to both leaders say shultz will concentrate on winning 
shamirs agreement since peres already has accepted the shultz 
plan shultzs major goal is to convince shamir one official 
said 
a senior aide to shamir also speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the prime minister views the shultz visit with 
caution but is ready to listen and give his position some of 
his shultzs ideas are okay and others are not the aide said

the reputed leader of a chicagoarea group called 
the skinheads and five other alleged white supremacists were 
indicted friday for attacking a woman and drawing a swastika on her 
wall with her blood 
authorities believe the defendants beat the 20yearold woman 
with whom they were acquainted because she had black friends 
states attorneys spokeswoman lisa howard said 
the groups leader clark martell 28 and the others were 
charged with home invasion robbery theft and two counts of 
aggravated battery ms howard said 
arrested with them jan 25 was an unidentified 16yearold whose 
indictment had been expected friday but was delayed until later 
this month because a special hearing must be held to charge him as 
an adult ms howard said 
the victim was not identified to protect her from members of the 
white supremacist group ms howard said 
the suspects are accused of pushing their way into the womans 
north side apartment last april forcing her to the floor and 
repeatedly punching and kicking her 
after her attackers sprayed a macetype chemical in her face 
the woman managed to break free and lock herself in the bathroom 
where she passed out ms howard said 
the defendants allegedly ransacked her apartment stole jewelry 
and clothing and drew swastikas throughout her home ms howard 
said 
most of the nazi symbols were spraypainted or drawn with 
markers but one swastika on the womans living room wall was drawn 
with the victims blood ms howard said 
prosecutors believe the attack was motivated by the 
defendants anger over the victims friendship with blacks ms 
howard said the victim had formerly associated with the skinheads 
she said 
this type of crime which is nothing more than vicious race 
hatred will not be tolerated in cook county just as it cannot be 
tolerated anywhere in our society states attorney richard m 
daley said in a statement 
these defendants will be prosecuted to fullest extent of the 
law as will anyone who dares to commit such a cowardly crime he 
said 
the home invasion charge which is the most serious has a 
maximum prison sentence of 30 years and a minimum of six years 
without probation ms howard said the robbery charge can bring as 
much as seven years in prison and the theft and battery charges can 
bring as much as fiveyear terms each she said 
the others indicted were identified as morgan kipp 18 her 
brother sean kipp 20 cassandra clark 20 tracy zajdel 20 and 
kevin jamison 26 they are scheduled to be arraigned march 11 
before chief criminal court judge richard fitzgerald all except 
martell are free on 50000 bond 
the states attorneys office will seek to try the juvenile as 
an adult 
martell is scheduled to appear in court twice on charges 
stemming from separate racial attacks before the hearing on the 
latest indictments 
skinheads is a name some white supremacists across the nation 
have given themselves in accordance with their practice of shaving 
their heads but some people enjoy the music and fashion of the 
skinheads without sharing their racist sentiments said terry 
levin a spokesman for the states attorneys office

panama apparently seeking a way out of a 
legal and diplomatic predicament with the united states made 
discreet inquiries about us willingness to drop federal charges 
against military strong man gen manuel antonio noriega 
administration officials say 
the state department confirmed friday that panamanian 
authorities had asked about that possibility and that assistant 
secretary of state elliott abrams raised the matter with the 
justice department 
after being told that dropping the charges was technically 
possible abrams relayed that message wednesday to panamanian 
president eric arturo delvalle during an unannounced meeting in 
miami 
but during their discussion abrams made no deal offered no 
deal and was not in a position to offer a deal state department 
spokesman charles redman said 
redman added that the indictments against noriega are 
obviously based on strong evidence and we have every intention 
on carrying through with them 
the panamanian embassy had no comment on the miami meeting 
saying only that delvalle had gone to miami for medical treatment 
redman denied an account in the new york times that said abrams 
told delvalle the indictment might be dropped if noriega withdrew 
from politics and went into exile the times cited as its sources 
us officials and congressional staff members it did not name 
the panamanian inquiry was made as a political crisis grew in 
panama brought on in part by noriegas legal problems 
indictments handed down in florida two weeks ago portrayed 
noriega as a key member of an international drug trafficking 
conspiracy 
among other activities he was accused of providing protection 
and other government services to international drug smugglers who 
shipped cocaine and marijuana to the united states through panama 
uspanamanian agreements do not provide for his extradition 
making it virtually impossible for noriega to be brought to trial 
at the same time the reagan administration is deeply concerned 
about panamas political stability and has been encouraging noriega 
and his military allies to withdraw from politics 
the administration believes that the security of the panama 
canal is best assured through elected civilian rule delvalle is 
widely viewed as a figurehead president who bows to noriegas 
wishes 
the times account said that under the formula abrams discussed 
noriega could move to any country he wished without having to 
concern himself with the possibility of extradition to the united 
states 
with noriega living in exile this scenario also could enhance 
the possibility consistent with us objectives of an evolution 
to a civilianled government in panama 
but redman insisted that the administration has no interest in 
any arrangement for noriega to be exiled in exchange for a drop of 
the charges 
we all see the drug problem of tremendous importance in the 
united states as well as throughout the hemisphere redman said 
reaffirming that the indictments will not be withdrawn

a federal prosecutor in miami says he was 
treated like the enemy by us diplomats and stymied by 
superiors in the us attorneys office after he discovered oliver 
norths contra supply network 
jeffrey feldman an assistant us attorney says in a sworn 
statement the us ambassador to costa rica turned white after 
learning what feldman knew in the spring of 1986 eight months 
before the irancontra arms and money affair dominated the news 
and feldman described months of unsuccessful efforts to take the 
investigation to the grand jury with his boss telling him in 
august 1986 that politics was responsible for the delay 
feldman other prosecutors and an fbi agent unveiled the story 
of the miami investigation in sworn statements to the congressional 
irancontra committees they were released this week by a senate 
foreign relations subcommittee 
feldman admitted he should have been more aggressive in 
pursuing the north network because history has basically 
spoken 
feldman and two fbi agents went to costa rica on march 31 1986 
to investigate an alleged murder plot against thenus ambassador 
lewis tambs the prosecutor said the plot proved to be bogus but 
he did obtain details about a private supply network for the 
usbacked contra rebels trying to overthrow the nicaraguan 
government 
feldman said he made the information into a chart with norths 
name on the top north a national security council aide directed 
the secret operations to sell arms to iran and aid the contras 
despite a law prohibiting such assistance 
the ambassador turned white feldman said describing tambs 
after he was shown the chart tambs was identified in the 
irancontra hearings as a key link in norths network 
the only thing he said when i pulled out the chart was get 
fernandez in here the words are indelibly imprinted in my mind 
feldman said 
joe fernandez then cia station chief in costa rica knew he 
was dealing with three people feldman and two fbi agents who had 
only seen the tip of an iceberg and was trying to rip the 
credibility of the various people who were making the allegations 
that we were exploring feldman said 
feldman said he and the fbi investigators with him in costa rica 
were being treated like the enemy for the rest of their stay 
he added i felt perhaps we were being watched 
throughout the spring and summer of 1986 feldman asked his 
boss us attorney leon kellner in miami to allow the case to go 
to a grand jury 
but feldman who at the time did not realize the full 
significance of what he had discovered said he was stalled for 
months by kellner and other top assistants in the office 
kellners assistants said the case wasnt far enough along to 
move to the grand jury and on aug 29 feldman said kellner told 
him politics are involved 
the secret sale of us weapons to iran and the diversion of 
profits to the contras didnt dominate public attention until nov 
25 1986 after a lebanese news magazine disclosed secret 
negotiations over american hostages between the united states and 
iran 
kellner in his deposition acknowledged telling feldman that 
politics were causing a delay but denied that he was referring to 
the discovery of norths network 
instead kellner said he referred to allegations he received 
from procontra mercenaries that aides to massachusetts sen john 
kerry were paying informants to lie 
kellner admitted he did not tell feldman about these allegations 
when he used the word politics but kellner decided not to 
give the case to the grand jury without first discussing these 
allegations with the justice department 
feldman who then was 29 years old acknowledged in his 
statement that he did not focus on north who was directing the 
irancontra effort feldman said he thought the case was mainly 
about paramilitary groups illegally aiding the contras 
for the most part the case is about people in private 
organizations basically on their own going out and recruiting 
help for the contras or putting their own little paramilitary 
groups together feldman said

retail food prices will rise more slowly this 
year than last years 42 percent increase mainly because of a 
sharp increase in meat production the agriculture department says 
the forecast however is based on an expected jump in pork and 
poultry production which should more than offset a drop in beef 
output in figuring retail food prices according to a usda report 
issued this week 
that does not necessarily mean any boon for consumers unwilling 
to forgo beef in favor of pork and poultry the national 
cattlemens association already is hailing a decline of 3 million 
head in the us herd as of jan 1 to 99 million as a bullish 
signal for increased beef prices 
usdas economic research service says red meat production in 
1987 totaled 38449000 pounds and poultry 19765000 pounds 
consumption of red meat and poultry combined was 2167 pounds per 
capita last year 
the forecast issued this week said red meat production this year 
should reach 38345000 pounds and poultry 20935000 it estimated 
per capita consumption at 2219 pounds 
retail food prices last year were 333 percent of their 1967 
level according to the report the report did not attempt to 
estimate precisely how much they would climb over the year ahead 
but merely said the increase would be less than that of 1987 
the report also said hog profits fell sharply in the final 
quarter of 1987 and probably will continue to drop this year net 
returns could average only slightly above the breakeven point it 
said

308500 tons china 299000 tons and morocco 220800 tons the 
department said 
usda said sales of sorghum totaled 347100 tons the most in the 
current marketing year the increase was attributed mainly to

weeks mark and 72 percent above the fourweek average japan was 
the main purchaser followed by romania the netherlands and mexico

percent below the previous weeks mark and 50 percent off from the 
fourweek average

surgeon general c everett koop says public 
health officials agree that heterosexuals are at risk for 
contracting aids despite recent published accounts that give the 
impression heterosexuals are relatively safe 
koop said friday that several articles including one in 
cosmopolitan magazine wrongly led women and heterosexual men to 
believe they are not at risk 
the risk is real koop told the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on health it is just not true that there is no 
danger from normal vaginal intercourse what is unknown is the 
level of danger there is always a danger whenever people engage in 
casual sex outside the marriage relationship even if their 
promiscuity is heterosexual 
as of feb 15 there were 53814 cases of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome reported to the federal centers for disease 
control about 65 percent were in homosexual or bisexual males and 
17 percent were in intravenous drug abusers 
while only 4 percent of current aids cases are reported among 
heterosexuals koop said that proportion is expected to rise to 5 
percent in the 1990s 
koop told the subcommittee that medical personnel generally have 
responded well to the aids crisis but he said there is a minority 
of medical personnel who refuse not only to treat persons with 
aids but also turn away patients alleged to be from population 
groups identified with those two highrisk behaviors that is 
homosexual and bisexual males and intravenous drug abusers 
he characterized that behavior as unworthy of anyone in the 
health or social service professions 
those who turn away aids patients use the excuse that the 
disease is fatal and contagious koop said but the plain fact is 
that the risk of contracting aids from an infected patient is 
extremely small and nearly always preventable 
of nearly 7 million health professionals in the country koop 
said fewer than a dozen became infected with the aids virus while 
doing their jobs and in most cases that exposure could have been 
prevented if the person had followed guidelines published five 
years ago by the cdc 
cdc director james mason another witness said more than 15 
million americans are being tested anonymously each year for aids 
through blood banks and the military and in 30 communities 
he said more anonymous testing should be done to get a better 
fix on the extent of aids infection in the united states but he 
rejected rep william dannemeyers idea that anyone coming in 
contact with the health system be tested 
dannemeyer rcalif has introduced legislation that would 
require testing of hospital patients clinic patients marriage 
license applicants and others he also wants to require reporting 
by name of any positive test results 
mason endorsed the general approach sponsored by subcommittee 
chairman rep henry waxman dcalif which includes voluntary 
testing confidentiality and antidiscrimination protection for 
those with the disease or virus 
where theres worry about confidentiality or discrimination 
theres a chilling effect mason said

american military intervention may be needed 
in colombia to halt the flow of narcotics to us cities sen john 
f kerry says 
weve gotten to the point where we have to be prepared to be 
tough we cannot be patsies about this stuff the massachusetts 
democrat said friday we ought to make it permanently hot for 
them down there 
kerry chairman of the senate foreign relations subcommittee on 
narcotics and terrorism said the united states should provide 
colombia with helicopters communications equipment and other 
military systems to combat the regions drug czars he said an 
estimated 80 percent of the narcotics entering the united states 
come from colombia 
but the senator added that military assistance may not be enough 
and that the administration should be willing to send troops to the 
area if necessary to help colombian agents 
im willing and i think we ought to consider the use of our 
southern command forces to assist in the interdiction effort on a 
casebycase basis they ought to be able to do that because what 
you have here is literally a paramilitary organization that youre 
fighting against kerry told reporters 
this is a very sophisticated effort were working against and 
if it takes the visibility of our military force thats worth 
it to me he added 
last april 14 us military advisers were sent to bolivia to 
help train bolivian antidrug police 
in july 1986 the united states sent 175 soldiers provide 
logistical support for bolivian antidrug operations that program 
ended in november 1986 
meanwhile kerry released a letter to sen lawton chiles 
dfla chairman of the senate budget committee urging the 
immediate transfer of 50 million from the defense department to 
the coast guard which is charged largely with battling drug 
trafficking at sea 
kerry lambasted president reagan for a series of coast guard 
budget cuts 
im tired of this phony war on drugs where they talk about it 
where they stand nancy reagan up at the state of the union 
message and try to pretend the war on drugs is rampaging across the 
country and meanwhile they cut the guts out of the law enforcement 
effort that type of hypocrisy has simply got to stop kerry said 
he also called for a tightening of banking regulations for cash 
transactions and increasing penalties for drug trafficking

president reagan and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl are lauding a western effort to build a common arms 
control strategy so nato can manage the soviets with realism 
strength and alliance unity 
the two leaders ended talks at the white house on friday with a 
pledge to intensify the effort at a nato summit march 23 
what we need now is an overall concept covering the whole 
field of disarmament and there i do not see any difference between 
us and the americans kohl told reporters before heading back to 
bonn 
we agreed that we must deal with the soviet union from a 
position of realism strength and alliance unity 
since reaching agreement with the soviets to eliminate 
landbased nuclear missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3125 
miles the united states and its allies have been trying to set 
goals for further talks with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
his aides 
we want to get out of a situation where we merely react to 
proposals which have been submitted by gorbachev we want to put 
down proposals and let him react to them kohl said 
secretary of state george p shultz who attended the white 
house meeting left later in the day for another round of 
negotiations with the soviets in moscow kohl said shultz pledged 
to convey to the soviets the west german concern about ethnic 
germans facing discrimination in soviet bloc countries 
nato already has agreed on a first priority of a ussoviet 
reduction in longrange missiles and bombers while seeking cuts in 
conventional and chemical weapons 
we were in agreement that all these disarmament questions and 
issues as well as the necessary measures to preserve our common 
security should be combined in form and overall concept for our 
alliance kohl said 
each of the 16 allies depending on its politics and geography 
has different interests to advance and one of the key differences 
was reflected in comments after kohls meeting with reagan 
west germany is particularly eager for negotiations to reduce 
tactical nuclear weapons those with ranges below 300 miles and 
wants those talks included in any conferences that deal with 
conventional weapons kohl whose country would be threatened by 
such weapons if a war broke out in europe reiterated the desire 
for quick and comprehensive talks on the shortrange systems 
the united states which believes tactical nuclear weapons are 
necessary to deter a conventional attack wants to defer 
negotiations to reduce the shortrange systems indeed it is 
working on plans to modernize these weapons with nato approval 
during kohls visit the two sides sought to minimize the 
importance of the disagreement kohl said he did not favor the 
elimination of the tactical nuclear weapons artillery shells and 
shortrange missiles 
he does not seek a denuclearized zone least of all in 
europe kohl said 
kohl was asked at the news conference about concerns that 
modernization of shortrange weapons would touch off protests like 
those that rocked europe in the early 1980s after nato decided to 
deploy intermediaterange weapons 
i dont share that fear kohl said 
in its efforts to play down the issue the reagan administration 
noted during kohls visit that further study is needed before the 
most powerful of the shortrange systems a missile to replace the 
75milerange lance is deployed and it may not go into operation 
before 1995

rep newt gingrich contending that published 
reports have outlined clear violations of house rules by 
speaker jim wright says he intends to ask the house ethics 
committee next month to launch a formal investigation 
gingrich rga told a news conference friday that the house 
needs to know the truth about the allegations of corruption that 
have been leveled at wright dtexas in news accounts over the 
past decade 
were going to have to at least at a minimum insist that we 
find out what the truth is and on march 3 i intend to create that 
opportunity gingrich said 
wrights office did not return a telephone call friday seeking 
comment on gingrichs plan to seek an ethics committee 
investigation 
gingrich said two specific published reports about wright 
provide clear evidence that he violated house rules one involved 
wrights failure since 1980 to file the required financial 
disclosure reports for a company in which he is a partner 
the other involved 55 percent royalties wright received for a 
book published by a friend whose printing company worked for 
wrights campaign committee house rules prohibit members from 
receiving royalties in excess of the usual and customary value 
for such services gingrich said and most authors receive 
royalties of 6 percent to 8 percent 
gingrich said the ethics panel also should investigate wrights 
connection to texas savings and loan association officials who are 
under investigation by federal authorities 
the democratic congressional campaign committee last month 
accused gingrich and a political action committee he heads of mail 
fraud and asked the postal service to investigate the dccc said 
the pac collected more than 200000 through mail solicitations of 
contributions for conservative candidates but provided only 3000 
to such candidates 
gingrich who has denied the accusations said friday the dccc 
complaint was a smoke screen designed to discredit him 
politically so he could not pursue the ethics complaints against 
wright 
under house rules any member can ask the ethics panel to 
investigate another member the committee composed of six 
democrats and six republicans can reject such a request only by a 
majority vote 
gingrich said it would be inconceivable that the committee 
would refuse to investigate the allegations but if that happens 
he said he intends to force the issue on the house floor with a 
series of privileged votes that could tie up house business 
gingrich tried unsuccessfully last year to persuade the house to 
create an outside commission to investigate ethics complaints 
against wright and other democratic leaders 
he said he was announcing his intention to seek an investigation 
of wright now to give other house members time to familiarize 
themselves with the long list of allegations 
gingrich has criticized the ethics committee in the past for its 
lenient treatment of democrats accused of wrongdoing but he said 
friday he has more confidence in the panel after its recent votes 
to reprimand one democratic congressman and recommend the expulsion 
of another 
he said he believes the panel can conduct a fair investigation 
of wright if it will agree to hire an outside attorney acceptable 
to both republican and democratic house leaders and to complete its 
investigation before congress adjourns for the year

a proposed merger between two of the nations 
largest manufacturers of glass containers remains on hold today in 
the wake of a ruling by a federal appeals court 
late friday afternoon the us court of appeals issued an 
administrative stay of a lower court decision that would have 
cleared the way for the merger between owensillinois inc and 
brockway inc 
earlier in the day the federal trade commission had asked the 
appeals court to extend until next tuesday a restraining order 
blocking the merger until the agency could decide whether to appeal 
a ruling by us district court judge joyce hens green 
on thursday green refused the ftcs request for a preliminary 
injunction ruling that the ftc had not proven the deal would harm 
competition 
ftc spokeswoman susan tichnor said the agency will have until 
next tuesday to file an appeal and that the court will issue a 
decision sometime after owensillinois files a response wednesday 
attorneys for owensillinois said there is no excuse for the 
ftcs unusual filing friday to keep the merger on hold until 
the agency can decide whether to appeal 
the ftc has been acutely aware since the beginning of this 
case of the extreme time sensitivity surrounding the merger and in 
that regard has had ample time to prepare for the possibility of a 
decision adverse to it said paul warnke an attorney for 
owensillinois 
last september the toledo ohiobased owensillinois proposed 
to buy brockway of jacksonville fla for 750 million or 60 
per share 
the merger would make the combined company the largest 
manufacturer of glass containers in the industry the nations top 
manufacturer is anchor glass container corp which controls 237 
percent of the market 
the ftc has said the merger might violate federal antitrust laws 
by substantially reducing competition in the glass container 
industry and creating conditions for price discrimination it wants 
to halt the merger until it can conduct an administrative review of 
the proposal 
but green accepted the argument advanced by the two 
manufacturers that competition from the plastics and 
metalpackaging industry will hold down prices

peace talks between nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government and contra rebels are right back where they 
began mired in a dispute over what comes first democracy or a 
truce 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo the nicaraguan roman catholic 
church leader who has been mediating the negotiations abruptly 
suspended the latest round of talks friday indirectly blaming the 
sandinistas for their failure 
obando y bravo said he was disappointed that both sides had not 
accepted at least in principle a proposal he put forth thursday 
in an attempt to break a deadlock that arose in the first hours of 
the talks 
that impasse stemmed from what the cardinal said was the 
inability of the two sides to agree on whether they should 
negotiate a ceasefire to obtain democracy or negotiate democracy 
to obtain a ceasefire 
more than 40000 people have been killed since november 1981 
when the contras began fighting the sandinista government 
the cardinals plan called on the contras to accept a truce in 
exchange for four major concessions by the government they were 
concessions the contras have long sought and they quickly accepted 
the proposal in principle 
but victor hugo tinoco nicaraguas deputy foreign minister 
said the cardinal suspended the talks in midafternoon friday 
before he could deliver his governments formal written response 
which also conditionally accepted the plan 
the confusion apparently arose because president daniel ortega 
initially instructed his negotiators to reject obando y bravos 
proposal as unsuitable for discussion at talks the sandinista 
leader felt should be aimed solely at the mechanics of achieving a 
ceasefire 
the government apparently changed its mind later and authorized 
tinoco to accept conditionally the cardinals plan by then obando 
y bravo had suspended the negotiations without setting a time or 
place for a new round of talks 
contra negotiators announced their tentative acceptance of 
obando y bravos proposal at a news conference thursday night 
shortly afterward tinoco told reporters the plan was interesting 
and constructive but needed clarification 
paul reichler a washington dc attorney advising the 
sandinistas said ortega advised the government negotiators during 
a telephone conference later thursday evening to reject obando y 
bravos proposal 
reichler quoted ortega as saying that if obando y bravo felt the 
issues he raised in his proposal were of vital importance to the 
nicaraguan people the president would discuss them with the 
cardinal personally 
but reichler said ortegas initial reaction was that he would 
not discuss political issues at the bargaining table with the 
contras a position the nicaraguan leader has long held 
obando y bravos plan called for the contras to move into 
unspecified enclaves or zones with their arms and equipment 
during a 30day truce during which talks would continue toward a 
more lasting ceasefire 
in exchange the cardinal called on the nicaraguan government to 
grant a full general amnesty to the several thousand 
political prisoners in nicaraguan jails including members of the 
national guard of former dictator gen anastasio somoza whom the 
sandinistas overthrew in 1979 
permit unrestricted freedom of the press a right now 
granted only to a few mass media including the opposition 
newspaper la prensa and radio catolica the voice of the catholic 
church 
reconsider mandatory military draft law which has provoked 
violent disturbances by youths and mothers of draftage people in 
several nicaraguan cities 
reopen a dialogue with its internal opposition including 14 
dissident political parties and a coalition of business labor and 
political groups known as the democratic coordinating council 
those talks broke down late last year 
tinocos initial response and the governments later written 
statement said the obando y bravo plan needed clarification on the 
size and location of the ceasefire zones when the truce would 
start how it would be verified and how the contras would be 
supplied during the cessation of hostilities 
reichler said ortega suggested that roger fisher a harvard 
professor who heads the center for conflict resolution in boston 
draw up a new ceasefire proposal drawing on plans already 
submitted by both sides 
but in announcing suspension of the talks obando y bravo issued 
a communique rejecting fishers participation in the negotiations 
the communique said such work was the proper task of each sides 
technical advisers

siberia is the stroke capital of the world and 
heavy drinking and cold weather could be partly to blame 
researchers say 
soviet stroke data gathered as part of a world health 
organization program were released for the first time friday at a 
stroke conference sponsored by the american heart association 
we were surprised said dr kjell asplund we thought that 
china and japan would be the higest 
the study showed that canada and denmark are the safest places 
to live at least as far as stroke is concerned although the 
stroke rate is low throughout most of north america southern 
europe and australia 
asplund a researcher at umea university in umea sweden said 
the data suggest that strokes must have several causes while 
racial differences may play a role they dont explain all of the 
variations in the risk of stroke around the world 
the study found that in siberia the stroke rate was 119 for 
every 100000 men and 107 for every 100000 women these figures 
were the highest in the world and significantly ahead of china the 
country with the second highest stroke rate 
strokes are also common in japan but data collected there were 
so sparse they were not included in the analysis 
strokes among men are least common in canada where they strike 
21 in 100000 in women they are least frequent in denmark where 
they occur in 8 in 100000 
asked why strokes are so common in siberia asplund said at 
this point we can only guess we know that alcohol consumption is 
very high high alcohol use among men is associated with a high 
risk for stroke i also suspect that there are some climate factors 
involved 
although there are exceptions such as canada he said it 
appears that strokes are more common in cold climates than in 
milder places he noted that people are more likely to suffer 
strokes in northern sweden than in southern sweden and in scotland 
than in england 
some experts suspect that asians are more likely to suffer 
strokes at least in part because of racial differences however 
asplund said that most people in siberia moved there from european 
parts of the soviet union 
its not only a racial thing he said it must have other 
determinants as well the goal of this study is to find the 
determinants of the huge variations in stroke around the world 
he said the researchers will be trying to learn why the stroke 
rate is falling rapidly in the united states while it is stable or 
increasing in many other countries 
the study found that in most places strokes are more common in 
men than in women the only exceptions to this were sweden canada 
and israel where strokes are slightly more common among women 
the 10year project called monitoring of trends and 
determinants of cardiovascular disease or monica is being 
conducted in 26 countries and will conclude in 1994

a condition known as anencephaly was pronounced brain dead 
thursday at loma linda university medical center

seven days in hope of finding recipients for its organs hospital 
spokeswoman anita rockwell said 
one liver transplant candidate in pittsburgh was not an 
appropriate match and another in that city became infected 
delaying any transplant ms rockwell said

liver for another candidate because it had committed itself to do 
another transplant and could not perform two in one day ms

ucla medical center in los angeles turned rejected the liver as 
not an ideal candidate for their recipient ms rockwell said 
anencephaly usually is fatal within days after birth an

mexico has asked the united states to give 
favorable treatment to banks that take part in the governments new 
program to exchange part of its foreign debt for longterm bonds 
the treasury department said 
finance secretary gustavo petricioli said in a statement that he 
discussed the plan with us officials during president reagans 
recent meeting with president miguel de la madrid in mazatlan 
mexico 
the mexican delegation the statement said emphasized 
that it is necessary that all parties involved continue working in 
the search for deeper and more permanent solutions to the problem 
of the foreign debt and financing 
it said mexican officials acknowledged the us help to mexico 
in restructuring foreign debt and in fashioning mexicos new debt 
exchange program mexico has a foreign debt of 105 billion the 
second highest in the developing world after brazil 
the new program involves exchanging some of the debt mexico owes 
foreign commercial bankers for new 20year bonds that will be 
issued by the government 
mexico has set feb 26 as the date for an auction of the bonds 
the bonds will be backed by 10 billion worth of special 
securities to be issued this year by the us government mexico is 
expected to pay about 2 billion for the 20year us zerocoupon 
bonds which pay no interest but are issued at a sharp discount of 
their face value 
the government statement said petricioli asked us officials at 
the mazatlan meeting that they give the most favorable treatment 
possible to the banks that decide to participate in this 
operation 
some us banks reportedly have expressed concern about taking 
part in the program because they are unhappy that mexico will 
continue obtaining loans at 100 percent of their value while paying 
back through the bond program its old loans at about half their 
value 
they also are reportedly reluctant to accept losses of 50 
percent or so on the loans entered into years ago and worry about 
government regulations concerning accounting for the securities on 
their books 
most of mexicos about 600 creditor banks have authorized the 
government to go ahead with the auction which would apply to 51 
billion of the foreign debt 
under the program banks would exchange their old debt for the 
new bonds letting mexico recover 52 cents or so for each dollar in 
the secondary market that means that mexico could retire part of 
its debt for half its face value 
by reducing its debt the government will also pare the amount 
of interest it pays each year on the loans mexico has annual 
interest charges of 8 billion to 9 billion

michael dukakis trying to add some 
midwestern momentum to his win in new hampshire was pushed by 
democratic presidential rivals to defend his economic policies and 
complained during a debate that my name was taken in vain 
missouri rep richard gephardt another democratic frontrunner 
also found himself in the cross fire friday during the latest 
debate of democratic presidential candidates as jesse jackson 
asked if the missouri congressman was proud of your vote for the 
reagan tax cut in 1981 
gephardt and dukakis the governor of massachusetts were the 
biggest targets in a debate that was freewheeling but less fiesty 
than a jangling exchange among the candidates in texas the day 
before 
the st paul debate came as the focus of the presidential 
campaign shifted briefly away from the super tuesday battlefield 
mainly in the south and returned to the midwest where minnesota 
and south dakota hold contests on tuesday 
though the delegates at stake from those two contests pale next 
to those to be allocated in the south the closely bunched 
candidates are looking for a midwestern edge to propel them toward 
the march 8 super tuesday primaries and caucuses 
in the latest debates the candidates tried to block gephardt 
and dukakis from gaining more momentum gephardt was hit on trade 
and taxes while dukakis was forced to defend his budget plans 
gephardt defended his overall tax voting record saying most of 
the tax cut derided by jackson went to ordinary people 
that was the trigger of this whole deficit crisis jackson 
countered 
and dukakis agreed it wasnt just a bad vote as a matter of 
tax policy it was the worst trade bill ever passed 
the minnesota debate drew five of the six democratic contenders 
tennessee sen albert gore jr was absent 
dukakis fired one of the most direct shots of the debate at 
gephardts trade policies warning that weve got to do more than 
wave a fist at our foreign competitors 
but gephardt queried why is everyone defending unfair trade 
practices 
after the candidates exchange was interrupted by a moderator 
gephardt predicted well never finish on trade 
dukakis complained that my name was taken in vain by gary 
hart who demanded to know why dukakis had not followed his example 
and released a budget proposal 
the reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is because 
they dont want to tell the american people the facts hart said 
im the only person on this platform who has balanced a 
budget retorted dukakis 
turning to sen paul simon hart asked why dont you put your 
budget out paul 
when a moderator interrupted the exchange with a joke about 
exchange your budgets tomorrow hart complained i thought 
thats what we were here to debate 
the candidates paid homage to former vice president walter f 
mondale one of the ceremonial sponsors of the debate with 
gephardt saying that mondales call for a tax hike during his 
failed 1984 democratic presidential bid was to his everlasting 
credit 
jackson noted that this campaign is the first in 20 years that 
minnesotans dont have a favorite son candidate to vote for 
dont despair let me be your favorite son jackson said 
i want to be your other favorite son interjected simon 
fridays debate was sponsored by a series of groups including

marcel piattier cleared omaha beach of 
german mines the day after the allies stormed it on dday and went 
on to make a career out of defusing or detonating unexploded world 
war ii bombs 
on friday the 66yearold piattier retired with a bang safely 
exploding a 300pound english bomb found in january in this town 
150 miles north of paris 
the live bomb couldnt be moved and was detonated near the 
center of town causing no damage 
in his last year as head of the regional bomb and mine clearing 
service the man considered the dean of the 25 civil defense 
explosive experts in france was kept busy 
in the second half of 1987 we received 560 calls to 
neutralize bombs found by individuals piattier said 
he says his work in his later years was safer than it used to be 
in 1945 we probed mine fields with bayonettes he recalled 
in two years 27 french mine clearers died and thats not 
counting the german prisoners of war we used 
to determine if the bomb detonated friday was still live 
piattier used sophisticated xray equipment similar to that used 
at nuclear power plants to see inside to the strikepin 
normandy was the scene of the allied invasion in 1944 and saw 
intense fighting that left behind thousands of bombs and mines that 
often turn up unexpectedly in the past year bombs have been found 
by workers digging the english channel tunnel and near a hospital 
in caen 
the most dangerous explosives still scattered throughout the 
verdant countryside are small antipersonnel bombs dropped in 
bunches from german planes 
a woman had her leg torn away in june and a child died in

carrie the 7 million broadwaybound musical 
based on the stephen king novel received tepid reviews following 
its premiere at the royal shakespeare theater in 
stratforduponavon 
jack tinker in the daily mail called the show scheduled to open 
april 27 at new yorks virginia theater an expensive mess 
but he praised 17yearold newcomer linzi hateley as the 
telekinetic carrie of the title a traumatized adolescent played by 
sissy spacek in the 1976 film version of the book 
i hope sincerely that broadway takes miss hateley to its 
heart it can take the rest wherever it pleases tinker wrote of 
thursdays performance 
milton shulman in the standard thought the show presented in 
association with the royal shakespeare company lacked that 
element of supernatural awe that made the movie memorable 
he added if carrie has to be transformed into a musical 
director terry hands has probably done it as well as it can be 
done but one has to ask whether the idea and the production were 
really necessary 
originally mooted for broadway several years back the show is 
now headed for new york in a cast made up equally of britons and 
americans under a special arrangement with the actors union 
equity 
the behindthescenes talent is of mixed nationality as well 
choreographer debbie allen composer michael gore and lyricist dean 
pitchford are all american director hands and his design team 
ralph koltai and alexander reid are british 
michael coveney in the financial times said the musical was 
enjoyable in a masochistic way but lamented hands 
participation in an utter cultural vacuum of dance studio 
robotics with a hint of cultural and classical pretensions 
coveney and the other critics all had kind words for broadway 
veteran barbara cook who plays carries mother margaret the 
religious fanatic played onscreen by piper laurie 
coveney said the 60yearold miss cook was superb and 
tinker called her broadways reclaimed heroine 
irving wardle in the times of london said the voices of linzi 
hateley and barbara cook provided the most thrilling sounds of 
the evening 
carrie is the second motherdaughter musical to open 
backtoback locally wednesday night saw the london debut at the 
cambridge theater of the rink the 1984 broadway flop that 
starred chita rivera and liza minnelli 
the london bow received mixed marks for the material a maudlin 
reconciliation drama set in an abandoned roller skating rink but 
praise for the two leads josephine blake and diane langton

president spyros kyprianou refused to 
back either presidential candidate in sundays runoff elections 
after he lost a bid for a third term throwing wide open cyprus 
most hotly contested vote 
kyprianous centrist democratic party diko said friday that it 
did not agree with the stands of either glafcos clerides leader of 
the rightwing democratic rally party or millionaire businessman 
george vassiliou an independent backed by the powerful communist 
party akel 
that left kyprianous 91000 supporters free to vote either way 
dikos surprise move came after days of backroom bargaining 
rivals were eliminated in a firstround ballot last sunday 
kyprianous thirdplace showing last sunday took him out of the 
race 
the small socialist party edek announced it was putting the 
94 percent of the vote it won sunday behind vassiliou in a leftist 
alliance 
on paper that guarantees vassiliou just under 40 percent of the 
vote when this mediterranean islands 363000strong greek cypriot 
electorate votes vassilou gathered 3011 percent of last sundays 
vote 
the conservative prowestern clerides 68 a veteran political 
warhorse topped sundays poll with 3332 percent but he will have 
to secure at least twothirds of the votes kyprianou won to edge 
ahead of vassiliou this sunday 
the election has developed into a straight leftright battle 
for the first time in a cypriot presidential contest since 
independence from britain in 1960 the outcome cannot be predicted 
political analysts believe the diko vote will split roughly down 
the middle with just a slight swing toward clerides that may not 
be enough to ensure him victory 
the election has been dominated by the partition issue 
cyprus has been divided since the turkish army invaded in july 
1974 after a shortlived coup by militant greek cypriot supporters 
of union with greece 
the turks overran the northern third of the island the turkish 
cypriot minority declared a breakaway republic in 1983 
clerides has pledged that if elected he will form an allparty 
government of national unity to revive deadlocked negotiations 
between cyprus greek and turkish communities to reunite the island 
seeking to strengthen his national unity strategy clerides 
announced in a television debate thursday night that he was 
resigning as leader of democratic rally to head into sundays 
showdown poll as an independent 
vassiliou dismissed that as an electoral ploy and pointed out 
that the other three parties have rejected clerides coalition 
proposal as unfeasible 
clerides and vassiliou 56 earlier concentrated in knocking 
kyprianou out of the race and blocking his election for a third 
fiveyear term with kyprianou out of the way they are now 
slamming each other 
clerides is accused of being a rightwing antilabor 
reactionary who heads a party that harbors the extremists who 
were behind the illstarred 1974 coup that briefly ousted cyprus 
first president the late archbishop makarios 
clerides rejects the charge and accuses vassiliou a selfmade 
millionaire making his first foray into politics of being a 
communist pawn 
both men however support the unconditional resumption of 
negotiations with the turkish side 
kyprianou had insisted that talks should resume only after the 
withdrawal of the 35000 turkish troops and 65000 settlers shipped 
to northern cyprus from the turkish mainland 
clerides and vassiliou also demand a turkish withdrawal but do 
not make this a precondition for talks that have been stalled for 
the last three years 
taverns and most restaurants will remain closed from noon today 
until noon monday in compliance with a law banning sale of alcohol 
at election time

senior conservatives are growing uneasy 
about the peoples party backing president kurt waldheim who for 
the first time in an opinion poll did not muster the support of a 
majority of austrian voters 
the daily salzburger nachrichten today published a survey 
showing 45 percent of those who responded to the poll favored 
waldheims resignation and 42 percent wanted him to stay 
it said 31 percent of the respondents said they would vote for 
waldheim by all means if presidential elections were held 
while 42 percent replied they would by no means elect him 
the newspaper said 522 people were polled on feb 1819 but it 
was not known how representative was the sample nor give the margin 
of error 
in previous polls waldheim always had obtained the support of a 
majority of respondents 
in an interview published in todays issue of the vienna 
conservative daily die presse helmut kukacka general secretary of 
the peoples party was quoted as saying that for now at least 
the party would give waldheim full backing 
but waldheim must work to reduce his credibility deficits by 
an information strategy the newspaper reported kukacka as saying 
early this summer the party will decide whether it makes 
sense to further stand by waldheim or to signal a certain 
distance kukacka said in the interview 
kukacka pledged his party would do everything to strengthen the 
presidents position but noted waldheim has a responsibility to 
the peoples party and to austria so that all of us get out of 
the crisis 
waldheim is not a member of the peoples party but received its 
nomination in the june 8 1986 presidential runoff which he won 
with almost 54 percent of the vote 
in a late friday night television interview kukacka confirmed 
his comments published by die presse 
the federal president has not yet sufficiently responded to 
the contents of the report of the historians commission while on 
the other hand a pressure of opinion as it were was generated 
in the whole world he said on the television 
the historians report presented no clear evidence to back 
allegations waldheim was directly involved in war crimes when he 
was a lieutenant with the german army in the occupied balkans 
but the report left open the question of whether he was guilty 
of any crime it said he was in close proximity to nazi 
atrocities knew about them and did nothing to prevent them 
the president must put forward all his arguments to restore his 
credibility said kukacka 
after a conservative national leadership caucus thursday 
peoples party chairman alois mock waldheims main defender said 
the presidents decision to remain in office must be respected 
the conservative daily oberoesterreichische nachrichten in 
friday editions said segments of the peoples party are crumbling 
away over waldheim 
the socialist party senior partner in the government coalition 
with the conservatives has refrained from openly calling on 
waldheim to step down but party officials have made clear they see 
his resignation as the best solution to the standoff 
in an interview published in todays editions of the west german 
conservative newspaper die welt waldheim said my resignation 
from the office would throw the country into chaos 
he said resigning would give the impression that not austrian 
voters but foreign media and groups decide who may be austrian head 
of state 
mock who is vice chancellor and foreign minister in the 
coalition government apparently is coming under increasing 
pressure from waldheim critics in his party 
mock is the keystone in this issue he cannot move any more 
if he were gone it would be easier to resolve the controversy 
over waldheim a highranking peoples party official told the 
associated press after the party caucus 
meanwhile public protests against waldheim continued throughout 
austria those calling for his resignation friday included actors 
of a vienna theater and civil servants in four ministries 
various petitions with signatures calling on waldheim to quit 
are circulating in vienna and elsewhere including two separate 
lists of conservative and socialist university professors

mario vazquez rana the mexican newspaper 
publisher has announced he has sold his control of united press 
international he said the former president of financial news 
network will take over direct operational control of the company 
the transaction took the form of a sale by the mexican media 
executive of an irrevocable proxy of his stock ownership in upi 
to wnw group inc 
upi in an announcement moved on its news wires friday night 
said the transfer is effective immediately 
the announcement said vazquez rana relinquished his control over 
the news service in return for present and future financial 
considerations totaling more than 55 million 
vazquez rana bought upi for 41 million in june 1986 ending 
bankruptcy court proceedings that began in april 1985 when the 
news service filed for protection from creditors 
the announcement did not identify the owners of wnw upi 
spokesman christopher smith said he believed wnw group inc is an 
independent company with no connection to fnn but said he did not 
really know anything about them at this point 
an irrevocable proxy represents a transfer of voting power 
represented by the ownership shares but not the shares themselves 
smith said that vazquez rana considers his task of investment 
in upi completed at this time 
smith said additional details would be released at a news 
conference probably on monday 
the agreement under which vazquez rana acquired upi after 
creditors approved a reorganization plan limited his ability to 
sell his interest in upi without first giving an employees stock 
ownership plan the right of first refusal during a 60day period 
the upi announcement said that the new president of the news 
service will be paul steinle former president of financial news 
network a 24hour cable tv distributor of business news the 
announcement said he would have total operational control of 
daytoday management 
the announcement identified the chairman of wnw group inc as 
dr earl brian but provided no further identification 
vazquez ranas statement said this step was necessary because 
i could not devote a sufficient amount of time to handson 
management i am pleased that in this agreement we have assured 
the continuation of a venerable world news gathering and 
independent journalistic organization 
in addition to steinle and brian the upi announcement also 
listed three directors of wnw group inc they are j alexander 
mcmahon chairman and professor of the health services 
administration department at duke university james thistle 
director of the school of journalism at the college of 
communications at boston university and erik hendricks executive 
director of the pennsylvania society for the prevention of cruelty

three hospitals have turned down the 
liver of a braindead baby whose body was being maintained on 
lifesupport machines today and tests indicated the organ was 
failing a hospital spokeswoman said 
the 7pound infant known as baby john was born tuesday with most 
of its brain missing and was pronounced dead two days later at 
loma linda university medical center 
the baby was the first brainabsent infant in the nation to be 
placed on artificial life support to keep its organs healthy for 
transplant hospital officials said doctors had planned to 
maintain the body for up to seven days but a blood test friday 
suggests that his liver is failing hospital spokeswoman anita 
rockwell said 
one prospective candidate in pittsburgh was not an appropriate 
match and another in the same hospital became infected delaying 
any possible transplant she said friday 
a medical center in wisconsin also was unable to accept the 
liver for another candidate because they were committed to another 
transplant and could not do two in one day ms rockwell said 
the doctors in wisconsin have refused the liver pending 
further studies the spokeswoman said 
ucla medical center in los angeles turned down the liver because 
they feel it is not an ideal candidate for their recipient ms 
rockwell said 
baby john was born with only a brain stem a condition known as 
anencephaly that usually is fatal within days of birth an infants 
healthy organs can be transplanted only if organ damage is 
prevented by maintaining the infant on life support from birth 
loma linda is the nations only medical center to experiment 
with using anencephalics as organ donors

the air force concerned that its losing too 
many pilots to higherpaying commercial airlines is considering a 
bonus program to encourage its aviators to stick with the military 
air force secretary edward c aldridge said friday that while 
the details havent been worked out basically we would pay 
pilots something on the order of 9000 to 12000 per year for 
signing up for a period of time as bonuses to the basic pay that 
they would have 
the 54 million bonus program is needed because steppedup 
hiring by commercial airlines has caused the reenlistment rate for 
military pilots to drop steadily aldridge said at a news 
conference 
whatever the air force recommends still would have to be 
approved by congress

if soviet troops withdraw from afghanistan before 
there is an interim coalition government in place rival afghan 
factions could become embroiled in unending civil strife 
pakistans acting foreign minister warned 
in our opinion the way things are being worked out by the 
soviets it is going to lead to a bloodbath the diplomat zain 
noorani told a news conference in london friday 
he said hundreds of thousands of afghans could be killed if a 
political settlement does not precede a soviet departure and 
called on the west to press moscow for an agreement on an interim 
government 
president mohammad zia ulhaqs government in islamabad wants a 
transition government in kabul the afghan capital before it will 
sign an agreement leading to soviet withdrawal and the return home 
of more than two million afghan refugees now living in pakistan 
noorani said that without an interim coalition government 
islamabad believes the refugees will not return to afghanistan 
we anticipate that under such circumstances more refugees will 
be coming into pakistan from afghanistan he said 
noorani who met with foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
earlier friday denied pakistan was trying to sabotage the chances 
of an agreement at talks in geneva between pakistan and afghanistan 
on how to end the conflict 
he said islamabad wants soviet forces to leave but also wants a 
lasting settlement 
noorani said afghan guerrilla leaders and refugee and emigre 
representatives on monday would propose what he called a detailed 
framework of a coalition government 
earlier this month mikhail s gorbachev offered to begin 
withdrawing the estimated 115000 soviet troops in afghanistan on 
may 15 if pakistan signs an accord at the next session of the 
unsponsored peace talks in geneva that begin march 2 
but gorbachev also said the soviets would not attempt to 
influence the composition of the kabul government after they leave 
the soviet leader said all soviet forces could be withdrawn in 
10 months if agreement is reached at geneva the soviets later 
accused pakistan of trying to block chances of an agreement 
pakistans stand has some backing in washington and london but 
western leaders have urged islamabad not to go so far as to 
jeopardize gorbachevs withdrawal pledge 
soviet forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 and replaced 
one prosoviet government in kabul with another the soviet move 
was condemned by the united states britain and other western 
governments 
the soviets and afghan government soldiers have been fighting 
moslem guerrillas trying to overthrow the kabul government 
the guerrilla groups maintain bases in pakistan and have 
received support from the united states iran and pakistan 
the british foreign office said in a statement friday following 
nooranis meeting with howe there is a tremendous amount of 
sympathy and concern for pakistan after eight years of occupation 
in afghanistan the soviet withdrawal is bound to leave a 
tremendous vacuum

a published report today says two men closely 
linked with attorney general edwin meese iii received 150000 from 
a swiss businessman pushing an iraqi oil pipeline but meeses 
lawyer says the attorney general didnt benefit in any way 
the washington post reported that bruce rappaport of geneva sent 
the money in mid1985 to franklyn chinn meeses former investment 
adviser and e bob wallach a close friend of meese for more than 
30 years 
sources familiar with the payment said wallach said the money 
represents his legal fee for his work on the pipeline proposal the 
newspaper said that work included getting meeses help in setting 
up a meeting for rappaport in june 1985 with thennational security 
adviser robert c mcfarlane the post said 
the post quoted one source as saying the money was sent to 
chinn for the benefit of wallach 
meeses attorney james rocap said friday he was aware of the 
payment but that it has absolutely nothing to do with mr meese 
none of it the money ever went to mr meese he said 
none of it was ever used for the benefit of mr meese 
the post said the payment is not included on wallachs 1985 
income tax return and was not reported by him until may 1987 when 
independent counsel james c mckay expanded his investigation of 
the scandalplagued wedtech corp to include meeses dealings with 
wallach and chinn 
wallach and chinn and a third man were accused in a federal 
indictment in new york in december of taking illegal payments from 
wedtech to influence meese mckay has been conducting a separate 
investigation of meeses dealings with the two men 
rappaport hired wallach in 1985 to try to drum up us support 
for the proposed 540mile pipeline through jordan that would run 
close to israeli territory the pipeline never was built 
the san franciscobased bechtel group which was seeking to 
build the project had enlisted the swiss businessmans help 
because of his close ties to israeli political figures there had 
been concern that israel might attack the pipeline

secretary of state george p shultz 
today said the soviet union must face up to its human rights 
problems if it wants to participate in a middle east peace 
conference 
shultz specifically cited restrictions on emigration and 
religious practices as well as a lack of diplomatic relations with 
israel 
so they have some work to do that will make their presence at 
an international conference more acceptable from our standpoint and 
israels standpoint shultz told reporters on his air force jet 
flight from washington 
the middle east is one of the topics on his agenda for the talks 
shultz is to hold in moscow sunday with foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and on monday with general secretary mikhail s 
gorbachev and shevardnadze 
shultz is scheduled to go to the middle east next week to try to 
set up negotiations between israel and the arabs he seemed 
doubtful that a peace conference would be the right framework 
what is an international conference supposed to do if there is 
one shultz said 
but he added if the soviets continue to advocate seriously 
an international conference they have to face up to these problems 
that are posed by their lack of diplomatic presence in one of the 
key parties and the immigration and other problems that i 
mentioned 
shultz said he would not seek soviet backing for his efforts 
we will talk around about the middle east but we are not 
asking them for anything he said i think it will be more in 
the nature of information sharing 
jewish emigration from the soviet union was nearly 800 people a 
month april through september of last year it rose to over 900 
monthly october through december but in january emigration dipped 
to about 650 to 700 and is at about the same rate this month 
last year applications were accepted from jews who did not have 
relatives in israel but on jan 1 the process was halted 
the soviet union broke relations with israel after the 1967 
mideast war but sent a handful of diplomats to tel aviv last year 
shultz said the soviets had imposed unwarranted restrictions 
on emigration and on the practice of judaism and other religions 
so they have some work to do he said 
on another front shultz backed pakistans demand for a 
coalition government in afghanistan he said it would make a 
contribution to stability as soviet troops withdrew from the 
country 
shultz said the usbacked afghan rebels would propose new 
ideas in geneva when negotiations for a settlement resume march 2 
the soviets last week said pakistan was obstructing an end to 
the eightyear war in the country by insisting that a change of 
government in kabul precede the signing of a peace agreement 
some 115000 soviet troops are in afghanistan supporting the 
government in its war with the guerrillas on feb 8 gorbachev 
offered to begin a withdrawal on may 15 if an agreement is reached 
and to carry it out over 10 months 
the negotiations are being conducted by pakistan and afghanistan 
under the auspices of the united nations 
the peoples democratic party which seized power in kabul in 
1978 has presented its proposal for a future government to un 
mediator diego cordovez a us official who demanded anonymity 
said it called for a dominant role for the kabul regime 
shultz said the united states would suspend its military aid to 
the rebels provided the soviets cease similar supplies to the 
government forces 
there has to be a symmetry there shultz said

republican jack kemp used a rare oneonone confrontation with 
gop presidential rival george bush to claim he is best qualified to 
continue the reagan revolution while democratic candidates 
debated bitterly despite a plea to tone down their family feud 
relishing the limelight relinquished by sen bob dole and pat 
robertson who boycotted the gop debate friday night in dallas 
kemp assailed bushs stance on a nuclear missile defense and called 
the vice presidents budgetbalancing plan unworkable 
the candidates in both parties kept up heavyduty rhetorical 
fire as they sought to gain momentum going into upcoming primaries 
and caucuses especially the super tuesday contests in 20 states on 
march 8 
while bush suggested that dole was angry and bitter over his 
secondplace finish in new hampshire the vice presidents aides 
acknowledged that he was withdrawing from competition in tuesdays 
south dakota primary bush wants to devote more attention to the 
southern and border states holding contests on super tuesday they 
said 
dole meanwhile appearing in lexington ky said he was not 
shaken by his runnerup showing in new hampshire and that he will 
do well in south dakota and minnesota 
were ready for the next round in south dakota and minnesota 
and well see who wins those two well see whos dispirited 
wednesday morning next week the kansas senator said 
in their second caustic debate in as many days three democratic 
candidates played catchtheleader in turning their criticism 
toward frontrunners michael dukakis and richard gephardt 
jesse jackson drew hoots from the crowd in st paul minn when 
he asked gephardt if he was proud of your vote for the reagan tax 
cut in 1981 the missouri congressman defended his overall tax 
voting record most of that tax cut went to ordinary people he 
said jackson retorted that was the trigger of this whole 
deficit crisis 
dukakis the winner of the new hampshire primary this week took 
a direct shot at gephardts trade policies warning during the 
friday debate that weve got to do more than wave a fist at our 
foreign competitors 
why is everyone defending unfair trade practices gephardt 
said 
toward the end of a turbulent campaign week that saw the 
withdrawals of republicans alexander m haig jr and pete du pont 
and democrat bruce babbitt there were these other developments 
democrat paul simon said in south dakota that he would remain 
in the presidential race despite saying just days earlier he would 
drop out if he didnt win in south dakota or minnesotas contests 
next tuesday 
im in it until the finish line in atlanta he said 
contending he had received an outpouring of encouragement and 
money since his disappointing thirdplace finish in new hampshire 
robertson holding a rally with supporters at the same posh 
dallas hotel where bush and his entourage had stayed said he 
backed out of the debate because he didnt get enough tickets for 
his supporters and id rather be with you here 
because of the noshows by dole and robertson kemp got a rare 
opportunity to confront bush with wide television exposure and 
without interference from others he didnt flinch 
i believe in the reagan revolution and i want to carry it into 
the 1990s the new york congressman said in a pointblank 
challenge to bushs oftstated campaign pitch that he is the 
rightful heir to the reagan legacy 
in an exchange that provoked laughter debate moderator roger 
mudd asked if the kemp and bush appearance might suggest a gop 
ticket for 1988 kemp responded i dont think george bush wants 
to serve another eight years as vice president 
in the nights sharpest exchange kemp attacked bush on nuclear 
weapons saying he would more quickly research test and develop a 
missile defense shield 
bush said it would be wrong to support premature 
development and kemp asserted that they must stand up for 
something beyond peace alone 
i was in combat bush replied referring to his record in 
world war ii experience i dont think you know what it is until 
youve seen your fellow men drop dead 
kemp snapped back i dont need a lecture 
the democrats during their st paul runin seemed oblivious to 
party chairman paul kirks exhortation that they cut down some of 
the internecine warfare 
in a dear candidate letter kirk said personal attacks among 
the contenders do nothing to enhance the opportunity for a 
democratic victory in november 
but the candidates seemed unfazed by this 
dukakis complained that my name was taken in vain by gary 
hart who demanded to know why the massachusetts governor had not 
followed his example and released a budget proposal 
the reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is because 
they dont want to tell the american people the facts hart said 
im the only person on this platform who has balanced a 
budget retorted dukakis

agreement was reached saturday on a 22 million 
package of union concessions that will keep the new york post 
publishing and clears the way for owner rupert murdoch to sell the 
paper 
the agreement was reached at 150 am after a final bargaining 
session that began around 10 am friday 
murdoch had said the paper would close friday unless the papers 
unions provided concessions he needed to sell the moneylosing 
paper to real estate developer peter kalikow 
i want to say at this time that i wish mr kalikow great 
successful publishing of the new york post murdoch said in 
announcing the agreement 
hes a very ambitious man as well as being a wealthy one i 
know that he is determined to make it successful murdoch said 
hes getting the newspaper now in better shape getting a 
newspaper with a fine staff wonderful executives and im sure 
that he needs nothing more than a new start under new leadership 
and he goes ahead with that with my full blessing 
the agreement slated to take effect march 7 is subject to the 
auditing of the savings by kalikows company and fast ratification 
by each of the 10 unions involved officials said 
the cost reductions amount to 10 million in the first year 8 
million in the second and 6 million in the third with a 2 
million acrosstheboard bonus for employees in the third year 
officials said 
murdoch had demanded concessions totaling 24 million over three 
years to meet conditions of a deal to sell the post for 37 million 
to kalikow 
according to the agreement the paper will save 225 million by 
cutting 130 jobs officials said murdoch contributed 3 million to 
the package raising the total beyond the 24 million mark and 
allowing for the employees raises officials said 
union leader george mcdonald thanked murdoch for the 3 million 
to sweeten the pot 
murdoch said the agreement resulted from good will on both sides 
it has been a very difficult 12 days for all of us he said 
at the posts offices editors were preparing the saturday 
edition 
murdoch met earlier friday with kalikow said union leader 
george mcdonald 
the alternative was to fold the paper because of a federal 
regulation barring murdoch from owning a newspaper and tv station 
in the same city murdoch owns wnyw in new york 
on friday morning murdoch had declared flatly that he would not 
stop the clock to save the newspaper 
on wednesday the unions put forward a proposal they said would 
save 33 million 9 million more than murdoch demanded and asked 
that the extra money go into pay raises on thursday management 
knocked down 12 million of the package as nonnegotiable under 
terms of the deal with kalikow 
after 10 minutes with the negotiators at the grand hyatt hotel 
on friday morning murdoch said the gap in the concessions package 
amounted to 4 million over three years 
the exact size of the gap was a major sticking point along with 
the union demand for raises for those workers who survived the cuts 
barry lipton president of the newspaper guild of new york said 
another problem was that management had increased the number of 
jobs that would have to be pared initially the negotiators said 
they were dealing with 116 reductions from a workforce of 1200 
while other union leaders went into small working groups to seek 
a solution the leader of the papers drivers union jerry cronin 
said he was done talking unless he heard from management 
if the post went under he said it died at the hands of mr 
murdoch 
the union leaders consistently called on kalikow to join the 
talks but he said the concessions had to be made with murdoch for 
the sale to go through 
the contract with kalikow gave murdoch until feb 22 to 
negotiate the union concessions 
the post founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton faced financial 
problems from its earliest years but held on as paper after paper 
in the city merged and then eventually shut down 
murdoch bought the afternoon tabloid from dorothy schiff in 1976 
for about 31 million as he expanded his worldwide media holdings 
from australia and england into the united states 
under murdoch the paper turned from liberal to conservative on 
the editorial page and became splashy and racy the early edition 
of friday carried the frontpage headline only hours to live 
to promote a story about the release of photographs taken of 
jennifer levin a short time before she was killed in central park 
murdoch says he has lost nearly 150 million in 11 years of 
operating the post he said friday that current losses were running 
100000 a day 
murdoch chose to sell the post following a congressional rider 
engineered by sen edward m kennedy dmass and sen ernest 
hollings dsc that blocked the federal communications 
commission from continuing to waive its rule barring ownership of 
both a television station and a newspaper in the same city murdoch 
owns wnywtv in new york 
in boston where he faces the same situation murdoch has 
indicated hed sell his tv station and hold on to the boston herald

the united states sent records to help britain 
investigate alleged links between kurt waldheim and six british 
commandos who were executed in nazioccupied greece prime minister 
margaret thatcher said 
she also said britain had no suspicions about waldheims record 
as an intelligence officer in the german army when he was elected 
un secretarygeneral in 1972 
the prime minister made the comments friday in written replies 
to questions in the house of commons 
allegations have been made that waldheim who held the un job 
10 years and now is president of austria committed war crimes 
during his service in the balkans an international panel of 
historians appointed by the austrian government said it found no 
proof but left the question of guilt open 
waldheim 69 has denied wrongdoing since the accusations began 
during his presidential campaign two years ago and has refused to 
resign since the historians report was made public last week 
the arrival of the microfilmed german army war records from us 
military archives was the latest step in an attempt ordered by mrs 
thatcher to determine whether waldheim interrogated the six 
commandos 
the men a raiding party captured off the greek island of 
alimina in april 1944 were handed over for interrogation to the 
unit in which waldheim served 
they refused to talk and were executed by the germans a war 
crime under the geneva convention on prisoners of war 
i am informed that at the time of dr waldheims election as 
un secretarygeneral no doubts were raised about his wartime 
record said mrs thatcher 
she was answering questions from lawmaker robert rhodes james 
who served on waldheims personal staff at the united nations and 
now is trying to prove him guilty of war crimes the historians 
report said waldheim was in close proximity to atrocities must 
have known of them and did nothing to stop them 
british officials said the material sent from the united states 
was a copy of the socalled alimina file dealing with the capture 
of the commandos 
the original file was in a mass of german military documents 
american forces captured at the end of the war in 1945 the 
documents were kept in the united states until sent to west german 
archives at freiburg in the late 1960s 
historian gerald fleming says records of the vital second 
interrogation of the commandos including who conducted it were 
missing from the original file in freiburg 
fleming was the british member of the international commission 
which reported finding the initial w in waldheims hand on an 
earlier record of interviews with the six men indicating he at 
least had read it 
the historians report said waldheim was well aware of hitlers 
orders to execute commandos 
a note in english attached to the alimina file said do not 
film this sheet interrogations reports removed because of security 
classification it was not immediately clear whether the us 
microfilmed material was more complete than the original file 
an inquiry in 1986 based on incomplete british files did not 
establish a link between waldheim and the commandos

four men died today from inhaling toxic fumes 
given off when plastic foam in a sofa caught fire during a minor 
blaze at an apartment london fire brigade reported 
the four deaths bring to at least 14 the number of britons 
killed during fires by the thick black fumes given off by plastic 
foam used as filling material in cheap furniture 
the other 10 victims were children who died within the first 10 
days of this year 
public concern and a longrunning campaign by fire chiefs 
against the filling prompted the government to announce last month 
a ban on use of standard and highresilience polyurethane foam in 
new furniture the ban would be put into effect starting february 
1989 
the time gap is to allow manufacturers to reequip but the ban 
does not cover existing foamfilled furniture which will remain a 
potential danger in many homes 
the fire brigade said in a statement that a carelessly discarded 
cigarette is thought to have started todays fire in an apartment 
at bethnal green in east london 
the fire itself took firefighters only 10 minutes to bring under 
control they found the bodies of two of the dead beside a locked 
rear door in the apartment the bodies of the other two victims 
were found in a bathroom they are thought to have taken refuge 
there to escape the fumes 
a fifth man found in the same room as the sofa also had 
inhaled the fumes but survived he was hospitalized

tv evangelist jimmy swaggart who 
accused ousted ptl leader jim bakker of sexual misconduct is being 
investigated by the assemblies of god church amid reports of 
similar allegations 
the denominations 13member executive presbytery met with 
swaggart at its headquarters here for nearly 10 hours thursday to 
discuss matters that could affect his credentials with the 
church church spokeswoman juleen turnage said friday 
mrs turnage would not give details of the investigation but 
said it is a critical situation and that swaggart is 
cooperating the assemblies of god last year stripped bakker of his 
credentials 
abcs nightline citing sources it did not identify 
reported early today that church officials at the meeting were 
shown photographs purported to show swaggart and a known prostitute 
going into and out of a motel room 
one unidentified church official told abc the photos were open 
to interpretation 
swaggart did not deny to church officials that he had been with 
a prostitute abc reported abc said new orleans preacher marvin 
gorman was believed to have provided the photos to church officials 
the assemblies of god defrocked gorman in 1986 for immorality 
and conduct unbecoming to a minister an unidentified church 
official told the washington post 
cbs news reported friday that the probe involved allegations of 
sexual misconduct and the post quoted unidentified sources in 
todays editions as saying the investigation involved charges of 
adultery 
the assemblies of god did not comment on the nature of its 
investigation swaggart spokeswoman barbara klein said late friday 
at this point we dont have a statement 
bakker who was stripped of his credentials as a minister in the 
church following allegations of homosexuality and an extramarital 
sexual encounter in 1980 with jessica hahn said friday night that 
the reports about swaggart were most confusing and hurtful 
im shocked he added what weve gone through no one on 
earth should have to go through 
swaggart 52 is president of a tv ministry worth an estimated 
140 million a year it is based in baton rouge la and 
broadcasts to 143 countries 
swaggart interviewed at the baton rouge airport upon his return 
from springfield was asked about the nature of the meeting with 
church officials 
youll have to call them and ask them he replied 
when asked about the report of the pictures he said call our 
attorney if you like 
last september gorman filed a 90 million suit accusing 
swaggart and others of plotting to ruin his tv ministry with false 
reports of adulterous affairs a judge dismissed the suit saying 
it was a religious dispute that didnt belong in court 
shortly afterward gormans organization marvin gorman 
ministries filed for bankruptcy reorganization claiming debts of 
more than 2 million he is pastor of the metropolitan christian 
life church in metairie la outside new orleans 
calls to gormans church in new orleans went unanswered and 
there is no telephone listing under gormans name there 
swaggart a pentecostal minister has come under scrutiny 
recently on several fronts 
in june a court battle over the taxexempt status of a texas 
radio station belonging to the ministry forced the evangelical 
empire to release details of its finances and led to allegations 
swaggart has kept contributions for his personal use 
when bakker stepped down from ptl last march he accused a rival 
group of trying to take over the 172 million tv ministry by 
exposing his involvement in a sexandmoney scandal swaggart was 
alleged to be a member of that rival group but denied that 
accusation bakker later retracted the charge 
swaggart a highschool dropout is the cousin of singer jerry 
lee lewis he and his wife frances have a son donnie in 
addition to the television ministry swaggart has put out more than 
50 gospel albums and runs one of the largest nonprofit mail order 
merchandise businesses in the country

a militia commander today said his forces 
arrested several accomplices in the kidnapping of a us marine 
officer who heads a united nations observer team but that the 
mastermind had escaped 
daoud daoud the top military commander of the mainstream shiite 
amal militia in south lebanon also that the kidnapping was 
wellplanned in advance but that a series of snags slowed down the 
abductors flight giving amal time to seal the area 
he said he believes lt col william r higgins still is in 
south lebanon although he was kidnapped wednesday 
we have arrested several accomplices but the leader of the 
kidnap operation has left the south daoud told the associated 
press in an interview at his home in bedias seven miles northeast 
of tyre 
we know them all by name now and we believe lt col 
higgins is still in south lebanon he said 
amal militiamen and un peacekeeping troops have sealed off a 
300squaremile area around tyre searching through cavestrewn 
valleys and olive and citrus groves 
higgins 43 heads a 76man unarmed un observer team that 
monitors border violations of a 1949 armistice agreement between 
lebanon and israel 
the group is attached to the 5800member un interim force in 
lebanon or unifil deployed in 1978 after an israeli incursion 
into south lebanon 
the proiranian organization of the oppressed on earth on friday 
claimed responsibility for higgins abduction accusing him of 
being a cia spy american and un officials denied the charge 
the pentagon said higgins of danville ky had been a junior 
military aide to former us secretary of defense caspar weinberger 
but that his abduction did not pose a major security risk to the 
united states 
the first claim of responsibility for the kidnapping came 
thursday in a call from an anonymous man claiming to speak for a 
previously unknown group the islamic revolutionary brigades 
we believe higgins is still in south lebanon because the 
accomplice who was assigned to transport him to beirut after the 
abduction is detained by us daoud said refusing to identify any 
of the suspects or their affiliations 
security sources speaking on condition of anonymity said many 
of the 40 men detained have links to the iranianbacked hezbollah 
or party of god an umbrella organization for shiite extremists 
hezbollahs voice of islam radio station based in baalbek in 
east lebanon claimed today that 150 hezbollah members were rounded 
up in house raids in the tyre region 
amals men have stormed hezbollahs operations center in the 
south seized documents equipment and cameras they also raided 
the house of hezbollahs south lebanon leader abbas musawi the 
radio said it made no mention of higgins 
daoud said higgins abduction was carefully thought out 
planned and staged 
he said among the detainees were those assigned to monitor 
higgins movements and they have confessed that they knew four 
days in advance that he was coming to tyre on wednesday 
higgins was driving from tyre to unifil headquarters in the 
border town of naqoura when gunmen in a brown volvo car blocked the 
highway and seized him 
the kidnappers ran into a chain of snags after the abduction 
their first car the brown volvo got stuck in the mud they made a 
bulldozer driver push them out but the exhaust was broken and they 
had to move higgins to a white peugeot daoud said 
this second car collided with a truck loaded with oranges 
southeast of tyre the kidnappers then moved higgins to a red 
mercedes and fled to their unknown hideout daoud added 
these snags cost the kidnappers about 1 hours during which 
we managed to seal off all exits from tyre region south of the 
litani river daoud said 
he said the mastermind had sent four other brown volvo cars 
speeding through several neighboring villages 
he wanted to shake off any pursuers however the accidents 
gave us the needed time to seal off the area daoud said 
i am 60 percent certain that higgins is still south of the 
litani it is very difficult for them to smuggle him out on foot 
through the valleys nevertheless were keeping this in mind he 
added 
unifil spokesman timur goksel today said we are maintaining 
road checks and heavy emphasis on collection of information we 
believe he is probably still south of the litani goksel said 
in washington president reagan said thursday that the united 
states will not withdraw americans from the un observer group 
despite the abduction fifteen other nations contribute to the unit 
in its typewritten arabic statement the organization of the 
oppressed on earth said higgins is one of the biggest spies 
planting daily terror in our land 
the statement was delivered to a western news agency in beirut 
accompanied by photocopies of two identity cards of higgins 
the group believed made up of shiite zealots previously has 
claimed responsibility for hijackings bombings and the abduction 
of 12 lebanese jews it has claimed to have killed eight of the 
jews kidnapped in 1984

the soviets top arms control official said his 
country is counting on secretary of state george p shultz to 
arrive ready to explore new initiatives in ussoviet disarmament 
talks 
viktor karpov a former arms negotiator who now heads the soviet 
foreign ministrys arms control department said late friday that 
shultzs visit which begins sunday must set the pace for 
further sovietus dialogue 
during the us officials threeday visit he is scheduled to 
talk with mikhail s gorbachev and other top soviet officials about 
a proposed agreement to cut the superpowers longrange nuclear 
missiles by 50 percent 
the talks follow the dec 8 signing of a treaty to ban 
superpower medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles by soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev and president reagan in washington 
in a special panel of the supreme soviet parliament earlier 
friday two red army officials said that ratification of the dec 8 
treaty could save the soviet union more than 80 million and would 
free tens of thousands of soldiers from their present duties 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev the military chief of staff and 
maj gen vladimir i medvedev were among top officials who spoke 
before the panel which is considering ratification of the pact 
those who spoke at the hearing at the kremlin endorsed the 
treaty but akhromeyev said the soviet military is worried about 
nato moves to compensate for the weapons slated for destruction by 
the pact 
the idea of compensation is wild said the first deputy 
foreign minister yuli m vorontsov a doctor who operates on a 
person to cure him of an ulcer does not then say what can i put 
in to compensate for the ulcer 
on feb 9 the foreign relations commissions of the two houses 
of the soviet legislature created a special 10member subcommittee 
to seek the opinion of experts and ordinary soviet citizens about 
the treaty 
the treaty must be ratified by the supreme soviets presidium to 
become law but because it already has been approved by the ruling 
communist party politburo passage is assured 
fridays twohour hearing seemed designed to assuage the fears 
of some soviets that their leaders made too many concessions in the 
treaty a small group of foreign reporters was allowed to attend 
those against are few said chairman georgy m korniyenko 
summing up soviet public opinion those who are against just 
dont trust the imperialists but then there are not a few who 
have concerns 
under the pact the soviet union must destroy 1752 missiles 
compared with 859 for the united states 
but akhromeyev said that under the agreement the soviets will 
eliminate 650 modern mediumrange missiles while the americans 
will destroy 689 new weapons he said 
us defense secretary frank carlucci and other nato officials 
have said the west needs to modernize its battlefield nuclear 
weapons or improve its conventional arms to make up for the banned 
missiles 
akhromeyev said there was not a word in the inf treaty that 
would bar such measures 
akromeyev said 3 percent to 4 percent of the tens of 
thousands of military men to be released from their duty with the 
missiles would be put on pension but that younger men could 
continue with their military careers 
medvedev told the panel that missiles and other soviet military 
equipment worth 33 million to 415 million would be destroyed 
because of the treaty 
he said the soviet union would save 83 million and that 
military equipment used for the missiles that does not have to be 
destroyed is worth 250 million 
the subcommittee adjourned without a date set for its next 
session the panel will report back to the supreme soviets foreign 
relations commissions which must recommend whether the treaty 
should be ratified

revenge attack on two swapo guerrilla bases in angola this morning 
retaliating for a bank bombing that killed 18 people in namibia 
the defense force chief said 
gen jannie geldenhuys said air force fighter aircraft 
successfully carried out attacks on southwest african peoples 
organization targets in lubango and ongiva in southern angola 
he said the attacks were in retaliation fridays bombing of the 
first national bank in oshakati southwest africa where 18 people 
were killed and 31 injured 
geldenhuys said swapo which has been fighting for 22 years 
against south african occupation of the territory also known as 
namibia was responsible for the lunchhour bomb 
a statement friday from the swapo office in luanda angola 
denied involvement in the bombing and said it was part of a south 
african propaganda campaign to smear the name of swapo 
the guerrillas fight in southwest africa also known as 
namibia from bases in southern angola that periodically are raided 
by the south african defense force 
eight mirage fighters took part in the attack on two targets 
near lubango 186 miles north of the namibianangolan border and 
five impala aircraft attacked targets at ongiva 26 miles north of 
the border the statement said 
geldenhuys said the lubango targets were swapos most 
important training center in angola the tobias hainyeko training 
center and a terrorist holding area about 10 kms 62 miles west 
of there 
he said swapo guerrillas receive training in the handling of 
explosives at the tobias hainyeko center which he said can be 
regarded as the breeding ground for terrorism against the 
inhabitants of southwest africanamibia 
swapo had launched a number of raids from ongiva recently on 
civilians in southwest africa the general said 
by these attacks the security forces demonstrated their 
willingness never to allow swapo terrorism to go unpunished 
geldenhuys said terrorists will be tracked down and destroyed 
fridays bank blast was the deadliest in 22 years of war between 
the black guerrillas and the minority white government of south 
africa

said the citizen newspaper 
of the 31 people injured 20 of them were black said an army 
spokesman cmdt lieb bester 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast 
which destroyed the bank building five people were injured when an 
explosion occurred in the street near the same bank a year ago 
chris ball managing director of the first national bank flew 
to windhoek to visit the scene friday afternoon he called the 
bombing a barbarous and senseless attack on the community of 
oshakati achieving nothing 
all those killed were civilians bester said most were believed 
to be local government employees who had just been paid 
a police inspector keirie du rand said about 55 pounds of 
plastic explosive was used in the blast which occurred shortly 
before 1 pm he said a fire raged for several hours after the 
explosion hampering police access to the scene 
oshakati is in northcentral namibia about 25 miles south of 
the angolan border it is home to the largest military base in the 
region a staging point for south africas current military 
intervention in angolas civil war

the new york post the nations oldest 
continuously published daily gained a new lease on life today with 
approval by its unions of 22 million in concessions 
owner rupert murdoch had said unless he was given 24 million in 
concessions he would close the paper but he contributed 3 million 
to the deal calling it a farewell gift 
the agreement clears the way for murdock to complete a 37 
million sale of the financially troubled tabloid founded in 1801 
by alexander hamilton to real estate developer peter kalikow 
the agreement was reached at 150 am after nearly 16 hours of 
bargaining 
i want to say at this time that i wish mr kalikow great 
successful publishing of the new york post murdoch said in 
announcing the agreement i hate to leave it 
while murdoch had said the paper would close unless he obtained 
the concessions he agreed to stop the clock as negotiations 
continued past his 2 pm friday deadline 
kalikow agreed to a package that would save 2 million less than 
originally sought on condition the unions agreed to all other 
terms according to howard rubenstein a spokesman for both kalikow 
and murdoch 
under the agreement kalikow would save 10 million in the first 
year 8 million in the second and 6 million in the third minus a 
2 million bonus in the final year said theodore kheel an adviser 
to the unions 
in each of the three years kalikow saves 75 million through 
employee buyouts and 25 million through employee pay cuts kheel 
said in all 130 jobs from a work force of 1200 will be 
eliminated 
however in the first year employees will not lose anything 
because murdoch will give them 25 million to restore the pay 
cuts he added 
in the second year kalikow is to restore 2 million of the pay 
cuts and murdoch make up the difference with 500000 kalikow 
agreed to provide 4 million in raises and 2 million in bonuses in 
the third year kheel said 
i dont think theres any question that without murdochs 
contribution of 3 million the paper would have definitely shut 
down kheel said 
kheel said murdoch referred to the 3 million contribution as a 
farewell gift 
union leader george mcdonald thanked murdoch for the 3 million 
the unions achieved their goal to save our jobs for our people 
and our families said mcdonald president of the allied printing 
trades council an umbrella group for post unions 
the agreement to take effect march 7 is subject to 
verification by kalikows auditors and union ratification but 
murdoch said those were only formalities 
murdoch said of kalikow hes a very ambitious man as well as 
being a wealthy one i know that he is determined to make it the 
newspaper successful 
the post faced financial problems from its earliest years but 
held on as paper after paper in the city merged then shut down 
murdoch bought the afternoon tabloid the nations oldest 
continuously published daily from dorothy schiff in 1976 for about 
31 million as he expanded his worldwide media holdings from 
australia and england into the united states 
under murdoch the paper turned from liberal to conservative on 
the editorial page became splashy and at times racy 
his efforts failed to turn the paper around murdoch says he has 
lost nearly 150 million in 11 years of operating the post he said 
friday that current losses were running 100000 a day 
earlier this month murdoch announced he had reached agreement 
to sell the post to kalikow 
the sale was prompted by congressional action late last year 
that blocked the federal communication commission from granting him 
another waiver to its rule against owning a newspaper and tv 
station in the same market murdoch also owns wnywtv in new york 
in boston where he faces the same situation murdoch has 
indicated hed sell his tv station and hold on to the boston herald

on the municipal building the arabrun palestine press service and 
hospital sources said 
a spokesman for the israeli army could not immediately confirm 
the death 
the palestinian news agency identified the victim as abdullah 
atta abdullah 20 and said he was shot in the head 
it said abdullah was one of several hundred demonstrators 
demanding the resignation of the municipal council of ramallah 
which is 10 miles north of jerusalem 
sources at a hospital at ramallah who spoke on condition they 
not be identified said abdullah was shot in the forehead 
the army command said israeli troops clashed with 200 moslem 
worshipers at the tomb of the patriarchs in hebron in the occupied 
west bank 
moslems and jews both believe the site is the burial place of 
the biblical patriarchs abraham isaac and jacob and three of their 
four wives 
arabs spread prayer rugs on the floor and began to pray friday 
during jewish services in a chamber normally used at different 
hours as a place of worship by jews and arabs 
the site attracts jewish and moslem religious fundamentalists 
and has been a constant source of friction since israel captured 
the west bank and gaza strip in the 1967 middle east war 
an army spokeswoman said soldiers ordered the moslem worshipers 
out of the hall and used force but not gunfire or tear gas to 
evict them when they refused 
the arabs attacked the soldiers the spokeswoman said on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with army regulations 
by un count and not including todays reported death 55 arabs 
have been killed by israelis since protests began in the occupied 
territories dec 8

bullets against arab protesters dumdum bullets expand explosively 
when they hit a target causing greater damage

throwing stones bricks and bottles soldiers retaliated with tear 
gas and chased youths through the streets 
at jabaliya refugee camp in the gaza strip hundreds of people 
demonstrated after prayers carrying palestinian flags and throwing 
rocks 
the army command denied palestinian reports that soldiers used 
tear gas and clubs to disperse the protesters at jabaliya 
in gaza city protesters threw stones and burned tires shati 
refugee camp remained under curfew imposed by the army last week 
kinnock in israel on a visit made the charge about dumdum 
bullets at a news conference friday he said he saw xrays of a 
wound which showed shattering of the bone and flesh consistent 
with the use of an explosive bullet at another point he said the 
injury was consistent with the wound inflicted by a dumdum 
bullet 
the comment by abu rahmeh a palestinian leader from the gaza 
strip to the associated press came after the outlawed plo issued a 
statement friday 
the statement said the visit and a new peace initiative 
promoted by shultz were aimed at liquidating the palestinian 
cause and the heroic uprising in the occupied lands it said no 
palestinian leaders in the occupied territories would meet shultz

an independent plo delegation

a lawyer for attorney general edwin meese iii 
said saturday that meese received no money or benefit from a 
reported 150000 payment to two close meese associates in 
connection with promotion of an iraqi pipeline project 
the attorney james rocap said he was aware of the payment but 
that it has absolutely nothing to do with mr meese 
swiss businessman bruce rappaport sent the money in mid1985 to 
franklyn chinn meeses former investment adviser and e bob 
wallach a close friend of meese for more than 30 years according 
to sources familiar with independent prosecutor james mckays 
investigation of meese 
rappaport was enlisted by the san franciscobased bechtel group 
which was seeking to build the project 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity quoted wallach 
as saying the money from rappaport represented his legal fee for 
his work on the pipeline proposal including getting meeses help 
to set up a meeting for rappaport in june 1985 with thennational 
security adviser robert c mcfarlane 
rocap characterized as not a big deal the fact that wallach 
had been paid a fee through rappaport and that the 150000 had 
been deposited in a trust account with chinn 
ed meese never got any money from the pipeline project or from 
bruce rappaport he never got any money from bob wallach with the 
exception of a few lunches said rocap 
the lawyer said that the only money meese got through his 
partnership with chinn was the previously disclosed stock profits 
that chinn earned for the attorney general through various stock 
trades 
the washington post reported saturday that the payment was not 
included on wallachs 1985 income tax return and was not reported 
by him until may 1987 when mckay expanded his investigation of the 
scandalplagued wedtech corp to include meeses dealings with 
wallach and chinn 
a federal indictment in new york accused wallach and chinn and a 
third man of taking illegal payments from wedtech to influence 
meese 
rappaport hired wallach in 1985 to try to drum up us support 
for the proposed 540mile pipeline through jordan that would run 
close to israeli territory the pipeline never was built

president reagan today asked congress to ward 
off election year pressure for increased spending and enact the 
11 trillion budget presented earlier in the week 
if congress upholds its commitments and stands firm against 
pressures for increased spending pressures that reach a peak 
during election years solid results will be forthcoming reagan 
said in his weekly radio speech 
if our proposed budget is enacted deficit spending will have 
dropped from 221 billion in fiscal year 1986 to 130 billion in 
fiscal year 1989 the president said 
he said consultations between congress and the white house 
before the budget submission which both branches have hailed as a 
method of avoiding budget fights as in previous years 
demonstrates responsible leadership expected by the electorate 
reagan said the budget will keep the lid on spending while 
recognizing that some increases are needed to avoid jeopardizing 
national security 
he repeated his criticism of last years budget process saying 
late amendments to the spending bill required him to sign a package 
without the review it should have been granted or face shutdown of 
the federal government 
with the new budget he said we have an opportunity to put 
our fiscal house in order 
reagan also repeated his assertion that his administration has 
presided over the biggest economic expansion since world war ii and 
once again hailed his administrations record on employment

police across the country detained at 
least seven top opposition activists in an apparent effort to 
prevent a weekend solidarity meeting from convening opposition 
spokesmen said today 
among those reported held were two prominent figures in the 
outlawed trade union federation who were removed by officers from a 
car also carrying solidarity chairman lech walesa 
walesa interviewed by telephone from his home in gdansk said 
union spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz and gdansk regional solidarity 
leader bogdan lis were taken from his car shortly after noon but 
he was left alone 
we have reforms by means of arresting walesa said 
sarcastically this is something well known to communist 
authorities 
also reported held was zbigniew bujak warsawregion solidarity 
leader who was the unions underground chief after the imposition 
of martial law in december 1981 
he was detained at the warsaw train station before he could 
board a train to gdansk to attend a meeting of the solidarity 
national executive commission said the rev henryk jankowski an 
adviser to walesa 
jankowski initially reported that solidarity adviser jacek kuron 
was detained at the same time but warsaw opposition spokesmen said 
later that jankowski was mistaken and kuron had not been held 
solidarity regional leaders from krakow lublin bydgoszcz and 
wroclaw also were reported detained 
commission meetings are not announced in advance and neither 
walesa nor jankowski would not state the reason for the meeting in 
the baltic port 
however solidarity which has remained active despite its being 
banned in 1982 is known to be evaluating its strategy in the face 
of steep price increases imposed feb 1 
the increases have caused widespread discontent but no major 
unrest past price increases have triggered violence as well as the 
strikes that spawned solidarity in august 1980 
jankowski who spoke by telephone from gdansk said 19 people 
were detained nationwide but there were contradictory reports from 
other opposition sources 
a spokesman in the government press office zbigniew 
augustynowicz said he had no immediate comment on the reports but 
would look into them 
authorities in poland often use brief detentions to block 
illegal meetings since a 1986 amnesty no one has been held more 
than 48 hours solely on political charges 
wladyslaw frasyniuk a regional leader of solidarity in the 
southwestern city of wroclaw was detained friday evening by a 
group of uniformed and plainclothes police said his wife krystyna 
police later telephoned their home and said without explanation 
that frasyniuk was being held for 48 hours she said 
it was not known if frasyniuk who is also a member of 
solidaritys executive commission had planned to attend the 
meeting in gdansk however he was to attend a meeting sunday of a 
banned farmers group rural solidarity in southeastern poland 
another executive commission member stanislaw weglarz was 
detained friday in his home city of lublin in eastern poland said 
opposition spokesman janusz winiarski 
stefan jurczak an executive commission member from near krakow 
also was detained friday another opposition source said 
briefly detained was janusz stepniak from near lublin a leader 
of rural solidarity said winiarski who said stepniak was warned 
against attending the rural solidarity meeting in rzeszow 
the provisional national council of rural solidarity an 
farmers union modeled on the soviet blocs first and only 
independent labor federation has called a national meeting of 
farmers to mark the seventh anniversary of the 1981 
rzeszowustrzyki agreements 
in those accords the government officially recognized rural 
solidarity 
after the imposition of martial law rural solidarity was 
banned although some members have continued their activities

a regional ice cream company has won a 
trademark victory over giant mcdonalds corp which claimed a 
frozen milkshake called quick thaw mcstraw was too much like 
its own trademarks 
its not often that the little guy wins over a fortune 500 
company said dennis roney president and chief executive officer 
of oberweis dairy inc parent company of roney ice cream co 
roney announced friday that it has won a fiveyear trademark 
dispute with mcdonalds 
the roney company which makes ice cream and ice milk in this 
chicago suburb filed in december 1983 for a trademark registration 
for quick thaw mcstraw 
the name was a variation on hannahbarbera productions quick 
draw mcgraw and the hollywood animator gave the company permission 
to use the name with limitations roney said 
mcdonalds opposed the registration arguing that consumers 
would be confused by the use of mcstraw when it had so many 
trademarks using mc or mac roney said mcdonalds based in 
suburban oak brook also argued that the roney frozen shake was 
similar to its own products 
the department of commerces trademark trial and appeal board 
ruled in favor of the ice cream maker 
mcdonalds spokesman chuck rubner said the comnpany may appeal

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio broadcast 
my fellow americans this week i transmitted to congress our 
proposed budget for 1989 this budget fulfills the second year 
obligations of a bipartisan agreement i hammered out last november 
with the leaders of congress 
we then after arduous negotiations agreed on a plan to reduce 
federal deficit spending by over 75 billion in two years if 
congress upholds its commitments and stands firm against pressures 
for increased spending pressures that reached a peak during 
election years solid results will be forthcoming and progress 
has already been made 
if our proposed budget is enacted deficit spending will have 
dropped from 221 billion in fiscal year 1986 to 130 billion in 
fiscal year 1989 as a proportion of gross national product it 
will have been cut by more than half since 1983 
the legislative and executive branches by living up to our 
commitments of last november are demonstrating the kind of 
responsible leadership expected by the electorate the budget weve 
transmitted is true to that spirit 
it reduces the level of deficit spending while at the same 
time holds the line against any general tax increase it remains 
firm in our commitments to essential domestic programs it also 
includes funding for the minimum defense program needed to keep our 
country safe and necessary to honor our commitments to our friends 
and allies 
anything less would not only jeopardize our national security 
but also dim prospects for further negotiated agreements with our 
adversaries 
weve proposed a trim budget that keeps the lid on spending and 
yet still recognizes that some increases are justified for 
example were actually calling for congress to spend substantially 
more on education combating aids the war against drugs and 
improving air safety while keeping discretionary domestic spending 
within predetermined limits 
the longterm solution to the plague of deficit spending 
however is not prudence this year or next whats needed is reform 
that will bring discipline and accountability to the budget process 
exemplifying the shortcomings last year the federal budget was 
slapped together into a single behemoth bill and delivered to me 
hours before the federal government was due to run out of money i 
was faced with the decision to either sign without time for careful 
consideration or see the federal government shut down 
i pledged during the state of the union after plopping down 43 
pounds of paper sent to me by congress that i would never sign 
another catchall continuing resolution im pleased that at least 
34 senators and a good number of congressmen including many in the 
leadership have indicated that they too do not want a repeat of 
last years budget mayhem 
make no mistake we have the opportunity to put our fiscal house 
in order and to reform the budget process weve proven time and 
again that by working together partisanship can be put aside and 
progress can be made when the national interest is at stake 
it took cooperation from both sides of the aisle for example 
to put in place an economic recovery program that has given this 
country the longest peacetime expansion in history inflation and 
interest rates have been kept down family income is up and we 
created over 15 million new jobs since the recovery began being 
mindful of the suffering that comes with unemployment that last 
figure is a matter of particular pride for me and as our economy 
is grown unemployment has dropped to its lowest level since 1979 
but that statement doesnt come near to describing the success 
weve enjoyed 
today more people have jobs and a higher percentage of our work 
force is employed than ever before since the recovery began weve 
created more new jobs than in all of western europe and japan 
combined and even the meaning of unemployment figures is sometimes 
not fully understood 
our 7 million unemployed citizens are often thought of as people 
who have lost their jobs as theyre sometimes described in the 
media in fact less than half of the unemployed are job losers 
fiftyfive percent are new entrants mainly young people looking 
for their first jobs reentrants individuals who left the work 
force perhaps to raise a family and are now seeking to get back in 
or jobleavers whove voluntarily left their jobs to change 
locations or occupations 
we of course need to remain concerned about each and every 
citizen who is seeking work and should not be satisfied until 
everyone who wants a job a good job has one 
one person enduring the pressures and frustrations of 
unemployment is too many that is why responsible federal spending 
and taxing policies policies that foster growth and expand 
opportunities for all our citizens are so important that is what 
the budget that i have just sent to congress is all about 
until next week thanks for listening god bless you

associated press writer vicki miller was aboard 
the california zephyr on her way to a skiing weekend in colorado 
when a fire broke out this is her account of the incident 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
most people in the first coach car of an 
amtrak train were trying to sleep in the wee hours of saturday 
morning when the california zephyr pulled into the small station 
here to pick up passengers 
the quiet was shattered by the sound of sirens but no one knew 
what was going on until they began to smell smoke 
there were no crew members in sight one woman in our group 
which was headed for a ski trip in winter park colo went to 
investigate she returned to tell us calmly that there was a fire 
in a nearby car 
it didnt sound serious and jokes were tossed around while 
passengers in the car began to stir 
we remained in the car wondering if it was safe reassuring 
each other that we would be warned of trouble 
minutes later a woman crew member ran through the coach her 
face blackened with soot she dashed outside and then returned 
saying shed barely escaped from the crew car where the fire 
apparently began 
chattering with cold she said she had no shoes and that her 
feet were cold outside it was about 31 degrees 
the woman left but returned quickly to ask passengers for 
blankets her voice was panicky as she told us people outside the 
train needed them 
i glanced out the window and saw smoke billowing from the crew 
car two cars ahead soon the faint smell of smoke drifted into our 
car and we decided it was time to get out 
as we left the train it became apparent that the fire was 
serious some crew members blankets drapped over their shoulders 
appeared dazed one man sat bent over on the steps leading to the 
upper deck of our coach car others were visibly shaken 
outside was a maze of fire trucks hoses and rescue vehicles 
firefighters on ladders attempted to cut into the crew cars 
windows with power tools 
emergency personnel and volunteers carried stretchers to 
ambulances an amtrak employee yelled to firefighters that he 
thought there were still people inside the car 
soon more people were helped from the car many were dressed in 
bedclothes and some men were barechested 
by the time a spokesman announced that the train would proceed 
without the crew car and sleeper car our group of six had decided 
to bail out of our weekend trip we hitched a ride across town in 
the back of an ambulance with another vehicle toting our gear 
we turned our hopes from fresh powder to finding a rental car 
after we got the last one in town my companions headed back home 
one person was dead others were hurt my traveling companions 
kept asking why werent we told whether we were in danger or 
were safe

acting gov rose mofford is getting high 
marks in her role as temporary chief executive from many 
legislators but not from the man she replaced impeached gov evan 
mecham 
mrs mofford a democrat and arizonas longtime secretary of 
state became acting governor feb 5 when mecham a republican was 
impeached by the house she moved into the governors office and 
will remain acting governor until the senate reaches a verdict 
my lifestyle has changed mrs mofford 65 told a group of 
mayors friday saying shes switched her bedtime reading to 
subjects like the state budget or arizonas medicaid alternative 
program 
when mecham was impeached he was considered legally disabled 
and mrs mofford assumed all of his gubernatorial powers including 
the right to sign bills and hire or fire state employees 
mrs mofford brought in her own volunteer staff and replaced one 
state agency head department of administration director max 
hawkins who drafted mecham into the 1986 gubernatorial race and 
was widely blamed for many of mechams problems she also accepted 
the resignation of mechams controversial washington lobbyist fred 
craft 
that angered mecham who has moved his own staff to an office 
building in suburban glendale in a letter to mrs mofford last 
week he complained that she was turning a temporary acting 
governorship into a complete disruption and replacement of my 
administration 
may i ask you to recognize that i have only been accused and 
not convicted of any act mecham said adding that he expects to 
be cleared and return to the governorship 
mrs mofford replied to mecham i am responsible for acting as 
the chief executive of this state i did not ask for this job 
but i intend to discharge it to the best of my ability during these 
difficult times 
lawmakers say they generally are pleased with the work of mrs 
mofford who many had hoped would act mainly as caretaker 
mrs mofford addresses problems in a calm deliberate 
manner said rep jim skelly a conservative republican who 
headed the house select committee on mechams impeachment thats 
a change shes not going off halfcocked 
havent you noticed theres a different air in state 
government said senate minority leader alan stephens a 
democrat people arent looking for the next bomb to drop 
mecham faces a feb 29 impeachment trial on allegations that he 
concealed a 350000 campaign loan misused 80000 from the 
governors protocol fund by lending it to his auto dealership and 
that he tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat 
by a state official 
he is also scheduled for a march 9 criminal trial on six felony 
counts in connection with the 350000 loan 
if mecham is convicted in court or by the senate mrs mofford 
becomes governor in her own right 
however that would raise a new series of questions if it 
occurred before the may 17 recall election attorney general bob 
corbin has issued a nonbinding opinion saying that if mecham 
resigns or is removed before the recall mrs mofford would be 
subject to removal from office in the recall vote 
rep gary giordano a republican who opposed mechams 
impeachment said he realized mrs mofford was entitled to her own 
staff but added i dont think she had a particular mandate to 
bring in the babbitt administration 
many of mrs moffords volunteer aides had worked for former 
gov bruce babbitt a democrat 
but house minority leader art hamilton a democrat said he 
believes mrs mofford is handling the job wisely 
its ticklish and its difficult and its like no other chief 
executive in this state has ever found themselves in hamilton 
said 
mrs mofford pleased democrats and angered some republicans when 
she said one of her top priorities would be to seek creation of a 
martin luther king state holiday mecham created a storm of 
controversy in january 1986 when he canceled a holiday for state 
workers on grounds it was illegally declared by babbitt through 
executive order 
otherwise there has been little controversy over her policies 
including her statement that a tax increase probably would be 
needed to balance arizonas budget 
i dont know all the problems that are facing us mrs 
mofford acknowledged friday i know that there are criticisms out 
there but i dont think that that will be the last time that i 
will ever be criticized

greek cypriots vote sunday in the second 
and decisive round of the most heated presidential election since 
cyprus won independence from britain 28 years ago 
the outcome is wide open in the race between veteran rightwing 
leader glafcos clerides and political newcomer george vassiliou 
the candidates left in the race after they took the top two 
spots in the first round of voting last sunday held their final 
mass rallies in nicosia friday night and fired verbal broadsides at 
each other 
clerides 68 topped last sundays poll with 3332 percent of 
the vote by the 363000strong electorate vassiliou 56 a 
millionaire businessman backed by the powerful communist party 
akel polled 3011 percent 
on paper vassiliou goes into sundays showdown ballot in the 
strongest position after the small socialist party which polled 
94 percent announced it will back him 
but sundays ballot was thrown wide open after president spyros 
kyprianou eliminated in the firstround vote refused to back 
either of the frontrunners 
kyprianou leader of the centrist democratic party diko was 
seeking a third fiveyear term he took 2729 percent last sunday 
he told the 91000 greek cypriots who voted for him that they 
can back anyone they want 
tens of thousands of flagwaving greek cypriots many bused in 
from other areas attended fridays rallies held within 500 yards 
of each other in central nicosia jamming streets for hours 
both candidates stressed that sundays poll will be the most 
crucial since the island became independent in 1960 
cyprus has been divided since 1974 when the turkish army 
invaded to seized the northern third of the island forcing about 
180000 greek cypriots to flee to the south 
turkish cypriots declared their own republic in the north in 
1983 turkey is the only country to recognize it 
the partition of the island and stalled efforts to reunite the 
rival communities has been the dominant issue in the election 
bread and butter issues have taken a back seat 
clerides and vassiliou have taken a more conciliatory attitude 
toward reviving negotiations than kyprianou a hardliner who has 
been widely blamed for blocking un efforts to establish a 
federation 
kyprianou said he would resume negotiations with the turkish 
side when it withdrew its 35000 troops from northern cyprus along 
with the 65000 settlers turkey shipped from the mainland 
clerides and vassiliou have said they are willing to resume 
talks without such preconditions 
the turks invaded ostensibly to protect the turkish cypriot 
minority after militant greek cypriots staged a shortlived coup 
seeking to unite the island with greece 
that coup forced the president at the time archbishop makarios 
to flee the country clerides who was then president of 
parliament stood in until makarios returned in december 1974 
clerides has sought to attract wide support by pledging to form 
an allparty government of national unity to enter into talks with 
the turkish cypriots 
to strengthen his strategy clerides announced during a 
televised debate thursday night that he was resigning as leader of 
his democratic rally party to go into sundays ballot as an 
independent 
vassiliou rejected that as an electoral ploy pointing out that 
the other three parties have rejected cleridess coalition proposal 
as unworkable 
the two frontrunners who had concentrated on knocking kyprianou 
out in the first round have spent the last week slamming each 
other 
vassiliou accuses clerides of harboring the extremists involved 
in the 1974 coup and of being a rightwing antilabor 
reactionary 
the conservative leader has rejected the charges and accuses 
vassiliou of being a communist pawn

people with aids who have begun their own trials 
of experimental aids drugs found support for their efforts saturday 
from members of the presidents aids commission 
the most exciting aspect of this project is that it originates 
from the aids community empowering ourselves to participate in the 
research that may save our lives and dramatically expand the number 
of patients who have access to experimental drugs said thomas 
hannon administrative director of the community research 
initiative in new york 
the project uses private physicians and their patients to test 
ways of preventing development of fullblown acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome he said 
while aids drug trials are usually done by government 
universities and drug companies the community based project will 
include areas of reseach that might otherwise be neglected he said 
several members of the presidential commission on the human 
immunodeficiency virus epidemic voiced support for the project 
after hannon testified at a commission hearing 
i think what youre doing is introducing an element of 
competition into the realm of what to do abut the aids problem 
said commission member john j creedon i commend you i say 
right on 
but commission member burton lee a physician at the memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york said the projects 
strategy of including intravenous drug abusers among test subjects 
was a bad mistake 
they are unpredictable at almost the 100 percent level and 
their inclusion will create completely flawed material in 
research results he said some researchers say that intravenous 
drug users are poor research subjects because they often dont 
follow instructions and dont appear for followup visits 
hannon disagreed saying people with this disease have their 
lives on the line and are willing to cooperate 
the project is sponsored by the people with aids coalition said 
hannon who said he has aids 
the project approved by the new york state department of health 
to sponsor treatment trials already has five experiments under 
way he said most funding comes from the companies that make the 
drugs involved he said 
creedon president and chief executive officer of metropolitan 
life insurance co suggested the project also apply to the 
insurance industry for financial help 
studies must be approved by the organizations institutional 
review board which includes physicians law professors religious 
leaders and people with aids 
another commission member william walsh told hannon to let 
us know as specifically as you can what we can do to get more 
support more interest for such communitybased programs 
commission member beny primm executive director of the 
addiction research and treatment corp in brooklyn ny offered 
to supply responsible intravenous drug abusers who are in 
treatment from my program any time you want 
among the drugs being tested by the community project are 
pentamidine being studied in 200 people with aids for prevention 
of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and erythropoietin for anemia 
brought on by the aids drug azt or the disease itself 
another study in seven people will see if a parasitic infection 
called cryptosporidiosis can be treated with milk from cows that 
were injected with the parasite the idea is that the cows immune 
systems would create proteins called antibodies that would attack 
the parasite and that the antibodies would be in the milk 
a 750000 trial about to begin with funding from du pont co 
will test a drug called ampligen 
with money raised from the community hannon testified the 
project is testing al721 an extract from eggs that hannon said 
thousands of people with aids are taking on their own the project 
is studying its potential for fighting the aids virus and boosting 
the immune system he said

philippe bidart leader of iparretarrak had been sought for 
more than six years the former schoolteacher was convicted twice 
in absentia once for the murder of two police officers and is 
suspected in two other slayings of policemen 
iparretarrak which means those of the north in the basque 
language is fighting for independence for the basque country in 
southwestern france and northern spain 
it has been less active than the spanish basque terrorist 
movement eta but has claimed responsibility for dozens of attacks

of the french army surrounded bidart and his companions in a home 
on the outskirts of bayonne the largest city in the french basque 
region

lieutenant 
bidart and the other two philippe lascaray and jeanpaul 
hiribaren then surrendered 
defense minister andre giraud sent a message of congratulations

here is the text of the democratic response 
delivered by house budget chairman william gray of pennsylvania to 
president reagans radio address on saturday 
hello this is congressman bill gray the chairman of the house 
budget committee two days ago the president sent congress his 
budget request for fiscal year 1989 but this year something is 
different everybody is shocked at the calm on capitol hill 
people have gotten used to a set pattern the budget comes up 
the battle lines are drawn political bombs are dropped the war 
begins this time people wonder why no bombs are being dropped 
whats different is the presidents budget the budget that arrived 
on my desk on thursday is more realistic than any of the other 
seven the president has sent to congress 
in large measure of course this is due to the bipartisan 
agreement between the administration and congress at the budget 
summit last fall that agreement established specific limits for 
the major areas of the budget including defense spending and 
domestic programs 
it also committed us to an equally important objective real 
permanent significant deficit reduction the presidents budget 
appears to meet the summit guidelines which is why were not 
seeing the kind of fireworks weve had in the past lets give 
credit where its due in at least some areas the president has 
recognized that congress priorities are also the priorities of the 
american people 
instead of trying to cut aid to education by 28 percent as he 
did last year the president is proposing a four percent increase 
from the current funding level instead of trying to cut back on 
the war on drugs the president would increase spending by 13 
percent and to deal with aids one of our most important health 
problems the president is asking for a 40 percent increase in 
funds for aids research and education 
but in other areas this budget is out of line with americas 
needs and americas values for example the presidents budget 
would spend more for homes in space than for the homeless here on 
earth in fact funding for the proposed space station would be 
almost 1 billion but funding for the needs of the homeless would 
be only 219 million far less than the amount authorized by 
congress 
the president and his representatives have indicated that this 
year they want to avoid confrontational politics and acrimonious 
exchanges the kinds of things that in previous years led to budget 
stalemate and huge deficits well we can all agree with that the 
success of the budget summit and the prospect of continued 
administration involvement will i believe demonstrate that 
nothing is wrong with the budget process nothing that cant be 
fixed by cooperation and compromise on priorities and policies 
we proved that the process wasnt the problem when in seven to 
eight weeks with cooperation and compromise we designed and 
implemented a twoyear budget agreement the spirit and willingness 
to compromise are the oil that makes the budget process work we 
know that the economy has improved recently inflation is down and 
unemployment after rising to records in the long recession is 
back down to its 1979 level 
but we democrats are concerned about the future we cannot rest 
comfortably with economic gains built on a policy of borrow 
borrow spend spend the deficit is a problem we cannot escape by 
talking about process since 1980 our national debt has more than 
doubled by next january it will be almost 28 trillion that 
works out to 11400 for every man woman and child in the united 
states and every year we have to pay the interest on that debt we 
have made major progress but we still have a long way to go 
if we maintain the bipartisan spirit that came out of the budget 
summit we can pass a budget that reduces the deficits and meets 
the needs of this nation and if we maintain the spirit of 
conciliation that has been evidenced so far this year we can make 
the budget process work and build a brighter future for the next 
generation and an america with greater opportunity this is

president reagan beseeched congress saturday 
to stand firm against election year pressure for expensive 
additions to his 11 trillion budget but the chairman of the 
house budget committee called for more money to help the homeless 
reagan defending the spending package in his weekly radio 
speech delivered from camp david md said deficit spending will 
drop from 221 billion in fiscal year 1986 to 130 billion in the 
1989 fiscal year which his proposed new budget covers 
if congress upholds its commitments and stands firm against 
pressures for increased spending pressures that reach a peak 
during election years solid results will be forthcoming the 
president said 
the new budget sent to capitol hill thursday was written after 
a series of consultations with congress on deficitreduction goals 
and outlines of the amounts to be spent on broad categories 
as a result reagan said the legislative and executive branches 
are demonstrating the kind of responsible leadership expected by 
the electorate 
the budget the president said remains firm in our 
commitments to essential domestic programs it also includes 
funding for the minimum defense programs needed to keep our country 
safe and necessary to honor our commitments to our friends and 
allies 
he called it a trim budget that keeps the lid on spending 
while permitting increases for education the battle against aids 
and illegal drugs and air safety programs 
rep william gray dpa chairman of the house budget panel 
echoed the presidents praise for the budget consultations and the 
hikes for education aids and narcotics programs 
lets give credit where its due gray said in the democratic 
response in at least some areas the president has recognized 
that congress priorities are also the priorities of the american 
people 
in other areas this budget is out of line with americas 
needs and americas values gray said 
his only specific criticism of the package was a request for 1 
billion to build a manned space station compared with 219 million 
for programs to help homeless people far less than the amount 
authorized by congress 
the budget provides more for homes in space than for the 
homeless on earth gray said 
at the same time he said he expected differences to be worked 
out through compromise and cooperation 
this year something is different gray said everybody is 
shocked at the calm on capitol hill people have gotten used to a 
set pattern the budget comes up the battle lines are drawn 
political bombs are dropped the war begins 
this time he said people wonder why no bombs are being 
dropped 
whats different is the presidents budget gray continued 
the budget that arrived on my desk on thursday is more realistic 
than any of the other seven the president has sent to congress 
reagan in his radio address repeated his criticism of last 
years budget process saying late amendments to the spending bill 
required him to sign a hastily assembled package without review or 
face the shutdown of the federal government 
with the new budget he said we have an opportunity to put 
our fiscal house in order 
reagan also repeated his assertions that his administration has 
presided over the biggest economic expansion since world war ii 
and he once again hailed his administrations record on employment

the soviets have become more open about 
announcing their space failures but failed to announce the 
destruction of a spy satellite last month and gave out sparse 
details about a rocket failure spacewatcher jim oberg said 
saturday 
the official tass news agency reported that the upper stage of 
the proton rocket booster failed on wednesday and that on thursday 
the sputniks entered dense layers of the atmosphere and ceased 
their existence 
according to us space command the largest chunk of debris 
from the mission reentered the earths atmosphere friday afternoon 
between saudi arabia and turkey and a smaller chunk fell earlier 
near australia 
besides the failure of the proton with three satellites aboard 
the soviets lost another satellite cosmos 1906 on jan 31 the 
imaging satellite was launched on dec 26 and was blown up to 
prevent the film and equipment from falling into the hands of 
western intelligence agencies oberg said 
since soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev came to power in march 
1985 oberg said the soviets have certainly released new 
material but there remain severe limits military stuff is clearly 
beyond the limit 
still oberg said western technology can detect such events as 
the proton failure and western news reports can force further 
disclosures from the soviets 
penetrating the secretive soviet space program is nothing new 
for oberg who has published his findings in a new book called 
uncovering soviet disasters exploring the limits of glasnost 
long before gorbachevs moderate reforms led to greater 
disclosure of problems in the soviet union oberg had pieced 
together hairraising tales of disasters that for decades went 
unreported in the statecontrolled media 
oberg has been working since childhood at this watching their 
space program looking for chinks in their secrecy and driving 
through them 
soviet secrecy can be dangerous oberg wrote in his book on 
oct 24 1962 a soviet space probe exploded into dozens of objects 
during the cuban missile crisis the confrontation that brought the 
superpowers their closest to nuclear war 
debris from the probe appeared without warning on american 
attackwarning radars in alaska oberg wrote the cuban missile 
crisis was at its height and for a few moments the unannounced and 
unpredicted soviet space failure looked like the longfeared 
massive soviet intercontinental ballistic missile attack 
the debris burned up as it entered the atmosphere but oberg 
said the soviets have never publicly acknowledged the event 
soviet media also have not reported on the most spectacular 
and probably the greatest disaster of the space age the 
nedelin catastrophe which on about oct 24 1960 killed 
scores of soviets including marshal mitrofan nedelin the commander 
in chief of the soviet strategic rocket forces 
the accident came three years after the soviets launched the 
first satellite sputnik operating in the strictest secrecy 
the soviets launched two unmanned spacecraft on a probe to mars 
but both fell back into the atmosphere and burned up because their 
upper stages failed 
a third booster was loaded with fuel and the order was given to 
launch but the main rocket engine did not ignite it just stood 
there on the launch pad bathed in searchlights and fuming with 
clouds of supercold liquid oxygen oberg wrote 
nedelin made a fatal error and committed a gross violation of 
elementary rocket safety standards oberg wrote from the 
launch bunker where he had prepared to watch the expected success 
he ordered a team of engineers to inspect the rocket booster 
immediately 
since he was an experienced combat commander he would not 
send men into peril he himself avoided so he walked out to the 
base of the rocket while the inspection was being made 
although the main rocket failed to ignite the uppermost stage 
continued to operate as though it were en route to mars and at the 
time when it would have separated from the booster fired its own 
rockets 
a million pounds of kerosene and liquid oxygen flared up in a 
pyre which must have been visible for hundreds of miles oberg 
wrote 
the soviet press carried an official obituary of nedelin several 
days later saying that he had died tragically in the line of 
duty in a plane crash 
not a word has appeared since then in the official press 
although writings smuggled out of russia or published by emgres 
have described the incident and oberg pieced together the evidence

when an innocent bystander in an affluent los 
angeles neighborhood was killed in the crossfire of a gang 
gunbattle local merchants asked for more police protection and 
quickly got it 
the swift action following the jan 30 incident sparked protest 
from many blacks and hispanics who charged that similar requests 
from poorer minority neighborhoods fall on deaf ears 
a week after the shooting local minority leaders publicized a 
new study to support claims that police react more slowly to 
emergencies in less affluent areas police chief darryl gates 
released a letter friday from the studys author saying his 
findings had been misconstrued 
the racial tugofwar intensified last weekend when an offduty 
black police officer was arrested as he stood on a street corner in 
an upscale neighborhood with six black youths the officer said his 
group was conducting an informal sting operation to investigate 
alleged police harassment 
none of those kids did anything except stand on that corner 
and be black and that was enough said hawthorne police sgt 
don jackson police said jacksons group was blocking the sidewalk 
gang violence fueled by drug trafficking has been a reality for 
years in the citys predominantly black and hispanic southside 
neighborhoods driveby shootings are commonplace with innocent 
bystanders being killed by errant or ricocheting bullets 
in one recent incident a 67yearold woman was killed in a 
driveby shooting while she sat in a wheelchair in the doorway of 
her southside home 
there were more than 300 gangrelated murders in los angeles 
county in 1987 that figure may rise to 450 this year as gangs 
battle for control of the lucrative crack cocaine market said 
michael genelin head of the district attorneys gang division 
and thats not the way it should be we should be able to live 
normally said barbara thomas spokeswoman for the south central 
organizing committee a group that claims a membership of 78000 
black families 
gang violence has begun to move into more affluent mainly white 
areas illustrated by the jan 30 shooting of 27yearold karen 
toshima who was caught in gang crossfire she was killed in 
westwood village a popular theater and restaurant district 
when police stepped up patrols in the area hundreds of 
southside residents demonstrated at lapd headquarters charging 
that officials ignored daily death tolls in their communities 
minority leaders publicized a justreleased study ordered by the 
police commission and prepared by the public administration service 
in virginia the study showed that police responded more slowly to 
crimes in poor areas than in the more affluent westside and san 
fernando valley the leaders said 
the police department then released a letter from peter bellmio 
the principal author of the nearly 200page report that stated his 
findings had been misinterpreted 
the letter said the actual conclusion was that the police 
department takes too long to respond to emergencies and does not 
significantly respond more rapidly in any of the citys 
geographical areas 
bellmio said he was under contract not to comment publically 
until march 8 when he makes a formal report to the police 
commission 
the deployment controversy has fanned other racial issues such 
as the alleged harassment that prompted jackson to conduct his own 
sting 
in an effort to prove that lapd officers were mistreating 
blacks jackson and six friends gathered on a busy street corner in 
westwood while an associate secretly videotaped the scene 
officers arrested jackson on a misdemeanor charge and rounded up 
and frisked the others 
police defended the arrest saying jacksons group was blocking 
the sidewalk refused to move when requested by officers and was 
dressed in attire similar to gang members jackson was released on 
his own recognizance pending a court hearing 
more criticism of the police came monday when the rev william 
johnson of curry christian methodist episcopal temple complained 
that when officers do patrol black neighborhoods they come ready 
to do combat 
mayor tom bradley who is black signed an ordinance wednesday 
that provided for the hiring of 150 more officers increasing the 
force to its largest strength ever 7500 officers 
were determined to return this city to a drugfree gangfree 
atmosphere the mayor said 
ive been telling the people of this city that we need 
hundreds more police officers said gates the police chief we 
should focus on getting rid of the problems and not on the 
complicated subject of deployment 
some criminal experts say more officers wont make a difference 
in poor crimeinfested areas 
historically theres a resentment to an excessive show of 
force said garrett capune professor of criminology at the 
university of southern california and california state university 
it has a racist overtone you know there seems to be more 
crime because theres more officers he said it becomes a sort 
of selffulfilling prophecy 
i dont know what these criminologists are all about 
snapped city councilman nate holden who represents a mainly black 
district these guys can sit in some classroom and think what 
its supposed to be like but they havent seen the real world i 
resent them 
let them come into the black community and see what its 
like

a top pingpong player went to poland and took her 
son away from her exhusband then hid from polish authorities 
until she could sneak the boy into sweden a newspaper said 
saturday 
i have gone through hell and the child has gone through 
hell kaisa karlsson said in a telephone interview with the 
denver post from stockholm where she and her son michael arrived 
friday 
probably this night i can sleep said karlssons father 
bohdan dawidowicz also a top table tennis player from his home in 
suburban aurora 
karlsson 26 has been fighting since 1983 to win custody of 
michael from her polish exhusband who was initially given custody 
in colorado and polish courts she got the colorado ruling 
reversed but the polish ruling stood and she took matters into her 
own hands a week ago saturday 
she said she took her son away during her regular visit with him 
in warsaw then hid in a series of homes working her way from the 
warsaw suburbs to the port city of gdansk the post reported 
there they boarded a ferry for sweden late thursday 
karlsson wouldnt say exactly how she got her son past polish 
police who were looking for him 
there are just too many people who could get in trouble she 
said 
karlsson and dawidowiczs battles with the polish government 
began shortly after dawidowicz decided to live in the united states 
in 1971 in the middle of an international table tennis tour 
three years later after going back to poland they won 
permission for the whole family to come to the united states she 
won tournament after tournament representing us teams and in 
1978 became a us citizen 
in 1981 she married mitchell gaca another polish immigrant 
michael was born later that year they were divorced in 1983 with 
custody initially given to gaca 
karlsson battled back but her travels on the table tennis 
circuit worked against her and in 1985 her exhusband returned to 
poland with their son 
the same year karlsson introduced new evidence in her case and 
was awarded custody by an aurora court but it was too late 
karlsson and her father said they were disillusioned by the us 
governments handsoff approach 
the state department refused to intervene saying polish law 
applied since gaca had gotten a polish court to award him custody 
donna sherman a spokeswoman for the consular division of the 
us state department said there is not much the government can do 
once a child is in another countrys jurisdiction 
we cannot do anything that violates the laws of that 
country she said we can arrange for meetings to try and 
arrange some kind of conciliation but we cant force it we cant 
act as attorneys 
karlsson who has since married a swedish businessman hopes to 
visit the united states this summer but says that in the meantime 
she and michael will relax in sweden 
he needs a little rest i think hell be sticking around the 
house she said

sikh gunmen set off a new wave of 
violence saturday in punjab state killing 10 people and prompting 
police in the amritsar district and in new dehli go on red alert 
the attacks raised the death toll in violence blamed on the 
separatist radicals to 32 since friday at least 60 others were 
wounded 
we are after the killers the entire police force is on red 
alert said amritsar district police superintendent mohammed 
izhar alam 
road blocks were set up saturday throughout the farming state 
bordering pakistan and punjabs 35000member police force was 
being aided by paramilitary troops in the search operations 
in a related development a hindu angered by the spate of 
killings entered a sikh temple and set fire to sikh holy book in 
wadala kala a village 26 miles south of amritsar saturday police 
said 
we are worried because this will give rise to tension said 
police officer rajinder singh 
the man identified as atma ram was arrested singh said rams 
younger brother had been slain by suspected sikh radicals last 
month 
he was angry after he heard the news of the new killings he 
went inside a gurdwara sikh shrine and set fire to the holy 
book singh said 
sikh militants have been fighting for a separate homeland in 
punjab since 1982 sikhs are a majority in punjab but comprise 
only 2 percent of indias 800 million people more than 80 percent 
of whom are hindus 
the radicals want an independent homeland because they say the 
hindus discriminate against them 
at least 250 people have been killed in sikhrelated violence 
this year last year more than 1000 deaths were blamed on the 
separatists 
among saturdays victims were two hindu farm laborers a hindu 
trader and four sikh farmers the remaining three have yet to be

the sikh faith has elements of both hinduism and islam and was 
founded about 500 years ago as a peaceful alternative to the two 
warring religions 
but the sikhs 10th and last prophet guru govind singh 
declared sikhism as a warrior faith in which the adherents should 
all carry swords and the male should bear the name singh lion

the 16yearold accused of the ax 
murders of four members of his family wrote poetry and was so 
gentle he wouldnt step on a flower friends say but those 
closest to him also saw a darker side 
david brom who faces four charges of firstdegree murder in the 
slayings of his mother father sister and brother had expressed 
frustration and anger about his parents and was drawn to 
hardcore punkrock bands with songs of pain insanity and death 
i saw the school side of david i think youre going to find 
there were a lot of faces said the rev jack krough davids 
teacher and the chaplain of rochester lourdes high school 
a favorite of davids according to one friend is the group 
suicidal tendencies a song on their latest album describes 
the maniac ill meet his love for me is like a father to a son 
and now the maniac and i are one 
the high school sophomore was arrested friday after an allnight 
manhunt in this city of 62000 about 90 miles southeast of 
minneapolis 
friends according to krough had heard david muse recently 
about wanting to hurt his family they regarded that as an 
expression of typical teenage alienation but never as a serious 
plan the priest said 
to most david had a quiet magnetism at school krough said he 
was an avid bicyclist but not a jock and he wasnt active in 
other extracurricular activities at the 415student parochial 
school principal michael leahy said 
there was a group of students he was the center of krough 
said i guess you would tend to call him an artistic poetic kind 
of person a deepfeeling person 
about david and his friends krough said if there was ever a 
group of adolescents that fit the image of sensitive teens that 
group would qualify 
many of broms friends wrote letters to be delivered to the 
olmsted county jail and they defended him fiercely when questioned 
by reporters 
the punk appearance he adopted the day of the killings 
including shaving the sides of his head dying his hair black and 
spiking it on the back of his head seemed out of character to some 
he wouldnt step on a flower said schoolmate chris 
bromelkamp whose locker is next to davids he may have done 
something wrong but theres a lot of people he touched 
authorities were far from understanding what may have triggered 
the slayings but sheriff charles von wald said one small piece 
came out in interviews with davids friends the teenager and his 
father had an argument about a tape the boy had taken home he said 
also unexplained was how a boy described as an almost frail 130 
pounds could commit the slayings with a 28inch ax without anyone 
in the house escaping 
chief deputy sheriff stan anderson would not comment on other 
details of the murders such as where the weapon was obtained or 
why the suspect stayed in rochester after the killings 
the victims were bernard brom 41 paulette 40 diane 14 and 
rick 11 the only family survivor other than david is his 
19yearold brother joseph who has his own apartment in rochester 
rochester is dominated by the mayo clinic and an ibm plant where 
the elder brom worked 
mrs brom had recently quit her job at the church to spend more 
time with her children leahy noted 
david did not appear to possess his parents devout religious 
faith krough said david was a searcher he said

there are signs that child heart transplant 
recipients develop atherosclerosis and also have a worse survival 
rate than adults given new hearts a transplant surgeon says 
dr d glenn pennington chief of the cardiac replacement 
service at st louis university hospital in st louis said he has 
seen indications of development of atherosclerosis in child 
transplant recipients and it may become more of a trend 
atherosclerosis is the thickening of the internal lining of the 
blood vessels and the cause of coronary artery disease 
as for survival rates i think it is worse than adults with 
infection the leading cause of death among children pennington a 
specialist in the use of artificial devices and in pediatric 
transplantation said friday at an international conference on 
thoracic organ transplantion 
he said children who have received transplants do not have worse 
problems with organ rejection than adults but he said there is an 
increasing number of child transplants who need retransplantation 
because of progressive failure of the organs they have been given 
i dont know what that means but my suspicion is that if we 
transplant children in infancy we will probably have to 
retransplant at some point again pennington said 
there was encouraging news on transplants from a leader in 
transplantation for extremely young infants dr leonard l bailey 
of loma linda university medical center in california who said 
some of his patients have exhibited an immune tolerance not 
seen in adults 
as a result several of the young recipients need only extremely 
small doses of the antirejection drug cyclosporine and may be 
withdrawn entirely from all drug therapy 
my guess is that a number of the babies will be able to grow 
up without the need for immunosuppression bailey said 
cyclosporine is used in transplantation in combination with 
other drugs to suppress the bodys immune system and keep it from 
turning against the donor heart 
bailey said he believes the optimal therapy is diagnosis of 
heart disease inutero because that gives us a chance then from 35 
weeks on to find a donor 
he said that in his programs experience transplants after more 
than the first few weeks of a childs life make for a much more 
difficult postoperative management problems those who have 
been transplanted in the first month of life have really been a 
piece of cake 
infants more than 3 to 3 months old given transplants will 
reject with considerable vigor requiring aggressive 
antirejection therapy said bailey who has performed heart 
transplants on the worlds youngest infants including a 
fourhourold canadian boy last october

the surgeon who transplanted a baboons 
heart into an infant girl in 1984 says hes optimistic about the 
continuing research toward eventual use of animal heart transplants 
in humans 
were still really working vigorously in that area from all 
points of view goats and sheep and primates dr leonard l 
bailey said at a threeday international conference on thoracic 
organ transplantation that concluded saturday 
researchers have turned to exploring the use of nonhuman organs 
for transplantation on either a temporary or possibly permanent 
basis in part because of the lack of sufficient organ donors 
in a controversial procedure in october 1984 bailey and his 
staff at loma linda university medical center transplanted the 
heart of a baboon into a 12dayold girl known as baby fae 
the child born with a fatal heart defect survived for 20 days 
before her bodys immune system rejected the foreigntissue 
transplant or xenograft 
rejection has been a major obstacle in xenografts 
another problem area has been the ethical question of using a 
primate heart in humans said dr bartley p griffith of the 
university of pittsburgh 
griffith thoracic and cardiovascular surgeon at one of the 
nations busiest transplant centers said chimpanzees are almost 
too close to humans in terms of behavior and would raise a moral 
dilemma 
nobody is talking about using chimpanzees and yet they in 
fact are the most sizeappropriate probably to use he said 
griffith added that baboons hearts are small for human use and 
might eventually be used more appropriately as auxiliary hearts 
bailey said the testing that has been conducted at the loma 
linda calif facility has involved a series of experiments 
testing the xenograft bridge to allograft theory and its 
working out very well an allograft is a samespecies organ 
transplant 
the testing he said includes using xenografts of green monkey 
hearts into baboons in temporary bridgetotransplant situations 
we still very firmly believe that a wellselected primate 
heart from a baboon will be virtually as good as a human 
allograft that may have no tissue match whatsoever and bear very 
little resemblance and genetic makeup to the original even as a 
permanent graft he said

american banker and philanthropist david 
rockefeller unveiled a private nonprofit foundation saturday that 
he said will aid hardpressed farmers in this communist country 
rockefeller met privately with polish communist leader gen 
wojciech jaruzelski before formally inaugurating the foundation 
which will raise pigs and export hams to the united states 
it seems to me that what we all need to do is to find ways in 
which despite the ideological differences we can work together 
rockefeller said at a ceremony in warsaws royal castle 
organizers said the foundation brings poland its first new 
longterm western credits since the 1981 martial law crackdown and 
will serve as a model for western institutions wishing to provide 
financial assistance to the debtstricken country 
but the size of the credits 24 million is miniscule compared 
to polands burgeoning foreign debt now standing at 392 billion 
the foundation for the development of polish agriculture is the 
result of the personal interest of rockefeller and the rockefeller 
brothers fund said leon irish chairman of the foundations 
organizing committee 
its first project will be the development of swine production to 
increase exports of premium polish hams to the united states by 14 
percent 
the foundation will borrow money to import to poland 
highprotein feed concentrates from the united states for sale to 
polish farmers under a contract arrangement 
the farmers will use the feed to raise swine more efficiently 
the swine will be sold to polish meat processors in partnership 
with the foundation 
hams resulting from the arrangement will be exported to the 
united states with a portion staying in poland for domestic sale 
proceeds from the exports will repay foreign loans and be used 
for other foundation projects irish said 
unlike other east bloc nations where cooperative farming 
predominates private farmers control 75 percent of the farmland in 
poland and produce 80 percent of the crop 
the foundation is to be governed by a council with 60 percent 
us and western european membership and 40 percent private polish 
membership

two city ambulance workers face disciplinary 
charges because they waited for their sandwiches in a delicatessen 
before responding to a report of a heart attack victim 1 blocks 
away officials said saturday 
the man died in the incident wednesday in the bronx 
the emergency medical service said its investigation had 
substantiated allegations of delay both crew members had been 
reassigned to clerical duties and faced disciplinary charges it 
said 
ems director james kerr said it was impossible to know whether 
the delay which he said amounted to 5 minutes had cost the 
stricken man his life but he said ems policy requires ambulance 
crews to respond immediately 
the crew had just ordered sandwiches to go when a man ran in 
into the deli at 830 pm wednesday and said someone had suffered 
a heart attack in the church of the mediator kerr said 
instead of leaving at once the investigation showed the pair 
waited for their sandwiches kerr said he declined to identify the 
crew or discuss possible penalties

south african fighter planes 
flew revenge raids on guerrilla bases in angola at dawn saturday a 
day after a bomb killed 18 people in a namibian bank 
angolan authorities said several civilians were killed 
more than a dozen mirage and impala aircraft attacked three 
bases of the southwest african peoples organization in southern 
angola the defense force chief gen jannie geldenhuys said in a 
statement 
he said the attacks avenged the bombing friday of the first 
national bank in oshakati southwest africa where 18 people were 
killed and 31 injured most of the dead were black government 
employees cashing their weekly paychecks 
geldenhuys accused swapo of the bank bombing the guerrilla 
group has been fighting for 22 years against south africas 
occupation of southwest africa also known as namibia 
on friday swapo denied involvement in the bank blast the 
deadliest in namibia in two decades it has claimed responsibility 
for other bombings in namibia 
swapo officials in london declined to comment on saturdays raid 
later saturday angolas defense ministry said the air assault 
on lubango and onjiva left several civilians dead 
a statement reported by the official angolan news agency angop 
said the exact number of victims had not yet been determined 
according to a report monitored in lisbon 
the angop report made no mention of swapo or geldenhuys 
announcement 
on friday south african defense minister magnus malan and 
foreign minister roelof pik botha warned neighboring states 
that south african troops would undertake unannounced hot 
pursuit raids across borders to fight guerrilla groups 
we have repeatedly invited them neighboring states to talk 
with us to sort our problems in peace now they have demonstrated 
they are not interested botha said reacting to news of the 
namibian bombing as far as im concerned there is no more talk 
of a regional conference not from our side were no longer 
interested in the neighboring states 
geldenhuys said eight mirage fighters took part in the attack on 
two targets near lubango about 190 miles north of the 
namibianangolan border and five impala aircraft attacked targets 
at ongiva about 25 miles north of the border 
geldenhuys said all the south african aircraft returned safely 
but gave no estimate of casualties inflicted 
he said the lubango targets were swapos most important 
training center in angola the tobias hainyeko training center and 
a terrorist holding area about 10 kms 62 miles west of there 
an air force source told the associated press that the jets that 
attacked lubango were probably mirage f1as a frenchdesigned 
fighterbomber capable of carrying about 14000 pounds of bombs 
the impalas are a south african version of an italian aermacchi 
light attack craft they can carry sidewinder airtoair missiles 
and are able to carry about 4000 pounds of missiles or bombs 
the general said swapo had launched a number of attacks from 
ongiva on civilians in southwest africa 
in 1971 the united nations ruled that south africas occupation 
of namibia was illegal but south africa has defied the court and 
continued its occupation 
only about 70000 of namibias 13 million people are white and 
the south african government has installed a multiracial 
transitional administration to run the territorys affairs 
swapo has refused to negotiate with the transitional government 
citing the un resolution demanding free elections 
south african and southwest african troops have been fighting 
for about five months in angola on behalf of the unita rebel 
movement which is battling the marxist government in luanda south 
african officials say they will not grant independence to namibia 
until the 40000 cuban troops supporting angolas marxist 
government leave africa 
all of south africas blackruled neighbors swaziland 
lesotho mozambique botswana and angola have accused south 
africa of staging unannounced crossborder raids during the past 10 
years killing dozens of civilians as well as alleged guerrillas 
south african officials have denied refused to comment on or 
ridiculed most of the claims although they did announce a raid 
last year on livingstone zambia 
but military officials have acknowledged previous hot 
pursuit operations against swapo in southern angola 
botha and malan presented their statement friday as a new 
gettough policy against neighboring governments which they say 
allow the antiapartheid african national congress swapo and other 
guerrilla organizations to stage attacks on south africa from their 
territories 
by law and custom in south africa apartheid establishes a 
racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no 
vote in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy 
and maintain separate districts schools and health services

the organizer of a planned blood bank for 
chaste donors says he hopes to expand into a national network of 
christian blood banks a plan one physician called a dangerous 
attempt to capitalize on fear of aids 
dr condon hughes said he hopes to open lifeblood a christian 
blood bank that will not accept promiscuous donors by early april 
blood donors will be asked to sign a statement confirming they have 
abstained from sex or been faithful to a spouse since 1977 
the blood also will be tested for aids and other bloodborne 
viruses hughes said 
my intention is to inform heterosexuals that if they have more 
than one faithful partner that they are at risk of developing a 
deadly disease and to provide blood from people who do not fall 
into that category hughes said 
but dr ronald gilcher of the oklahoma blood institute said 
hughes inaccurately implies that lifebloods supply will be safer 
than other blood banks 
and us food and drug administration spokeswoman susan cruzan 
noted that the fdas list of risk categories does not include 
promiscuous heterosexuals 
what we see this doing is undermining the donor base 
confusing people creating distrust and a lack of credibility 
gilcher said we think that is a dangerous thing 
i commend what hes doing in the sense of trying to create a 
safer blood supply because thats what were all doing but the 
method by which dr hughes is trying to do this i think is 
unsound gilcher said i think its dangerous because it could 
create a lack of availability of blood products 
gilcher said existing blood banks already screen donors and test 
donated blood 
the blood supply is safe but its not 100 percent safe 
gilcher said there is no such thing as a zero risk the public 
wants a zero risk but it doesnt exist 
gilcher said hughes exclusion of heterosexuals who have had 
more than one partner since 1977 relies on the honesty of the donor 
and the honesty of the donors sexual partner he said it also 
dangerously limits the pool of potential donors 
but hughes said he thinks chaste and faithful donors can supply 
the nation with blood 
five percent of the nation provides the blood for the entire 
nation hughes said i am confident that there is 5 percent of 
the nation that is chaste our goal is to identify those 
individuals and encourage them to give blood take a stand for 
morality and administer the love of christ through blood 
donations 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an affliction 
in which a virus attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers one method 
of transmission is through infected blood or blood products 
the fda requires all blood banks to provide potential donors 
with information about aids and ask them to refrain from donating 
if they fall into certain risk categories 
the fda constantly reviews categories cruzan said the 
category of promiscuous heterosexuals was discussed in 1986 
epidemiologists concluded at that time that the heterosexual spread 
of hiv the aids virus was not a significant reason to exclude 
this category 
hughes said he plans to sell blood on a firstcome firstserved 
basis regardless of religion or sexual activity for a fee donors 
will be allowed to have their own blood frozen for their own use 
the cost of the blood is going to be determined primarily by 
the number of donors that we have we hope it will be comparable to 
the nonprofit oklahoma blood institute we may be at a 
disadvantage because we have to pay taxes hughes said

a sitin launched by 200 university of 
massachusetts students at the start of a snowy holiday weekend 
seemed doomed by doubt and disarray leaders of the little 
rebellion by minorities recalled 
you do not take a building on a night before a major snowstorm 
that will close it anyway and which is going to be closed for an 
entire holiday weekend michael thelwell a black professor said 
he warned the protesters at the start of the occupation 
but by the end of the sixday occupation of new africa house 
hundreds of white students had displayed their sympathy in rallies 
and vigils money and supplies had poured in from around the nation 
and even the chancellor had expressed admiration for the 
protesters who won several concessions from the school 
we werent organized all we had were these five little 
demands said jo ella costello a negotiator for the group but 
something had brought us all together that was the fascinating 
thing by the third day we knew it was working 
the takeover began feb 11 after students met with chancellor 
joseph d duffey to discuss the demands troubled by recent acts of 
racial violence on campus the protesters insisted on the 
disciplining of five white students accused of beating two blacks 
and they demanded a stop to the encroachment of other school 
departments on new africa house a third world center 
tension had festered since an october 1986 beating of a black 
student by several whites following the boston red sox loss to the 
new york mets in the final game of the world series 
the disorganized protesters refused to meet with duffey the 
morning after the takeover but began forming committees to handle 
finances security media questions and negotiations and they 
imposed strict procedures on meetings 
the rules proved successful we started voting on everything 
costello said we even voted on which movies to watch 
support began pouring in from the campus and beyond the black 
faculty senate said members would risk arrest with the protesters 
if the chancellor called in police to remove them from the 
building costello said 
the massachusetts teachers association volunteered to strike in 
the same event she said some 500 white students staged a rally 
outside the building to lend their support 
costello said she knew the protesters had won widespread support 
when she went to a nearby dormitory for a shower they said you 
all from new africa house i said yeah anybody got any soap 
they ran to get it theyd give us deodorant anything 
costello was among four women and five men elected by the 
protesters to negotiate with the chancellor 
a meeting scheduled for monday had to be postponed when duffey 
went to visit a brother who had undergone major surgery the 
protesters sent the chancellor a card and duffey responded with a 
basket of fruit 
we had oldtimers with us saying my god ive been going to 
sitins for 20 years and ive never seen anything like this 
costello said 
duffey and the students met tuesday and talked for more than 
four hours 
but then the group that had been occupying the house was 
suddenly outnumbered by minorities returning to the campus from the 
holiday weekend 
they were acting like wed sold out saidcostello 
i was really hurt by all these people who hadnt been there 
the whole time i asked them where were you 
the newcomers left early wednesday and the stalwart core voted 
to accept duffeys responses to their demands which included 
timetables for the hiring of minority faculty and a promise to 
leave the new africa house in the hands of the third world 
community 
costello said the agreement was a victory that will enhance the 
schools image among whites and blacks 
i think umass will get the reputation of fighting racism 
she said this is terrific whats happening here

relief services for about 260000 
palestinian refugees in lebanon will be cut to the minimum because 
of the kidnapping of two scandinavian employees of the un relief 
and works agency the agency said saturday 
there will be noticeable changes in unrwa services and 
activities because of security problems and the lack of freedom of 
movement said agency spokesman niall kiely 
we feel agency staff be they foreign nationals or locals are 
under threat to their physical safety 
unrwa employees jan stening 44 of sweden and william 
jorgensen 58 of norway were kidnapped feb 5 unrwa said 
palestinians acting independently of guerrilla factions kidnapped 
the men for personal motives 
kiely said only four of the 14 international staff assigned to 
lebanon remained in west beirut and they are very heavily 
involved in the search for stening and jorgensen 
he said he was reasonably hopeful that the scandinavians 
would be released because there are no real setbacks in 
negotiations he did not elaborate 
kiely said unrwa has canceled a repair program for beiruts 
warravaged chatilla and bourj elbarajneh palestinian refugee 
camps because it cant be supervised 
about 2200 local relief workers serve with unrwa at field 
centers in lebanon 
kiely said another impact of the kidnappings in south lebanon 
was that all unrwa transports between beirut and the southern port 
cities of sidon and tyre have been stopped both ways 
he said agency operations such as schools have a certain 
momentum so for the moment many services will continue to run as 
before

the government in estonia accused us senators of 
trying to ruin sovietamerican relations and scuttle nuclear 
disarmament by encouraging nationalist demonstrations in the baltic 
republic tass said saturday 
the official soviet news agency said the presidium of the 
supreme soviet of estonia issued a statement saying the senators 
are taking part in a new propaganda farce they advocate a 
favorable attitude to antisoviet actions planned to be held in 
estonia by some groups 
such steps can further only one political aim to hamper the 
improvement of sovietamerican relations and to undermine the 
nuclear disarmament process tass said 
the statement was the latest manifestation of a dispute between 
the government and nationalist activists supported by western 
politicians over the fate of the baltic states 
the states estonia lithuania and latvia were independent 
until they were incorporated into the soviet union in 1940 some 
residents believe their national identity and religious freedom are 
suppressed under soviet rule 
moscowbased dissidents said some lithuanians demonstrated 
tuesday to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the declaration of 
independence from soviet russia months after the bolshevik 
revolution of 1917 wednesday is estonias anniversary of 
independence and activists say they plan protests there also 
this month 32 us senators wrote to kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev asking him not to interfere with demonstrations and 
religious services in the baltics the senators urged gorbachev 
not only to allow the lithuanian and estonian people to 
peacefully honor their national independence days but also to take 
all necessary measures to guarantee that they do not become targets 
of statesponsored harassment 
estonias presidium shot back that those who call into 
question the choice made by estonia in 1940 when it joined the 
union of soviet socialists republics as a fullfledged member 
oppose the will of our people the policy of perestroika the 
principles of humanism and the policy of peace 
perestroika is the name of gorbachevs wideranging program to 
reform soviet society 
in a speech to the communist party central committee on 
thursday gorbachev acknowledged the nationalities problem remains 
thorny he said soviets must respect the language and culture of 
national groups but that nationalism aimed at selfisolation lead 
only to a spiritual blind alley 
the presidium statement also acknowledged the nationalities 
problem but said some people are taking advantage of the recent 
soviet campaign for openness as a means of kindling hostility 
among the nationalities living on estonian territory this fully 
applies to the groups that emerged in estonia which try to put 
soviet estonia and its history in a bad light 
tass did not say when the presidium of the supreme soviet of 
estonia the republics nominal parliament issued the statement 
last august thousands of people demonstrated in estonias 
capital and those of the other baltic states on the anniversary of 
a secret agrement between nazi germany and the soviet union the led 
to the soviet takeover of the baltic states in 1940 
the us government has never recognized the soviet 
incorporation of the baltic states 
in a related development an estonian political activist and his 
family of six arrived in sweden saturday after being expelled from 
the soviet union 
about 30 exiles greeted rein metz his wife and five small 
children at the airport 
metz told swedish television at stockholms arlanda airport he 
was the leader of a religious and political association he 
said he expected 3040 more members of his congregation could 
be forced to leave 
i greet you in the name of jesus he told some 30 exiles at 
the airport 
last weekend two converted estonian buddhists arrived in sweden 
after given the choice of going to jail or leave the country one 
of them ekepart nomm 22 said he had probably been forced to 
leave because he read an appeal to form an estonian independence 
party at a meeting in the city of tartu on feb 2

a leader of the congressional irancontra 
probe says he cant understand why vice president george bush 
remains reluctant to discuss his role in the affair months after 
president reagan opened the administrations books 
i dont know why hes been so hesitant to acknowledge that he 
supported the president in it said arthur liman chief senate 
counsel in the investigation he was not a decisive factor 
liman 55 was on the hawaiian island of maui on thursday 
preparing to address tuesdays meeting of the federal bar council 
an association of judges he made the comments in an interview with 
the maui news newspaper 
the vice president now talks about the fact that his 
conversations with the president were privileged and he cant 
reveal them liman said the reality of it is the president 
waived executive privilege i saw memos diaries other documents 
reflecting meetings attended by the vice president and the 
president 
there was never any document withheld on that ground either 
by the vice president or the president liman said all of the 
damaging evidence came as a result of the white houses production 
of documents 
liman said evidence presented to the congressional committees 
shows the decision to sell arms to iran was made by the president 
and the vice president supported him liman said if bush had 
opposed the plan it wouldnt have made a difference 
the president heard arguments on both sides and made his own

john demjanjuks yearlong nazi war crimes trial 
was supposed to serve as a vivid history lesson to young israelis 
but it gave way to lengthy technical debates that some say 
trivialized the horrors of the holocaust 
demjanjuk the second man to stand trial in israel on nazi war 
crimes charges became more human to many israelis than adolf 
eichmann the first because he learned some hebrew and his family 
attended nearly every session 
he chatted with police guards laughed good naturedly during 
sessions and shouted the hebrew greeting shalom to bystanders 
as he was led handcuffed to and from court 
he even tried to shake hands with a death camp survivor who 
recoiled in horror and called demjanjuk a murderer 
but any sympathy demjanjuk might have won was virtually undone 
by a stumbling defense team that seemed to move two steps backward 
for every step forward 
for months before the trial ended last week israelis stood in 
line to get a seat in the converted movie theater where five 
holocaust survivors recounted how a guard called ivan the 
terrible mutilated jews with sadistic pleasure before driving 
them into gas chambers at the treblinka death camp in nazioccupied 
poland 
but interest waned and frustration mounted when the survivors 
emotional accounts of nazi atrocities were replaced by a 
timeconsuming often repetitive debate over the issue of 
identification 
demjanjuk 67 a retired ohio autoworker maintains he is not 
ivan but an innocent victim of mistaken identity 
this trial truly displayed the banality of justice ephraim 
zuroff a new yorkborn israeli and nazi hunter said in an 
interview theres no question that people got frustrated by the 
triviality and technicalities 
hundreds of exhibits even a paperclip were submitted in an 
effort to determine the authenticity of a key piece of prosecution 
evidence demjanjuks alleged nazi identity card 
six prosecution experts testified the card was authentic and an 
equal number of defense witnesses maintained it was forged 
demjanjuk contended the document was fabricated by the soviet 
union to punish him for fighting in an anticommunist unit at the 
end of world war ii 
for many israelis there was a difference between eichmann the 
man who masterminded adolf hitlers final solution and ivan who 
carried them out eichmann was convicted and hanged in 1962 
unlike eichmann whom spectators glimpsed only as he was tried 
behind a bulletproof screen demjanjuk had a human dimension that 
intensified the emotion of the trial 
the ukrainianborn defendants wife vera his three children 
and 2yearold grandson frequently watched the proceedings from 
front row seats and their anguish was recorded in israeli 
newspapers and on television 
shame on you you have no heart mrs demjanjuk screamed 
tearfully at prosecutors when the trial ended thursday and accused 
them of lying and failing to give her husband a fair trial 
the threejudge panel which has retired to review more than 
15000 pages of testimony and some 500 exhibits is expected to 
issue a verdict in april 
if convicted demjanjuk faces a maximum penalty of death but it 
is widely believed the sentence will not exceed life in prison 
on thursday one member of the audience holocaust survivor 
mordechai fuchs 63 displayed the pain of dozens of nazi victims 
who attended the proceedings over the year 
waving a tattered photograph of his parents three brothers and 
a sister killed at treblinka he sobbed the defense lawyers are 
liars why does this have to be such a performance 
but many israelis believe the attempt to probe into details 
showed the trial was fair 
it wasnt a quick openandshut case said toby greenwald a 
clevelandborn israeli no matter what the verdict no one can 
ever say there wasnt enough time spent on detail thats 
important because people will ask whether jewish judges can be 
fair in a war crimes trial 
some of his supporters however claimed demjanjuk did not get a 
fair hearing partly because of his own faltering defense team and 
the trials publicity some witnesses watched others testify on 
israel television before they took the stand 
demjanjuk frustrated by his defense fired mark oconnor of 
buffalo ny his attorney of seven years midway through the 
proceedings 
several defense witnesses were discredited including one who 
retracted her testimony and another who tried to commit suicide 
after her credentials were called into question 
some of the defense arguments seemed bizarre even demjanjuk 
squirmed uncomfortably in his seat when a defense expert claimed 
the soviet secret service used thought power to kill its 
enemies and inflict disasters on the west 
demjanjuks own contradictory version of his whereabouts during 
world war ii also appeared to hurt his case 
until the defense began its case i was not convinced of 
demjanjuks guilt said ehud offer a 31yearold israeli 
sculptor but the defense itself has erased the doubts

fire officials and university of vermont 
researchers saturday picked through the rubble of a nationally 
known laboratory for maple tree research destroyed by fire 
the laboratory at the universityaffiliated proctor maple 
research farm was engulfed in flames friday night in a fire of 
undetermined origin university officials said 
frederick laing an associate professor long involved in 
research at the farm said efforts in recent years had centered on 
finding a cause for declines in maple syrup production in vermont 
and around the northeast 
much of that research had been looking into whether acid 
precipitation atmospheric pollutants carried into the northeast on 
winds out of the midwest was to blame for recent maple production 
declines 
laing said saturday that it was now generally agreed that it 
acid rain is one of the stresses causing the slump in maple 
sugaring theres still some difficulty in assessing just how 
large a part it plays 
the fire which laing said destroyed between 200000 and 
250000 worth of equipment comes with this years maple sugar 
season about a month away it was unclear saturday whether the lab 
or some replacement facility could be geared up in time 
rayburn levigne a uvm assistant vice president for buildings 
and facilities said while the cause of the fire was unknown it 
was not believed to have been arson

possibly spooked by light at the end of 
the tunnel deer have been shy about using four passageways 
recently installed for them under a new maryland interstate highway 
the state highway administration built four corrugated steel 
culverts under sections of interstate 97 near annapolis in hopes of 
encouraging animals to cross under instead of over the roadway 
researchers at the university of marylands appalachian 
environmental laboratory in frostburg are trying to find out if 
animals are using the underpasses so far theyve found mink mice 
muskrat and raccoon but no deer have ventured through the dimly 
lighted pathways 
to us the opening at the other end looks fairly large 
said william r gates a graduate assistant working on the project 
but for deer its like going into a cave or tunnel and they 
arent used to going into enclosures 
several other states have tried culverts but little has been 
done to document their use 
the state and federal highway administrations are funding the 
210000 fiveyear study in hopes of finding a way to reduce the 
number of animals killed on american highways 
according to the federal highway administration an estimated 
200000 deer die each year on us roads however doug smith an 
fha ecologist said the number was a conservative estimate more 
than 25000 are killed each year on roads in states with high deer 
populations such as pennsylvania 
the study also aims to learn more about what happens to a 
wildlife area when it is bisected by a highway the interstate cuts 
through woods near crownsville state hospital 
researchers are observing tracks and using a wildlife 
surveillance system to monitor animal activity in the culverts 
movement at the tunnel openings trips sensors on video cameras 
which film the activity day or night 
so far we had a deer enter the culvert and then come back 
out gates said 
recent flooding inside the tunnels might have discouraged some 
animals from using them but gates said he suspected the culverts 
might not be large enough 
three of the culverts are 15 feet high 21 feet wide and about

yuri and tanya zieman got bad news again last 
week their latest application for an exit visa was turned down by 
soviet authorities 
vladimir tufeld learned friday that he too had once more been 
refused 
their disappointment was aggravated by the timing for the 
latest rejection notices arrived on the eve of secretary of state 
george shultzs visit to moscow an event many jewish 
refuseniks had hoped would help get them out 
in the past the soviets often have lowered emigration barriers 
just before highlevel ussoviet talks but there is no 
indication shultzs scheduled arrival on sunday has had much effect 
people are pinning so many hopes on him that im afraid its 
going to be a very pathetic frustration for many mrs zieman 
said there is nothing to pin your hopes on now 
a senior western diplomat who watches trends in soviet 
emigration and other human rights matters said what had been 
some fairly steady but limited improvement last year may have 
come to a halt 
as for freeing of political prisoners the process has 
stopped following the release last year of dozens of religious 
humans rights and nationalist activists the diplomat said he 
spoke only on condition he not be identified 
observers say one possible reason the flow of jewish emigrants 
appears to have slowed from last years unusually high levels is 
that the issue is receiving less official and public attention now 
most of the bestknown refuseniks have left in recent 
months said one diplomatic analyst and although thousands of 
wouldbe emigrants are left behind they arent as well organized 
and dont have as effective a voice as some of the jewish activists 
who have recently been granted exit visas 
the ziemans first applied for permission to emigrate when their 
daughter vera was a baby vera is now 11 years old and has grown 
up knowing she and her family could leave at any time but while 
they wait they are outcasts 
yuri zieman 50 lost his job as a computer programmer in the 
biomedical field as soon as he applied to leave and worked until 
recently as a janitor the familys plight has taken on a new 
urgency since yuri suffered a potentially deadly aneurysm in the 
brain several weeks ago and doctors warned him not to risk the 
delicate surgery to repair the afflicted artery unless he can reach 
the west 
although zieman says he never had access to state secrets the 
only reason he and his family have been given for the authorities 
refusal to permit them to leave is that theirs is a security 
case 
tufelds wife isolda was granted a threemonth visa in 
december to enable her to have surgery for a brain tumor she 
remains in johns hopkins university hospital in baltimore md 
after undergoing three operations last month her husband said 
saturday 
jewish emigration reached a peak of about 51000 in 1979 but 
dropped after that as ussoviet relations worsened in 1986 
fewer than 1000 were allowed to emigrate the number rose above 
8000 last year for the first time since 1979 but appears to have 
reached a plateau or declined since the ussoviet summit in 
december in washington 
some refuseniks blame soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
public annoyance at being questioned repeatedly on the subject 
others fear the us government has lost some of its persistence in 
the drive to improve relations and reach a strategic nuclear 
weapons accord with the kremlin 
in the meantime new groups of jews are forming to press their 
exit demands 
one calling itself the new wave announced it will hold 
demonstrations every week in downtown moscow to protest the refusal 
of soviet authorities to recognize its members eligibility for 
visas because they acknowledge they dont have immediate relatives 
abroad 
another group called the second generation consists of young 
people whose parents have spent years trying unsuccessfully to 
leave the country the children many now in their teens or 20s 
have grown up expecting that one day they would go to the west with 
their parents but now find they are barred just as their parents 
were

richard gephardts past has become his 
present dredged up endlessly by democratic presidential rivals who 
ask whether his evolution on issues from abortion to busing is a 
troubling lack of conviction 
the attacks on gephardt and his record could seriously damage 
the missourians candidacy if voters come to perceive the sixterm 
congressman as insincere in his beliefs according to political 
professionals 
its clearly everybodys best shot at gephardt says 
democratic pollster geoffrey garin 
what voters are really looking for is somebody who says what 
he means and means what he says during the election year 
gephardt has switched his positions on issues such as abortion 
and school busing since arriving in the house in 1977 to represent 
a bluecollar st louis district 
gephardt explains his changes as a natural evolution of his 
views and says they are unrelated to the start of his national 
campaign but gephardts democratic presidential rivals suggest 
they are flipflops of political convenience 
what i try to do in approaching issues is to do it from a 
practical point of view to ask what will solve a particular 
problem gephardt has said i have strong beliefs about things 
arms control central american policy tax reform trade health 
care social security and what have you but i dont come to those 
from an ideological viewpoint i try to look at the facts of a 
particular issue 
the attacks against gephardt heated up last week during a 
democratic debate in texas when sen albert gore jr mentioned 
several of gephardts voting zigzags and said im going to lay 
it on the line dick the next president has to be someone who the 
people will believe will stay with his convictions 
sen paul simon employed a similar attack strategy against 
gephardts voting record in television commercials aired during the 
new hampshire primary campaign the ads asked voters whether they 
could trust a candidate like gephardt who had changed his positions 
a newsweek magazine poll of 284 democratic leaders and 
politicians rated gephardt last among the partys seven 
presidential candidates the poll taken on feb 1719 and 
published this week asked if the candidates have been generally 
consistent in their stands on issues or not 
fiftyeight percent said gephardt had not been consitent and 38 
percent said he had according to the newsweek poll by contrast 
former colorado sen gary hart who was sixth was rated as 
inconsistent by 38 percent and consistent by 49 percent and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis who was first received an 86 
percent consistent rating and 5 percent inconsistent 
gephardt has obviously been wounded by the way that simon 
basically drew out his record says robert squier a democratic 
political consultant 
but squier contends it will be more difficult and far more 
expensive for candidates like gore to launch a similar tv offensive 
against gephardt in the south because of the large number of states 
participating in the super tuesday primaries on march 8 
i would guess that the gephardt people feel like they have 
been through a near miss says squier 
here are some of gephardts positions 
abortion gephardt started his career in congress backing 
antiabortion constitutional amendments but dropped his support in 
1986 saying there was no clear agreement in the country on an 
amendment and that was hurting the chances for resolving the 
controversial issue he says he continues to oppose federal 
financing of abortions but has pledged not to veto congressional 
appropriations of such money if elected president 
busing gephardt sponsored a constitutional amendment in the 
97th congress to prohibit forced busing of school children for 
desegregation a position in line with the views of his mostly 
white workingclass district in south st louis he says he no 
longer supports such an amendment because its a completely 
different situation 
the justice department and the courts are doing something very 
different which i think is working says gephardt today they 
use magnet schools voluntary plans and other methods of trying to 
get schools integrated and i think theyre much more effective 
social security in 1985 gephardt joined with conservative 
southern democrats in supporting a deficitcutting package that 
eliminated costofliving increases for social security and other 
federal retirement benefits the proposal was rejected in the 
house in his presidential campaign gephardt says social security 
should be taken out of the budget so it does not become entangled 
in deficitreduction fights on capitol hill he also says he would 
no longer support a freeze on social security adjustments 
defense in 1981 gephardt reversed his longstanding 
opposition to the mx missile and b1 bomber and voted for the 
weapons systems sought by president reagan in later years he 
renewed his opposition gephardt says he was wrong in changing his 
position and did so to give president reagan a bargaining chip in 
arms control talks with the soviet union 
gephardt supported former president carters proposal for a 
neutron bomb and in 1982 backed a reagan push for production of new 
chemical weapons as president gephardt says he would press for a 
ban on all nerve gas and chemical weapons he also is supporting a 
liberal democratic proposal to ban nuclear tests 
taxes gephardt a critic of reagans economic policies 
supported the administrations income tax cut proposal in 1981 he 
initially voted against the gop plan because he supported a 
democratic alternative however he backed the tax cut measure on 
final passage as did several other democratic leaders including 
house ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski gephardt has 
defended his vote saying once we lost the question was clear 
were we for a tax cut for the middle class or were we not 
education in 1981 gephardt voted for a conservative 
republican proposal to bar the justice department from using 
federal money to block prayer and meditation in public schools 
gephardt says his vote is consistent with his current view that 
you could have voluntary silent prayer in schools gephardt 
who campaigns on the need for educational improvements opposed 
establishing the education department he also has abandoned his 
past support of tuition tax credits

leftist guerrillas on saturday 
vowed to launch more attacks on us military advisers stationed in 
the country and claimed american personnel have become directly 
involved in combat 
washington last year provided more than 600 million in aid to 
the centrist government fighting an 8yearold war against 
marxistled insurgents most of the aid was military or warrelated 
commander roberto roca a member of the high command of the 
farabundo marti national liberation front said in an interview 
with the rebel radio station that us personnel are becoming 
increasingly involved in combat and repression 
he said that makes them more likely to suffer the consequences 
of insurgent activity 
rocas statement broadcast by the rebels radio venceremos did 
not appear to be a blanket threat against all americans in el 
salvador he referred to the 55 military advisers here training 
salvadoran government troops and to what he said was a contingent 
of about 40 american civilians advising and directing the 
repression of the peoples movement 
this kind of personnel is also part of the counterinsurgency 
campaign and because of that it will find itself increasingly the 
object of popular combat said roca 
for us the americans have always been those responsible for 
this war they have always sustained the war against the salvadoran 
people he said consequently the personnel they have fighting 
here is a military objective of our forces 
he claimed the us military advisers stationed at the 
headquarters of the 6th infantry brigade in usulutan 70 southeast 
of the capital san salvador took part in combat there wednesday 
an estimated 600 guerrillas attacked the base and a nearby 
cotton cooperative in the rebels biggest assault in 10 months 
eighteen people died in the fighting 
col inocente montano commander of the 6th brigade said there 
were four us advisers at the base when the rebels attacked he 
said the compound was never penetrated and that the advisers were 
never in danger but he added that they were ready in case of 
incursion to help repel the attack 
regulations governing the conduct of us advisers here prohibit 
them from participation in combat except in self defense 
to the degree that the wars operation theater is widened the 
american advisers the american personnel in those places will 
find themselves increasingly up against direct military 
operations said roca that is to say their the american 
military personnel will be going home wounded dead 
sgt gregory fronius the only military adviser to die in combat 
here was killed in march of last year during a guerrilla attack on 
an army base in the northern province of chalatenango 
the rebels assassinated a us officer here in 1983 and killed 
four us marine embassy guards two american businessmen and seven 
other people in a machine gun attack on a san salvador cafe in 1985

the dean of harvard college has warned students 
that anyone involved in racial incidents faces expulsion and other 
disciplinary measures but says his comments are general and not 
provoked by any particular incident 
in dealing with situations where harassment discrimination or 
insensitivity come to light the college is ready to respond firmly 
and with appropriate actions dean alfred jewett said in an open 
letter to the harvard community 
in cases where physical harassment of students by other 
members of the community occurs there is a general principle that 
the harasser should be asked to leave the community said the 
letter published friday by the student newspaper the harvard 
crimson 
the letter was issued a week after minority students at 
university of massachusetts in amherst took over a campus building 
to protest campus racism the students left the building wednesday 
after meeting with the school chancellor 
in a telephone interview jewett said the letter was issued to 
lay down principles in the wake of deliberations with a committee 
on racial relations that was set up last year 
harvard and the committee of students and faculty members 
decided to come out with a series of messages that would alert 
the community to problems that might exist and do exist in some 
communities jewett said mine is the first statement 
four white students were expelled for a year last fall after 
frozen fruit was hurled at a black student who later received 
several racially derogatory telephone calls 
jewett said we have had no major things outside of that 
incident the decision to issue the open letter was made later in 
december but its publication was postponed until after exams 
the crimson said questions of racism were raised earlier this 
month after students alleged that a professor made unspecified 
disparaging comments about blacks and indians during a course 
called the peopling of america 
harvard officials who asked to remain anonymous said they were 
aware of the allegations but said no investigation would be made 
unless a formal complaint was made

future peace talks between nicaraguas 
leftist government and its contra rebels are likely to have a 
political hue the sandinistas never wanted 
the government appeared to open the door to political 
discussions with its armed opponents by belatedly agreeing in 
principle last week to a proposal by the mediator of the 
negotiations cardinal miguel obando y bravo head of the roman 
catholic church in nicaragua 
that proposal called on the contras to accept a ceasefire in 
exchange for four major concessions by the sandinista government 
the concessions were something the contras had been seeking and 
they were quick to accept the cardinals plan 
the government was called upon to grant unrestricted freedom of 
the press and a total unconditional amnesty for political 
prisoners renew a dialogue with its internal opposition and review 
its universal military conscription law 
whether it was a tactical error or a considered response the 
sandinistas delayed in taking a position that president daniel 
ortega has long and strenuously opposed on innumerable occasions 
in the past he has said he would never discuss political matters 
with the contras 
we dont want to create the impression that we dont want a 
ceasefire and are being intransigent said paul reichler a 
washington dc attorney who advises the sandinistas at all 
costs we want the negotiations to go forward 
reichlers comments came in a chat with reporters friday after 
obando y bravo abruptly suspended the latest round of peace talks a 
day before they were supposed to end and obliquely blamed the 
sandinistas for the breakdown 
ortega said saturday in managua that the cardinals proposal 
was not rejected by the sandinistas and said his government 
is willing to continue the conversations 
but a clarification was needed on the withdrawal of the contras 
to enclaves during the truce ortega said at the close of a 
government meeting 
he repeated that his government is willing to apply an amnesty 
once a ceasefire is in effect referring to the military draft he 
said it is logical that with the end of the war the military 
service will not require the current volume of soldiers 
ortega told the meeting on new economic measures aimed at 
fighting inflation that enemies of the revolution opposed the 
measures he said the right the extreme left and the opposition 
daily la prensa should be careful not to stir up insurrection 
the cardinal said after his return to managua on saturday that 
with the suspension of talks we have given time for reflection 
since there is a lack of trust between the two sides 
appearances are of vital importance to both sides with neither 
party wanting to be seen as the spoiler as long as there is any 
remaining chance the us congress might approve additional 
military aid for the contras 
in private talks with reporters the sandinistas made it clear 
that they were initially surprised by the cardinals fivepoint 
proposal then disappointed by his abrupt cancellation of the talks 
victor hugo tinoco nicaraguas deputy foreign minister said 
obando halted the negotiations friday afternoon before he had a 
chance to deliver the governments formal written response to the 
proposal the cardinal put forth thursday 
but tinoco insisted that he had discussed the governments 
position at length with the cardinal friday morning and had not 
been given any reason to believe that the cardinal was unwilling to 
continue the negotiations 
the cardinal did not tell us he disagreed with the 
governments position reichler told reporters later 
in its written response the government declared its agreement 
in principle with the cardinals proposal but carefully 
conditioned its answers to his requests that it reconsider its 
mandatory draft law and grant an unconditional amnesty to the 
thousands of political prisoners in nicaraguan jails 
but before nicaraguas formal response was delivered obando had 
canceled the talks saying he was disappointed that both sides had 
not accepted his proposal at least in principle the remark was 
clearly aimed at the sandinistas 
but late or not the governments response clearly put such 
political matters as press freedom and amnesty on the bargaining 
table for further talks and given the opening the contras are 
likely to push for even greater concessions 
the cardinal is expected to announce a time and place for a 
third round of facetoface negotiations sometime this week the 
first round of talks took place in san jose costa rica in late 
january only a week before the house rejected president reagans 
latest request for about 43 million in additional contra aid 
but the administration is considering a new bid for military aid 
for the rebels and as long as that possibility exists both sides 
will be playing their cards cautiously at the bargaining table

pressmens union

package that fell into place just before 2 am when murdoch said 
he would provide 3 million to the unions to satisfy the terms of 
his sale agreement 
the unions had already agreed to concessions totaling 19 
million and said they could not give any more

kalikow will take over the post for 376 million on march 7 
pending rankandfile ratification of the concessions and 
verification by his accountants of the details

editorial changes that could tone down the posts brassy style and 
was committed to keeping the paper operating 
there will be some changes in the format and appearance of the 
paper but hes not yet ready to discuss the changes in detail

by post employees

discuss his plans rubenstein said 
he wants to assure them he bought the paper so it could 
continue being a powerful voice in new york city and that he did 
not buy it for the real estate rubenstein said he will try to 
make it a very new york paper

gone into it with great vigor 
kalikow faces stiff problems in a highly competitive market the 
daily news and new york newsday are also fighting for tabloid 
readers and the new york times maintains a strong leadership in 
advertising revenue 
the post was founded in 1801 by alexander hamilton and other 
investors and during its long history has come close to folding 
several times the latest threat came from a federal law that 
forced murdoch to sell the financially troubled tabloid because he 
also owns a new york city television station wnywtv 
he had said the post was losing 100000 a day and that he had 
lost 150 million since he bought it in 1976 for 31 million 
after saturdays agreement was announced murdoch said i 
would do it all again i hate to leave it 
the 22 million package presented to kalikow will eliminate 130 
of the 1012 union jobs at the post some immediately and some 
later over the threeyear life of the deal the paper has about 
1200 employees 
i dont think theres any question that without murdochs 
contribution of 3 million the paper would have definitely shut 
down lawyer and mediator theodore kheel said i would give him 
the lions share of the credit 
the package to keep the post afloat consists of 22 million in 
lost jobs and pay cuts and 3 million from murdochs news america 
corp to restore the pay cuts because of that contribution no 
paycheck will be smaller for the employees who remain 
kheel said murdoch referred to the 3 million he put into the 
settlement as his farewell gift to the post and its employees

president daniel ortega said saturday 
that the right the extreme left and the opposition newspaper la 
prensa should be careful because they can in fact provoke an 
insurrection that can destroy them 
speaking at the closing of the leftist governments meeting on 
new economic measures ortega said enemies of the revolution 
including the political opposition the us government and la 
prensa opposed new economic steps announced by his administration 
the past week 
he called la prensa the daily of the cia 
the opposition from both sides of the political spectrum and the 
superior council of private enterprise ortega said have said 
that the time for an insurrection has come 
he said they should not be looking for five feet on the cat 
because they may find them they should be careful because if they 
put themselves on the side of the contras and the aggressors they 
are going to stir winds that can provoke tempests 
the superior council of private enterprise is the most important 
private business organization in nicaragua 
adding more teeth to the economic measures announced earlier 
ortega announced one to fouryear prison sentences for 
speculators he said taxi drivers and others who work in 
transportation would have their vehicles confiscated if they 
charged more than the official prices 
he also announced a 10 percent reduction in the national budget 
and a tax exemption for 22900 families whose housing loans were 
forgiven by the government 
the exact amount of the budget is not known and he did not 
elaborate on where the cuts would be made 
those and other measures announced the past week are to give 
the economy a push and fight inflation he said 
the sandinista government on monday created a new cordoba 
currency worth 1000 times as much as the old one and pegged it at 
10 to the dollar 
it also raised salaries to five times what they were in december 
and authorized price increases of up to more than 50 percent on 
some basic goods 
although the measures were designed to slow inflation which was 
1500 percent for 1987 prices already were being hiked beyond the 
new official levels 
ortega issued a decree that requires individuals and 
corporations to report any foreign currency holdings of more than 
500 
a stamped signed copy of a report of the holdings to one of the 
countrys banks will be legal authorization for the owner to keep 
the money said the decree issued friday reports must be filed 
within 15 days but are not required if the funds are deposited in 
stateowned banks 
failure to follow the rules will be considered a currency 
violation punishable by one to three years in prison under a 1981 
law 
another decree authorizes the governments central bank to 
investigate large deposits of old cordobas if there are suspected 
of being linked to illegal activity 
groups from sandinista defense committees civilian neighborhood 
organizations accompanied by police have raided storerooms of 
alleged black market businesses and public markets to confiscate 
goods and force vendors to sell at official prices 
ortega compared the economic measures to a strong medicine 
for a sick person 
as long as the war doesnt end we are going to try to have 
the patient recover to better confront the aggressor he said 
the contra rebels which have been supported by the us 
government have been fighting more than six years to overthrow the 
sandinistas

a woman pleaded innocent saturday to a 
charge that she killed one of her five former husbands who died 
two years ago of arsenic poisoning but she remained in jail in 
lieu of 200000 bond authorities said 
joan hensley davis 54 was arrested friday and charged with 
firstdegree murder in the 1986 death of james h hensley said st 
clair county states attorney john baricevic 
my client is in disbelief about the whole thing attorney 
judy cates said in a telephone interview 
the southern illinois woman who now has a sixth husband is 
not wealthy and was having trouble coming up with the bond 
mrs cates said 
her husband is standing beside her said mrs cates who did 
not know his name 
ms davis was widowed by two of her husbands and was divorced 
from the other three mrs cates said 
ms davis entered her innocent plea before associate judge 
robert craig who informed her she could face a minimum of 20 years 
and a maximum of 40 years if convicted 
hensley 62 of shiloh died march 8 1986 at memorial hospital 
in belleville and the initial autopsy showed he had died from 
arsenic poisoning said illinois state police capt philip kocis 
its unusual for a case to be charged two years after the 
offense baricevic said but we didnt feel we had enough 
evidence to present to a jury until now 
we had some problems and all the questions about them will be 
answered at the trial wed rather not discuss them until the 
trial 
in an indepth investigation like this there are obviously no 
witnesses to the crime we have to rule out all accidental causes 
so it takes a long time kocis said 
he said the death of the other man who died while being married 
to ms davis was not currently under investigation but he refused 
to say whether it had ever been investigated he said he did not 
know the mans name or when he died 
the investigation is concentrated on hensleys death at this 
particular time kocis said

a flash rainstorm caused floods 
and mudslides that left at least 70 people dead saturday as many 
as 95 others were feared dead after an avalanche of mud and 
boulders crashed into a nursing home 
firemen used surfboards and the navy used amphibious vehicles to 
rescue people stranded by the storm which began late friday night 
and left about 3150 homeless 
state health director jose noronha said at least 70 died and 80 
to 95 more were feared dead the same number of victims was 
reported by civil defense spokesman bruno avila who said the death 
toll could be even higher because of mudslides in poor shantytowns 
that line mountainsides in this city of 56 million 
the fourhour downpour dumped 488 inches on rio and left many 
streets under 5 feet of water 
mayor roberto saturnino braga declared the city a disaster area 
called in all offduty municipal doctors and canceled a 
postcarnival parade of champions scheduled for saturday night 
there is nothing to celebrate now there is only sorrow 
said martinho da vila a popular samba composer who performed in 
the famous carnival festivities here a week ago 
the vila isabel neighborhood whose samba school won this years 
top carnival prize and which celebrated wednesday with an allnight 
victory party was one of the most rainbattered zones in the city 
state troopers were sent out to prevent the looting of stores 
and stop holdups of drivers whose cars had broken down in the high 
water 
avila said most of the 70 deaths occurred in poor slum areas 
where housing is precarious and drains and sewers often nonexistent 
james lewis a rescue work coordinator in the mayors office 
said we are accustomed to tragedies in our slums but this was 
too much something definitely must be done to protect slum people 
from rainstorms 
a mudslide knocked down one threestory wing of the threewing 
santa genoveva hospital a social security nursing home in santa 
teresa a welltodo mountainside neighborhood there was little 
hope that the estimated 80 to 95 elderly patients there would get 
out alive 
there is so much wood and concrete there we dont believe 
anybody could survive avila said 
at sundown the rescue efforts were called off for the day 
it was awful all my friends were dead in an instant maria 
teixeira one of 350 patients evacuated from the two other wings of 
the hospital told a tv interviewer as she lay in a stretcher 
boulders and mud left by the storm held up rescuers for three 
hours on their way to the nursing home 
old people were left standing in the rain and chill all that 
time i dont know how they endured it lewis said 
the storm accompanied by near nonstop thunder and lightning 
knocked out telephones and international communications and stopped 
commuter trains 
even the fire department and civil defense were without phones 
for a while and had to rely on radio to coordinate rescue work 
earlier this month rain caused flooding and mudslides that 
killed about 206 people and drove 13000 from their homes in rio de 
janeiro state the hardesthit spot then was petropolis a mountain 
resort 40 miles north of the city of rio

a court saturday ordered the extradition 
of a prominent irish republican army activist to northern ireland 
prime minister charles haughey citing a separate case welcomed 
limits on extraditions to britain 
owen carron 34 a former member of the british parliament and a 
leading member of sinn fein the iras legal political wing had 
been sought since he jumped bail on a weapons charge in northern 
ireland two years ago 
police arrested him friday night in the southwestern county of 
sligo about 20 miles from the northern ireland border after an 
officer recognized him 
the district court in sligo ordered carron extradited to 
britishruled northern ireland but gave him 15 days to appeal the 
order the court ordered that he remain in custody pending appeal 
in dublin haughey said saturday that a british courts refusal 
to free six irishmen accused of ira bombings showed the need for 
restrictions on the extradition of terrorist suspects to britain 
dublin inserted new conditions dec 1 for extradition to 
britain the measures include the requirements that british 
authorities produce evidence on warrants in all extradition cases 
and that the irish attorney general approve all extraditions 
britain has a historic inability to comprehend irish 
feelings and sensitivities haughey said in a speech to the 
annual conference of the governing fianna fail party 
britain long has criticized the irish republics reluctance to 
extradite suspects sought for trial in connection with irish 
republican army actions the ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the protestantdominated province with 
mainly roman catholic ireland 
haughey said the need for restrictions was exemplified by the 
case of six irishmen sentenced to life in prison for iras bombings 
of two birmingham pubs in 1974 that killed 21 people 
britains court of appeal upheld their convictions last month 
rejecting arguments that new evidence undermined the confessions 
and forensic findings that sent them to prison 
the wisdom of and the necessity for the effective safeguards 
provided in our extradition legislation has been clearly 
confirmed haughey said these safeguards are now in place and 
it is on the basis of these safeguards or not at all that 
extradition will proceed 
carrons case was not affected by the legislation because 
warrants seeking his extradition were issued in november before 
introduction of the new regulations 
carron came to prominence in 1981 when he was the election 
officer for bobby sands who launched a sevenmonth ira hunger 
strike at belfasts maze prison that year 
sands who was elected to the british parliament while behind 
bars and nine other ira members starved themselves to death during 
the protest over prison regulations when sands died carron won 
his parliamentary seat 
the royal ulster constabulary northern irelands police force 
had been hunting carron since he jumped bail in january 1986 on a 
charge of possessing a soldiers rifle he had been released on 
bail to run as a sinn fein candidate in special elections to the 
british parliament 
after being defeated in the election carron failed to report 
back to jail

a black teenager sent to death row at age 
15 was convicted saturday of murder in a retrial brought after the 
state supreme court overturned his original conviction by an 
allwhite jury the prosecutor said he would not seek the death 
penalty again 
ronald ward 18 showed no emotion and even smiled faintly at 
the jurors as they filed out of the courtroom 
the crittenden county circuit court jury deliberated nearly 13 
hours over two days before finding him guilty in the 1985 deaths of 
three whites 
though he was convicted of capital murder prosecuting attorney 
scott hunter said he would not ask the jury to impose the death 
penalty as a result ward was automatically given life in prison 
without parole the only other possible sentence for capital felony 
murder 
the fact that he has been on death row for 2 years was a 
factor in the decision hunter said 
he also said he considered the length of time the jury spent in 
deliberations i felt like i could not call upon this jury to do 
more than theyve done 
wards attorneys samuel turner jr of west memphis and joseph 
b brown jr of memphis tenn said a notice of appeal would be 
filed immediately the attorneys maintain that ward was illegally 
fingerprinted before his arrest 
the state supreme court overturned the original conviction last 
year noting that an allwhite jury convicted the 15yearold black 
boy of killing the three whites 
the retrial jury had eight whites and four blacks 
ward was convicted of killing lois jarvis 76 audrey townsend 
72 and a seventhgrade classmate of wards 12yearold chris 
simmons who was the grandnephew of the two women

attorneys for boston university have asked a judge 
to have coretta scott king release tapes of conversations between 
her late husband martin luther king jr and others recorded 
secretly by federal investigators 
the motion filed in suffolk superior court on friday also asks 
for correspondence between king and his colleagues 
the action which mrs kings attorneys charged was a form of 
harassment was the latest round in the legal fight between the 
school and mrs king over an estimated 83000 documents involving 
her husband which are now held by bu 
king who had earned a graduate degree from the school of 
theology in 1955 donated the papers to the university in 1964 
mrs king has filed suit saying the documents should be in the 
martin luther king jr center for nonviolent social change in 
atlanta and contending the university had mishandled or lost some 
of the papers 
bu trustees decided unanimously to oppose the suit 
mrs kings attorneys said they would oppose the request for 
copies of the secretly recorded tapes 
it seems theyre inquiring into things including dr kings 
personal life and perhaps mrs kings that have nothing to do with 
this case said boston attorney james obrien one of mrs kings 
lawyers 
we are going to object to the request for tapes he said 
i think its harassment 
obrien and rudolph pierce who also represents mrs king in the 
suit said they did not believe mrs king had copies of the tapes 
i dont know at the moment if mrs king or the estate has 
that information i would doubt it said pierce 
published reports in the 1970s indicated that a package of the 
tapes was sent anonymously to mrs king 
beginning in 1964 the fbi bugged hotel rooms where king was 
staying tapes implicating king in alleged extramarital sexual 
activity were made available to reporters members of congress and 
thenpresident lyndon b johnson in 1977 a federal judge ordered 
the tapes sealed for 50 years 
melvin b miller a bu trustee who law firm is handling the suit 
for the university said he believed mrs king had some of the 
tapes 
of course she has some of them he said 
he refused to say why the university wanted copies of the tapes 
for the lawsuit 
we are entitled to seek documents we believe will be 
admissible evidence in this case miller said whatever we ask 
for we believe will further our position 
we could make an argument for its appropriatenesss in a court 
of law miller said if you think were going to discuss the 
strategy of our case in the press thats a bit much

japanese and us officials failed to reach 
agreement on opening some japanese construction projects to 
american firms us officials said saturday 
japan recently offered to allow foreign participation in six 
large public works projects but us officials said saturday the 
proposals were not enough the officials held an unusual weekend 
news conference at the us embassy but spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
michael farren deputy undersecretary of commerce for 
international trade is heading the us delegation 
the six projects are expansion of the tokyo international 
airport at haneda construction of a new airport in hiroshima a 
bridge across the akashi strait near osaka a highway along ise 
bay the development of a coastal area along the tokyo bay and work 
at osaka port 
a great many american firms have expressed tremendous interest 
in gaining access to japanese markets said one official but 
the kind of things we called for in the way of construction 
services on this list would only open door to a very narrow range 
of american construction firms 
weve come to a judgement that the list of the six projects 
is not sufficient he said 
the officials said the talks will probably continue in 
washington where prime minister noboru takeshita met with us 
leaders on an official visit last month 
access to the japanese construction market has been a major 
trade issue in recent years between the two countries 
japanese companies won about 23 billion in contracts in the 
united states in 1986 while us firms did about 500 million in 
business in japan according to construction officials 
japan has opened only two semipublic projects to us builders 
the tokyo bay bridge and the multibillion dollar kansai 
international airport project 
the us congress last year passed legislation prohibiting 
foreign companies from taking part in us public works projects 
for one year if their countries bar participation of us firms in 
their public works projects

world champion garri kasparov 
lost saturday in the quarterfinals of the world chess blitz 
championship but soviet colleague mikhail tal won the sports 
richest tournament ever 
i played badly as you saw said kasparov 24 of the soviet 
union he spoke briefly to reporters after his morning loss to 
bulgarian kirel georgiev 22 
tal 51 who won his first major soviet competition in 1957 and 
the world championship in 1960 defeated soviet rafael vaganian 
3505 vaganian 37 had defeated georgiev in the semifinals 
the blitz match is a fastpaced chess game in which each player 
has only five minutes playing time the results do not count in 
competition for the world chess title 
in the sixgame final tal stormed to a 30 lead before agreeing 
to a draw in the fourth game to seize the title 
tal ranked no 6 in the world told reporters that he never 
expected to win and said my opponents played too hospitably 
its the beginning of a second career for tal said american 
grandmaster larry evans 
in 1960 tal then 23 became the youngest world champion in 
history until kasparov gained the title in 1985 at age 22 
but tal lost his title in 1961 to mikhail botvinnik another 
soviet 
kasparovs debacle began in the first of a fourgame series 
where he had a queen a bishop and a king verses goeirgives lone 
king a position where many beginners would have little difficulty 
in winning 
but kasparov the tournament favorite stunned the audience by 
stalemating his opponent ending the game in a draw 
in the position georgievs king could not move but unlike a 
checkmate it was not attacked 
as kasparov made the hideous error there were gasps from 
spectators and he held his head in his hands 
in the second game kasparov pressed too hard for victory 
blundered and lost 
their third encounter was drawn and georgiev checkmated the 
world champion in the fourth as kasparov overreached desperately 
searching for a victory 
the championship offered a total prize fund of 75000 us 
dollars tal won 37500 for four hours work the highest prize 
ever offered for a single chess tournament 
on friday former world champion anatoly karpov of the soviet 
union ranked no 2 in the world was eliminated from the blitz 
competition 
the blitz championship ended the monthlong world chess festival 
in the port city on canadas east coast

passengers aboard amtraks california 
zephyr complained that they received no warnings or instructions 
from crew members when a smoky fire caused by a defective heater in 
a crew car killed one man early saturday and injured 19 people 
its a miracle that there wasnt some kind of panic said 
sara bentley of fremont neb a passenger in the first coach car 
behind the passenger sleeper which was coupled to the crew car 
i think the worst thing was that they didnt let anyone in our 
car know whether we were in danger we couldnt find out if our car 
was safe 
amtrak spokesman john jacobsen said the fire aboard the 14car 
westbound train carrying 294 passengers and a crew of 18 was 
reported about 3 am as the train was pulling into hastings for a 
scheduled stop hastings fire chief jim mitera said the blaze was 
under control about 90 minutes later 
an electrical short in the wiring of the crew car heating unit 
caused the fire deputy state fire marshal chuck hoffman said at an 
afternoon news conference he said the heater was in a storage area 
under the crew sleeping quarters and that the short ignited the 
cars wood floor 
state fire marshal wally barnett said the wiring showed wear and 
tear but did not say amtrak was negligent 
adams county attorney gary anderberg said an autopsy showed that 
the amtrak employee died of smoke inhalation 
amtrak investigators who did not attend the news conference 
were on the scene by late saturday morning 
the crew car and the passenger sleeper were disconnected from 
the zephyr which travels from chicago to salt lake city then 
splits into sections that proceed to oakland calif los angeles 
and seattle jacobsen said from his office in washington dc the 
rest of the train pulled out of hastings about 930 am after some 
crew members were checked at the hospital and returned he said 
robert ballard his wife helen and 11yearold grandson robby 
were in a deluxe sleeper en route to a colorado ski trip he said 
they opened the compartment door and found the hallway filled with 
smoke 
we just woke up and smelled smoke said ballard of flint 
mich 
mrs ballard who suffers from asthma was admitted to the 
hospital for observation her husband said 
the thing i cant understand is we heard no smoke detectors 
going off ballard said 
jacobsen said there are no smoke detectors on the train because 
no one has invented one that works reliably because smoke 
detectors are so sensitive the constant vibrations of trains would 
set them off he said 
jacobsen said he could recall only two train fires and that 
because they are so rare there has not been a market for smoke 
detectors designed for trains 
jacobsen said the rest of the train was not in any danger from 
the fire and that there is no fuel or propane in any of the 
passenger cars 
bentley and another passenger mike casuscelli also of fremont 
said no crew members told them to evacuate but they and a number 
of other passengers decided to leave the train after seeing fire 
trucks arrive some crew members and passengers from the sleeping 
cars milled around outside the train many of the men shirtless or 
wearing only long underwear 
normally you dont want passengers to get off as long as the 
rest of the train is not in danger jacobsen said it is safer 
to keep people on the train 
a female crew member ran through bentleys car asking 
passengers for blankets for the injured she said the womans face 
was covered with soot and she was shoeless 
the crew car is designed for amtrak service attendants who are 
with the train from the beginning to the end of the trip jacobsen 
said it was divided into two sections one for baggage and one with 
small bedrooms 
the victim identified as chef cesar arguelles 70 of chicago 
was one of seven crew members on the car jacobsen said 
nine crew members and three passengers remained saturday evening 
in mary lanning hospital where they were being treated for smoke 
inhalation anderberg said all were listed in satisfactory or good 
condition 
three crew members one passenger two policemen and an 
ambulance attendant were treated and released anderberg said 
hastings a town of about 18000 is in southcentral nebraska

supporters of massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis saturday accused missouri rep richard gephardt of 
running a television advertisement that distorts the governors 
views on agriculture 
the ad which first aired across the state friday night said 
dukakis would not take a stand on a family farm bill sponsored by 
gephardt and ended with a barb at dukakis muchcriticized 
suggestion that iowa farmers consider raising belgian endive a 
salad green 
at a news conference minnesota agriculture commissioner jim 
nichols who supports dukakis for the democratic nomination for 
president said the governors farm plan would work well for 
midwestern states 
although dukakis praised massachussetts farmerss efforts to 
diversify by raising endive he recognizes that nationally we 
need a fair price in the marketplace and supply management 
nichols said 
but after the news conference gephardts south dakota campaign 
issued a statement contending dukakis has repeatedly denounced 
supply management for farmers the statement included a boston 
globe article quoting the governor as saying that controlling 
production would be incredibly complicated and very 
bureaucratic 
but state rep robert duxbury of wessington a state 
cochairman for the dukakis campaign saidmike dukakis has laid 
out a very thoughtful agriculture policy for family farmers and 
ranchers he favors credit relief supply management and fair 
market prices for farmers 
state sen roger mckellips of alcester another state 
cochairman called the ads a new low in south dakota

a braindead baby whose body was kept 
alive in hopes of tranplanting his organs was removed from 
lifesupport machines saturday after no suitable recipient could be 
found officials said 
meanwhile a child born saturday with the same fatal defect in 
san antonio texas was placed on a respirator and flown to 
california to be enrolled in loma linda university medical centers 
donor program 
the babies were born without most of their brain and skull a 
fatal condition known as anencephaly 
the child known as baby john was born tuesday and declared 
braindead thursday at loma linda officials had hoped to keep the 
babys body on lifesupport machines for up to seven days hospital 
spokeswoman anita rockwell said 
by saturday ms rockwell said physicians of four waiting 
liver recipients of baby johns same blood type refused the liver 
because of its progressive deterioration over the past 36 hours 
despite a worldwide search no infant of the same blood type 
needing a heart has been found 
out of respect for the braindead infant and with the consent 
of his mother dr joyce peabody removed the artificial life 
support from baby john and his cardiac activity ceased at 215 
pm 
anencephaly is fatal usually within days after birth an 
infants healthy organs can only be transplanted if organ damage is 
prevented by maintaining the infant on lifesupport from birth 
the first anencephalic child considered by loma linda hospital 
for the pioneering procedure was the child of brenda and michael 
winner of arcadia calif but the baby was stillborn on dec 22 
the use of such infants as organ donors has raised controversial 
ethical issues and loma linda is the first hospital in the united 
states to develop a medical protocol allowing such transplants 
the national right to life committee has denounced the procedure 
and complained that doctors have failed to do enough to ensure that 
organs werent removed from live children 
one of the hospitals 13 heart transplant patients under age 4 
received the heart of an anencephalic baby earlier this year from a 
donor child in canada 
if the texas baby is declared dead within seven days and one or 
more of her organs successfully transplanted it would be the first 
time that the procedure has been tried using an anencephalic baby 
born in the united states 
the infant 6pound 1ounce evelyn keys was put on a chartered 
plane in texas en route to loma linda she was born with only a 
brain stem said robert mcnaughton wilford hall medical center 
spokesman in san antonio 
evelyn is the first child of airman first class todd keys 21 
and his wife judy 22

massachusetts was the leader among democrats surveyed in the latest 
minnesota poll

days before the states precinct caucuses

active independentminded democrats will divide tuesday night

gephardt and came in third in the new hampshire primary where 
dukakis came in first and gephardt was second

from 18 months of campaigning for the democratic presidential 
nomination was to tell a cheering crowd at his national campaign 
headquarters saturday that it was good to be home 
i got a call a week ago from a neighbor of mine who said 
bruce you may be hot stuff out there in the rest of the united 
states running for president of the united states debating on 
television all the time but you better get home because youre 
fence is falling down and the dog is wreckin my lawn babbitt 
told about 1000 of his supporters 
babbitt the former governor of arizona officially dropped out 
of the race thursday after disappointing showings in the new 
hampshire primary and the iowa democratic caucuses 
babbitt said he and his wife hattie were going to spend some 
time getting reacquainted and reestablishing their roots in 
arizona 
i want you to know one thing wherever we go our roots will 
always be in arizona he said 
babbitt said he would be jumping into the fray of the 
gubernatorial recall election but not as a candidate 
i want to take the time in the next month or two to try and 
get back into the swing of what it is thats going on here to 
rejoin our fight here in arizona he said

soviet cosmonauts will carry a us commercial 
project into space for the first time in a deal approved by the 
government an attorney for the project said saturday 
payload systems inc of wellsley mass received a twoyear 
license from the commerce department earlier this month to contract 
with the soviet space agency to perform protein crystallization 
experiments aboard the soviet space station mir said mark s 
mcconnell a washington attorney who handled the companys 
negotiations with the commerce and defense departments 
the company a consulting firm was founded in 1984 by byron k 
lichtenberg of the massachussetts institute of technology he was 
the first american nonastronaut to fly aboard the space shuttle in 
december 1983 
the experiment will use the weightlessness of space to grow 
large regular protein crystals which are useful in the 
development of new drugs mcconnell said saturday evening 
to my knowledge it is the first time that the us government 
has approved commercial activity in the soviet space program 
certainly weve had joint missions governmenttogovernment he 
said 
since the explosion of the challenger space shuttle in january 
1986 american companies have been left with few alternatives for 
space projects 
even when the shuttle was flying it provided only a limited 
amount of time in space with the shuttle down the only american 
option is a plane flown in a parabolic flight path that gives 
only a few minutes of weightlessness mcconnell said 
us officials were concerned about the possibility of 
transferring sensitive technology to the soviet union but 
mcconnell said we created a situation that absolutely minimized 
that he said the commerce department issued the license after 
getting from the pentagon 
there will be extremely limited training given to the 
cosmonauts they will be doing no more than turning some dials on a 
box the contents of which they will not know about and monitoring 
environmental conditions in the space station he said 
he said the soviets were satisfied with the arrangement adding 
their goal from what i could tell is to promote commercial uses 
worldwide of their station 
the us government has been reluctant to permit american 
companies to hire the soviets to launch satellites and mcconnell 
said the soviets viewed the crystallization project as their best 
shot at working with a us firm 
he said payload systems has reached an agreement in principle 
with the soviets but still was negotiating over details 
he said the company would not attempt to sell the crystals grown 
in the first flight 
theyre just trying to see if it works for commercial 
purposes he said 
according to the new york times which carried a story on the 
project in sundays editions the first flight will be sometime 
next year 
the newspaper said payload systems refused to discuss the terms 
of the contract it added however that the soviets in the past 
have offered to carry western experiments for between 10000 and 
15000 a kilogram 
calls to company officials seeking comment were not immediately 
returned saturday night 
president reagans budget released thursday provides 1 
billion to build a us space station by the mid1990s earlier 
this month reagan unveiled a national policy for commercial 
activity in space it provides for the government to lease space 
aboard a space module that will be carried aloft by the space 
shuttle and left in orbit

prime minister margaret thatcher has announced 
plans to shift 70000 of britains 580000 civil servants out of 
government ministries and into a dozen new agencies run by 
privateindustrystyle executives 
the new agencies will take over such duties as issuing passports 
and drivers licenses forecasting the weather and printing 
government documents 
mrs thatcher told the house of commons thursday that in 
general the new agencies planned in the next 12 months will stay 
part of the civil service accountable to the government and 
parliament 
but she indicated some may eventually become private companies 
saying insofar as they become totally outside the civil service 
they will not of course be accountable to government scrutiny 
she did not elaborate but said the 12 were the first suitable 
candidates indicating more changes are in the pipeline 
the british domestic news agency press association said the 
plans herald the biggest civil service shakeup this century 
the daily telegraph said the government aims to eventually 
separate the civil servants responsible for carrying out executive 
functions from the minority responsible for formulating policy 
the possibility of some of the new agencies eventually being 
turned into private companies drew criticism from the opposition 
labor party 
some civil service trade unions also attacked the restructuring 
plans saying the changes could lead to a decline in pay and 
working conditions for their members 
the government has said its aim is increased efficiency the 12 
new agencies will take control of 12 services currently run by 
central government departments they include 
issuing passports currently one of the jobs of the home 
office 
running the government stationery office which prints 
government documents that is currently one of the jobs of the 
office of the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
running the meteorological office which provides weather 
forecasts for the armed forces television and radio farmers and 
other clients and is presently run by the ministry of defense 
managing the royal parks in and around london now done by the 
department of the environment

foreign minister bernardo sepulveda denied in 
a strongly worded protest note that mexico allows its territory to 
be used by leftist rebels to threaten the government of el salvador 
the government of mexico in no case allows the use of mexican 
territory by the groups of the fmlnfdr farabundo marti national 
liberation front democratic revolutionary front to develop 
activities that have repercussions and attempt against the 
stability of the salvadoran government sepulveda said in a note 
to foreign minister ricardo acevedo peralta of el salvador 
the note released thursday afternoon was in response to a 
protest note acevedo peralta sent to mexico earlier in the week 
the fmln links five guerrilla groups that have been fighting el 
salvadors ussupported government for the past eight years the 
fdr is its political ally 
the groups joint politicaldiplomatic commission maintains an 
office in mexico city as does clandestine rebel radio venceremos 
sepulveda said the office is allowed because mexican law 
establishes protection for political exiles who enter national 
territory and the constitution guarantees for all people who are in 
the territory liberty of association transit and expression of 
ideas 
a foreign ministry source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said sepulveda decided to make his response public because the 
salvadoran government released its note to the press that goes 
out of normal diplomatic channels the source said 
relations between mexico and el salvador were tense in the early 
years of the salvadoran civil war especially after thenpresident 
jose lopez portillo recognized the rebels as a legitimate political 
force in a joint mexicanfrench declaration in 1981 
the friction has eased during the administration of president 
miguel de la madrid who succeeded lopez portillo in december 1982 
mexico helped form the contadora group seeking peace for central 
america in january 1983 along with panama colombia and venezuela

poor countries late friday announced a fiveyear general capital 
increase 
president barber b conable said the capital increase of 748 
billion will enable the bank to lend money to developing countries

history earlier general increases in 1959 and 1980 approximately

leftist guerrillas attacked a convoy of 
peruvian troops in the andes and killed 10 soldiers and two 
civilians defense minister enrique lopez said friday 
the assault thursday near a road construction site on the 
outskirts of huancavelica a state capital 155 miles southeast of 
lima was the most devastating in a wave of attacks by shining path 
guerrillas this month 
a group of army personnel were the object of a cowardly attack 
by delinquent subversives the joint military command said lopez 
and the joint command declined to elaborate on how the rebels 
mounted the raid 
lopez said the troops were traveling in civilian vehicles from 
huancavelica to the road construction site to provide protection to 
government workers 
the maoinspired shining path has been fighting for eight years 
to topple the government and install a marxist state 
a year ago the guerrillas exploded a mine near huancavelica

world experts ended a threeday meeting friday 
without completing a draft protocol on controlling nitrogen oxide 
pollution suspected of being a main factor in widespread forest 
damage in europe and north america 
environmentalist groups allowed to attend part of the 
closeddoor meeting expressed deep disappointment 
we can only conclude that the international community is 
prepared to condemn the environment to an acid future said 
andrew kerr an observer for greenpeace 
the meeting of experts from 25 nations was sponsored by the un 
economic commission for europe commission spokesman hans lassen 
said it now was up to the governments to complete the protocol 
adding that it was still hoped the protocol could be signed before 
the end of the year 
lassen said three major areas of disagreement remained 
requiring political decisions 
when would a freeze on emissions take force and from what level 
should they be reduced by a proposed 30 percent 
would the united states be entitled to an emission credit 
meaning a reduction by less than 30 percent in view of efforts it 
has already taken unilaterally to control pollution 
by what year should unleaded fuel be available in all countries 
parties to the protocol 
acid rain begins with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 
pollution from smelters power plants and vehicle exhaust it 
travels long distances in the atmosphere and is transformed into 
sulfuric and nitric acid before falling to the earth in rain or 
snow 
it raises the acidity of lakes and rivers killing off fish and 
has been blamed by some environmentalists for stunting forest 
growth 
sources close to the meeting said seven countries canada west 
germany switzerland austria denmark sweden and the netherlands 
called for a freeze on nitrogen oxide emissions at the 1987 level 
by 1990 
the united states britain france norway finland as well as 
the soviet union and its allies reportedly favored a freeze by 1994 
at the level of 1987 or later with a reduction several years later 
canada strongly opposed the us proposal for a credit clause in 
the protocol the sources said speaking on condition of anonymity 
canada reportedly argued that the concept of using past actions to 
control air pollution to permit future increases in national 
emissions was contrary to the spirit of the agreement 
greenpeace has demanded a 75 percent cut in emissions throughout 
europe 
adam markham the observer for the world wildlife fund 
complained that the draft protocol that was emerging virtually 
has no teeth markham said it was increasingly likely that a 
group of countries including west germany switzerland and 
scandinavian countries will seek a separate accord outside the 
protocol that would call for speedier measures

president reagan contends in his annual economic report to 
congress that his tax and budget policies helped turn economic 
despair into hope during his administration 
the report issued friday also downplayed problems associated 
with the 24 trillion national debt and record trade imbalances 
during the reagan years 
separately on wall street the dow jones industrial average 
finished at a sixweek high rising 2818 points to 201459 the 
widelyfollowed indicator had not closed at such heights since it 
stood at 205189 on jan 7 
market watchers attributed the rally to an increasingly 
optimistic market outlook due partly to signs of strength in the 
manufacturing sector of the economy 
in an eightpage introduction to this years economic report 
president reagan said the country was in much better shape than 
when he took office seven years ago the president said the 
attitude toward the economy had shifted to hope from the despair 
that prevailed in the early 1980s 
the past five years of sustained and vigorous growth in 
production income and employment did not occur by accident the 
report stated they were shaped by government policies explicitly 
directed toward fostering the inherent dynamism of the private 
sector 
during a separate press briefing beryl sprinkel the 
presidents chief economic adviser said the united states had 
produced 2 times the number of jobs as the other top six 
industrialized countries combined since the end of the 198182 
recession 
addressing the nations 400 billion foreign debt sprinkel 
noted that the net payments to foreigners needed to service the 
countrys foreign debt represented just 01 percent of the 46 
trillion us economy 
sprinkel predicted an improving trade deficit would provide 
about half of the countrys overall economic growth this year 
which the administration is forecasting will slow to a 24 percent 
from 38 percent in 1987 
sprinkel also said recent signs of economic slowdown did not 
point to a recession in 1988 he said the recent string of three 
consecutive declines in the index of leading indicators signaled 
slower economic growth in the first half of 1988 but not a 
recession this year 
sprinkel discounted recent big declines in the key housing 
construction sector during december and january attributing them 
to a toorestrictive monetary policy pursued by the federal reserve 
in the months before the october stock market collapse

in facing a proxy fight over four seats on its 
board of directors gillette co might also be facing a referendum 
on its future as an independent company analysts say 
gillette said friday it would resist an attempt by coniston 
partners to place four representatives on board seats up for 
election at the companys annual meeting in april including the 
seat of chairman colman m mockler jr 
coniston which holds a roughly 6 percent stake in the giant 
personal products maker is attempting to pressure gillette into a 
restructuring or merger that would boost its share price 
gillette rose 25 cents to 3887 a share in new york stock 
exchange trading friday 
coniston pursued a similar strategy last year in leading the 
successful campaign to break up allegis corp leading analysts to 
predict the battle over gillette would be long and bitter 
coniston i dont think is going to go away any time soon 
said deepak rap who follows gillette for the investment firm 
merrill lynch amp co 
mockler who also is gillettes chief executive and president 
said gillette would continue resisting coniston in the belief that 
the company would function best as an independent business 
gillette cited its 1987 financial results which reflected a 12 
percent rise in sales and a doubling of operating profit indicated 
that its business strategy was working 
andrew shore of the investment firm shearson lehman hutton 
inc said proxy fights were difficult to win but in this case 
gillette management would have its hands full 
the company has rebuffed several buyout offers from revlon group 
inc dating back to 1986 the latest a 47ashare or 54 
billion offer was spurned late last year 
in addition a major restructuring that it undertook after 
turning down a 412 billion revlon buyout offer in november 1986 
may not have boosted gillettes share price enough to suit major 
investors who remain wary about the strength of the stock market in 
the wake of octobers crash 
gillettes recent stock price in the high30 range is well 
below the high40 to low50 range analysts estimate is the 
companys acquisition value 
its really a referendum like a vote for coniston is a vote 
for the sale of gillette said shore thats going to be very 
difficult for shareholders to turn down 
revlon must have gillettes consent to launch a takeover of the 
company under terms of a 10year standstill agreement it signed in 
november 1986 when gillette bought out revlons nearly 14 percent 
stake in the company after spurning the 412 billion offer 
nevertheless revlon chairman ronald o perelman reportedly 
remains interested in acquiring gillette 
shore said that in addition to opposing conistons slate of 
directors gillette could take other defensive measures including 
the issuance of more stock a leveraged buyout a recapitalization 
or a white knight merger with a friendly suitor 
even its candidates win election coniston would be unable to 
take control of gillettes board because only a third of the seats 
are up for election in any year but analysts say a coniston 
victory could pressure the board to consider a merger 
keith gollust a principal in the partnership contended the 
proxy fight was mandated by gillettes takeover defenses which 
essentially gave its board unilateral power to accept or reject any 
merger offers
